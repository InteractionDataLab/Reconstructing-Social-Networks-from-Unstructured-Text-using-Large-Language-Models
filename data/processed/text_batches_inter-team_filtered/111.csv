We got gold and 'Best Poster of the World' Award!!
Hi everybody, UniTN-Trento team is proud to introduce you B. fruity!
B. fruity envisions a new environmental friendly way to control fruit ripening by exploiting an engineered, light-regulated strain of B. subtilis. The system works by synthesizing ethylene or methyl salicylate (MeSA) upon photoinduction.
Ethylene is a plant hormone widely used to ripen fruit. However its synthesis, handling and storage is expensive and dangerous. In contrast, B. fruity produces ethylene from inexpensive material by a metabolic intermediate: 2-oxoglutarate. Our system converts this metabolite to ethylene through the activity of an ethylene forming enzyme (EFE) from Pseudomonas syringae.
B. fruity does not just accelerate ripening, but can also slow the process down, when desired, through the incorporation of a methyl salicylate (MeSA) synthesis pathway. MeSA was previously shown to inhibit the ripening of kiwifruit and tomatoes. The explored MeSA pathway builds upon the 2006 MIT iGEM project “Eau de coli”.
As a proof of concept, we engineered E. coli with the above system plus the YF1/FixJ blue light receptor device.
We are hopeful that B. fruity will simplify the process of bringing fresh fruit from the field to the consumer.

Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched, there may be more than one region. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the minimal task is to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. Matching alternatives of two different chains in the template should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and"

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#Modeling#diffusion_-_-_TEXT.html,". Finding the accurate values of these parameters is not a trivial task. In the literature it is difficult to find a number experimentally obtained. So we decided to take an inverse engineering approach. The parameters ranges we found in the literature are:
Diffusion coefficient
Range of physical search: 0.01-0.2 cm^2/s
References: [1], [2], [3], [5]
Release rate (female)
Range of physical search: 0.02-1 µg/h
References: [4], [5], [8]
Release rate (Sexy Plant)
The range of search that we have considered is a little wider than the one for the release rate of females.
References: Primary sexpheromone components are approximately defined as those emitted by the calling insect that are obligatory for trap catch in the field at component emission rates similar to that used by the insect [4].
Detection threshold
Range of physical search: 1000 molecules/ cm3
References: [4], [5], [8]
Saturation threshold
References: It generally has been found that pheromone dispensers releasing the chemicals above a certain emission rate will catch fewer males. The optimum release rate or dispenser load for trap catch varies greatly among species [4].
Range of physical search: 1-5[Mass]/[ Distance]^2
Moth sensitivity
This is a parameter referred to the capability of the insect to detect changes in pheromone concentration in the patch it is located and the neighbor patch. When the field becomes more homogeneous, an insect with higher sensitivity will be more able to follow the gradients.
Wind force
Range: 0 - 10 m/s
References: [7]
Population
The number of males and females can be selected by the observer.
Patches
One can modify the number of patches that conform the field so as to analyze its own case. In our case we used a field of 50x50 patches.

General Lab Safety
All members of the team, even those not actively involved in the lab, underwent the environment health and safety training in WHMIS 2015 (Canada’s national workplace hazard communication standard) which incorporates the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals along with concepts in biosafety. This included education on hazardous materials, proper disposal methods, and safe behaviour in the lab. The education served all members well in understanding the correct methods and behaviours needed for lab work for each person’s personal safety, each other’s safety, and the success of our project.
Wetlab Safety
In addition to the WHMIS lab safety course and concepts in biosafety, the team handling things in the lab also took three additional courses which educated us on laboratory safety, chemical safety, and how to use the fire-extinguisher. The research team also went through additional training held by members of the UAlberta iGEM team and  our advisor Rochelin Dalangin regarding proper aseptic techniques in order to eliminate contamination of the environment and of our project.
Throughout the project, we ensured to sanitize our lab benches with ethanol and used proper aseptic techniques to prevent contamination of our cultures and ensured that we wore proper personal protective equipment (lab goggles, lab coats, long pants, and closed-toed shoes).

Based on the fact that the same enzyme and substrate nucleotide concentration are used, the difference in activity corresponds to difference in synthesised biomolecule concentrations. The expression of an enzyme depends on the particular strength of used ribosome binding sites. Taking this into consideration, the measured relative activity corresponds to strength of ribosome binding sites.
Toehold regulatory sequence library
To explore the capabilities of CAT-Seq workflow as a method for screening novel transcription or translation regulatory sequences a control riboregulator library was constructed based on Green et al., 2014. 9 library members, composed of 3 toehold sequencesand 3 activating RNA sequences, termed Trigger RNA, were designed to test the orthogonality and regulatory characteristics of each part.
Each of the regulatory part, consisting of one toehold sequence upstream of the esterase gene and one trigger sequence were constructed. First of all, the orthogonality of each toehold:activating RNA pair and they regulatory characteristic have been tested in bulk. The constructed library members were synthesized using In vitro transcription and translation kit and their catalytic activity towards N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate (Substrate Nucleotide) were tested. The reaction kinetics were measured using the spectrophotometer as a decrease of absorbance due tue hydrolyzed substrate nucleotide.
Figure 6 displays the relative hydrolysis speed of each regulatory part variant in a form of matrix. The decrease of absorbance shown in Y graph corresponds to the catalytic conversion of substrate nucleotides. As seen from control experiment, in which standard esterase was expressed, the decline of absorbance over time is seen. Taking these results into consideration, the same decrease of absorbance is only seen in the diagonal of the matrix. This means, that active catalytic molecules is expressed only when both regulatory molecules of the same group are present - Toehold 1 with Trigger 1, Toehold 2 with Trigger 2 and Toehold 3 with Trigger 3. None of the regulatory sequences show any cross talk with the other group.
Figure 6. The catalytic activity of each Toehold:Trigger RNA construct matrix. CAT-Seq esterase mutant sequences were placed downstream the riboregulatory sequences with corresponding trigger part and they catalytic activity was measured. The decrease of absorbance corresponds to catalytically active enzyme. The graph shown as a matrix concludes that only Toehold sequences expressed with their corresponding Trigger RNA produce an active enzyme molecule.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Methylmercury Poisoning_-_-_TEXT.html,"s the consequences derived from contact with excessive amounts of MeHg, especially of neurological character, were observed steeper when there was exposure during the prenatal period through maternal contamination. Cases where mothers were asymptomatic or had mild signs of intoxication were not unusual, giving birth to offspring with severe neurological disorders such as mental retardation, deafness, blindness, cerebral palsy, cerebellar ataxia, strabismus, dysarthria, among others. Poisoning by high levels of MeHg is rare nowadays.
Chronic poisoning due to exposure to low doses of MeHg are targets of ongoing studies, we still do not reach on an agreement, to assess their true risk (Clifton 2007). However, the teratogenicity of MeHg in the formation of the CNS is unquestionable in the scientific community, which explains the intense activities to try to relate exposure to low levels of MeHg and neurophysiological, neuropsychiatric disorders or neuroanatomical. To our reality in the study UFAM_Brazil team, river dwellers of the Amazonian areas would be much more common to show signs of chronic intoxication by low levels of MeHg, which therefore means that we have more attention to this type of case. According Ekino et al (2007), serious mental disorders and motor development in fetuses that were contaminated with MeHg through maternal exposure and the ability to overcome the uterus-placenta were observed. Such disturbances were connected bilaterally with:
• Swallow Deficit
• Speech Deficit
• Walking Deficit
• Deficit  in other coordinated or involuntary movements
• Epileptic seizures
All due to acute injuries in the encephalon, causing loss of brain mass in determined cortex areas. Besides pure neurological symptoms, many neuropsychiatric symptoms were seen on children that were conceived by mothers who were exposed to large amounts of MeHg during their prenatal lives, such as:
• Akinetic mutism
• Extreme shame
• Communication difficulties
• Lack of initiative
• Lack of facial expression
Figure 10 - Extreme shyness may be related to MeHg intoxication.
Poisoning by chronic exposure to low doses of MeHg also has the ability to cause harm to adults, even if not to the same severity in relation to fetal intoxication. According to yet Ekino et al. (2007), patients whose MeHg exposure time was prolonged at low doses reported cases in the distal regions of paresthesia of extremities, and around the lip region, even if exposure to"

For the above 3 figures, the first 3 subfigures are the results of 3 kinds of miRNA in the sample’s whole saliva, and the last 4 subfigures are the results of 4 kinds of miRNA in the sample’s saliva supernatant. The results are not satisfying. We assume that it is because the dataset collected is not large enough.
Application of different kinds of classifiers
Fisher Linear Discriminant:
Logistic Regression and SVM with linear kernel:
Logistic Regression and SVM are 2 kinds of commonly used classifiers which belong to the domain of machine learning. For this problem, considering the scale of the dataset and the number of features (see Machine Learning Lecture 12 on Coursera), it is most appropriate to use SVM with Gaussian kernel. This method was tried and the outcome was good. However, we decide not to choose this method. The reason is that Gaussian kernel or other more complex kernels transform the original features to another set of features, which is difficult to realize in in vivo biological systems, and the parameters obtained are hard to be transformed back to those of miRNA concentration.
Tuning the Parameters:
Considering randomness, regularization is added to the model and the parameter needs to be chosen. Take logistic regression for whole saliva as an example. The regularization parameter is lambda, and the following routine is applied:
Step 1: Set up a vector lambdas of the parameter lambda, each element of which is a value to be tested. To start with, the vector was [0.0001; 0.0003; 0.001; 0.003; 0.01; 0.03; 0.1; 0.3; 1; 3; 10].
Step 2: Set up a k * kk zero matrix called Evaluation, to take down the time that one particular value of lambda has satisfied the criteria which will be discussed later. k is the length of the vector lambdas, while kk is the time that an evaluation for the whole vector is implemented.
Step 3: The evaluation procedure is a triple loop. The outer loop is from 1 to kk; the middle loop is from 1 to 100 (This number can be modified); the inner loop is from 1 to k. We take one outer loop as an example. For one middle loop, we randomly split the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set consists of 31 positive examples and 15 negative examples, while the test set 8 and 4. Then we go into the inner loop, which"

Cultivation in Bioengineering KLF bioreactor with 2.5 L HSG medium with 20 mg L-1 chloramphenicol starting with OD600 = 0.4. Dissolved oxygen was regulated to 60 % air saturation (controlled with stirrer cascade starting with 200 rpm) and the pH to 7.0 (controlled with 20 % phosphoric acid and 2 M NaOH). The dissolved oxygen sensor had to be recalibrated after about 140 min.
Purification
After the analysis of cultivations with expression of SgsE | luciferase fusion proteins, different cell fractions were analyzed. It could be seen that the proteins form inclusion bodies in E. coli but that there are some soluble proteins left. This has the advantage that the proteins carrying an enzyme as fusion protein do not have to be treated with denaturating agents like urea which destroys the enzyme (data not shown).
To capture the protein from the cell lysate an ion exchange chromatography (IEX) was carried out (binding with pH 7.0, 25 mM NaCl, quaternary amine beads, elution with 100 mM NaCl). A lot of"

Commensalism (+/0) is a relationship in which one partner derives benefits from the other, while the other partner is not affected (neither harmful nor beneficial) by the association, e.g., an artificial microbial consortium consisting of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and Bacillus megaterium for vitamin C production.[6]
Inspired by the concept of co-culture system, MFCs populated by mixed microbial communities have garnered much attention owing to their stability, robustness due to nutrient adaptability, stress resistance and general tendency to produce higher current density than those obtained using pure cultures. e.g., a mutualistic system established by the fermentative bacterium Escherichia coli and the dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis in a bioelectrochemical device is reported with formate as the key metabolism.[8]

4 Intracellular protein degradation
4.1 Theory of protein degradation in bacteria
Modifications that target proteins for proteolysis, and thereby affect protein stability, have been extensively studied. These modifications can serve as quality control features that regulate protein synthesis, remove defective proteins, recycle amino acids and inactivate proteins.
Bacteria co-translationally tag stalled or interrupted translational products with the ssrA peptide. This 11-aminoacid signal, targets the defective translation product to cellular proteases, including ClpA/XP, Lon and etc. The ssrA signal is encoded by a small, stable RNA containing an alanyl tRNA domain and mRNA domain encoding the open reading frame of the tag (tmRNA). Upon encountering stalled or incomplete translation, the tmRNA and accessory factors are recruited to the ribosome to rescue the idle translation complex by replacing it with the tmRNA encoding the ssrA tag. The ssrA mRNA serves as the template for the addition of the ssrA peptide. The ssrA tag is added co-translationally to the carboxy-terminus (C-terminus) of incomplete proteins to target them for.[10]
4.2 Mf-lon
Interestingly, the ssrA tags encoded by the tmRNA molecules in most Mycoplasma are very different from those found in other bacteria. Most Mycoplasma genomes encode only two AAA+ proteases, Lon and FtsH, and have lost the genes for ClpXP, ClpAP. In the absence of ClpXP, the unusual"

Achievements:
We practiced measuring fluorescence using our pDawn and mcherry constructs. We successfully completed PCR assembly of our M.sssI. We performed our first cotransformation with I751250, an AHL sender that was downstream of pDawn and T9002. We redesigned primers for PCR reactions that had been giving us trouble, paying more attention to the annealing temperatures of the primers we were designing.
WEEK 6
July 10 2013 - July 17 2013
Goals:
As the summer was nearing its halfway mark, we wanted to decide on the relative merits of the two projects and reach a decision. We also wanted to continue our cloning for the two projects and troubleshoot cloning-related problems. We now had all the parts we needed for Cas9, TALE, and zinc finger methylase constructs and wanted to begin assembling them into constructs that we envisioned. These constructs would have a two-plasmid system. One plasmid would have the DNA binding domain downstream of a T7 promoter activated by tetracycline, and the other would be a reporter plasmid to detect methylation.
Achievements:
We decided on the constructs that we would create and began the restriction digest and gel extract steps of our miniprepped components. We planned an experiment we could do with tetracycline induction to test whether our hypothetical methyltransferase-DNA binding domain fusions were actually being expressed.
WEEK 7
July 18 2013 - July 24 2013
Goals:
This week our main goals were to attempt our tetracycline induction experiment, order primers for performing a COBRA assay, and refine our LIMS and retroactively manage our samples. We also wanted to finish the cloning experiments we began the previous week.
Achievements:
We completed our construct for our zinc finger fusion plasmid after a successful colony PCR and sequencing result. We performed our first induction experiment by inoculating cultures with a tetracycline-activated promoter. We redid a PCR assembly of our TALE and Cas9 systems that had been failed before.
WEEK 8
July 25 2013 - July 31 2013
Goals:
We wanted to finish our remaining fusion protein constructs and begin thinking about an SDS PAGE to measure protein expression. We also wanted to dedicate more time to pursuing drylab—making advances on our human practices and continue reading the literature on selective methylation. We also wanted to look into trying out different biobrick parts for our quorum sensing"

The focus of the Large Phage Team is to make a cross section of phage sizes through the mutagenesis of T4 bacteriophage. Our main area of research is in making T4's already large capsid even larger, while maintaining phenotypic stability. This was done by taking the isolated large phage and observing there later generations to ensure that their phenotype is inherited.

Shaking Flask Cultivation
The first trials to produce the CotA-laccase from Bacillus pumilus DSM 27 (ATCC7061, named BPUL) were performed in shaking flasks with various designs (from 100 mL-1 to 1 L flasks, with and without baffles) and under different conditions. The parameters tested during the screening experiments were temperature (27 °C,30 °C and 37 °C), the concentration of chloramphenicol (20 to 170 µg mL-1), induction strategy ( autoinduction and manual induction with 0,1 % rhamnose) and cultivation time (6 to 24 h). Furthermore it was cultivated with and without 0.25 mM CuCl2, to provide a sufficient amount of copper, which is needed for the active center of the laccase.  Based on the screening experiments the best conditions for expression of BPUL were identified(see below). The addition of CuCl2 did not increase activity, so it was omitted.

We have to define what is the “non-pooisonous” carbon chain. However, if the end product of oil degradation is non-polar, it may still destroy the protection ability of bird feather.
Since β-oxidation is an important metastasis pathway. It is difficult to reduce production of CO2 via inhibit the β-oxidation of A. borkumensis. And it is also hard to application in large scale.
3. Focus on 3 following papers:
Proteomic Insights into Metabolic Adaptation in Alcanivorax borkumensis Induced by Alkane Utilization.
Genome sequence of the ubiquitous hydrocarbondegrading marine bacterium Alcanivorax borkumensis.
Global features of the Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 genome.

1. Brainstorming.
2. Everyone elected 2 ideas and chose 1 idea which they want to follow.
3. Oil-degradation group reported their progress:
We found Alcanivorax borkumensis can live in oil polluted sea region and able to degrade the crude oil then turn into energy which it can use.
We want to find an oil-eating plankton, which with symbiosis bacteria can help it degrade greenhouse gas(CO2).
Moreover, we want to let the oil-eating plankton radiate fluorescence, so it can be used to determine the oil polluted situation and oil-flowing direction.

There were some non specific bands, but the appropriate bands were present. However, the bands were kind of off.  I think this is due to the samples running weird on the gel.  B/c the first two lanes were the exact same sample, just aliquoted, and they ran fairly differently.

Transformation
Back to protocols .
Transformation is the introduction of a foreign plasmid into competent cells. We follow the protocol from last year's team: 2010 protocol
Additional notes
The protocol specifies to ask Henrike for plasmid quantities. Here is her answer:
For relatively pure plasmids, 1 ul is enough.
For low concentration plasmids, like those originating from a Gibson assembly, use 2 to 3 ul.
If you are conducting the heat shock in an eppendorf tube, use 45 seconds instead of 30.

The RMIT University iGEM (Victoria_Australia) team aims to build a biological lighting system via cell free transcription and translation (CFTnT). This project applies Synthetic Biology in a simple manner that could be efficient for everyday use. It was developed after the consideration of current energy and climate change issues. A CFTnT system was chosen because in principle, the lysate used in the CFTnT system may be prepared from any type of cell. Hence, the team thought it would be of merit to develop an alternative light source, which could possibly be powered by a waste material as simple as grass clippings (cell lysate). The team also hopes to address cellular and bioprocess problems that arise when employing a CFTnT system and is considering many novel approaches to creating a more sustainable system that can be scaled up for practical applications. Initial experiments conducted by Victoria_Australia will focus on two cell-free systems derived from Escherichia coli and wheat germ.

SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"
Nowadays in China, transgenic technology is often concentrated in the field of food in the public perception. Because of media speculation and improper publicity, most people are over-concerned about the disadvantages of genetically modified food/Transgenic food so that genetically related topics often raise public tensions. This leads to the fact that the drawbacks of transgenic technology are over-amplified while the benefit of GM in many areas is seriously neglected. Therefore, we are intended to present the public with the advantages and authentic appearance of GM, which will provide a more dialectical and rational way of thinking for the public.
And as mentioned, through the questionnaire for the patients with hyperuricemia and the conversations with doctors from West China Hospital, we found that the public seems to be lack of understanding and attention of hyperuricemia. As college students with a strong sense of social responsibility, we are eager to educate the citizens about hyperuricemia and we would like to receive more comments and suggestions on our subject. Consequently, to enhance our cooperation with other iGEM teams, we actively invited 3 iGEM teams in southwest China to jointly organize and held the 1 week exhibition in Chengdu Library with the theme of “transgenic and human health”.
As the idea of carrying out a science popularization exhibition came to us, we had successively contacted Army Medical University, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and Sichuan University school of life science iGEM teams who were willing to cooperate on this program.
We instantly made contact with Chengdu Library which is a first-class modern city center library playing a leading role in west region of China. In 2016, the number of readers approaching Chengdu library reached 1.09 million. Hence its adequate readers flow and strong impact on the public might increase the feasibility of our exhibition.
Gotten the supports from the library, the communication with the library stuff was plain sailing. All the four teams were associated when deciding the theme, contents and poster design. We had a good cooperation and nailed it.
On the beginning day of the one-week-long exhibition, we the four teams gathered in the library early, and handed out handbooks and little gifts to the public, introducing our exhibition. We explained the contents on the posters and answered the questions proposed by the viewer. We shared our opinions about transgenic technique and accepted their advice on the exhibition. “I got an objective and all-round view on GM products,” said one viewer.
We decided that the theme of the exhibition was “transgenic and human health” and the main contents went about disease therapy"
Columbia-Cooper-NYC,2012,Team:Columbia-Cooper-NYC#Columbia notebook 1_-_-_TEXT.html," The ODs of the solutions were also taken using the same procedure as before. Over a period of 3 days, each of the 6 AFM flasks had a copper mass decrease of 30%. We therefore cannot tell whether the bacteria is actually etching the copper, as the rate of the dissolved oxygen etching the copper overshadows the rate of bacterial etching.
July 11
Liquid Media:
Flasks were cleaned up because it seemed like the data from the controls were inconclusive. The experiment will be repeated with more bacteria in the flasks.
Solid Media:
The solid media sample #6 (no bacteria), sample #8 (with bacteria), and scratched samples were removed from the incubator. The latter was removed just for picture taking and was placed back in the incubator shortly after. The copper pieces were covered in green and surrounded by brown. There are dark green-blue rings in the middle of some copper samples probably due to layered oxidation. The copper samples were washed away and massed using the same procedure as on 7/8/12. Again our data does not make sense because the average percent decrease for the copper samples without bacteria is greater than the average percent decrease for the copper samples with bacteria.
July 14
Solid Media:
The solid media sample #3 (no bacteria), sample #5 (with bacteria), and scratched samples were removed from the incubator. The latter was removed just for picture taking and placed back in the incubator shortly after. The copper pieces were covered in green and some pieces were surrounded by blue especially the ones in the bacteria petri dish. The copper samples were washed away and massed using the same procedure as on 7/8/12. This time the data made sense because the average percent decrease for the copper samples without bacteria is less than the average percent decrease for the copper samples with bacteria.
July 17
Solid Media:
The solid media sample #1 (no bacteria), sample #7 (with bacteria), and scratched samples were removed from the incubator. The copper pieces were covered in green and were enclosed by a blueish square. The copper samples were washed away and massed using the same procedure as on 7/8/12. Data did not make sense because the average percent decrease for the copper samples without bacteria is greater than the average percent decrease for the copper samples with bacteria.  We made a plot of data points and interpolated curves (Look at Data and Conclusions Section). The data does not seem very reasonable since the solid media with no bacteria ended with a higher % decrease in copper mass than the solid media with bacteria."

The Tale of Ghost and Elf: Chapter six
The Little Dot felt a little unhappy, for everyone made effort to protect the planet except her. She just accompanied Summer and the little prince all day. Summer didn’t give her any tasks.
“What’s the matter? You seem to be unhappy.” Summer asked, noticing her displeasure,” the little prince will go back home tomorrow. He worries about his Rose. Could you help me send him home for me?” Little Dot smiled,” OK, but how can I send him?”
“I have already programmed the firefly. You can take it to leave and fly back home.”
“What about you, don’t you go together with us?”
“No, I have to stay here to observe the planet in case that something emergent happens.”
“Flame Angel is me. I am the Flame Angel. The first man protects the world……” Little Dot sang happily.
“Come back soon, don’t linger. There is a more important task waiting for you.
The next day, Little Dot and Little Prince flied to planet B612 together.
“What a tiny star!”
“Yeah, but that doesn’t prevent me from feeling satisfied about my life with the company of  my rose.”
“So where’s she?”

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2018,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," and most people are acceptable. However, considering the individual tolerance, patients can choose painless colonoscopy according to their own wishes. Painless colonoscopy is performed under general anesthesia. However, it is also necessary to consider the risks of general anesthesia, such as anesthesia accidents, sometimes anesthesia recovery process is longer, and the cost is more expensive.
Before taking the colonoscopy, you need to take laxatives and discharge the excretions in the intestines. This is a painful process: the colonoscopy is still very painful. The tube is pushed from the anus and then the intestines. Keep deepening according to the shape of colon. Because the intestines have ascending colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, etc., when the tube comes to turning, it is very painful and generally difficult to bear.
One patient revealed that he had had a colonoscopy. After doing it, he did not even have the strength to walk. Patient can choose painless colonoscopy, which is the state of anesthesia, and it can alleviate the pain. The instrument for colonoscopy is a flexible fiber hose with a length of about 140CM. The front end is a fiber hose with a miniature electronic camera with a light source. The rear side is connected with an imaging display. The doctor operates the moving direction of scope according to the image on the display to the intestine. After entering the anus, the colonoscopy passes through the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum.
In order to see the road conditions in the intestine during the examination, the doctor will continue to inflate and pump the intestines in the intestines. The stomach will have a feeling of bloating when inflated. This pain is within an acceptable range. If the above picture can be displayed, you can see that the colonoscopy will go through three curves during the on-going process, the first is the sigmoid colon, the second is the spleen of the descending colon to the transverse colon, and the third is the transverse colon to the hepatic curvature of ascending colon. It is a great test for doctors and patients going through these three corners. If the doctor is skilled and can lightly pass these three corners, the patient will not have much pain. However, if the doctor is not skilled, it will be a painful thing. These three corners, recalled by people who have completed the course, the pain levels from high to low are the spleen, sigmoid colon and hepatic curvature, which means that the second one is the most difficult, which is consistent with the"

We sought to both improve and characterize this part for future utilization in our filtration device by adding a modified lac promoter to allow for constitutive expression rather than IPTG induction within the biological system, and thus make it more applicable in the environment (Figure 5). We also improved the characterization of their part by testing its application for biological precipitation of iron and cadmium in addition to their copper testing to add to the functionality of the part.

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," a recombination directionality factor (RDF) was identify recently to reverse the recombinase action and now, the activation or inactivation of any desired pathway could be triggered by the actuation of PhiC31 recombinase together with its RDF (Brophy and Voigt, 2014).
Figure 2. Graphic genetic design of PhiC31 actuation in plant-human genetic circuit. A) Register assembly construct composed by 35s promoter inverted sequence and Mtb terminator flanked by two opposing PhiC31 site-specific recombination. B) Dimers of ΦC31 bind to the attachment sites and each subunit binds to one half site. When recombinase is bound to specific pairs of sites (e.g. attP and attB sites), an integrase tetramer is assembled and a synaptic complex between both sites is constituted. C) Double-stranded DNA breaks are produced by the activated tetramer and recombinant product is produced.
ChatterPlant proposes a modular and orthogonal AND gate in order to increase the genetic control of expressing any color protein. Leaf’s colour changes are triggered by the designed genetic toggle switch comprised by a stress-inducible promoter and a terminator in opposite directions flanked by ΦC31 attachment sites (attB and attP).
In normal basis, ΦC31 recombinase is being expressed in the plant and the stress-inducible promoter is always inverted. In this case, no coding sequence is expressed, and the circuit is inactivated (Figure 3A).
The RDF from ΦC31 - gp3 - was used to reverse the directionality of integrase actuation allowing the inducible promoter to return to the original state (Khaleel, Younger, McEwan, Varghese & Smith, 2011). The use of gp3 customized in plants allows us to activate the biological system in order to produce a colour protein corresponding to a specific stress. Once RDF expression stops, the toggle switch return to the OFF state (Figure 3B).

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," produces one optimal solution when multiple valid optima may exist, FVA (flux variability analysis) reveals the entire optimal solution space and provides flux ranges for each reaction in the model.3,4  Therefore, analyzing FVA results gives us insight into which metabolic pathways an organism is using, given constraints that we set.
Result: Pyruvate Metabolism
When we compared flux data for our wild type and nitrogen fixing WM1788 models, we found that pyruvate synthase had higher (more positive) flux ranges for the nitrogen fixing strain than for the wild type.
2 flavodoxin (semi-oxidized) + 1 pyruvate +1 coenzyme A ↔ 1 CO2 + 2 reduced flavodoxin + 1 H+ + 1 acetyl-coA
1 pyruvate + 1 coenzyme A + 1 NAD → 1 CO2 + 1 NADH + 1 acetyl-coA
1 pyruvate  + 1 coenzyme A → 1 acetyl-co-A + 1 formate
Therefore, we determined that knocking out pyruvate dehydrogenase (see figure above) redistributed more flux through pyruvate synthase, increasing the positive effect and producing more reduced flavodoxin.
However, experimentally, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency in E. coli is associated with a buildup of pyruvate [5] , which is then converted into lactic acid, and results in compromised cell activity. To bypass this effect, we proposed simultaneous overexpression of pyruvate synthase, which will favorably produce more reduced flavodoxin from excess pyruvate.
Metabolite Exchange Reactions
We wanted to determine if the addition of any one metabolite to cell media could help promote model growth or activity. We specifically looked into the effects on maximum biomass, ATP, and reduced flavodoxin. From a Max Biomass vs. Max ATP scatter plot we generated with our data, we were able to narrow our set of metabolites to 6 sugars, including maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose.
Based on our results, we believe that the addition of any one of these metabolites to lab media can aid cell activity by providing an additional source of energy.
Additional Work: Single and Double Gene Knockouts
When a gene is knocked out in a cell, a metabolic flux redistribution can result.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

Purpose: To optimize the induction conditions for the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT construct. These conditions included time, temperature and IPTG concentration.
Attributions: The SDS PAGE runs, inductions, and all subsequent analysis were performed by Ryan Shontell and Gina Watanabe.
Materials and Methods: An overnight culture (ON) of the transformed CR2 Gag-Prot-RT BL21 cells was prepared (10 mL of this ON culture will be used to perform a 200 mL induction). 50 μg/μL of chloramphenicol and 50 μg/μL of ampicillin was added to the ON culture. The flask was then left in the incubation shaker ON at 37°C at 220 rpm.
200 mL of media was then added to the induction container along with the 10 mL of the ON culture. The induction culture was then allowed to grow at 37°C. (Note: For 1-15 mL induction cultures it is recommended to allow growth for 1 hour at 220 rpm. For inductions that are 100+ mL it is recommended to allow to growth for 2 hours at 175"

Composite parts
New Composite Part : SV40+Rluc
BBa_K1722012
SV40 is a strong promoter with enhancer in the upstream. Rluc is a widely used reporter gene which can produce Renilla Luciferase. However, different from normal Rluc reporter gene, this one is being amber mutated and the mRNA chain being transcriped out has a terminator inside it. In this way, the whole chain of Renilla Luciferase cannot be translated in natural condition. Only with two other composite parts of our project (BBa_K1722010& BBa_K1722010) can Renilla Luciferase protein being produced.
Another Composite Part : hUPⅡ+AckRS
BBa_K1722007
hUPⅡ is a bladder specific promoter that can only drive gene expression in urothelium cells. As the output gene of this recombinant plasmid, AckRS can produce an RNA synthetase which can achieve the attachment of Ack and tRNA. This composite part will perform its function together with two other plasmids (BBa_K1722010& BBa_K1722012)
Another Composite Part : hTERT+tRNA
BBa_K1722010
hTERT is recognized as a cancer specific promoter for various cancers. The tRNA that is expressed by tRNA gene has CUA as its anticodon, which can pair with the amber mutated stop codon UAG in the mRNA chain to continue the translation of the amber mutated mRNA. Together with BBa_K1722007 and BBa_K1722012, this genetic circuit can specifically recognize bladder cancer cells and express the therapeutic gene out.
Another Composite Part : shTERT+GFP
BBa_K1722009
shTERT is a cancer specific promoter improved from hTERT promoter. We use GFP as the output reporter gene of our plasmid. When shTERT promoter is activated, sfGFP is produced and be oxidized to fluoresce. By inserting this plasmid into T24 and 5637, two lines of bladder cancer cells, we are able to acquire sfGFP. Green fluorescent light is detected using fluorescent microscope. This indicates that"

The Coliguard: Project Overview
In our Coliguard System, we want our engineered E. coli to be able to recognize and destroy contaminants in culture medium. Since we want our bacteria to show maximum efficiency during the industrial process, we decided to create two different lineages of E. coli:  the worker lineage – responsible for executing the industrial process – and the killer lineage – responsible for detecting and killing the contaminants. Both lineages are going to be simultaneously present in the culture medium, but their proportion will vary due to the presence or absence of contaminants. In the absence of contaminants, the amount of worker cells will be much higher than the number of killer ones, so that the industrial process will occur at its maximum efficiency. In the presence of contaminants, killer cells will induce surrounding worker cells to differentiate into more killer cells in a transient manner. After elimination of contaminants by the killer lineage, the proportion of worker and killer cells will return to its original rate.
Based on our model, we divided the project into three subparts:
Recognition mechanism
Differentiation mechanism
Killing mechanism
1) Recognition mechanism
Our idea is based in the ability of the engineered  E. coli  be able to recognize contaminants in the culture medium. Thus, our bacteria need to recognize a specific signal that they don’t produce, but are broadly produced or presented by potential contaminants. Thinking about the potential signals, we found two candidates: The AI2 (auto inducer 2) and the conjugation recognition mechanism.
As most bacterial species produces AI2 as a secondary metabolite, we decided to use this compound as a recognition factor. Our E. coli will be impaired in the synthesis of this compound, the synthesis will only happens when the cells receive the conjugation signal. The presence of AI2 in the culture medium will then indicate the presence of contaminants, which will be recognized by an AI2 sensitive promoter present in our E. coli.
In conjugation, a donor bacterium only conjugates with organisms that don’t have the same conjugative plasmid. Bacteria that already have the plasmid display membrane proteins that prevent the conjugation with other bacteria that have the"

Surveys (August 2015)
iGEM Team IIT Delhi conducted some surveys to get an idea of the level of awareness among the citizens of Delhi, and getting an insight into the basic health and mental issues faced by the people by virtue of living in the most polluted city in the world. This was done in Central Park in Connaught Place, New Delhi and Munirka village. This was a really eye opening experience as we realised that the basic level of awareness is very low among the common people of the city. The details of the surveys have been enclosed in a separate document.

Questioning Central Dogma
The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is the foundation of modern-day synthetic, molecular, and microbiology. While countless innovations in medicine and technology are based on the truth of the doctrine, it does not always accurately predict results in the lab. The Penn State iGEM team questions the central dogma with genetic constructs explore deviations from the norm.
Projects >>
Welcome!
Welcome to the Penn State iGEM page! Here you can find information on all of our projects , progress , achievements , and much more.
We are currently working on three projects that question the dogma of the Central Dogma of Biology. The Central Dogma is the commonly held belief that within biology, information flows from the order of nucleotides in DNA to the order of nucleotides in RNA and finally to the order of amino acids in a protein. These proteins then go on to complete a variety of functions that make life work.
Molecular biology can be challenging to understand. Check out our Synthetic Biology For Dummies animation below!

Bacteria II itself will automatically produce another                                 part of regulator LuxR triggered by IPTG. Besides Bacteria II has a logically                                 amplification circuit regulated by LuxI-LuxR complex. In this circuit containing two                                 promoter regulating two protein. The former one is regulated by Lux complex and produces                                 cI inhibition protein and the latter one will be inhibited by cI protein and EGFP will                                 be expressed when lack of cI protein. Consequently, this genetic amplification circuit,                                 compare with others, will not directly enhance the intensity of GFP expression but to                                 increase the signal resolution of concentration variation.
The design intention on bacterial membrane permeability improvement is directly from part                                 of mechanism of antibiotics resistance. Theoretically, bacteria won't receive antibiotic                                 substance because of mutation of its transmembrane protein and efflux system. Thus, we                                 are attempting to modify bacteria in reverse way, that is overexpression of                                 transmembrane protein, or more specifically porin, and inhibition of efflux system                                 production through CRISPR.
Antibiotic Substance Sensing                                 Module
Previous research from Sahar Melamed and Shimshon Belkin has already selected dozens of                                 promoters responding to antibiotic concentration specifically through the fluorescence                                 signal.
Promoter Selection with Fluroescence Intensity, *2012 Shimshon Belkin*
For instance, micF has relatively specific signal response when treated with                                 sulfamethoxazole(255.2), sulfadimethoxine(44.9) and colistin(36.9), soxS is                                 able to sense tetracycline(26.5) and oxytetracycline(26.1) at relative high intense.                                 Besides, recA will effectively detect the existence of nalidixic acid and etc.                                 These maximal induction of each promoter strain is tested in the course of 10h of                                 exposure.
The mechanism of these promoters are different from each other. However, basically,                                 mechanisms consist of: - micF, an antisense ncRNA targeting ompF RNA, main endogenous                                 porin of Escherichia coli, participating in post-transcriptionally regulation                                 of this outer membrane protein F(ompF). micF is also regarded as one of the promoter of                                 soxRS-regulated gene.

bglX was capable of degrading the substrate MUG, which has a β(1→4) bond, similar to that of cellobiose.
We tested the ability of E. coli with this bglX part to grow on minimal media with cellobiose as the only carbon source. It could not. By contrast, it did grow if glucose was the carbon source, showing that it is fundamentally capable of growing on minimal media:
   
Cellobiose as the only carbon source. K523014 (bottom) fails to grow.

INP-EYFP
We made a fusion ( BBa_K523013 ) of Ice Nucleation Protein and Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein, and placed it under the control of the Lac promoter.
Under blue light, the cells fluoresced yellow, as shown below (left image). Unfortunately, our imaging technology was not capable of showing whether the fluorescence was localised to the outer membrane, so we centrifuged the cells so that the membrane fraction was localised to the bottom of the tube and compared the result to a colony expressing EYFP without INP. This showed that the INP-EYFP was indeed localised to the cell membrane.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated human practices_-_-_TEXT.html," management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening programme and a set of quality.
Adequate staffing and facilities for testing, diagnosis, treatment and programme management should be available prior to the commencement of the screening programme
Clinical management of NSCLC is optimized by NICE. NICE would be in charge of creating management and monitoring plan for our test, were it to be used clinically. Our test would actually free up healthcare staff and facilities. Early detection would reduce the number of cancers diagnosed at later stages where the only option is palliative care, which is more expensive than earlier stage treatment.
This in turn would free up healthcare staff and facilities. [12]
Information about the test and its outcomes must be understood by the individual being screened.
Potential participants should be provided with evidence-based information on the purposes and potential consequences of the programme so they can make an informed choice.
Decisions about the screening interval and sensitivity of the process should be scientifically justifiable to the public
When the individual is being screened, information, similar to that on our wiki, could be presented to them. Evidence for the efficacy of screening could only be given once clinical trials have been carried out. The screening interval could also be optimized from these trials.
All other options for managing the condition with cost effective intervention should have been considered
This is not applicable to NSCLC - early detection is required to reduce mortality rates - when detected late, it can only be treated palliatively.
If people carrying a mutation are identified through screening, their natural history should be understood, which includes psychological implications.
If the test is for a mutation or a genetic variants, the method and means for findings to be kept under review, should be clearly set out

Education
After running a couple of workshops relating to synthetic biology, it was clear to us that genetic modification was seen as dangerous, or unsafe by most younger students. Bacteria were generally seen as risky to work with as many people did not realize there were non-pathogenic strains. Often synthetic biology jargon would cause people to turn off. This was not only the case with younger students, but with adults as well.
We therefore changed our approach to engagement - focusing on making our project more accessible and therefore more exciting. We came up with real world scenarios to pique interest in synthetic biology - from diagnosing disease to reducing the impacts of climate change. We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rect"

Lane 7 = 8ul of HindIII DNA ladder
The DNA gel electrophoresis was run at 90v and run for 30 minutes. The results and analysis of the gel can be seen below in the 'Results' section
Results
It is quite clear from this photograph that the restriction digests did not work properly. Whilst it looks like the plasmid backbones are the right size (we are expecting the backbone to be 2079bp and on the gel it appears to be between 1904 and 3530bp), their appearance looks unconvincing. All four plasmid backbones appear to have been split into two parts; this should not happen at all. The samples treated with only one enzyme should be linearised not cut into two parts whereas in the sample treated with both enzymes, the backbone should be in one piece with the insert removed.
It has to be noted that the insert appears smaller than expected; according to the Parts Registry the BBa_J33206 BioBrick is 956bp whereas the gel photograph suggests it's roughly 564bp long.
The suggested reasons for this are:
Too much DNA was added to the wells - this can be seen by the heavy black blots on the photograph
The FastDigest enzymes EcoRI and PstI were given too little time to act.
In another attempt of this restriction enzyme digest, the Metal Sensor team should consider altering the amount of contents in the restriction enzyme digest mix and should also consider reviewing the length of incubation time allowed for the digests to happen as well as how much DNA to put into the wells.
Promoter Library Sub-Project
The aim of this sub-project is to create a library of sigA promoters which differ in strength and to characterise them.
The first step in this process is to digest the pGFP-rrnb plasmid with restriction enzymes EcoRI and NheI. The enzyme digests were prepared in 1 Eppendorf tube in the following way:
15ul of pGFP-rrnb plasmid DNA (from a midiprep)
3ul NheI (FastDigest)
3ul EcoRI (FastDigest)
4ul FastDigest buffer
15ul distilled water
This makes up a total volume of 40ul The mixture was made in such a way that the DNA, the distilled water and the FastDigest buffer was added first before the enzymes were added. The tube was given a spin pulse and placed in a water bath at 37C for 1 hour.

Angular6 combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. It helps developers to build cross-platform applications that live on the web, mobile, and desktop across Mac, Windows, and Linux.                         ​ Angular6 makes our web pages extremely high performance. It turns templates into code that's highly optimized for today's JavaScript virtual machines, giving us all the benefits of hand-written code with the productivity of a framework. And Angular apps load quickly with the new Component Router, which delivers automatic code-splitting so users only load code required to render the view they request.                         ​ Thanks to Angular popular, many well-known code editing products support Angular, like Visual Studio Code, Sublime text and WebStorm. We choose WebStorm as our IDE to makes code easily and spend less time.                         ​ When setting up our development environment, Angular CLI plays an important role. Angular CLI is a command line tool which makes build, add components and test faster. It has become one of the most essential tools for Angular.                         ​ We use Angular6 modularity system and component system to work together more easily and efficiently. The modularity system differentiates and combines the same and different functions and the component system can use less code to do a good job. Benefiting from Angular6’s performance and rendering mechanism which are better than most current mainstream frameworks,  including Vue and React, our web pages has faster response and more comfortable experience. With Karma for unit tests, our codes become stronger.                         ​ One of the important reasons we choose Angular6 is the issue of network security. Angular6 has built-in protections against common web-application vulnerabilities and attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks. To systematically block XSS bugs, Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template"
NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," illness comes up repeatedly and the treatment cycle is long as well as expensive. Because it's a lifelong illness and you need to take a pill every day after being hospitalized. Better drugs like biologics are expensive, even up to about 10,000 USD a month. Less effective drugs are not covered by Medicare. Coupled with the repeated illness needs to be looked after by the family and society has brought a burden. The financial and mental burden of an inflammatory bowel disease patient is enormous.
Later, doctors also told us that there has always been a large number of patients who have got inflammatory bowel disease, while more than 20 IBD patients in a floor of this inpatient department. Crohn's disease primarily affects young people while ulcerative colitis occurs at all ages. Patients are more likely to choose medication and few will undergo surgery.
The interview exposed problems with existing treatments, such as the difficulty of effectively curing IBD for long. The rapid spread of inflammatory bowel disease is taking a huge toll on individuals, families and society. It also presents huge health risks, as more and more people are getting sick and the situation will only get worse if they are not dealt with in time. Patients and society are looking forward to the emergence of a new type of treatment. Our team should not blindly pursue curative effect when designing the scheme, but also consider the economic benefits and accompanying risks.
5 vegetable planting
In addition to IBD patients, we want everyone to have a healthier gut. So we're going to grow broccoli this fall. Thanks to the efforts of our team members, we successfully cooperated with the university to open up a small field of broccoli on the unbuilt campus wasteland.
Broccoli is not only our source of sulforaphane, but also an accepted healthy dish.We plan to distribute our broccoli to IBD patients, campuses and surrounding communities, hoping that people will pay attention to gut health and develop healthier eating habits.
Thanks for everyone’s time and support. We believe that more and more people will pay more attention to their intestinal health in the future and give more care and understanding to IBD patients, be interested in synthetic biology, and be willing to contribute to the cause of human health.

Imperial_College_London,2009,Team:Imperial College London#Drylab#Genome Deletion#Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," However, if lambda cI promoter is weak, there might not be enough killing, so we will only see a reduction in growth of cell population, ie: a slower increase in population.
The Model
We model the behaviour of our system with 6 differential equations. The first two are concerned with the production of protein cI, which represses killing. The next two tells us the production of restriction enzymes. Equation (5) describes the cell population, while equation (6) tells us the total number of dead cells. This will allow us to relate our model to the cell death assays performed.
In this model, the effects of Dam methylase are not included.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our second cargo is the scaffolding protein attached to FitD, a molluscicidal toxin specific to Zebra and Quagga mussels. Zebra mussels are an invasive species in North America and have become an increasing threat to Canadian waterways. Therefore, as a method of preventing the spread of invasive mussel populations, we have designed a method to deploy SP-FitD encapsulated in P22 PNCs. For this application, we have also designed a P22 surface modifier, a mutated P22 decoration (Dec) dimer. This DecS134C dimer has been previously shown to cause aggregation of PNCs (Uchida et al., 2015). The size of the PNC aggregates corresponds with the size of phytoplankton, the typical food for invasive mussel species (Molloy et al., 2013; Sprung & Rose, 1988; Baldwin et al., 2002). For more detail on the Zebra mussel application, please see our Product Design and Human Practices pages.
Finally, for additional proof of concept experiments, we have also designed a reporter cargo where the truncated P22 SP was fused to a super-folded GFP.
MS2
MS2 bacteriophage coat proteins self-assemble to form a 27nm PNC (Rohovie et al., 2017). To improve encapsulation of protein cargo, we fused our cargo to an anionic tag to improve protein interactions on the interior surface of the PNC. We also added a modification to the surface of the MS2 capsid, a polyarginine peptide, which can target and penetrate cells non-specifically.
The natural MS2 bacteriophage has an RNA genome. Within this genome there is an RNA oligonucleotide that, when in proximity to the capsid protein, causes the self-assembly of the capsid, effectively encasing the RNA genome inside. This mechanism relies primarily on electrostatic interactions as the RNA is highly anionic (Glasgow et al., 2012). Thus we have put a highly anionic peptide on the end of the GFP protein to facilitate encapsulation at a higher efficiency. This also avoids the need for attaching DNA/RNA to proteins via “click chemistry”. In this case, GFP also acts as a reporter for our validation experiments.
We have also modified the exterior surface of the MS2 capsid with a polyarginine tag. Polyarginine peptides have been shown to penetrate and move through the membrane of eukaryotic cells and has also been previously used to deliver macromolecules through the membrane (Sch"
UC_Chile,2013,Team:UC Chile#Game_-_-_TEXT.html," the promoter PSOS that responds to a variety of agents such as UV-light, physical agents and stress.
Team Heidelberg tells in its webpage:
“The immunity gene is under the regulation of two promoters, the PSOS of the colicin operon, and its own constitutive promoter that allows a constitutive production of the immunity protein. This ensures that there is no free colicin inside the cytoplasm, which would kill the host cell. The separated constitutive promoter is located within the structural gene of nuclease colicins. There is no immunity gene in operons encoding pore-forming (ionophoric) colicins: It is located on the opposite DNA strand of the intergenetic space between the colicin and the lysis structural gene and is transcribed from its own promoter under constitutive regulation. The last gene of the colicin operon encodes for the lysis protein, which is controlled by the same promoter as the colicin production. Due to the terminator localized downstream of the colicin gene, the lysis protein is expressed in lower amounts than the colicins. After reaching a certain threshold of lysis protein the host cell is lysed which leads to the release of colicins into the medium.”
Next figures shows the biobrick made by Team Heidelberg.
Colicin E1 operon which contains a colicin with pore-forming activity.
Colicin E9 operon which contains a colicin with nuclease activity.
In Research, you need to gather the pieces of DNA that will form the recombinant plasmid, and all this while you are learning about synthetic biology.
The final structure of the plasmid is:
An inducible promoter  (Para) is needed in order to liberate the colicins inside the termite and no before. Tnos is the terminator. T7 is a strong constitutive promoter that is needed to express the immunity protein, in order to protect the host from the toxin while is producing it. The RBS used, the Ribosome Binding Site, belongs to the Anderson RBS family of partregistry (8) . This is a constitutive RBS family that is suitable for prokaryotes, specially for E. coli. It could be chosen, for example, BBa_J61100.
To maximize the effectiveness of the process, a High copy plasmid is used.To get a fast response, you have to work with Escherichia coli: the model bacteria. It also is the bacteria that work best with the chosen biobricks"

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT#HP#Magazine#iGEM Communication 1_-_-_TEXT.html," was also a poster area where we can see the posters of different teams to learn their ideas and thoughts. The posters all have their own features of their team, for example, the poster of Ocean University of China was painted on a blue background just like the beautiful ocean.
In the afternoon, HUST team and other 6 teams presented their projects in English. At first, two girls of HUST team introduced their project and they designed an engineering bacterium called Cao Mengde that can monitor Cu2+ of effluent, and meanwhile adsorb cyanogen compounds. And BNU team designed a project about an enzyme called ModA. The enzyme can adsorb and fix nitrogen and release molybdenum, which is of great help for plants to grow. And CAU team also bring us an amazing project. They tried to use a certain mechanism to make the engineering bacteria express RFP cyclically so that make a snowflake-shaped picture.WHU-Pharm team focused on designing a drug monitor without cellular system,while  Jinlin team chose a project of environment track just like Peking team in order to control water pollution.
(Pic 3 Our delicious dinner)
At dinner, HZAU team brought us a sumptuous feast. We tasted various delicious local foods in Zhuyuan Dining Hall. After dinner, we had a lively and amazing discussion, which we called free talk. We have deep-going discussion and communication with BIT team, NDTU team, LZU team, WHU team and AHUT team. The atmosphere of free talk cannot be more enthusiastic, and all members have a very positive attitude to talk with their new friends and other team members. We cannot help being moved by our enthusiasm.
All team members made great efforts for one topic, one dream and one goal. We encouraged each other, and we were grateful for HZAU held the wonderful meet-up, which we cannot forget any more. What’s more, one of our team delegates also found a fellow-townsman in this competition, which made him feel very warm and happy.
All in all, the most important meaning of joining in iGEM is not about the grade , and should be the knowledge, confidence, friendship and the beautiful memory!

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html,"DNA ( Jain & Vale 2017 ). The cleaving activity of this (and other) nuclease can therefore be tested using the coacervation detection method. One more nuclease that can characterised in a similar way is the coding sequence for a nuclease regulated by T7-promoter ( BBa_K2144000 ).
Further improvements
Several optimization and broadening steps for the coacervation method can be thought of. Trivial optimization steps are those in which the coacervate forming polymers and their concentrations are optimized to achieve maximum visual difference between coacervates and homogenous solutions. Furthermore, dyes exist that partition into coacervates rather than in the polymer-poor phase, and by centrifugation the dyed coacervates can be spun down to the bottom of a tube ( Aumiller et al. 2016 ; Aumiller & Keating 2015 ). For more quantitative measurements with the coacervation method, absorbances can be measured in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer, as we did for several of our own experiments as well.

Introduction
Our cellular model develops on the characterization on srfA, comA and sfp gene expression pathway as well as trying to predict the final productivity of surfactin over time. The main tool wo used to build our model is Matlab,sponsored by Mathworks. To be more specific, we use Simbiology which is a plugin toolbox that specifically designed for computational system biology. By writing deterministic differential equations of reaction inside the cell, we can easily create the pathway that resembles real-life situations.
The signalling cascade
To start with characterization of our gene pathway, our model has been assumed to act as a standard three-component regulation pathway. This type of modelling is well established in the past(Chen, He and Church.1999)(Ingalls, Brian, 2012)
In our model, we assumed the biochemical reaction take place in sequence as shown below:
srfA, comA and sfp are transcripedt and translated simultaneously.
srfA activator,which is coded by comA, helps in transciption of srfA which codes for the synthesis of surfactin synthethase
PPTase, which is coded by sfp, helps in activation of surfactin synthethase, making it become holo synthethase which will produce surfactin by binding with the amino acids.
Transcription
In real life situation, the transcription rate can be affected by many factors. However we found out through literature research that the major factor would be the initiation of transcription. Therefore we assumed that:
The overall transcription rate is primarily determined by the strength of the promoter in the pathway
The promoter strength is constant throught at maximum expression level the whole process
For constitutive promoter, we assume that the expression level is at the maximum rate for all time
In our final construct, the sfp is under the control of pVEG. According to our literature research, pVEG is 100 times stronger than J23101 which has been characterized in terms of relative units by Berkeley iGEM2006 team. From the database entry we can see that J23101 is 1791 times stronger than promoter J23112 which has a value of 1. Therefore"

Initially BNU-China did the SDS-PAGE of the whole protein of bacteria, and the result was not as expected. The first time of result is not shown here. To put it in detail, they centrifuged 5 mL bacterium solution under overnight shake culture at 4 °C, 6000 rpm for 10 minutes, which was boiled for 10 minutes, then protein loading buffer was added. Afterwards they did the SDS-PAGE of the mixture with the running gel concentration 12%.
Because the whole cell was too stick, BNU-China couldn’t make an accurate estimation from the result, but anyway there was no sign of expression of the objective proteins whose molecular weight was about 46 kDa. Then they tried a normal SDS-PAGE of the homogenate and supernatant and the result is shown in Fig.6

Lane 1, molecular weight standards (kDa); Lane 2-4, the homogenate of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB; Lane 5, 6 and 8, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB, Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.
The bands were clearer this time, but there was no significant difference between the empty vector plasmid and the transformed ones.
After two times of unsuccessful attempts, BNU-China reviewed some articles of reliable protocols for membrane extraction and detection. With the protocols collected, they processed the experiment the third time(Fig.7).

Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.  From this result BNU-China concluded that the differences exist between the bands of controlled plasmid and the experimental ones, whereas it seemed that"

Project Overview
Our team aims to create a novel sensing device that enables one to quantitatively characterize the concentration, or presence of certain compounds. The theoretical advantages to our design include; a wider range of sensitivity, better accuracy, customizability, and ability to detect more than one input at any given time.
Our design combines three promoters upstream of three different chromoproteins onto one plasmid. This allows for the advantages listed above (see Figure 1-label theoretical comparison- comparison between tricolor and single color). To provide an example of our general design, we decided to create a tri-color system for glucose. The first two promoters in our system are already apart of the iGEM registry.
The first promoter is part BBa_K118011, submitted to iGEM in 2008 by University of Edinburgh in Scotland. This promoter is similar to the familiar promoter for the lactose operon in E. coli cells (the same one as described above). However, BBa_K118011 only has a lone cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding site, as opposed to having a CRP binding site and an operator site that binds to the lactose repressor protein. At extremely low glucose concentrations cAMP levels in the cell are high. In these conditions, cAMP associates with CRP forming a complex that binds to the binding site and activates high levels of transcription. In our construct, downstream of this glucose repressible promoter is efor Red (BBa_K1073023), which contains its own ribosomal binding site (RBS). The next promoter was also submitted previously by another team. In 2012, Wuhan University in China submitted part BBa_K861171, which is a glucose inducible promoter. The mechanism for this promoter can be thought of as the opposite of the first promoter. Instead of having a CRP binding site upstream of the promoter, the CRP binding site is located within the binding site for DNA polymerase. Thus, has the opposite effect as the first; when glucose is low, cAMP levels are high. Thus, cAMP associates with CRP and blocks transcription. As glucose concentrations rise, transcription is induced. In our construct, the chromoprotein associated with the second promoter is aeBlue (BBa_K1073021).
There was not another glucose inducible promoter in the iGEM regresistry, so our team created"

8.16 Modeling phage plaque size - Experiment One
I) Purpose
Utilizing knowledge gained from 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Size -  Preliminary Experiments , we will model phage plaque size against phage particle size and genome size.
II) Expected Outcome
A inverse relationship between phage plaque size and phage particle size/genome size.
III) Reagents Used
Accurate x2 top agar made using a volumetric flask.
LB
E coli B.
Stocks of phage: T1, T2, T3, T4, and T7.
IV) Procedure
1) Plating (8.16)
To see a statistical significance in plaque sizes between different phages, many plaques are needed. Thus 10 plates were used for T1, T2, T3, and T7. Because T4 form much smaller plaques, only 3 plates were used.
Experimental procedures are as follow: 0.5mL of E coli B (OD 0.5, adjusted after initial measurement of 0.558) was infected with 20uL of respective phage dilution samples for 10 minutes. 5mL x1 top agar was then added to each test tube, and the content was plated. The plates were incubated at 37 Celsius for 24 hours.
2) Propagation and spot test of T1 (8.12-8.20)
Propagated T1 by infection 1mL E coli B and 4mL of LB with 10uL of stock phage. Complete clearage was observed in two"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"
