You can stand on my umbrella to ANTI microorganisms.
Antimicrobial peptide CecropinXJ is synthesizing in “Rihanna” anytime. When your foot is on the insole, the temperature of your foot induces the temperature sensitive promoter to drive the expression of self-kill gene hokD to lyse the “Rihanna” to release CecropinXJ.
Visit Project “Rihanna” for more.
Overview
The best way to control foot odor and tinea pedis is to control the microorganisms on our feet. It’s well known that fungus can cause tinea pedis: most commonly caused by Trichophyton rubrum, a fungi species originated from Southeast Asia. But in different areas, the species of fungi causing infection varies sometimes. [1]. For foot odor, researches have shown that gram positive microorganisms contribute to the foot odor (Figure 1) [2].
Figure 1
So we decided to use engineered bacteria to secret chemical components to inhibit them. Antibiotics are not a wise choice because the abuse of them are very serious now and it’s useless for fungus inhibition. As a result, we decide to utilize antimicrobial peptide (AMP) to deal with the problem. It’s important to find a antimicrobial peptide which has a wide antimicrobial spectrum towards gram positive bacteria and fungus and can be expressed in E. coli successfully.  At last, we find CecropinXJ. It can be expressed in E. coli in fusion protein form and has a wide antimicrobial spectrum (Figure 2) [3], which is suitable for our goal.
Figure 2
But another problem is that, how to release the antimicrobial peptide? The secretion system in E. coli is not easy for releasing of protein synthesized in E.coli even with signal peptide. As a result, we decide to lyse the cell directly to release the content by temperature inducement.
The Rihanna system works as follows.

This led to the start of FUEL planning, an idea touched upon in our planning briefings as one of many possible side-projects.
18/7/16  - 22/7/16
Week 6 - PCR problems
Pain, Primers & PCRs
With our guides and spilt luciferase cloned into pET16b (or so we thought), we set about on troubleshooting our PCRs - we were skeptical of the official guides, and tested a range of temperatures and combinations (appropriate to each construct) to achieve the strongest signal. Outside of the lab, we searched for collaboration opportunities - CRSIPR-CAS9 was a common enough system that there must be someone else using it in a similar way to us?

Week 7 - PCR PCR PCR
Dreaming of PCRs
We found the golden ratio, and we went into overdrive to make up for lost time, running hundreds at a time, (record = 105 in an afternoon). Despite a low success rate, we found SB1C3 - R1 almost immediately and Andrew sent it off for sequencing. Concurrently Chris and Nik were busy re-doing all previous stages for the constructs, and troubleshooting along the way to work out what had failed and why. In a few cases it was human error, but we discovered more problems with our protocols, and a the week after we found out a full third of our constructs were doomed from the start
1/8/16  - 5/8/16
Week 8 - Success?
First Biobrick - worthy construct
A New Hope
Huzzah! Our first bonafide success, even if it was just a guide RNA for a CRISPR-dCAS9 system it counts as our first biobrick-able construct. No time to celebrate though. With over 20 gels to run at times it felt like a Sisyphean task, but as always, what needs to get done gets done. With multiples samples sent off for sequencing, the end seemed near. Alongside all this Rob continued to toil on his FUEL project on the side.

Figure 13. The yield of riboflavin in different strains :EC10, Rf02S (Δpgi+EC10), EC10*
When we characterized our part, we were not able to detect the FMN for lacking proper equipments. However, we were surprised to find that the production of EC10* was even better with a larger output of riboflavins. For riboflavin measurements, culture samples were diluted with 0.05 M NaOH to the linear range of the spectrophotometer and the A444 was immediately measured, according to the Dr. Tao Chen’s method [7]. As for the reason of production improvement of RF, we speculate that the strengthening of ribC gene can improve both the RF and FMN yield through the flavin metabolic pathway.
3 Co-culture MFC -- Division Of Labor
Microorganisms rarely live in isolated niches. One reason is that the maintenance of viability of these microbes may need supplementary metabolites or other signaling chemicals provided by other microbes in the ecosystems and communities.[11] Conforming to the trend of revolution, we apply the bacterial consortium in our MFC for greater power generation and increased duration.
Apart from the universal trend of nature, the mixed culture shares some unique advantages particularly in our MFC. For example, Shewanella originally can merely use few simple carbon substrates like lactate, acetate, formate, pyruvate and some amino acid.[1] However, our consortium as a whole can expand the absorption range of carbon resources and develop a more complex diagram of carbon input for Shewanella. Also, our intention is able to achieve comprehensive functions through “Division Of Labor” that monoculture can hardly manage. For instance, if we use only Shewanella to supply electricity, the production of flavins as well as other related reaction will inhibit current creation. These are fundamental reasons that we adopt the “mix” strategy in our project.
3.1 First Trial
Our experiment started with monoculture of Shewanella, in which we have found several important conclusions that might be used in the later trials: (i) Shewanella alone cannot take good use of glucose as the mere carbon source to generate power. (ii) Voltage has been improved when we add flavins to the monoculture medium, which proved that flavins indeed would help the power enhance. (iii) As an attempt to choose a proper substance being used in the experiment, we put sodium lactate into service and found that Shewanella could achieve power output"

2012 Taiwan iGEMer Fest
Synthetic biology is a new research area which has been  developing at an amazing speed in recent years. One of the important events  that contribute to its development is the International Genetically Engineered  Machine (iGEM) competition. Students that participate in iGEM share their ideas  with top students all around the world by building their own biological systems  using standard, interchangeable parts.
Students from Taiwan began to participate in this event from  2007. The number of teams from Taiwan has increased to 4 from only 1 at the  beginning. Considering that Taiwan is a small island on the Earth and lack of source  to let all students do their best on international event, a platform for  communication and cooperation between students from Taiwan are really needed.  So, a  meeting for Taiwan iGEMers -- 2012 Taiwan  iGEMer fest -- held at National Yang Ming University  (NYMU) on August 15th (Wed).
The  theme of this meeting is “iGEM – let the crazy idea come true"". During the meeting, students made subjective  reports and reviews. iGEM teams display the current progress of their projects,  and share their experiences with meeting participants.
The meeting will open to all undergraduates, graduate  students and researchers who are interested in iGEM and synthetic biology. We  encourage the participants to interact with each participant during this time  meetup. The meetup is supported by Institute of Biomedical informatics, NYMU.
Feedback
I’m so  glad to have the opportunity to  participate in the 2012 Taiwan iGEMer fest because this is the first time that  iGEM teams from Taiwan got together to share our interest in Synthetic biology  and iGEM. As a freshman in NYMU-Taipei iGEM team and just coming to NYMU nearly  a year ago, the happy in my mind cannot be described with words.
At the beginning  of the fest, the leaders of three teams introduced each team members to  everyone. Although we had probably communicate with each other before on the  facebook where offers the client a way to  build up clubs, I  made a lot of friends who study in NTU or"

The image(c) shows that there are no dark blocks in E .coli. But unexpectedly clear dark blocks both appeared in image(a) and (b).
We assumed that the dark blocks in image(b) might be resulted from expression leakage, the modeling proved this assumption.  You can see more on modeling page.
Later we did energy dispersion spectrum analysis for dark blocks.

(b)uninduced and mineralized cells harboring PT5-ftnA.
(c)Mineralized cells harboring empty plasmid back bone.
The data show that iron exists in all the tested bacteria sample. So we needed another more ideal method to prove that our bacteria was successfully mineralized.
Native PAGE Test
In most occasions, TEM test is the most assurance test, and most literature verify their in vivo mineralization by this test. However, TEM test is quite expensive, and when we doing this test, we found that it’s hard to figure more detailed structure. Consequently, we can’t verify the iron core in ferritin through TEM test. So we explored a new method to verify the iron core synthesized by ferritin after mineralization.
From literature for in vitro [8], we learned that Native PAGE is one of the most powerful techniques for studying the composition and structure of native proteins, since both the conformation and biological activity of proteins remain intact during this technique.
Two native gels will be prepared, one of them is stained by potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6) to determine the mineralized ferritin, the other is regularly processed by Coomassie brilliant blue(CBB), aiming to mark the locus of ferritin as the cross-reference with the previous one.
Fig.8. Chemical reaction of generating prussian blue
Ferric iron can readily react with the ferrocyanide in acidic condition, resulting in the formation of a bright blue pigment namely prussian blue. [10]The chemical reaction could indicate the existence of the iron core because the color of bands would be blue when the iron core exist in ferritin cavity.

The RIM protein fits inside the                       TolC pore, with the RIN being a bulky anchor preventing total release of the adhesin. The RIM & RIN domain act as a TolC β-barrel plug (4) . The translocation process of the adhesin is shown in figure 2. After translocation, the HlyB/D complex is recycled. In our design, we want to use this                       ingenious system to express the adhesin on the surface of E. coli. However, the native                       adhesin is too large to be produced in E. coli. To avoid problems with expressing                        the adhesin in E. coli, the amount of RII repeats in the gene encoding the adhesin was reduced to 15.
Figure 2. Translocation mechanism of MpIBP adhesin.
Hydrogel
To find an appropriate hydrogel for our adhesin to bind to, we used the fact that this                       sugar binding domain has its highest affinity for glucose (7) . Our hydrogel must be biocompatible,                       it must be non-toxic to E. coli. The microstructure of the hydrogel must be open and porous, allowing efficient                       and fast nutrient, oxygen and solute exchange. The hydrogel must be mechanically stable to prevent bacterial leakage. The hydrogel must not degrade over a sustained period of time and synthesis should be                       relatively straightforward and reproducible.
Dextran is a polymer that consists of α-1,6-linked D-glucopyranose (glucose) residues.                       This glucose-based nature makes dextran an ideal polymer for our MpIBP adhesin to bind to.                       Dextran is non-toxic, has been investigated for tissue engineering applications, and                       is already used in the clinic as blood plasma substitutes (8) . A hydrogel from dextran                       polymer chains can be synthesized using radical polymerisation of glycidyl methacrylated                       dextran (9) . By adapting the protocol of Plieva et al. (9) , we designed a supermacroporous dextran hydrogel                       with pores ranging from 1 to 100 micrometer that meets our requirements. This unique morphology                       allows for the rapid and non-restricted mass-transport of solutes of virtually any size (9) .

To investigate the effect of smaller well plates, a cultivation of two of our strains was performed by the iGEM team UNIFI from Florence, Italy. The team cultivated E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) in a 96 well plate. The cultivation was performed at 37 °C and 130 rpm in 3  mL of LB media. Three biological replicates were cultivated and measured at each time point. The results are shown in figure (6).

Figure 5-4 Applying PR in a WWTP model. A) Three groups were setup and churned for 5 hours: PR bacteria + distilled water, PR bacteria + CC-AgNPs, and CC-AgNPs + distilled water. B) After 5 hours, flocculants were added and aggregated materials settled to the bottom. C) We then centrifuged the contents of each cylinder, and observed that the pellet of the PR bacteria + CC-AgNPs mixture was orange, reflecting the presence of aggregated CC-AgNPs.

Video 5-1 Testing PR bacteria in simulated aeration tanks. Three tanks were setup: PR E. coli + distilled water (right), PR E. coli + CC-AgNP (middle), or CC-AgNP solution alone (left). The contents were mixed for 5 hours to simulate the conditions in an aeration tank. Then, we stopped the rotor and added the flocculant powder used by Dihua WWTP to each tank. In the CC-AgNP cylinder, adding flocculants did not have any effect, suggesting that current wastewater treatment practices cannot remove NPs. In the cylinders containing PR bacteria, however, aggregated materials (including bacteria) settled to the bottom of the cylinder as expected. We observed that the aggregated PR bacteria + CC-AgNPs mixture was orange, indicating the presence of CC-AgNPs. Experiment & Video: Justin Y.
BIOFILM CONSIDERATIONS
To achieve our goal of applying biofilms in WWTPs, we need to inform WWTP managers on the amount of biofilm necessary to trap their desired amount of NPs. Thus, we devised two experiments to investigate the effect of 1) biofilm volume and 2) biofilm surface area on NP trapping; the results of these experiments were incorporated into our model. (Learn more about modeling here !)
Volume Does Not Affect NP Trapping
To test the effects of biofilm volume, E. coli biofilms were grown, extracted, and washed as described in the Experimental page. These tests were performed with Gold NPs (AuNPs). Because AuNP solution is purple in color, we can take absorbance measurements and convert these values"

Also, this is the result .
The result says, 97% of people feel Drosophila as dirty, 81% feel as harmful. What does this mean? A lot of people confuse Drosophila and fly. Fly you find in your house is harmful, however, Drosophila can be used for gene therapy. So, it is very useful for us to study.
Also, we asked about the therapy of leukemia. From the result of this survey, we found that people wants to use inexpensive and recurrence preventing drugs.
Introduction of the class of Bioart (2012/09/19-21)
In our college KIT, bioart was firstly introduced as a lecture with practical course called‘Fusion of Science and Art Ⅰ using our project two years ago, E. coli pen in last year. Undergraduate students who major not only biology but also various fields of science can take the lecture.
Students learned the mechanism that the ink of E. coli pen emits fluorescence and drew paintings on agar plates using E. coli inks. And they gave a presentation on their concept of bioart.
Furthermore, the bioart described in E.coli Pen is carried by the textbook of the high school student.
Movie
According to the questionnaire, which we conducted, people think that genetic engineering has risk for environment and humans, and these are very complicated. And, they think Drosophila melanogaster, which we used in our experiments, is a harmful insect. In order to change the idea, we made a movie, which explains genetic engineering, and shows the significant usefulness of Drosophila melanogaster. This movie includes the scene of our lab work. By watching this movie, many people can get a correct knowledge of genetic engineering and Drosophila melanogaster, and change the idea. We hope people in the world would be interested in “science”.

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#PlugnplayAssembly#customization_-_-_TEXT.html," different purposes, for instance the removal of undesired restriction site or for alteration of a proteins catalytic function. When introducing mutations it is only necessary for the primers to overlap in the complementary region (linker). Depending on whether the point mutation should be degenerate or not only one or both primers needs to carry the mutation. Degeneration means that more than one codon may code for the same amino acid. Thereby, a degenerate mutation can give different outcomes in use of tRNA's.
Introducing a point mutation with non-degenerate codons
Both primers have to carry the desired mutation to ensure that the codon and the resulting amino acid are generated by the mutation.
1. To introduce a point mutation in a vector, the mutation has to be defined first.
2. To design the primers the software PHUSER can be used. Remember to introduce the desired mutation into the primer. Two primers are used per mutation.
3. The primers are ordered from your favourite company. Notice that the price can be a bit higher and delivery time a bit longer, when ordering primers with a uracil incorporated. We have had a good experience with the price, delivery time and quality of the primers ordered from Integrated DNA Technology.
4. To amplify the BioBricks the protocol Amplification of biobricks by PCR can be used.
5. Check the PCR reaction on an agarose gel before assembly. The new BioBricks can be used directly or purified by agarose-gel purification if needed.
6. The assembly of new BioBricks should be performed according to the protocol USER cloning .
7. A BioBrick, device or plasmid with the desired point mutation should now have been assembled.
Introducing a degenerate point mutation, which can give a different codon usage
Only one primer has to carry the desired point mutation. The procedure of assembly is the same as for the non-degenerate point mutation above.
It is also possible to introduce several point mutations in different regions by customizing the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard. This only requires one round of PCR and one round of cloning. The difference is that the PCR fragments made for each mutation will have to be fused together meaning that the introduction of two mutations would require the fusion of three PCR fragments, and so on.
Deletions
With this guide a gene or part of a gene or any other desired sequence of a plasmid, device, or BioBrick can be deleted.
1. First the site of the deletion should be defined.
2. The primers need to be designed so that"

I.Xuexuan Zheng：several ideas
1.Use lactobacillus instead of E coli as our new model for genetically engineering in order to avoid the potentially harmful outcome to human so that these technology could be used in the field ofmedicine safely.
Difficulty:
1)source of proper strain
2)synthesis of standardized part
3)money required
2.Membrane RNA
Difficulty:RNA in membrane is unstable, easy to desquamate and be degradated
3.Two directions of sifting aptamers:1.theosine homolog 2.other aptamers whose properties is similar to theosine
II.Sitao Zhang:PNA（Peptide nucleic acid）
Properties:
1.stable at high temperature
2.the binding between PNA/DNA strands is stronger than between DNA/DNA strands  3.Better recognition capability
4.stable in the presence of protease and DNase
Functions:
1.bind to DNA and prevent DNA from methylation
2.recognize DNA with specificity
Usage:genetic switch and sifting
Difficulty:
1.unbearable cost
2.can't be standardized
III.Xuyuan Gao:
1.Use the gene of Tase and attenuator regulated by tryptophan to establish a recording net.
2.papers about aptamers:a kind of aptamer,KMF2-1a,could bind to some special proteins in cell membrane,then it could be transported into cell by endocytosis
IV.Qian Li:
1.Optical Control:
1)Synthesis a special peptide,one terminal of which act as a ligand and is able to bind to cell membrane,the other terminal is a systeine whose residue,a sulfhydryl,could bind to hydrogel with the irradiation of laser.That peptide could act as a bridge to bind cells to hydrogel.
2)Central section of the peptide should be designed to be a special structure which could be cut off by UVL so that the cells binded to hydrugel could desquamate.
2.Ferritin：Ferritin is a kind of protein looks like a box,it could transport ferrum inside it in vivo.These boxes only unlock when ph is 2.0(5.0 in procaryotic cell),shut when ph reach 7.5.
Application：put chemical compounds in ferritin,let E coli carry them to the area where cancer cells live and growth,then unlock ferritin,release our medicines to kill cancer"

The question is then if the concentration is still high enough to induce expression of GFP in our system. Good insights into the amount of steel retained after sharp-force trauma and blunt-force trauma on bones can be found in a series of papers ( 6 , 7 ). Potential contaminants will also be of great importance. Hence testing the system with similar compounds will be one test. Checking for the prevalence of inducing compounds in or around bones is essential to see how prone the test is to leading to false negatives.
To remove doubts in the data from the bone incision experiments, due to possible experimental error we should repeat the experiments. This would ensure that the experiments are reproducible and reliable.

What is iGEM?
iGEM stands for international Genetic Engineering Machine and is a contest held by MIT
Student teams are given a kit of biological parts (DNA) at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. Teams present their work at the iGEM Jamboree held each year on MITs campus in Cambridge, MA and compete for awards in several categories including energy, health/medicine, and food.
For more information visit the Official Website
What is Synthetic Biology?
iGEM addresses the following questions:
Can simple biological systems be built from standard,
interchangeable parts and operated in living cells?
Or
Is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in the way that
mechanical and electrical systems are designed and constructed?
The answer is that biological systems CAN be built from standard parts! This is an approach to genetic engineering called Synthetic Biology. The primary objective of this field is to abstract the long, complicated sequences of nucleotides found in the DNA of cells into higher order 'interchangeable parts'. Just as you can piece together a computer, scientists want to piece together biological components to create living machines. Synthetic biology also encompasses the creation of standards for these parts.
This field is young and has great potential for both solving some of the most impending problems of our time and the potential for substantial misuse. With such a promising technology it is very important that safety guidelines are followed to prevent the latter.
Follow us to our safety page to see the precautions we take in our research in our Safety Section .
What is lab-work like?
This clip can give you a glimpse of the wetlab side of iGEM or biological engineering experimentation in general. The Wisconsin-Madison iGEM Team will be featured in an upcoming documentary called SynBio. The documentary will try to evaluate the emerging field of Synthetic Biology and explain the major goals of the field to the general public! Here is a teaser trailer of the Wisconsin iGEM Team.  The other half of our time on iGEM is devoted to research and analysis!

Here, the values of K1, K2 and K3 are unchanged. [E0] = 0.01, while [S0] varies from 0.01 (low in relation to KM and [E0]) to 10 (high in relation to KM and [E0]).
Module 2 Timeline
In this simulation, we have increasing [S0], while keeping [E0] constant. The slope of the graph of product vs time gives us rate of production of product. For lower values of [S0], the rate of production of the product is directly proportional to the amount of [S0]. However, for higher values of [S0], rate of production of product saturates at a maximum rate. Increasing [S0] will no longer have any effects.
When [S0] is very large, we will get a straight line on the graph of [ES] vs time or
. This is when the rate of formation of product purely depends on [E0] , and that [E0] is the limiting factor. In this case, we can say that the Michaelis-Menten assumption holds, and therefore,
We can see from the simulations of the rate of formation of product with and without the Michaelis-Menten assumption, that only for values at which the initial enzyme concentration is very large do we get some difference in the rate.
Simulation 3: Varying [E0]
Here, the values of K1, K2 and K3 are unchanged. [S0] = 0.1, while [E0] varies from 0.01 (low in relation to Km and [S0]) to 10 (high in relation to KM and [S0]).
Module 2 Timeline
When we increase [E0], we would see an increase in the rates of production of enzyme-substrate complex and product, as well as an increase in rate of the break down of substrate. This is because for a greater initial concentration of enzyme [E], the substrate utilisation rate increases.  The initial rate of product synthesis also increases.  Therefore, the enzyme has an activity that varies with its concentration.
Moreover, at high values of [E0], we note that the rate of formation of product saturates. This is when [S] becomes the limiting factor. In this case, [ES] decreases rapidly as the substrate is being utilised.  Therefore, the enzyme-substrate concentration [ES] no longer has a dynamic steady state.  The Michaelis-Menten assumption now no longer holds true.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," it may sometimes be hard to regulate dynamic viscosity ratio without         disrupting osmotic pressure. To conclude, every experiment should begin with selection of the right channel         design, while flow rate and viscosity regulation should only be used for fine-tuning
Model Limitations
Our model has some limitations. Due to the nature of phase-field model and minimal free energy principle, it         proved to be an invidious task to model liposomes exactly like in the real life. Since we cannot characterize         lipids and surfactants inside our materials to act as in reality, LO phase just forms a distinct sphere outside         of junction instead of surrounding the IA phase.
However, LO phase doesn’t impact the size of liposomes in any meaningful way and just needs to barely reach the         junction to subsequently form a pocket for inner fluid. So, in order to mimic the reality as best as possible,         we have made a few adjustments:
The surface tension between IA and OA phases was set the same as LO and OA, to depict the interface             movement correctly.
While IA phase is hydrophilic, it was set as a fully de-wetting phase to form veracious droplets

The Brickard Game
BRICKARD is the card game we created as a tool to help explaining synthetic biology in a fun way. The game consists in a deck composed by 40 cards, which are divided into the main biobrick categories:
Five types of Brickards
promoter cards,
RBS cards,
coding region cards,
terminator cards,
chassis cards.
Each group of players receive a mission alongside the deck, with an explanatory text regarding a problem they have to solve combining the cards, just like we do (with the real stuff!) in our lab. The missions were priority based on projects from past iGEM participations. They were:
Mission: Fuel from sunlight
Mission: Microplastic
Mission: Spoiled meat
Mission: Malaria and artemisin
Mission: Celic disease
Mission: Space exploration
Mission: Our own project!
To simulate difficulties faced on real experiments, there were incompatibilities among some cards. Promoter and terminator cards were classified according to an arbitrary force from 1 to 5 (represented by the number of full colored stars on cards), suggesting that different sequences present different affinities and, so, act on transcription on different ways. Thus, weak promoters could just be used with strong terminators, and constitutive promoters must join weak terminators following precise indications on each card description. Some options of chassis may apply, but the real possibility of their use should be justified; besides, each chassis must be combined with a specific RBS (bacteria with bacteria RBS, yeast with yeast RBS and so on), pointing the existence of molecular patterns that turn a sequence specific to a certain organism. Finally, the coding region cards included a sort of key genes to solve the problems proposed; the gene originally used by the related iGEM team was our expectation for each mission, but we were open to new creative, wellsupported devices students might present.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Modelling Stability Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," On the other hand, as shown in figure 2, there are two functions namely nullclines which are obtained by setting $\frac{dx}{dt}=0$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}=0$, have 3 intersections. The intersections, as defined above, represent the equilibrium points of the system. Nonetheless, according to the phase portrait, not all the points are stable; in fact only 2 points are stable to which the arrows points, while one of the intersections is unstable from which the arrows point away, while at the unstable point, all the repressor proteins’ concentrations are of equal concentration. And upon slight perturbation at this point, the system switches to either one of the stable points. This property is shown pictorially that when it is perturbed slightly away from the unstable point, the arrows point to one of the stable points.  And the other intersections are considered stable due to their recovery ability under perturbation.
As expected, phase portrait can be applied to tri-stable toggle switch, which provides us another way to analyze the system stability pictorially.
Fig. 3a. Phase portrait of tristable system, under the condition of Hill’s coefficient, n = 2 and a = 8. Red arrows indicate the 3 intersection points of the three surfaces.
Fig. 3b. Cross-sectional diagram of 3a. Red arrows indicate the intersection points of the three surfaces.
We notice there are three intersections on the phase plane which corresponds to the three stable points identified by Poincare-Perron Theorem in the previous section: $\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\a\\0\end{pmatrix}$ , $\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\0\\a\end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix}x_s\\y_s\\z_s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0\\a\\a\end{pmatrix}$.
Accordingly, it shows that the system has three steady states, which conforms to our original design.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#FRED#Prototype_-_-_TEXT.html," dip switch for changing resistors values to alter measurement sensitivity, and had it milled onto a compact and durable circuit board with a diameter of only 6 cm. A software platform with a graphical user interface was developed to interface with the circuit and analyze the raw data.
The Hardware
Figure 2: Early design, featuring portable power, a variable dip switch, and LEDs
Our preliminary designs were relatively small, battery powered and had exposed electrodes that were inserted into a beaker of solution. One of our more seriously developed prototypes was a black box that housed the circuitry and the DAQ, featured power switches and LEDs to report on what stage of the experiment was currently underway. As we  continued to compact the potentiostat circuit, the designs continued to get smaller and more lightweight until the same circuit was concentrated onto a 6cm printer circuit board.
Another consideration we made pertained to containment of the bacteria. We developed a disposable cartridge system that allows for safe and easy sampling, while remaining inexpensive. One of the main features of our final prototype is the material we used. Rather than having our design manufactured, we used supplies and materials that were readily available around a molecular biology lab. The main shell of the biosensor is a cylindrical plastic Nalgene container, and the disposable cartridges have been built out of 15 mL falcon tubes.
Figure 4: Reloadable cartridge sytem.
The Nalgene shell houses the potentiostat circuit, two 9 V batteries, and a port for the insertion of cartridges. Each cartridge is a sealed vessel containing our bacteria. One end houses an electrode strip on the interior, and the connectors protrude from the exterior for connection to the circuit. There is also a one-way valve for injection of samples, so the field tests can be conducted without the bacteria escaping.
Figure 5: 9 V batteries connected via audio jack can be contained in the Nalgene shell.
The Software
To run our hardware, we developed a personalized software package with the MATLAB platform. Software was required to run the DAQ’s inputs and outputs, as well as to interpolate the data acquired and format it for the user to view.
Figure 6: Snippet of source code from the biosensor software package and a view of the GUI detecting PDP
There were several outputs that needed to be operated through the software, mainly the initial voltage sweep that was the basis of our potentiostat, as well as the two indicator LEDs.  All of this was possible through our simple, yet sophisticated software package.  Within this package the user can toggle a wide range of voltage"

Acid Resistance
The main goal of this part of our project is to enable our E. Coli we used to eradicate H. Pylori to become acid resistant in order to live in gastric juice's low pH (pH:2) microenvironment. Wild-type E. coli already have couple systems to show acid resistance up to a certain pH level (pH: 5). Among those systems, the most stable-working and efficient one is known as Glutamate Dependent Acid Resistance(GDAR) system. The most important protein of Gad system is GadE, which controls the synthesis of all other proteins. By overexpressing this protein, we aim to have our bacteria resistant enough to live in gastric juice for a while.
Background
Escherchia coli Natural Acid Resistance System
E. coli possesses four phenotypically distinct systems of acid resistance. These systems:
1. Glutamate dependent acid resistance system (GDAR)
2. Arginine dependent acid resistance system (ADAR)
3. Lysine dependent acid resistance system (LDAR)
4. Ornithine dependent acid resistance system (ODAR)
The most effective one of these systems is the glutamate dependent system so we decided to focus on glutamate dependent system (GDAR).
The GDAR system has in the acid resistance complex pathways. We decided to do the certain pathways that how to do acid resistance with our results of research.
EvgA is the most effective positive regulator of GDAR. (Efficiency: evgA>ydeO>gadE) But evgA takes part in countless number different genes regulation and cellular processes (2,6,7) and also most of this cellular processes are unclear. We cannot predict the results of the overexpression of evgA so we chose gadE and using by overexpression of gadE we can induce glutamate depended acid resistance system.
Briefly talk about the impact of the GadE on the mechanism.
The central activator is the LuxR-family member GadE (formerly known as YhiE). GadE"

Because VirA senses the vanillin concentration in the cytoplasm, it's important to estimate the diffusion of vanillin over the cell membrane. Also because vanillin is not actively removed from the extracellular medium, the rate of evaporation of vanillin is an important figure if we"

Recent studies found contamination of ground- and surface waters in at least 26 states, which serve as drinking water sources for more than 16 million people. 4 According to the EPA the estimated annual costs for public water systems to comply with a 4 microgram/L of perchlorate limit are 120 million dollar (in 2013). This is still less than the annual 320 million dollar costs of the arsenic rule of 10 microgram/L. 5 In Europe perchlorates have also been detected in crops. According to the European Commission the presence of perchlorate in fruits and vegetables is more widespread than initially expected, mostly due to the use of certain fertilizers. The toxic compounds have also been found in infant formulae, with mean concentrations of 10 microgram/kg. 6
Health
If you get exposed to perchlorates, many factors contribute to the toxicity. Such factors include the physical form of the compound, the dose, the duration of exposure and how you come in contact with the salt. On earth people might get exposed to the toxin by ingestion of contaminated food or drinking water, after which the perchlorates travel via the intestines to the bloodstream. If someone breaths in dust particles, such as the particles present on Mars, the toxin can enter the bloodstream via the lungs. Because the perchlorate ion is similar to the iodide ion, it can be taken up in place of it by the thyroid gland. By doing this, perchlorate disrupts the production of thyroid hormones, thereby disrupting the metabolism and indirectly other physiologic systems. 11 The reference dose for perchlorates has been set at 0.007 milligrams per kilo (24.5ppb). However, further studies are necessary to be able to completely answer all questions regarding toxicity.

Summary of our Education and Public Engagement Activities and Outputs
Our team attended the North East Big Bang Fair to talk to students and teachers about synthetic biology
We produced a report of our investigation into science communication: A Corpus Based Investigation Into Science Communication
We also created a set of guidelines for communicating synthetic biology: Breaking down the barriers: How should we communicate SynBio to the public?
We ran science communication seminars to share our work
A Blog was written: transform and translate .
Aims of our Education and Public Engagement Work
Our Education and Public Engagement work focused on understanding and encouraging dialogue about synthetic biology. To do this, we undertook a journey through science communication . We shared this work with the public- via blog posts, and scientists- in seminars which we held with research groups. Using techniques and influence from the humanities and social sciences, we analysed the language used in science communication, and used this research to produce our own guidelines for communicating synthetic biology to the public.
North-East Big Bang Fair
In July, we attended the North East Big Bang Fair- a large and exciting science fair. Over 2000 students and teachers attended, and we got the opportunity to talk to everyone about synthetic biology, iGEM, and our project! We had a few different activities to get the students and teachers involved with synthetic biology. ‘Build your own Biosensor’ is an interactive activity we developed to get the students thinking about synthetic biology independently.

Cytochrome_Engineering
1. Cloning of AP Cytochrome PACE: As the colony PCRs of this clone looked promising further expermients were carried out with it in the mean time. The aim of those experiments was to create AP variants with different ORIs. In order to do so, PCRs were performed to generate PCR products from Gibson overhang 5 to Gibson overhang 4 (3.6 kb fragment lacking the pBR ORI and AmpR). As those PCRs did not work, different conditions have been tested according to Phusion Flash polymerase trouble shooting protocol in order to optimize PCR conditions (different template concentrations, different cycler runs, touch down PCRs, Betain, DMSO, decreased amount of total cycles, different primer concetrations). After none of this worked either, further test PCRs with the template AP were conducted over the encoded chaperone protein, to see, whether the corresponding Gibson overhang was correct. The results indicated, that some of the APs carry the correct chaperone and some of the APs do not.
So the AP was send back in to GATC for sequencing with a different primer this time. Also the two other AP purifications were send in for sequencing to check, whether they fit better.
Sequencing results showed, that the AP clones from which the PCRs for the exchange of ORIs have been tried, is contaminated. The other two AP purifications showed no contamination as one of them showed clear results over the whole sequencing length, this one was used in all further experiments.
Since the aim of generating different AP variants could not be achieved yet, the next experiments should enable this aim. To increase the chance of success of the following PCRs, the 3.6 kb fragment was split in 2 smaller fragments (2.7 kb and 900 bp). Those fragments were meant to be amplified in separate PCR reactions. Only one of these PCR reactions succeeded and could be isolated from the agarose gel. For the other PCR the trouble shooting protocol was consulted again to optimize PCR conditions. Several different conditions (annealing temperature changed, annealing temperatur + primer concentration, cycler run have been tried also in combination but did not lead to the desired outcome.
Taking one step back, the PCR of the 900 bp fragment was repeated with a different AP template and finally worked. So the second fragment could be isolated from the agarose gel subsequently. The following Gibson assembly was conducted with both backbone fragments (Gib"

Therefore, by making this enzyme dysfunctional, we can redirect all cellular Protoporphyrin IX to the Chlorophyll synthesis pathway [7]. We have designed and synthesised 12 gBlocks, which we hypothesise are necessary for chlorophyll biosynthesis. Using the 3A assembly method, we ligated these genes to form two large operons; operon 1 is 10.6 kbp and has been characterised as functional and operon 2 is 6.2 kbp but has not yet been characterised. We hope that the ligation of these two operons will allow us to characterise a unified chlorophyll biosynthesis part. Once chlorophyll a is synthesised within the E. coli, Photosystem II will have the energy required to oxidise water - producing hydrogen ions and electrons.  Researchers are yet to successfully synthesise chlorophyll a in a non-photosynthetic organism. There may be unknown post-translational mechanisms that are essential for tetrapyrrole synthesis under variable environmental conditions [8].
Figure. 2 Protoporphyrin IX Pathway
Photosystem II Synthesis
Figure. 3 Photosystem II
Photosystem II (Fig. 3) is one of the main protein complexes involved in the photosynthesis pathway. The complex is comprised of photons, chlorophyll-binding proteins that work with a pair of chlorophyll molecules (known as the P680 reaction centre), pheophytin molecules, plastaquinones, water, and oxygen. Photosystem II is a multimeric protein complex that binds a pair of chlorophyll molecules at its core, which work together to supply electrons to the electron transport system. This is done by splitting water molecules via absorbed photons in the Photosystem II reactions centre [9].
Developed from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the Photosystem II complex used has 17 genes. These 17 genes, involved with the Photosystem II construction, are grouped into 5 operons. In operon 1 there are 3 genes: psbD, psbC, and psbA. psbA encodes the major subunit D1, located in the reaction centre that forms a heterodimer with the D2 subunit encoded by psbD [10]. Attached to D1-D2 heterodimer is CP43, encoded by psbC, which is a subunit of the proximal antennae in Photosystem II [11].

Virginia,2013,Team:Virginia#Chassis Improvements_-_-_TEXT.html,"inia species, invasin probably being the most widely known.  When present on E. coli, Ail confers a phenotype of attachment and invasion, though invasion is primarily limited to epithelial tissue. These qualities already make Ail an attractive protein for enhancing minicells role as a delivery vehicle, but they are not the primary reasons we chose to use it. Ail was also found to have both structural and functional homology with outer membrane proteins like Rck of Salmonella typhimurium, which grants high-level serum resistance. The serum resistance Ail grants to E. coli helps prevent the activation of the complement cascade—a primary defense mechanism of the immune system. The binding of complement proteins to bacteria usually spells their end: it triggers inflammation, draws phagocytic cells, facilitates phagocytosis, induces cell lysis, and coordinates opsonization by antibodies. By protecting our minicells from destruction, we can improve the chances of successful payload delivery and simultaneously reduce the risk of septic shock.
We are currently conducting a human complement binding assay to test the blocking efficacy of both Ail and PSA (see protocols).
The Ail plasmid we used for this purpose, pVM102, was a courteous gift of Dr. Virginia L. Miller.

In Vitro Tests
To test the functionality of our fructose construct, we cultured cells in environments with methanol. To determine if methanol was a viable carbon source for our cultured bacteria, growth assays were done in M9 media where the carbon sources were controlled.
Figure 2: Growth rate in M9 media with controlled carbon sources. IPTG was added at hour 5.5, when the OD of all the cultures approximately reached 0.6, n=3 for each group.
Methanol was added at various concentrations to an M9 media containing 0.2% glucose. Half the traditional glucose concentration was chosen to put cells in less than ideal conditions, giving them incentive to pick up methanol as a carbon source once the plasmids were activated. Figure 2 shows that an increase of methanol from 1% to 2% impairs the growth rate of cells. A comparison with the same growth conditions against 0% methanol was also done. The results of methanol toxicity can be seen in Figure 1 of the supplemental data section. Aside from the impaired growth rate with increased methanol concentration, the OD appears to be higher from hours 6.5 to 9.5 for the cultures induced with IPTG. Although we do expect to see an increase in growth rate as the cells are now able to metabolize the methanol present in the media, this minor increase is not statistically significant. Further tests have to be done to validate the functionality of our plasmid.
In collaboration with the University of Maryland Bioprocess Scale-Up Facility , we were able to acquire access to the 10 liter bioreactor. This instrument allowed for us to control for all of the major factors that influence bacterial growth including temperature, gas-flow rate, gas-composition, and agitation.
The bioreactor used to test our constructs.
Two major tests were run on fructose in the bioreactor in order to test its functionality. The first test was designed to determine the growth rate of our fructose construct in 1.5% methanol. The experimental group had the construct induced with IPTG to stimulate protein production, while the control group had no induction, to serve as a comparison for the effects of the induced proteins.
The second test was to see if our fructose construct was capable of surviving the stress of induction, methanol exposure, and the atmospheric conditions associated with landfills. Typically, landfill gas composition is approximately 50% methane and 50% carbon dioxide with trace amounts of oxygen"

Figure 13: How a man may assign his time in a project when getting integrated data by himself
In fact, this trouble is possible to be solved ---- by a dedicated software. If we could establish an integrated database, consisting of a unified standard of data composition and data format, we should find out the relationships among the data more easily. Besides, a data format standard makes it more convenient and engineering to store, reuse and combine the data. And engineering work is what computers are good at.
So our team desired to change the workflow into the figure below:
Figure 14: How a man may assign his time in a project when getting integrated data with a dedicated software.
Study the needs of ordinary bio-lovers
At the same time, we chatted with some students who are interested in biology work. They told us:
""We'll like the software if it shows details of each bio-project, in a way easy to understand.""
""It would be better if the software can provide a basic analysis of the work.""
""Could you develop a software which can recommend interesting projects of my own?""
...
We found that the needs above are the most popular. To achieve these goals, an enough huge and integrated database is critical. Of course, mathematical algorithms should be equipped with our software.
Studying the needs of biology labs
During the summer, we visited several biology laboratories of Sun Yat-sen University. Researchers warmly greeted us. Thanks to Prof. Lu Yongjun's help, we finished our interlab task and wet-lab validation in his laboratory. Meanwhile, we chatted with the researchers and conducted a small survey of their project idea.
By talking with researchers working in the lab, we were surprised that lack of ideas is one of the common problems when they work on a synthetic biology project.
“A good beginning is half done. That is to say, a good idea of a genetic circuit design is half done of the whole project.” A researcher named Dong told us.
Since ideas are so significant to a project, where do researchers' ideas usually come from? We did a small survey of researchers in several labs.
Figure 15: The sources distribution of researchers' project idea.
From the figures above, we learned that the majority of researchers’ idea source is professional research articles and journals ---- they work before, but a novel idea may arouse from them if the researcher reuses their essence and aims to an accessible direction. However, each paper usually describes its design in the author’s own style and standard, which is usually hard to understand and absorb its design ideas for one"
BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," it is really fascinating. I wish I can join in this group next                         year.
How time files! The orienteering has already ended. In this lively morning, we                         walked through the campus. We visited the stela in BNU, made new friends, looked around the lab                         and understood the main key of iGEM. We learned a lot today, and the high tech equipment really                         impressed me! I feel I am getting close to the mysterious scientific research. I hope to become                         a part of iGEM and helping others.
The combination of the cross-country and the iGEM experiment is full of fun. And                         as a sophomore student, I am very curious to iGEM, and I want to know more about it. I have                         learned the detailed introduction to the laboratory and the project from seniors and get the third place prize. I am happy to participate in this activity! I always want to get a chance to                         train my laboratory experiment skills and do the experiment in the lab but I didn't find the                         opportunity to do that, and this is one of the reasons of my participation. Finally thanks for                         taking the time to further our understanding of iGEM. Happy :)

Click the operon to be linked to the phsABC part page!
The phsABC genes from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 encode thiosulfate reductase, which catalyzes the stoichiometric production of hydrogen sulfide and sulfite from thiosulfate for heavy metal removal by precipitation. Within a separate bacterium from that containing the mer operon construct, This system allows us to extend our heavy metal bioremediation device to be applicable to a wide range of heavy metals in addition to mercury in both ionic and organic form. The phsABC operon encodes three open reading frames (ORFs), designated phsA, phsB, and phsC. Based on sequence homology to formate dehydrogenase-N, it is predicted that thiosulfate reductase behaves in a similar fashion. The PhsA subunit is predicted to be a peripheral membrane protein active site bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) molybdenum (MGD) cofactor. PhsC is an integral membrane protein that anchors the other two subunits to the membrane, and contains the site for menaquinol oxidation and two heme cofactors located at opposite sides of the membrane. PhsB is predicted to possess four iron-sulfur centers that transfer electrons between PhsC and PhsA.  was shown to have the highest catalytic activity in the IPTG- inducible plasmid pSB74.

Motivation
Crystallin damage is the chemically significant way to quantify cataract severity (Cui X.L. 1993).                             Physicians grade cataracts on a LOCS scale from 0 to 6, with 2.5 usually being the threshold for surgery. This standard method to determine cataract severity is through optical analysis, which is not applicable for chemical analysis. (Chylack)
The purpose of this model is simple. In Model 2, we find the amount of GSR to maintain in order to ensure a cataract remains below a certain severity. Before we can do that, we must find a way to relate the physical definition of cataract severity (LOCS) to the chemical definition (crystallin damage) in Model 1.
We use literature data to relate LOCS to absorbance, which is still a physical property, but is frequently used in the lab. Then, with experimental data, we relate crystallin damage to absorbance, thus completing the link between the chemical and the physical definitions.
Quantification of Crystallin Damage
Crystallin damage is difficult to quantify, as few literature sources attempt to quantify it. We propose a mathematical way to measure crystallin damage based on how complete the degradation reaction of crystallin is complete depending on the amount of H2O2.
Crystallin damage depends on two factors: (1) the amount of H2O2 crystallin is exposed to, and (2) the time crystallin is exposed to H2O2. Therefore, we can mathematically quantify this by integrating the amount of H2O2 in the crystallin over time:                                 \[c.d.(t) = \int_{0}^{\infty} [H_2O_2]_t dt\]
We define one unit of crystallin damage to be the equivalent damage caused by exposing the amount of crystallin in the human eyes 1 M of H2O2 for 1 hour, with units M-h. We make an assumption here, described fully in “Assumptions” #1.
Note that 1 M-h is a significant amount of crystallin damage, because the concentration of crystallin in the eyes is extremely small, in the neighborhood of 10 uM (Fraunfelder 2008). In addition, the eyes have a naturally occurring antioxidant system that lowers the concentration of H2O2, so it"

It’s possible that your idea is ahead of time and in a few years when the measuring technology will make progress your kit will be able to be used to measure the presence of celiac. As far as the enzyme activity goes, in my opinion it has better chance of succeeding, it is possible that the thermophile proteins created an interesting and unexpected process for you, it may even work very well”.
Dekel: “do you think the product will be useful?”
Dr. Maayan: “If it will be good then yes, however, I have not performed an extensive market survey. In my opinion and to what I know from friends or parents of celiac patient children they would be very happy to have a reliable device to check gluten because they don’t trust foods labeled “gluten free” or something similar would make them extremely pleased to check themselves, of course in restaurants as well because it is a small device you can take with you everywhere. In my eyes the idea is fantastic, what’s more is that you can use the same technology to detect other substances other than celiac.”
Dekel: “What is your opinion on the fact that the Ministry of Education does not acknowledge children with celiac?”
Dr. Maayan: “First of all this is a topic I am not familiar enough with, however, at large, I think that the educational system as a line of guidance needs to allow children overcome any kind of disability in order to succeed in fitting in with the system, celiac is a kind of health disability that needs acknowledgment and things need to be done in order to help them fit in so they can eat like they should and go to school without fear that something may happen, I don’t know what needs to be done to make that happen and I also don’t know how easy it is to solve it, and how easy it will be for them not to be exposed to gluten.”
At the end of the conversation we spoke to Dr. Maayan openly about the scientific collaboration need as is with Igem. After the meeting with him we understood that collaboration does not characterize and basically known in the science world and that the world of science has less interest in sharing knowledge, unlike in the world of Igem.

Figure 14 shows the successful DsbA-directed secretion of DNase across both cell membranes.
A is the supernatant of uninduced E. coli MG1655 BBa_K729004 [pBAD], whilst B is the supernatant of 0.2% induced E. coli MG1655 BBa_K729004 [pBAD]. The band is approximately 21 kDa, corresponding to the size of DsbA-DNase.
Figure 15: Expression host MG1655 BBa_K729004 [pBAD] biofilm growth assay
Figure 15 shows the effect of inducing the expression of BBa_K729004 [pBAD] on the ability of the host to form biofilms. The control (MG1655, pBAD/HisB, 0.2% ara) and MG1655, BBa_K729004[pBAD], 0% ara are both able to grow biofilms, as shown by the intensity of the crystal violet staining. When BBa_K729004[pBAD] is expressed, the intensity of the crystal violet staining is reduced, showing a diminished ability to grow biofilm. This data suggests that the secretion of DNase is able to inhibit biofilm formation.
Conclusion
Through our experimental work, we have successfully created and submitted 12 sequence-confirmed BioBrick parts, 7 of which we rigorously characterized for antibacterial and/or antibiofilm function. We validated that Art-175 and Microcin S are both potent antibacterials, the former of which is shown to be even capable of killing antibiotic-resistant biofilm-encased bacteria. On the antibiofilm side of things, we not only showed that the enzymes of interest, DNase and DspB, were successfully exported across both membrane layers of E. coli following our modification of them with secretion tags, but also proved that the enzymes are able to refold properly post-secretion such that they retain their enzymatic function.
In conclusion, we achieved our aim of creating bacterial ""living therapeutics"" - strains of bacteria genetically engineered to secrete functional antibiofilm and antimicrobial proteins towards the treatment"

Quantification by Flow CytoMetry (FCM)
From the result of fluorescence microscopy, the expression of HRH4-mCherry fusion proteins can be observed roughly, for quantifying the expression level of HRH4-mCherry, FCM is performed. From the result, a distinct peak value can be observed. Considering the fluorescence microscopy result that most of HRH4 are correctly located, this data does provide us a reliable probability distribution of total H4 protein expression variance between yeast individuals. Finally, the probability distribution of functional H4 receptor expression variance can refer to the total expression probability distribution we get from experiments.
Fig.4 Flow Cytometry result of HRH4-mCherry fusion protein expression
The test of this composite part set the foundation of our project, it proves that HRH4 can be expressed in high level under the trigger of a constitutive promoter-ADH1 promoter. Besides, the HRH4 can locate in the yeasts’ membrane without adding other sequence. It can be part of the evidence that our HRH4 is functional. Then the Flow CytoMetry result provide us a reliable probability distribution of total H4 protein expression variance between yeast individuals, which is significant for modeling.

Therapeutic Biofilm
Introduction
The IBD can often become a chronic disease and is difficult to treat. Therefore, ‘cocktail’ therapy by combining different strategies may very helpful to patients. Similar approaches have been used successfully in treating AIDS and many types of cancer. Other than aforementioned secreted EGF, we are also interested in applying therapeutic biofilms to treat gut diseases, since it is stable and programmable.

The biofilms are organized communities of cells ensconced in a network of extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and other biomolecular components[1]. Although the researches of biofilm have focused on preventing their formation and promoting"
Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Protocol_-_-_TEXT.html," 100 uM solution of primers by resuspending with 10 ul water for each ng DNA in the tube. For example, if there are  38.2 nmol of primer then by adding 382 µl of H2O, a 100 µM primer stock is created.
3. Incubate master stock primers newly suspended in water for 10 minutes.  Mix well before making working stock dilutions.
4. Create a 10 uM solution of primers as a “working solution.” This reduces the number of freeze/thaw cycles that the master primer stock goes through and reduces the chances of contaminating the primary source for the primer. Dilute the primer master stock in a sterile microcentrifuge tube 1:10 with water.
5. Store stock solutions and working solutions at -20 degrees C.
Steady State Growth and Fluorescence Measurement
Purpose: One of the ways that gene expression can be measured is by fluorescence. By measuring the intensity of a fluorescent protein, it is possible to predict the expression of a gene that is kept on the same plasmid. One of the ways that measuring fluorescence is useful in the codon optimization project is that the gene that is trying to be optimized is a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Using a TECAN, it is possible to see which variations of GFP have the most expression while keeping the concentration of cells the same for all of the variations.
Procedure:
1.  A standard 96-well microplate containing 200 µL of LB media and the desired antibiotic was inoculated from single colonies. A non-fluorescent cell culture was also inoculated. The cultures were allowed to grow overnight at 37 C at 250 rpm until an OD of 2.0 was reached.
Note: Only the inner 60 wells are used for measurement because the outer wells can have media evaporate and this would affect the results. The outer wells were filled with blank media to prevent this from happening to inner wells.
2.  A fresh 96-well transparent, flat bottom microplate wwas filled with 198 µL M9 minimal media. Microplate wells were inoculated by overnight cultures using a 1:100 dilution.
3. The new microplate was placed inside the spectrophotometer and incubated at 37 C at 250 rpm.
4. When a culture reached an OD between 0.15 and 0.20, 10-20µL samples of each culture were transferred to a fresh, transparent, flat bottom microplate containing 180-190"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html,", as they were completely covered by red colonies, with only a few white ones. Many of the white colonies from the previous week had become red. Eight overnight cultures were also performed so that a restriction digest could be done on the CAR colonies, to see if the part was there. These overnight cultures were prepared with the Kan antibiotic. Another ligation was done with the three combinations of cut inserts and vectors: CAR with PET, NPT (E/P) with pSB1C3 , and NPT (X/P) with pSB1C3 . Restriction digests were performed on the CAR overnight colonies with AscI and HindIII, and when the gel was run, a single lane was shown to contain both the CAR gene and PET vector, as shown below:
As shown in the gel above, lane 3 indicates 2 bands, the uppermost at about 5.4kb, identifying as PET. This single lane also contains a clear band of CAR, a bit under the 5000bp mark, at 4690bp. The ladder used was 1 kb plus.
This successful result allowed us to proceed with mutagenesizing the 6 illegal cut sites of CAR, including: 2 PstI sites, 1 EcorI site, and 3 NotI sites, with the primers that we had designed. Two additional colony PCRs of NPT were performed, but unfortunately a band indicating NPT was not visible in any of the traisl, even when an additional plate of both the NPT (E/P) and NPT (X/P) restriction digests were ligated and transformed. Very few white colonies could be seen on any of the transformations, but we were determined to continue trying. We then attempted to mutagenesize the first illegal cut site of CAR, which would be a PstI site. The mutagenesis primers needed to be diluted and stock solutions were made. Then, we attempted to mutagenize the PstI site of CAR with that site's specific primers, using various concentrations of template DNA (5ng, 20ng, 50ng). We used the KAPA system to perform this plasmid amplification, using the thermocycler settings of the Desulfurization team. The mutagenesis PCR would be run over the weekend to hopefully have successful results.
Week 16 (August 13 - August 17)
This week, the attempted PstI mutagenesis of CAR ws run on a gel. Unfortunately, amplification was unsuccessful, but we had an idea for why this"

This is the first year that SZU_iGEM enter this competition.
SUSTC-Shenzhen has an experience in the competition last year and they had a good result. Thus, we invited them to a meetup in Shenzhen University on 19th July. They gave us some advices in how to registry a team and explain the medal criteria. Also, they suggested us to add a suicide system in our project. As feedback, we gave them instruction on lab safety and experimental skills. For example, we instructed them to use the flow cytometry and freeze-dry the sample in the PCR tube. During this meetup, we exchanged many ideas and also had great fun. We want to thank SUSTC-Shenzhen a lot for giving us so many useful instructions and helps.
ETZ Zurich invited us to participate in their survey related to complexity. Our team members completed the survey. As feedback, ETZ Zurich gave us a badge.

Purdue,2014,Team:Purdue#The Solution#Gene Design_-_-_TEXT.html," among others. nas1 was selected because, in a previous experiment, it was able to, alone, produce NAS.[xv] naat1 from corn was selected because a previous experiment revealed that the rice naat1 gene encodes functional NAAT and is expressed in cells of Fe-deficient leaves, strongly suggesting that it is involved in phytosiderophores production and sufficient to produce NAAT on its own, without other naat genes.[xvi]
Killswitch
The killswitch was included as a safety precaution so that the modified bacteria could be easily killed. We wanted to include the kill switch because the modified bacteria are intended to be released into fields, not kept in a confined environment like a laboratory. With a kill switch, the bacteria could still be killed out in the field if they were not working as expected or if they spread farther than desired. Finding a promoter for the kill switch was complicated by the fact that most kill switches rely on things such as dramatically altering the pH or exposing the bacteria to red light, but this project required something that could get to the bacteria underground and is economically feasible to spread across an area as big as a field while not harming native plants or the natural soil microbiome. Lactose was chosen because it fulfills all of these requirements and would not work as a food source for the Bacillus subtilis.[xvii] The holin Hyb5 was selected because it is effective on Bacillus subtilis at neutral pH around field temperature and had fewer base pairs than its counterpart, the endolysin Lyb5[xviii].
Biochemical Pathway
Phytosiderophores are not directly produced by cells but instead formed from methionine being chemically altered in a specific order by four different enzymes. L-methionine is altered by S-adenosylmethione synthase (SAM synthase) to have an adenosyl bonded to a sulfer on the L-methionine, producing S-adenosylmethione (SAM). From there, nicotianamine synthase (NAS) catalyzes the trimerization of SAM molecules to form nicotianamine (NA). Nicotianamine aminotransferase ­(NAAT) catalases the conversion of nictotianamine to 3”deamino-3”-oxonicotianamine (a 3”-keto intermediate) and L-glutamate using 2-oxoglutarate. The 3”-carbon of the keto intermediate is reduced by deoxymugineic acid"

The mechanism autotransporters, has been examined using a single-chain antibody (scFv) as a reporter passenger domain to monitor the translocation process. Fusion of a scFv to the IgA protease allowed us to investigate the passage of the chimeric protein through the periplasm, its insertion into the outer membrane and the movement of the N-terminal moiety towards the cell surface. The binding activity of the scFv to its target antigen  entirely rely on the formation of disulphide bonds.
The leader sequence of C-IgAP is cleaved at the membrane by a signal peptidase, releasing the mature polyprotein into the periplasm. When in the periplasm, the beta-domain of the protein inserts into the outer membrane to form a beta-barrel structure. After formation of the beta-barrel pore, the passenger domain is translocated to the cell surface through the pore. Once at the cell surface, several possibilities may occur:
the protein remains intact as a large polyprotein that has a carboxy-terminal membrane-bound domain and an aminoterminal domain extending into the environment.
the protein either gains autoproteolytic activity and cleaves itself or it is cleaved by an outer membrane protease, but in this case the passenger domain remains in contact with the cell surface via noncovalent interactions with the b-domain.
the passenger domain gains its autoproteolytic activity or is cleaved by an outer membrane protease and is released into the environment.[1]

We used the Synergy MX II multi-well plate reader from the BioTek company for our measurements. GFP was excited at 488 nm and emission was measured at 509 nm. for mOrange, the excitation wavelength was 529 nm and emission was detected at 562 nm.
Figure 21. The fluorescence is normed to the optical density, which equals the cell number. A: Intensity of GFP fluorescence decreases with inceasing glyphosate concentration(0–2 mM glyphosate). B: Intensity of mOrange fluorescence increases with increasing glyphosate concentration 0–2 mM glyphosate).
This competition assay enables us to calculate the concentration of glyphosate in samples from people that are curious, how much glyphosate is in their soil.
4.2. Competition with β–galactosidase expressing strains
Another approach using competition assays is to use enzymatic indication systems. Therefore, we used the strain BP235 (ΔgltT ΔgltP) and the strain BP193 (palf4::lacZ) (12). As previously described, BP235 is characterized by high-level glyphosate resistance, while BP193 resembles the wild type despite the lacZ gene. The promoter palf4 is an artificial one and harbors a perfect consensus sequence for B. subtilis and a ribosome binding site. This leads to constitutive expression of the lacZ gene and to blue cells if the medium is supplemented with X-Gal. Cultures of both strains in CS-Glc minimal medium without glyphosate were mixed to obtain a 1:1 ratio of both strains and incubated with increasing glyphosate concentrations (0 - 5mM) for 24 h (Figure 22).
Figure 22. Cell mixture (1:1) of strains BP193 and BP235 were incubated with increasing glyphosate concentrations (0–5 mM). Strain BP193 harbors the lacZ gene behind an artificial promoter, but does not tolerate glyphosate in contrast to strain BP235. The intensity of the blue color decreases with increasing glyphosate concentration. Strains BP193 and BP235 were also incubated without glyphosate as a control.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of human clinical trials, ethical aspects are judged on the quality of the scientific protocol. It would not be ethical to use humans as tests if researchers are not certain to have exploitable results. Furthermore, the question of consent also needs to be adressed. While we cannot ask an animal or a plant for their consent, ethical commites insist on having a proof of consent in the European Union. This is particularly important since Anglo-Saxon scientific reviews refuse to publish papers if the have not been approved by an ethics commite. We can ask ourselves if the importance researchers give to Bioethics is truly personal or if they do not regard it as only constraint for publication.
When it comes to bacteria however, what point of view do we have? Humans generally have a vision of the world which is anthropocentric, we consider ourselves superior to other organisms. For example, during the Nuremberg trials against Nazi doctors, Carl Brandt (health minister and part of the German military) was sentenced for having lead experiments on humans in concentration camps believing that he was superior to them. When do these acts become wrong? Recently, in China, certain tests are being done on human embryos. Where should we draw the line for embryonic therapy? In Europe, questions of ethics slows down research on such topics but in Asia, research seams to be without limits.
How can we define intellectual property?
In sciences, the question of intellectual property is recurrent. Concerning synthetic biology, all of the objects used can be patented. Among these are genes, plasmids, biobricks, genetic circuit broads, software modeling of mechanisms etc. However, these aren't necessarily considered as dicoveries which we can define as a revelation of what was previously unknown, but already exist. Indeed, the scientific discovery is supported by publications which are in free access for who wants it. So, we can consider it is a part of the common knowledge, ownerless.  However, the creation is a process or a product which brings a solution for a particular problem. So it is a new element, previously a lacking element. An invention is supported by a patent.
In our case, in synthetic biology, the invention can be a whole organism, a gene or a DNA sequence. The National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE) tries to delimitate these processes by making it impossible to take ownership of organisms which already exist making sure that a discovery doesn’t become an invention. Also, the patentability of an element won’t be possible when it was extracted of its natural environment to live in a synthetic environment, or an element which was reproduced in a"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,", traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

Observations:  Upon adding lysis buffer, the solution appeared very milky/cloudy.  Perhaps too much cells were used.  The final supernatant had a moderate yellow tint.  Both the pellet, and the supernatant were stored in the -20C.  It is possible that the pipettes used may be erroneous.
Conclusions:  BCA will be used to measure protein concentration tomorrow, in order to determine how much of the His-resin to use."

Looked at plates from transformation yesterday. MP, SP, and DM all had colony growth but DT did not. On the plates from the transformation earlier this week DT began to grow colonies. We are unsure if this is contamination or actually a colony. We then used the three plates that worked and the older DT plate to run a colony PCR and create liquid cultures. We will then run 2 ul of the colony PCR on a gel to determine if the correct number of base pairs (1000 base pairs) is being amplified with VF2 and VR and we performed the Gibson correctly.
●
The gel revealed that all but DT worked using the PCR and the correct band ~1000 base pairs was amplified. Because of this result we ordered sequencing on all 4 of these samples to see how they compare to the sequence we think we are getting. We PCR clean used the colony PCR and used VF2 and VR for sequencing.

This gel was run on our 4 chromoprotein-His-tag colony PCR products. The gel order from left to right: ladder, SP, DM, MP, DT. The first three columns of chromoproteins see a correctly amplified region around 1000 base pairs. DT does not have this band present and we believe the sequencing data will show we do not have the correct product.

We ran a small scale protein extraction on the liquid cultures we started yesterday. 4 of them are CP, PP, TP, and VP with both cellulose binding domains and his-tags and 4 of them are BB, VV, LO, SO which are chromoproteins with His-tags. We then performed a lumio greed detection and ran on a SDS page gel and imaged to see if our his-tag was present in both sets of these chromoproteins.
