Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," need to be cooler.” Sam believes communicating science involves all platforms, “why aren’t more people live streaming, why aren’t more people snapchatting from lab? Often the science videos you see are so boring, science is exciting, and we should try to communicate that.""
“Scientists should be more open by talking to journalists. When a journalist calls, you [a scientist] should welcome it. Scientists, many of whom are partly funded by the public, have a responsibility to talk openly about what they are doing. I appreciate that this is a complicated subject and so that there is no easy fix.”
“You’ve got to put your story in human terms so the people who don’t understand the science will understand. So first set the scene, then get into what you’re doing, and do it in terms of what people might understand…So start there, start with storytelling and set the context. If you want to get into the science of it, you don’t have to teach them everything about the science. You can introduce them to the science, and if they want to know more then give it to them. The journalist has to understand that language and translate it over here for the audience who doesn’t speak that language. We are translators."" How can the Public tell when Science-Based Media is Sketchy?
“That’s really tough. See it’s tough to put the burden on the reader to go look it up. Where would they even look? That being said, any absolutes or anything that sounds too certain is probably fake. Science is all about probabilities. The biggest warning sign is if the article isn’t cited. That’s a pretty standard thing in journalism; [the journalist] should always mention the study.” Other things to look for are if the authors of the article are quoted. ""That’s a pretty good sign the article is good.""
“Going to other popular media accounts to check their portrayal of the story. If multiple sources are reporting it the same way than that is a strong indication what they are reporting it factually correct. The biggest red flag is when something just sounds wrong. Unfortunately, we all have prejudges towards what we want to believe and therefore you may not just be reading the news but an interpretation of the news.”
“As long as it’s a notable publisher or university, then you are doing well. Again, it’s the source. It doesn’t matter where you’re getting it, you always have to look at the source. If it’s coming from a reputable organization then it’s probably fine. It is important to identify if you are reading an opinion piece, or something sponsored by a company with a hidden"

This Lamda cI repressor has a cI857 mutation that results in denaturation of the repressor when the temperature is raised from 30 to 42°C, thereby allowing lambda promoter expression.
When the temperature is raised, typically to 42°C, the functionality of the protein is lost and the cI repressor is no longer able to bind to the operators on its promoter. Therefore, lambda promoter expression increases.
Composite
Lambda promoter (cIts responsive) is different from the common lambda promoter in that it is able to be repressed by the temperature sensitive cI protein (BBa_K200011). When it is not being repressed after 42°C induction, it acts as a strong promoter.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Human Practices#impact report_-_-_TEXT.html," they have evolved alongside bacteria, meaning they are more predisposed to counter certain bacterial defense systems. Plus, unlike antibiotics some phages have evolved mechanisms to penetrate biofilms formed by bacterial aggregates, thus making them easier to disband with phage therapy compared to antibiotic treatment. Phages are also very specific in nature meaning commensal gut bacteria would not be infected by a potential phage therapy. Only a small dose of phages would be needed as they continuously replicate as they interact with their host bacterium [14, 15].
As with any solution there are likely to be drawbacks, as is also the case with phage therapy. For one, specificity acts as a double edged sword. On the one hand only the desired bacterium is likely to be infected, however finding the right phage can be time consuming and potentially lead to the patient’s condition worsening. It should also be recognized that it is an unfamiliar treatment, as such, negative long term effects to these remedies could be a potential complication in the future [14].
Our project
Today phage therapy focuses on utilizing lytic phages as a treatment however, our project centers on synthetically engineering a temperate phage to suppress the toxin production in Clostridium difficile. Our engineered phage would integrate genetic constructs designed to reduce toxin production at a transcriptional and translational level in the bacterium, thereby allowing Clostridium difficile to remain in the gastrointestinal tract as a commensal bacterium.
The rationale for this is that by keeping the C. difficile present, they can take up space in the gut and potentially outcompete other more harmful opportunistic pathogens that might try and invade the gut during a state of dysbiosis [16]. Additionally, by not rapidly lysing the C. difficile cells the release of relatively high concentrations of intracellular components containing potentially harmful enzymes and other substrates cannot interfere with the gastrointestinal tract and cause harm. This could have been a potential outcome if our project focused on using a lytic phage. A potential flaw with our lysogenic phage therapy, is the potential for unwanted horizontal transfer of certain genes. However, this is unlikely because the phage used is specific for C. difficile.
We have integrated two different DNA constructs into our lysogenic phage delivery system that both aim to suppress the toxins C. difficile synthesizes during pathogenesis. The first construct uses an antisense RNA based mechanism, which is able to hybridize to the toxin mRNA transcripts, inhibiting translation and eventually be subject to degradation by enzymes. The second construct is a dead Cas9 protein, that binds to the promoter regions of these toxins"

This summer, we collaborated with nine 2018 iGEM teams for a better progress in project of each other. We received help from 2 teams, SCU-China and Jiangnan in equipment and chassis cells. We also help 2 teams, CDHSU-CHINA and CSU_CHINA set up their team and mentor their work. Besides, we developed cooperative relationship with 4 team, BNU-China, NEFU_China, BUCT-China and UESTC-Software to fulfill our project. Moreover, it was the most fantastic thing that we have a spark with NCKU_Tainan of combining our project together and making use of our side product as well as solving their problems of xylose resource.

 NCKU_Tainan
It was the most fantastic thing that we have a spark with NCKU-Tainan of making use of our side product as well as solving their problems of xylose resource. Straw was a bio waste in agriculture while it wasn't easy to decompose. Our work successfully solved this problem with synthetic biology. We degrading straw into useful raw materials, which are glucose, xylose, ferule acid, and lignin. In addition, we aimed to convert glucose into butanol and hydrogen. But it still remains some problems of making use of our side product. Fortunately, the team, NCKU-Tainan contact with us and searching for solutions together. We also find that they met some problem during cost evaluation and carbon footprint when designing the whole CO2 utilization system.
So they came up with the idea of combining our project together and end up building a completely eco-friendly system with negative carbon footprint. Xylose is one of the side product produced of us during straw degradation, it can be extracted and utilized in their system. At the same time, concerning the synthesis of xylose may produce greenhouse gas and chemicals, they would like to obtain xylose produced via biological method. So they can integrate their system at the downstream of our system.

Introduction :
Setting up our project, we involved local Indian citizens and expert authorities in India to understand their needs and how a synthetic biology approach addresses them in an accepted way. They shared with us how they perceive our work and their concerns, comments and questions. Our project has largely benefited from these exchanges.
The dish choice. It is easy to understand why we chose idli; it is a very popular fermented dish eaten daily all around India (see Graphic below) and loved because of its particular taste and texture. It is a way for us to celebrate and promote Indian culture without disrupting it.
Authorities and Experts :
We exchanged with lawmakers and food safety authorities to get their views on our project and tune it accordingly.
Contact person: Dr. A. K. Sharma, on the behalf of the Chairperson and CEO of Food Safety and Standard Authority in India (FSSAI).
Advice: Choose the right microorganisms so they can survive and work together, along with the use of critical genes for the vitamin pathways. Concerning the law, he said that there is currently no authorisation for GMO microorganisms in the Indian Food regulation and if we want to have our product in India, its safety needs to be established.
Contact person: Dr. Sunita Grover, principal scientist and head of the Dairy Microbiology Division at the National Dairy Research Institute
Advice: Use food grade vector system to make sure our product is safe for consumption and to reduce issues arising from the  use of genetically modified bacteria. She had concerns about the compatibility of the different species  living in fermentation batter. To finish, her major  concern is safety. Our project needs to undergo phase I and II trials in order to assess safety and scientifically proven health benefits.  She was surprised and really enthusiastic towards the project because malnutrition is a serious problem in India and many children suffer from it our project.

#Korean Regional Meetup  8/15 @ Lotte hotel Athen’s Garden
The three Korean teams gathered together and presented their own projects. We had an opportunity to show our idea and receive comments during Q&A sessions. Particularly, one overgraduate team called Korea_U_Seoul team asked us why we used E.coli instead of other microorganisms. We answered that it is for accessibility. Since our project is headed toward the welfare of farmers, we focus on the technology that is “available” and “easy” for them to use.
We also offered some opinions about two other teams. Three Korean teams collaborated to achieve better at Giant Jamboree. It was indeed a great time.
#i GEM mentors
Gha Young Lee, David Brown, Ricardo Chavez  We have applied for Pilot Mentorship Program, and were able to meet three great mentors who had experienced Giant Jamboree. In particular, Gha Young helped us a lot. She shared her experience about preparing for Giant Jamboree. We can’t wait until meeting her at Boston :) Also, we have skyped twice during the summer vacation( 7/1/15 10AM and 8/17/15 11 PM in Korean time) and got advice about part submission, human practice and the purpose of our project.
b. communicating with Bio Ethanol Research Institutes
#Jeon-nam University Bioethanol Research Institute 8/19
We started exchangin emails with JU Bioethanol Research Institute on August 19th. We not only introduced our bioengineering project but also Our questions were related to the problems that this institute encounters during their research. It answered that the economic feasibility and construction of infrastructure were the main problem it often faces.

""No man is an island"" is not just a well-worded phrase by John Donne but a fact. We could not have competed in this year's iGEM competition without the help of many individuals. Thus, we sincerely want to say ""thanky you"" to all the people who have supported us over the course of this year's iGEM competition and previous iGEM competitions.
First of all we want to thank our instructors Professor Dr Kohlbacher (Quantitative Biology Center) and Professor Dr Nordheim (Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology) for supporting our team since 2012 by providing us with financial and technical support and advising us when we were searching a project idea.
Then we also want to express our sincerest thanks to Professor Dr Jansen (Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry) who has most generously provided us with a modern laboratory and modern lab equipment for the third consecutive time this year. He receives our thanks for discussing technical, legal, and organizational problems and questions with us on a nearly weekly basis.
Next, we are most grateful to Dr Elisabeth Fuss , a researcher located at the Inferfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, who has supported our iGEM-Team since 2012 in many ways, has supported us with plasmids and enzymes this year, and helped us with organizing our School-Project .
Then we also want to thank Professor Dr Schwarzer for generously allowing us to use his lab hardware for synthesising peptides (like SpyTag and C-intein). Our sincere thanks also go to Professor Kalbacher who has supported our project by kindly providing us with his hardware for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)."

In 2007, the UC Berkeley iGEM team was able to show that cells lost their ability to reproduce but did not lyse upon induction with arabinose (2). The University of Lethbridge 2011 iGEM team wished to further characterize this part to degrade the genomic DNA of E. coli in order to have a functional chassis for our tailings pond clean-up kit without the risk of DNA contamination. In this way, tight control and regulation over our engineered bacterial cells is possible.

Analysis of Genomic DNA
Materials and Methods
E. coli DH5α cells were grown and induced to overexpress one of three samples: BamHI construct induced with arabinose (10µM) at an OD600 of 0.6, BamHI construct uninduced, non-BamHI construct induced with arabinose (10µM) at OD600 of 0.6. Cells were grown in LB media with 100 ng/mL ampicillin.
Qiagen Blood and Tissue Kit was used to isolate the genomic DNA of gram-negative bacteria. A 0.8% agarose gel was ran at 150 V for 90 minutes to separate the genomic DNA of E. coli DH5α cells collected at different time points (pre-induced and 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, and 3 hr post induction) for all three samples. One absorbance unit of cells were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to monitor cellular protein levels.

July Week 1: Plasmid Amplification
We chose pRSFDuet-1, pACYCDuet-1 and pCDFDuet-1 as expression vectors and pBluescript II KS(+) as the connector. These plasmids were amplified for further construction.
July Week 2: Plan Making
We intended to construct the gene of our fusion protein, ssDsbA-mRFP-HL-Lgt-FL-TAL-His Tag, using overlap PCR, enzyme digestion and ligation. After careful consideration, we decided to connect ssDsbA-mRFP-HL-Lgt as one part of this fusion protein and FL-TAL-His Tag as another, so that they could be connected together.
July Week 3: Construction of Part 1
We constructed the first part, ssDsbA-mRFP-HL-Lgt with overlap PCR and ligated it into the pBluescript II KS(+). Then we obtained more plasmids through transformation, colony picking and plasmid extraction. After that, we verified them with digestion identification and sequencing. Sequencing results showed accurate construction.
July Week 4: TAL Connection
In order to construct the second part, we had to obtain the TAL we needed using bioparts from 2012 Freiburg iGEM team. But unfortunately, we didn't get any positive result.
August Week 1-2: PCR Optimization
Because of the negative results, we decided to adjust some PCR parameters, including the annealing temperature, template concentration and cycle number. Test the conditions for the PCR.                             Connected TAL, transform, colony picking plasmid extraction and digestion identification.  Find with our electrophoresis band. Expression vectors and connector plasmid are confirmed by sequencing.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

THE RECEPTOR
INTRODUCTION
Very recently, a new peptide signaling system was discovered in B. subtilis phages that allows the phages to decide whether to lyse their host or integrate inside it as a prophage [1]. This signaling system, called arbitrium, was the first of its kind and consists of a signaling peptide called AimP that is sensed by an intracellular receptor, AimR. The AimR tested in [1] was derived from phage phi3T and was shown to be an activator of a gene called AimX in the absence of the AimP peptide. Upon binding, AimR from phi3T (phAimR)no longer binds to the AimX promoter and consequently, the AimX gene was repressed [1]. This AimR-AimP system was shown to be very specific and orthogonal to other AimR-AimP pairs, since AimP peptides from other phages did not bind to phAimR [1], making this system potentially very attractive for engineering synthetic cell-cell communication. Additionally, >100 AimR-AimP homologs were found in other B. subtilis bacteriophages, yet only 2 were characterized [1]. When this project started, nothing was known about the structural and mechanistic details on how the AimR-AimP system regulates gene expression, except that AimR had a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and that AimR is structurally related to the RNPP family of quorum sensing systems of Gram-positive bacteria [1]. Over the course of this project, two papers appeared presenting detailed structural models of AimR derived from Phi3T (phAimR) and AimR derived from SpBeta (spAimR) [2, 3]. Interestingly, the papers showed that the two AimR molecules differed strongly in both the structural details"

Interview Concerning Biosafety with Zhejiang FDA
We are concerned with the public opinion about the application of synthetic biology. In our visit to Zhejiang Food and Drug Administration, we further conducted a generic interview concerning biosafety. Below are the content of the interview.
Q: Questions from Jianan and Junbo
A: Answers from Dr.Jin
Q: With the rise of synthetic biology, there is an increasing number of drugs being produced by engineering bacteria. For example, streptomycetes are used to produce antibiotics. There are also other bacteria used in testing the presence of certain drugs and chemicals. In the process of drug regulation, would you take into account the approach by which the drugs are produced, for example, by biologically engineered bacteria or by chemical ways?
A: Yes, we certainly do. We basically speculate the outcome impurities by looking at the initial source of the production method of the drugs. The way the drugs are produced has a strong influence on the safety, effectiveness and purity of the drugs. So it's really important for us to have a comprehensive and clear understanding and examination of every single step in the procedure, from the raw material to the product.  We set our standards and specific examining procedure according to the ingredients and accessory reagents involved in the production. For instance, we use gas chromatography to detect acetone if that's involved in the production.
Q: Are there any standards or procedures for biological production of drugs?
A: Basically we'll detect if any raw material that could be of potential danger is left in the final product.
Q: If a kind of engineering bacteria is used for production and you've already removed the majority of them in your final products, we would still collect the remaining ones, if there are any. We cultivate them can wait for them to grow into colonies so that we can better examine their safety and effect on human bodies.
A: The impurity profiles of fermentational products are generally more complicated than those from chemical synthesis. We actually pay more attention on detecting organic impurities than the bacteria themselves in biological samples. However, if the engineering bacteria or the enzymes used in the production are proved to be poisonous, they will definitely be"

Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA fragment intensity slightly decreases. Furthermore, after 60 and 90 minutes an additional fragment can be seen at around 2 kb, which represents the stop cassette after recombination. Unfortunately, the small circularized fragment is not visible. Therefore, we conclude that the recombination of our stop cassette by Cre recombinase works as expected.
To check for leaking NanoLuc expression from the Cre reporter cassette, we measured the luciferase activity in overnight cultures of S. cerevisiae carrying the cre reporter construct but no additional plasmid with a Cre recombinase. As shown in figure 3, the luciferase within the cre reporter cassette does not show significant activity compared to wild-type and positive control (pADH-nanoluc).
Figure 4: Cells with Cre reporter cassette do not show significant luciferase activity. RLU=relative luminescence units, positive control = pADH-nanoluc.
In conclusion, we managed to design and transform a working Cre reporter cassette which would be suitable to work with a co-transformed Cre recombinase to form the memory unit of the sensor system.
Promoter activity determination
S. cerevisiae expressing pGAL1-nanoluc or pSUC2-nanoluc were cultured overnight with different concentrations of galactose or glucose, respectively. Raffinose was added to ensure overall sugar concentrations were 2% for all cultures. Nanoluc activity was measured after addition of luciferin in a plate reader. OD600 was determined for normalization on cell density.
Figure 1: pGAL1 and pSUC2 respond to different sugar concentrations. Shown are two technical replicates from three biological replicates, normalised to OD600 A) Induction of the pGAL promoter by galactose: Luciferase activity is increased between 0.5 and 1.5% of galactose. B) Repression of pSUC promoter by glucose: Luciferase activity is decreased with increasing glucose concentrations.
Figure 1A shows the luciferase activity after incubation of pGAL-nanoluc cells with different concentrations of galactose. As expected, luminescence is increased with the addition of galactose. No difference can be observed between 0.5, 1 and 1.5% galactose, which is due to the long incubation time during which the promoter was activated.

UI-Indonesia,2014,Team:UI-Indonesia#Human Practice#Expert Talking#yohda#_-_-_TEXT.html," in Europe and US is very high, but Asia has been left behind. Do you have any opinion?
I think the biggest factor is because of the budget. US people have lots of money and many people are willing to invest on new technologies. I don’t know about Indonesia, but in Japan it’s very hard to invest. In USA, small companies production would be tax-free. However, in our case, many taxes are given. If the investment is not successful, employees will be fired so many people don’t want to work in it. That’s why computer science is really developed in Japan. In biotechnology we need to build laboratories, instruments, employees, and it costs much. However in computer science, all we need is a computer and even one person could do it, very easy.
How about safety modules?
It might be possible, but do you remember Jurassic Park? Haha. To kill the dinosaur who goes outside, it didn’t work. I think its real! Life can escape a system. There are many evolutions could happen, many mutations.
Do you think the community should be pushed to accept Synbio development?
Even though there are risks, we should go ahead. Without going ahead, we will disappear. Even though S&T causes many problems, but we have to believe in it. Without it, we don’t exist.
What should we do as scientists? Need direct approach?
I think our problem should be divided into 3 main things: Government, mass communication, and education. Teacher should have at least master degree to teach young people. Mass communication: They have to know Science & Technology. I encourage people not to stay on the science, but people need to know and accept it. It’s hard for now but it’s possible. We should get to move ahead.

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". However, we were eventually able to narrow our results down to five main categories: co-culturing, process control, biological clocks, medical devices, and cell therapy, three of which are discussed below. For each of our main ideas, we examined the specifics of the issue, as well as current solutions, if any, before identifying our approach and the industries in which they might be applicable.
Application 1: Co-Culturing
For our first idea, we looked at the subject of co-culturing. Co-culturing happens when a a cell culture is set up with two or more different populations of cells growing with some degree of contact [4]. While this may be easy to set up, it is very difficult to maintain. The conditions of the culture have to be just right to support all the populations. They will compete for resources, but one population can not be allowed to overtake the others. One of the major reasons for setting up a co-culture is data acquisition, but even this needs to be carefully planned [4]. The dynamics of each individual population, as well as the interactions and the media, need to be studied in detail. Simple assays don’t exist for co-cultures. These problems of population maintenance, data collection, and culture conditions currently don’t have all-encompassing solutions [4]. Any more than two populations in a co-culture is too complex to maintain.
Oscillate could be part of the solution by introducing control over each population in the co-culture. Using different degradation tags and responsive promoters, it would be possible to tune the frequency at which Oscillate functions. Each population could respond to a different orthogonal frequency, which would then allow us to regulate each population’s growth. This means that one population could never overtake another, as the right frequency simply needs to be emitted to get the other population to grow faster. While Oscillate might not solve the issues with data collection, it would allow for co-culturing to become a more viable option.
This development could have significant implications for the microbiome and for biomanufacturing. The microbiome is a natural co-culture inside the human body. Many companies now advertise that they increase the population of “good” bacteria in the microbiome, but if each population were controlled with a different frequency, then the optimal ratio of populations could be maintained per person [6]. On the other hand, biomanufacturing utilizes multiple bioreactors to support biologically active systems, such as cultures [2]. Each bioreactor typically has one population where the product from one reactor is fed into"
Kyoto,2010,Team:Kyoto#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html,", when college student or high school student were children, Dolly was already born (1996).
It comes from difference of education. Contemporary students are taught about genetic engineering and biotechnology in school. They probably have more knowledge than the others about genetic engineering and biotechnology.
It comes from the amount of chance of household chores, especially shopping. Students do not spend much time for shopping compared with house maker.
According to the results of the questionnaire about both genetic engineering and biotechnology, over half of the subjects said that ""the research should continue"" in Q7, while most subjects have ""a negative image"" (Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5). It seems that people only have abstract and unclear image to this 'professional' technique. Genetic engineering is not still so common in Japan. And many people worry about safety. So engineers are desired to develop safety of biotechnology and spread knowledge about biotechnology.
Future work
We investigated the tendency of impressions on genetic engineering through comparison between Japanese (different ages, majors, job, and regions). We found that Students think that genetic engineering and biotechnology is not so negative as Other people.So it is necessary that the accurate knowledge about biotechnology and genetic engineering should be distributed to the public audience. However, it is difficult for us, college students, to have a frequent contact with public people. To solve this problem, we can use iGEM networks! This year iGEM Japan attracted Japanese media and our activities have been introduced by a magazine. So we can keep in touch with public people through our activities. This could be attained because we started ""iGEM Japan"" team instead of having one particular them. So we want to continue iGEM Japan project, and to make this project bigger.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," trachoma is a mass treatment. Everyone else in the community gets [treated]. But sometimes you are in a situation where you are not sure [...]. If you have a lab-based simple test to confirm the cases, that would be very good. In most cases if you suspect this is trachoma, you take the specimens or the swabs, you treat the community and then you later analyse the samples in the lab – 6 months or 1 year later – and you find out, oh it was not trachoma. And you know, drugs and antibiotics have got side-effects. So you subject the community to a lot of treatment. But also to verify that your treatment has worked. You give treatment [..] and you go back to do an assessment, and demonstrate with laboratory indicators, that the chlamydia have disappeared. Because your aim is to interrupt transmission. We have some literature to show that some trachoma follicles don’t disappear, even if you treat. So even if the chlamydia disappears, the follicles will still be there and you may end up saying: „Oh, there is still trachoma.“ and then treat again. This is the certainly the challenge that we are not backed up by a lab. The reason is that we don’t have a simple test for chlamydia that can be used in the field, or at least as a rapid test.
Samira:
Do you think our device would be helpful in your way of fighting chlamydial infections?
Prof. Kalua:
I think the idea is good. If the device would work, the idea would be very good, because of the time it will take to get the results. If we would have a simpler test like this, to be done in the lab then we could collect some samples. [...] The ones where you are not sure, the positives. You send them to the lab, while you are still doing research and then you get the results and you find out [...]. So it would be a very good idea [...] at least for the field work in Africa. This is the type of idea that you want, in the way that you have some test that is quick and [helps] in decision-making.

You said you already discussed with your colleagues about our project. So where do you see the problems which might arise by using [our application]?

Mass action kinetics
Mass action kinetics is the assumption that the rate of reaction is proportional to concentration of the reactants. We chose to create a mass action kinetics model as we could use relatively few parameters. Reducing the number of parameters, whilst keeping the model representative of the system, made it easier to understand the effect of varying each parameter. We built the model in MATLAB first, and later ported it to JavaScript to make it a better design tool for the biologists and better communicate how the model works.
Graph interactivity
We spent a long time reviewing previous teams models. A problem we found was that most models weren’t communicated in a way that was engaging and easy to understand. We’ve tried to explain our model in a way that someone with no experience in modeling could understand.
We’ve used interactive graphs on this page - when you get to them you can drag the sliders to change parameters and see how they affect the system.
We initially ported our model to a webpage so the design team could try out new stuff when they were designing our toehold switches. This turned out to be very useful for both of us. We decided to make it look a lot nicer and improve its compatibility with different browsers so we could put it on the wiki.
As a webpage it’s much more"

Overview
The cornerstone of synthetic biology is the characterization of genetic parts for predictable action in an engineered biochemical system. Currently this characterization of parts is limited to the “Model Organisms” of synthetic biology: E. coli, yeast, and C. elegans. While this work has been very successful in pioneering research in synthetic biology, characterization in a given model organism such as the primary bacterial model, E. coli, does not necessarily hold true across all bacteria. Therefore, the majority of research overlooks the possible benefits of synthetic work in other bacteria such as Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, and Nitrosomonas.
The main reason for this omission is that initiating work in these organisms is very challenging due to the present difficulty in attempting to transform these non-model strains. Standard protocols have not been developed in all bacteria for incorporation of synthetic DNA through transformation due to the difficulty in developing these protocols. The development of these protocols can be very unrewarding as the investment in time is high, the success rate is often low, and the incentive is small since very few parts are characterized for non-model strains.
NU Models seeks to crack open the field relating to non-model strains. We bypass transformation difficulties by utilizing a cell-free system to characterize a number of promoters and RBSs to incentivize future work in promising non-model strains. Past literature has indicated that characterization in cell-free systems in E. coli has a high correlation to characterization in living cell systems. This indicates that cell-free systems may also be a predictive model for living cells of non-model strains of bacteria.
Our organisms which are non-model in the field of synthetic biology are actually model organisms in their own fields. Streptomyces species have long been a source of novel antibiotics. The impressive secondary metabolism of Streptomyces species is a unique feature to this Genus and provides potential applications impossible in E. coli. Pseudomonas has long been used in agriculture on crops to outcompete other organisms. Nitrosomonas is the model for obligate ammonia autotrophs and is used in bioremediation.
The development of systems characterizing parts for these organisms is important for the development of new biotechnologies. The innate skill-set of these non-model organisms have potential"

For the protein concentration differential equations we took into consideration the maximum translation rate, αT , (also calculated as suggested also by the Team Beijing iGEM), the degradation rate, µT , and the rate of postranslational modifications, specifically, phosphorylations of some transcription factors.
Because all the genes in our circuits have been modified with a LVA tag, unless it is otherwise stated, all the protein degradation rates were considered to be equal to the cell division rate (1/30 min) plus the substance degradation rate (1/40 min, as suggested by Team Leuven iGEM 2008, https://2008.igem.org/Team:KULeuven/Model/Inverter )

So we add the interview part to invite experts. Thanks to our partners, Paris_Bettencourt and Parsteur_Paris, the interview part covers both researchers and Bio-tech Companies.
ü We provided further discussion in synthetic biology in general.
Figure 3 Human Practices-Discussion Types Classification from 2008 to 2014
We also classified the discussion part of Human Practices. Though teams are fond of talking about ethics, they focus more on theories instead of cases. There was a controversial research in April and we was wondering if we may express our opinions based on ethics. The researchers, headed by gene-function researcher Huang Junjiu at Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen University, modified in human embryos a gene responsible for beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder that can be fatal[1]. So we added ethical discussion in the second issue coming in May. Not only do we hope to combine ethics to cases, but also we want to make iGEMers keep an eye on Scientific Research Progress all the time. At the same time, we find that not many teams concentrate on the development of synthetic biology. This special issue is about the present situation of synthetic biology in different countries and regions. We hope we can treat SynBio future direction with more open eyes.
ü More teams join us.
Below is the circumstances of participation in Newsletter.Again, thanks to the teams that pay close attention to this platform.

ü More parts will be added.
Unlike last year, Newsletter consisted Team Introduction and Project Update. This year, we add several parts such as Interview, Ethical Discussion, Questionnaire, Collaboration, About Competition System, Human Practices and so on. We plan to add new session like Policy, Bio Bricks or something special.
ü More topics to discuss.
We will find more cases for iGEMers and people who concern about synthetic biology to discuss.
ü Draw attention from relevant figures.
We wish relevant figures such as researchers, stakeholders, workers, bosses and even the government care about synthetic biology.
ü Translate into different languages.

Tsinghua-A,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," generally instable, which may lead to infinite increase of molecule number. On contrary, negative feedback is always favorable to stability, such as Activation with negative feedback (contains 1 edge as feedback) and Self-inhibition (contains 1 edge as feedback). Interestingly, although Mutual-inhibition contains 2 edges as negative feedback, it may results in strong self-activation and switch between two stable states. In our project, we aimed at all three-node network structures which contain 4 nodes (1 input node, 2 regulatory nodes and 1 output node) and vast possible regulatory edges among them. So we combined these basic modules above to construct networks. Picture: some sketch maps of network structures like bellows:
Note2: (1) Possible regulatory edges among three-node network topologies (2) Illustrative examples of three-node network topologies The ODE Equations involve two 4*4 matrices to bring in the activating effect and inhibitive effect respectively, and a column vector for self-decomposition. In our wet lab part, we constructed plasmids in ** (need particular cell type), so we made some adjustment in our design for a better realization in experiment: We fixed two certain edges (Input inhibits A, A inhibits output) because in the***(need explanation from wet lab) We chose relative parameters close to the actual experiments in our simulation, such as b and K .

Basic Function Analysis -- Massive Parallel Data Processing
The ideal network in our project must be sensitive to the input signal and be able to distinguish the low input and high input from each other. So we expected that the target structure should have a low-input-low-output and high-input-high-output character. Besides, it should avoid ambiguous interim region between low input and high input. Picture: a curve added index descriptions like bellow:
Note4: (1) The input-output curve of functional networks We firstly raised two basic indexes, High-low Ratio and Interim Slope to evaluate the performance of all three-node network structures. To each structure, we scanned the value of input ranging from 1 to 1000 and recorded the corresponding output. Graph: like bellow:

After the groups fed back to the front of the theatre, we then wanted to see how many of the students felt these were valid concerns and why. To do this, we designated one side of the room as strongly agree and the other as strongly disagree. Each issue was then presented as a statement, and the students asked to move to a side of the room that reflected their opinion - this gave us a visual spectrum of where opinion fell. Once everyone had moved around the room, the team then picked out individuals and asked to explain why they were stood where they were - so some felt strongly that Bioterrorism was a serious risk that needs to be dealt with, while others were found to be in the middle ground, explaining that:
”It depends on what you are working on - not everything that you could make is dangerous, so bioterrorism isn't as much as a threat as accidental contamination or something”
Each issue was covered in turn, and most of these issues we have considered before but there was one theme that appeared which we hadn't. This theme was based around the costs of research and worries about spending money on unnecessary causes whilst the recession in Britain continues. What came across was that money was being wasted on research when it could be invested in businesses or other public needs around Britain. This seemed particularly interesting, so we presented a counter-argument that research can lead to new businesses and growth - an example being the invention of the LASER which was originally seen as ""a solution looking for a problem"" but within a matter of years helped to revolutionize technology. The group agreed that if the research was helpful then it should still be undertaken, but still felt that money could be wasted on unhelpful research that was being undertaken for 'fun' or personal interest ahead of societal gain.
The second most polarised issue was animal testing - the majority of the group were vehemently opposed although a few were very strongly in favour. When asked, the students thought that testing on humans was okay because consent can be given, and test subjects made aware of what they are doing and the consequences that could occur. Others raised the counterpoint that we risk needless deaths doing this. To help push the debate along, Paul explained how current clinical trials worked, after which there was some movement from the Against to the For side of the room. However, some more vocal students pointed out that often, the animal testing data was void, as frequently, the physiological effects of chemicals on mice are not the same as they are on humans.

IIT-Madras,2018,Team:IIT-Madras#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html,"optimized reporter proteins they got back to us saying that they did not have a codon bias table available for A. baylyi for our strain.
Our solution:
We made a freely available online tool called CUTE (Codon Usage Table Enumerator). This generates a codon usage table by taking the protein coding annotation into consideration. This tool can be used for all organisms whose genome has been sequenced and whose protein coding regions are annotated. CUTE can be found on the CUTE ChassiDex website. We generated the codon usage table from the protein annotation of A. baylyi available on the NCBI website. Using this codon table, we codon optimized reporter proteins and the characterization can be found here . Following this we conceptualised our next tool - a synthetic promoter library for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. We designed a T5 promoter-based library which can exhibit varying expression strengths. Our aim was to make this library as generic as possible so as it maximise its use in synthetic biology.
Results:
From our fluorometry experiments, we can clearly see that Codon optimized GFP shows higher expression than other GFP. This clearly demonstrates that expression of codon optimized GFP is higher than GFP itself. This suggests that codon optimization has been successful and is  a proof of concept that the generated codon table using CUTE is successful and can be used for other synthetic hosts in the future.
Baylyi News-a information resource for working with Acinetobacter baylyi
Background:
While working with our project-building a synthetic toolkit for A. baylyi, we realized that while there are comprehensive information resources for other synthetic hosts and model organisms, there is no such information resource for A. baylyi. There is little known about the unique properties of A. baylyi like natural competency and ability to degrade aromatic compounds.
Problem:
During the course of the project, we had traversed multiple laboratory websites and small scattered information resources along with a vast multitude of research papers. It is quite difficult to stumble upon many of these scattered information resources without reading a large number of research papers. This might de-motivate many researchers from embarking on the use of A. baylyi for their research.
Our solution:
Seeing the potential of using A. baylyi and the large number of unique properties, we decided to create an information resource and host it on a free public server as www.baylyinews.weebly.com . The features of the website are minimal with basic information that we felt was very useful and referred to multiple times in our own experiments. Data includes"
Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#calendar_-_-_TEXT.html," Switch Brick. Inside the strain that we received, the Pxyl and the Chloramphenicol resistance gene were already present in the region so it saved us a bit of work as we didn't have to clone it in. However, the sequence contains multiple illegal restriction sites for the BioBrick (EcoRI and PstI). To fix this issue, we decided to make a to synonymous change (no AA change) to the sequence where the restriction sites are located. The Switch Brick sequence is then sent off to DNA 2.0 for synthesis. Whilst waiting for the synthesised BioBrick to arrive, we will be using the current Switch BioBrick which contain EcoRI and PstI for our experiments.

We designed primers to clone out and amplify the switch BioBrick from the strain that we received.

Making Agar Plates for our Plants
Aim:
Make some M&S Agar Plates for growing plants.
Methods:
Some Murashige and Skoog Medium (M&S Medium) was made. This medium was ordered in powder form and water had to be added to it to be made into a solution. The solutions were then autoclaved to be used to make the agar for growing plants.
After the solutions have been autoclaved, we made some agar with the M&S Medium. We weighed out 3.0g of agar no.2 into 2x500mL bottles. 250mL of M&S Medium was then added and mixed. The agar was then autoclaved and then cooled at 50 ̊C. When it is ready to be poured, we poured the agar onto 25 plates and left it to set.

Aim and Methods:
Please refer to July 11th .
Results and Discussion:
Inconclusive results were found as the agar was cloudy and individual colonies were not clear. For this reason a sucrose test was set up to see if the cells containing the Groningen plasmid from the plates had"

Transferring the nif cluster from Cyanothece sp. 51142 into Escherichia coli
Caroline Focht, Richard Hongyi Li
Introduction
Nitrogen is abundant in the earth’s atmosphere but, unlike carbon, cannot be directly assimilated by plants.[1] Nitrogen can be directly fixed from the atmosphere by some Cyanobacteria such as Cyanothece 51142, which possesses the enzyme nitrogenase translated from nif genes. Some plant species have evolved close symbiotic associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Engineering crops with the capability to fix their own nitrogen could one day address the problems created by the abuse of fertilizers in agriculture. This could be achieved either by expression of a functional nitrogenase enzyme in the cells of the crop or through transferring the capability to form a symbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Our project mainly focuses on expressing the nif clusters in E. coli strains under various conditions in order to study the nif system in simpler internal environment of prokaryotic cells.
Objectives
Rapidly growing, with high survival rate in environment, E. coli has many attributes that make it an ideal candidate for use as a model organism, which is a species that is extensively studied to understand a specific phenomenon—we expect that the knowledge gained can be applied to other species as well in future.
The genomes of many strains of E. coli have been sequenced. These sequences have been scrutinized so heavily that the way the cell works is very well understood, and changing and manipulating the DNA sequence will lead to predictable results.  Thus, from the previous research of internal energy management and nutritional capability on various strains of E. coli, we have proposed to selected four strains[2], JM109, BL21(DE3), WM1788, and DH5α to carry plasmid pNif51142, which insert the nif cluster from Cyanothece sp. 51142, therefore expressing the nitrogenase activity. The general objective is to adjust parameters of environmental conditions to show nitrogen-fixing activity in E. coli strains and eventually adapt to the light-controlling"

A big step, but we had to go further. The biggest issue we faced as the summer drew to a close was sustainability. Indeed, a software tool is only accessible if it is properly maintained, updated and if it has a community supporting it. What would happen to Neptune after iGEM? Where will Neptune be in 5 years? If we seriously cared about promoting an accessible workflow, we had to make sure we considered the future of our tool.
What is NONA?
And so we proceeded to reach out to the NONA Research Foundation, a nonprofit whose aim is to broaden access to and develop a community around open source synthetic biology software tools. As cited from the organization, “Nona creates long-lasting solutions to the challenges posed by the rapidly growing complexity of software in the synthetic biology community by using the power of open source.”
Integrating with NONA provided 3 long-term, sustainable solutions to promoting the accessibility of Neptune and microfluidics to the synthetic biology community.
1) NONA would distribute Neptune, allowing Neptune to have a “home” where is can easily be found (beyond GitHub.)
2) NONA is dedicated to integrating all open synthetic biology software tools under one umbrella, thus building a community of researchers and developers who who will use and support these tools. Thus, NONA will be a medium through which other developers can contribute to Neptune, and NONA will be a place researchers can go to learn more about how to use Neptune, ask for help, and so forth.
3) Overall, by having a dedicated community and website where Neptune will always have a place, we are making it very hard for Neptune to be abandoned. Quite the opposite, with NONA will ensure Neptune is sustained for years to come, while also providing the opportunity for a community to flourish around Neptune and similar software tools.
Passing Neptune to NONA
We met with members of NONA to discuss integrating Neptune with their foundation. Discussions went really well; indeed, while NONA offered us a lot in terms of accessibility and sustainability, we found that our team could give NONA a hand as well.
We agreed to pass Neptune along to the NONA community. Neptune, with its installation link and all of the documentation were passed along to NONA. In the coming weeks more and more of Neptune’s supporting content; wiki’s, tutorials and all documentation will be pushed to NONA’s site.
NONA will now holistically support Neptune and ensure it is a successful, long term open source project. By integrating our software, with all its documentation and supporting educational material, to NONA, we have provided Neptune"
Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," this bacterium is the ampicillin. One of our objective was to modify it to remplace the ampicillin resistance gene by a chloramphenicol resistance. By amplifying by PCR pSB0K-P to select only the kanamycine gene and the replication origin in B. subtilis, and by ligating it with pSB1C3, we should obtain a plasmid replicative in E. coli and in B. subtilis. In addition, the antibiotic resistance genes would be the one expected: chloramphenicol for E. coli, and kanamycine for B. subtilis.

To get Csp1 from the shipping vector to the pBAD expression system for testing the TAT sequence had to be modified by the addition of a serine residue after the initiator amino acid of methionine. Serine was chosen over other amino acid possibilities because other TAT sequences seemed to have serine in this location.

You can view a animation of the full Csp1 tetramer here .
TAT Csp1 sfGFP
Csp1 sfGFP is a form of Csp1 with a C-terminal sfGFP tag as well as the modified TAT sequence. The sfGFP has a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for purification using Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography. We used this version of Csp1 for purification and microscopy studies. The microscopy images unfortunately showed no evidence of the protein reaching the periplasm. Instead they likely formed inclusion bodies.

Mycobacterial Metallothionien (MymT)
MymT is a small prokaryotic metallothein discovered in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Gold et al.(2) It is believed that the protein may help the bacterium survive copper toxicity. No crystal structure of MymT was obtained but there is an NMR structure of a eukaryotic homologue(3):
NMR average of yeast Cu Metallothein (PDB: 1AQR)
MymT
MymT is much smaller than Csp1 and, because we did not add in a secretion tag, is intended to be cytoplasmic. It can bind up to 7 copper ions but has a preference for 4-6.(2)
MymT sfGFP
This was a form of MymT with a C-terminal sfGFP. We used this version of MymT for purification and microscopy studies. Unlike Csp1sfGFP it had few problems with expression.
Copper sensitive Promoters
For our copper chelating bacteria to successfully compete in the gut we investigated copper biosensors so that the chelator was only produced when copper was present, maintaining cell resources.
As copper is a redox metal it is both very important in cells enzymes but also very toxic because it leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species."

This is our first regular meeting after the final exam. Considering some teammates have gone home, we simply concluded our work before and afterwards.
After analyzing many documents about Salmonella, we decided to start with improveing the character of facultative anaerobic of the bacteria to enhance its property of tumor targeting.
From the documents, we realized that the reason why some bacteria are highly anaerobic is related to anaerobic promoters.  The most used anaerobic promoter applied in experiments to express the target genes at present is promoter nir B.  However, we found other anaerobic promoters had few differences from Pnir B based on the data.  Therefore we supposed there might be better anaerobic promoters than Pnir B in terms of expressing specific target genes, and set our next goal to find newer and better anaerobic promoters.
In order to realize this goal, we start with reading the following documents that might bring us some illumination.

Result and Discussion
Confirmation antibacterial activity of each volatile substances derived from plant
First, we examined our working hypothesis to “Flavorator” that the volatile gaseous substances from plants’ origin can show either the antibacterial or bacteriostatic activity in a box like “KOZOKO”. The results clearly showed that all the volatile substances of wasabi（Japanese horse radish）, rose, garlic and onion had antibacterial properties. In the literatures, wasabi, rose, garlic and onion have antibacterial volatiles, such as allyl isothiocyanate (wasabi), geraniol (rose),allicin (garlic), and lachrymatory-factor (onion). These antibacterial volatiles are produced after complicated pathways, so for their syntheses, various enzymes are required. Then, we searched metabolic pathways in E. coli, in which antibacterial volatiles can be either end products or intermediates. The search hit the geraniol. In E. coli, a precursor of geraniol, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), is synthesized. If we can successfully operate one enzyme to"

Therefore, testimonial evidence is an important part of the scientific community – the policymakers aren’t normally in the laboratory, finding their own results."

Our probes
The first miRNA we decided to target is let-7a-5p: this miRNA is not among the ones found to be relevant as melanoma biomarkers (as instead are other miRNAs of the let-7 family) ( Larrea et al., 2016 ; Mirzaei et al., 2016 ); nonetheless, we thought it might                             be the best option to start from it as a proof of concept, because it was already well characterized for Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) by Deng et al., 2014 and Qiu et al., 2018
Qiu et al., 2018 , as well as our colleagues from the related 2016 iGEM team of NUDT China, had designed their probes in order for the amplicons to be recognized by a CRISPR-Cas 9 system. Since our project deals instead with CRISPR-Cas                             12a, despite the miRNA sequence being the same, we therefore had to modify the sequences of our probes accordingly. More specifically, we had to adapt the PAM sequence (placed on the amplicon of the probe) in order to match                             our Cas protein (we worked with LbCpf1): while the requirement for Cas9 was NGG on the 3' of the amplicon, in our case we needed to have TTTN on the 5'. More details on the design are described in the section ""Detailed design"".
We wanted to test different designs of probes: some were conceived to have the PAM at the beginning of the larger loop of the amplicon (as in the probes from NUDT China), but we also investigated the case where the PAM was placed                             on the double-stranded part (the stem) instead; the sequence on the uncostrained large loop was also changed among the probes.
We ordered 10 different probes; the sequence and related notes are described in the Table below.

However, we encountered many difficulties when thinking about possible challenges and therefore did not decide to chose that topic.

During our project we sadly came to the realization that a lot of people are uninformed about co-cultures and the many benefits they offer.
This fact did not only present itself to us, but also to the iGEM team of Waterloo, whose  project is dealing with co-cultures as well. This is why both of our teams decided to join forces in creating an educational video about microbial consortia. We included a lot of analogies and examples to make it easily understandable for people without a scientific background. Due to their creative skills following video was produced. Have a look!
iGEM Surveys
Surveys are a great method to collect a lot of data on the opinions or knowledge of society about a certain topic. We have designed our own survey and are very pleased with the advantages of this method. For this reason, it was very important to us to participate in and share the surveys of other iGEM teams to help them.

Our project is to make circuits that express chromoproteins when heme is present. To do this, we used a mechanism in which bacteria respond to heme to make an efflux pump. In this system, HssS and HssR were used to recognize from the outside of the cell and HrtR to recognize from the inside.
1. HrtR System
HrtR is a self-regulator that binds directly to the promoter’s palindrome sequence(ATGACACAGTGTCAT) in front of its CDS. When it binds to the promoter, it acts as an inhibitor that prevents the transcription of itself.
We ordered the hrtR sequence of the gram-positive Lactococcus lactis in IDT and cloned it into DH5alpha using pSB1C3 and TA cloning. In the picture above, the white colonies were inserted with the HrtR and the RFP was deleted. The red one is that the RFP still exists because HrtR is not inserted normally.
2. Chromoprotein
Commonly used GFPs must be exposed to ultraviolet light in order to see strong green color. So we planned to use chromoprotein instead of fluorescent protein because we thought that fluorescent proteins would be difficult to use in common life. The 2013 Uppsala team's project was using Lactobacillus and chromoprotein, and we decided to use these parts. This photograph shows the expression of their amilCP in E. coli DH5alpha. AmilCP will be more noticeable because it has a blue color that is complementary to the color of the feces.
Our final design using above system is as follows. HrtR is expressed in cells at a constant concentration by negative feedback. When HtrR binds to heme, its inhibitor function is lost and transcription occurs. Therefore, the concentration of chromoprotein increases and the color of the bacteria in the feces becomes darker."

Team HFUT-China
We are invited to test the front end of the project of the team HFUT-China for finding bugs and fix them. We found six bugs and design flaws.
We found that the wrong email domain name is passed while registering, and we were unable to log out after login. Besides, the error message is not obvious.
The page is unable to save the login cookies. When we logged in and open a new window, however, still showed no login.
Search algorithms need to be optimized. For instance, when we search the team USTC, XMU is on the top list, and there was even no USTC-Software.
The Brand button on the search page didn’t work.
There is no search engine in the Gene Relationship page.
In the Gene info interface, Gene Relationship button should be active (green), but it's actually red.
Team USTC
UTSC has been one of our traditional collaborators.
Focusing on the establishment and improvement of a online synthetic biology community this year, USTC, as potential users of our bio-hub, offered us opinions and needs in application design and homepage design. For example, they suggested adding an online forum named ""iGEMers' Notebook"" in which iGEMers can exchange important information and ideas concerning this competition .They also helped them with biological problems they came across, such as the biological background of comparative sequence analysis.
In return, we share them with some useful tricks. And we also help them in website making and modeling, which speed their work greatly. Besides, we held the annual Science and Technology Week and Science and Technology Exhibition, which spread the synthetic knowledge to the public."

Annual DECHEMA Conference in Aachen
The two representatives from our team from Göttingen (Tobi and Tobi), and our colleages from Aachen (green shirts).
We were very delighted when we were invited by the DECHEMA (Dechema Society for Chemical Techniques and Biotechnology) to their annual conference this year. Together with the iGEM Team Aachen , we presented our iGEM projects, and most exciting for us, in front of an audience with representatives from the leading chemical industry. Afterwards, we had an interesting panel discussion about challenges and responsibilities of Synthetic Biology.
Besides this, we listened to other conference talks about biotechnology. Furthermore, we met with the iGEM Team from Aachen, and exchanged ideas and experiences we made within our work for iGEM.
Postcard Campaign
One important goal of the iGEM competition is to get attention by the public, and awake people’s interest in a scientific field which plays a very important role in all our everyday lifes: Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology. In order to achieve this, and to spread our ideas and views regarding this topic, the iGEM Team Düsseldorf initialized a postcard campaign. Besides our team and team Düsseldorf, also the teams from Aachen, Bielefeld, Darmstadt, Erlangen, Hannover and Tübingen took part in this campaign. The concept of this campaign was that iGEM Teams from all over Germany design postcards with an important aspect of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology combined with a catchy motif, and exchange them with all the other teams. Now having a large variety of different postcards, the teams distribute them to the public. The aim is to give non-scientists an understanding of Synthetic Biology, what this means, and in which parts of our life it is involved. In order to give an impuls of thinking, we decided to create a postcard with the title “TOP DOWN is sometimes the right way” - according to the strategy of synthetic biology we applied in our project.
The postcards from the participating teams.
We took this great opportunity also to get in direct contact with generally educated people, which are no natural scientists. Distributing the postcards on both campuses of Göttingen, we came"

HELP ANOTHER iGEM TEAM
On August 30, the iGEM team of Wageningen sent us an email for help. They had developed a software tool for optimizing cloning strategies and we helped them testing their software tool by offering them the data of our new Biobrick part BBa_K658001 and the number of its cloning rounds. They soon wrote back to us saying that the prediction of their software tool met the result of our real cloning rounds quite well.
Meanwhile, we have got kindly help from iGEM Team USTC-China, iGEM Team WHU-China and iGEM Team Tsinghua, especially from Zhen Wang, the former iGEM Team member of USTC-software.

Uppsala,2015,Team:Uppsala#Results enz_-_-_TEXT.html," that the PCR product from the first PCR containing the HlyA-tag worked successfully as primers in the second PCR and hence since the HlyA-tag is the main part of the primer, it should have been inserted. According to the results in figure 3 the HlyA-tag was successfully attached to the dioxygenase and CueO since the RFC products were around 200 bp longer than the original genes.The RFC products did however encode defective export tags due to faulty primers. No extensive experiments to test the effect of the faulty enzyme were done.
Characterization of catechol 1,2 dioxygenase
Catechol 1,2 dioxygenase was successfully expressed and extracted in large quantities, while preserving its activity, hence proving E.coli as a potent host for its production. Since a major point of the project is to export the degrading enzymes out of the cell, the primary focus was on pH and temperature stability, as well as Km to find its optimal working conditions.  The dioxygenase showed good stability in a wide temperature range, losing its activity completely only in extreme conditions, as displayed in figure 6. The enzyme had its highest residual catalytic functions at temperatures around 40 °C, which is beneficial for our purposes to create a bioreactor since the enzyme works in the same temperatures as the cells will grow. It’s pH range was narrow, showing a peak around pH 7, see figure 7. These results, showing that the enzyme will be able to work optimally in the same pH as our cells, was also seen as good results considering our bioreactor. Dioxygenase showed very high substrate specificity and quickly approached Vmax with increase in catechol concentrations, shown in figure 5. This is favorable for extracellular conditions, where any substrate produced by laccases is diluted several orders of magnitude.
BPB-Test
The bromophenol blue plate test with the CueO and CotA showed clear regions of a brighter colour in the agar around the cells that contained PAH-degrading enzymes, thus this indicated the presence of laccases. There was no significant difference between the CueO with or without the HlyA-tag. On our negative controls, less bromophenol blue had been degraded than on the parts on the plate containing CueO and CotA. This indicated that it actually was our enzymes that were responsible for breaking down the bromophenol (see figure 8). The results of the bromophenol test with liquid cultures was however hard to assess, since we did not have any positive controls to"

iGEM is more than a scientific project! iGEM is a way to make thousands of people around the world feel bearers of the Synthetic Biology spirit. We felt part of it soon this year and started to work to spread our knowledge on SB along our country and even more. With this aim we arranged a Synthetic Biology awareness program for High Schools (BSIES) where we discussed about science, technology and ethics with high school students and teachers; we took part in scientific fairs, where we discussed Synthetic Biology with younger kids and families; and we organized the 2011 Europe Workshop. Also we started the first blog on Synthetic Biology in Spanish: Tornillos y genes. as a way to bring SB closer to non-English speakers. Several media appearances also contributed to give visibility to Synthetic Biology and our team's work at both regional and national scale.
Thanks to all these efforts, the UPO-Sevilla team received the prized to Best Human Practices Advance in Europe!

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Notebook#Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Aldrich) in 40ml of distilled water, to fill two 96 wells plates (with black plates for fluorescence measurement). Since the cellulose is almost insoluble in water the mix has to be shaken all the time while 200ul of it are added to each well. Also, due to the high viscosity of the mix we used the pipette of 1000ul to get 200ul.
Once we had all the wells full, the plates must be dried in the incubator at 37C one over night.
200 ul of cell extract was added to each well of the 96 wells plate already treated with cellulose, also the same was done with another plate but with 200ul of cell extract 1/10 diluted.
Rows A-H, columns 1-6 --> the concentration of cell extract is the original
Rows A-H, columns 7-12 --> the concentration of cell extract is 1/10 respect the original
The plate was incubated 24hours at 4C before the assay.
We carried out the assay as follows:
Measuring absorbance with 475 excitation 510 emission, when the wells were full and when the liquid is removed in each case (just in the Imperial College iGEM team is described).
3 washes were done with the following solutions: water, PBS1x, ethanol 70%, BSA 5% w/w and grape extract to a concentration of 1mg/mL.
The positioning of each of the washes in the plate is as follows:
We got the following results for the experiment:
The following table shows the comparison between our preliminary data and the one that was supplied by the Imperial team in 2014. As we can see, the results are quite different. In the case of Water and PBS, they are completely opposite from what was observed by the Imperial team, and in the case of the other solutions, they are more similar. The date shown in the graph is for remaining fluorescence after washes (relative fluorescence).
Because the results are too different and also because we need to test other subtracts, we will repeat the experiment in the future.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," a long way for synthetic biology to be accepted as normal technology in Germany. The iGEM team from Darmstadt played a small part in this issue but the following iGEM teams in Germany will also do so.
1. Junior
9th September 2012 Lab course with students from Highschool
To make not only the iGEM competition, but also the Synthetic Biology well known in the public awareness, the Darmstadt iGEM team decided to host a student internship. At the beginning of September came about 20 students of the Ludwig-George Highschool to the biology campus of the TU Darmstadt. In this laboratory course, students were able to transpose their theoretical knowledge of molecular biology techniques into practice. As molecular detectives their task was to analyze an unknown meat sample on its species. For this purpose, the students were allowed to purify mitochondrial DNA and perform a PCR for amplification of a specific mitochondrial gene. After a restriction digest and separation of the resulting fragments with agarosegel-electrophoresis the students were able to define the species of their samples. During the breaks, the iGEM team used the opportunity to present their project to the students and to discuss the importance of synthetic biology. The students were very receptive to the topic and immediately recognized that such issues playing no role in school and should be discussed more often. It was not only a new experience for the students, but also for the iGEM team to discuss ethic issues of Synthetic Biology and how the society could learn more about the opportunities which are given by that.
We really enjoyed the day with the iGem Team . We learned a lot of new things, but we also repeated what we already knew from school. It helped a lot that we could do the experiments on our own, because in biology it is very difficult to understand experiments if you don´t see them in front of you. If we had questions, we could ask the iGEM team and they explained it very well. They also explained us the idea of the bacterium which is able to recycle plastic and the whole group liked the idea. Altogether it was a very interesting and informative day and it should be possible for every class to take part in something like this.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," cell-sized liposomes. The video is 60x slowed down
A simple liposome size frequency distribution was determined with an image analysis software ImageJ. A plugin SpotCaliper was utilized to identify circular objects and measure their diameters (Fig. 8a). Gaussian distribution was fitted to the frequency histogram. Results verify that the size of the liposomes follows the Gaussian distribution (Fig. 8b). It proves that the droplets are highly homogeneous. Average diameter of a liposome (results from a single batch experiment) is around 12 µm, with standard deviation of 0.4 µm which fits our requirements very well.
Fig. 8 An automatic detection of droplets with SpotCaliper: the droplets are marked with teal colored circles and the                              diameter of each is measured; b size frequency distribution histogram fitted to Gaussian distribution (teal fit) proves                              the homogeneity of the liposomes; μ=11.853 >µm±0.017 >µm ; SD=0.442 µm ±0.017 µm.
Characterization: encapsulation efficiency and internal synthesis
To prove the encapsulation efficiency and test whether protein synthesis and folding are feasible within the liposomes we employed green fluorescent protein (GFP). First, plasmid DNA coding GFP (3.0 ng/µL) was encapsulated together with PUREfrex 2.0 transcription translation system. The total reaction mixture was 40 µL. The microtubes were kept on ice during the production and collection of the liposomes. After all the reaction mixture was used up, the collected suspension was incubated in 37℃ for six hours. During the incubation time, negative and positive controls were prepared. The negative control contained the same reaction mixture as previously, excluding the DNA. Positive control, on the other hand, contained purified GFP proteins and no included DNA. The outer solution of all samples contained RNAse to ensure that no synthesis occurred outside the droplets (in case some liposomes erupted and released DNA to the outside). After the incubation period, fluorescent microscopy was utilized to reveal the results. Excitation and emission wavelengths of GFP are 488 nm and 510 nm, respectfully, therefore a suitable FITC filter was used.
Brightfield images of the synthesized liposomes are presented in Fig. 9a. The same area was then imaged under the FITC filter Fig. 9b, showing prominent fluorescence. It confirms that the liposomes are biocompatible, and synthesis occurs within them successfully . These results, together with positive control (Fig. 9"

Brian counted the individual transformed colonies to check to see if the first set of cells are competent
We do not think the cells are as competent as needed, 10^6 / 10^7 colonies per plate is ideal. The plates made had approximately 2.5^5 colonies per plate.
New super competent cells are needed as these cells were not competent enough

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

These results indicate that higher fluorescence levels are reached when cells are reaching stationary phase and that even long incubation times fail to yield a majoritary population of co-transformed cells with dual GFP and RFP activity.
Fluorescense rates within cultures: a very stable imbalance
Our last assay aimed at answering this paradoxical question: is the lack of orthogonality a stable trait? In other words, is the GFP:RFP imbalance always the same? The answer, according to Figure 5 is clear: Yes, independent cultures exhibit a striking similarity in their flow cytometry plots. Almost half of the cell population only displays GFP activity, whereas only a relatively small fraction is either displaying RFP fluorescence or both.
Figure 5. Independent cultures of cotransformed cells indicate the lack of orthogonality is stable. Analysis by flow cytometry of XL1-Blue cotransformed cells.  One dot plot is shown for each independent culture.  FITC-A indicates green fluorescence (505 nm).  PE-A indicates red fluorescence (592 nm). Below: diagrams representing the percentage of cells that express no fluorescence, RFP, GFP, or both.
3. Proteomics
Our experiments involving E. coli cells co-expressing two different Biobrick parts revealed a lack of orthogonality between them. But what is going on with all the other parts naturally present in the chassis? Does the expression of a Biobrick part interact or interfere with any of the genes expressed by the host? In order to test this hypothesis, we performed a proteomic analysis on the simplest scenario: we compared the proteome of the DH5α E. coli strain expressing Biobrick part 1 (consisting of a green fluorescent protein under the control of a constitutive promoter) with that of the same strain carrying the empty cloning plasmid and the non-transformed wild-type strain.
General protocol (2)
Set up three independent 5-mL cultures of the strains named before as we explained above for the standard fluorimetry assays.
When an OD value between 0.2 and 0.4 is reached, pellet the cells at 4ºC and then wash them with sterile ice-cooled PBS buffer.
Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of ice-cooled sterile PBS buffer.
After this, we kept the tubes on ice and brought them to the Proteomics lab of the University of Valencia. The proteomic analysis was"

For this protocol, transformations with the required devices (6 + positive and negative control) in Distribution kits were made.To do so, our iGEM team followed the recommended iGEM protocols. After picking two colonies for each device, they were inoculated in 10 ml of LB medium + chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37 °C and 220 rpm. Then cells from all cultures were diluted in a 1:10 proportion, absorbance was measured and then the team proceeded to perform dilutions until an absorbance value at 600 nm of 0.02 was obtained. Samples were gathered from these last cultures as “Time 0” and then incubated for 6 more hours. After this, the samples were gathered and measured following the instructions and layouts provided in the protocol. The results from this experiment are shown the following Excel file.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 1: Schematic of Cas13a target binding. Unbound Cas13a can encounter an RNA sequence and initiate binding. Matching between the nucleotides of the crRNA spacer and target results in further pairing of the two sequences. Upon complete binding of the crRNA to a matching target, the target is cleaved and Cas13a is activated (and will engage in collateral cleavage).
In the kinetic model, loaded Cas13a can be in a number of states. It can be unbound, have formed $n$ (correct or incorrect) base pairs with a sequence that is being probed, or have cleaved its target substrate, at which point it is also activated. The ratio between the forward and backward rates determines the probability of moving between states and can be determined by the energy difference in the free-energy barrier between going forward and backwards between the state (for each position $n$):
$$\frac{k_{forward}(n)}{k_{backward}(n)} = e^{\Delta n} \tag{1}$$
As mentioned above, functional and structural studies of Cas13a indicate a central seed region ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ; Gootenberg et al. 2017 ; Lui et al. 2017 ). Therefore, we can schematically represent binding process as depicted in Figure 2). We take the first bound nucleotide to be at position 12 (as seen from the 5’ to the 3’ end of the spacer), in the middle of the central seed region that ranges from nucleotide 9 to 15 ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ). We impose that subsequent binding events occur sequentially in both directions.
Figure 2: Model representation of Cas13a target binding. Starting in the unbound state, binding between the crRNA and RNA target is initiated in the middle of the central seed region ranging from nucleotide 9 to 15. Subsequent binding events – towards the edges of the spacer – occur sequentially between adjacent nucleotides until the complete spacer sequence is bound to the target. If the spacer and target sequence match, Cas13a cleaves the target RNA and is activated (and will engage in collateral cleavage).
With these adjustments, we can follow the recipe given in ( Klein et al. 2017 ), we can now calculate the probability to cleave ($P_{clv}$) a target ($s$) with a given guide ($g$) once it is bound:
$$ P_{clv}(s|g) = \frac{1"

Integrated Practices
After initial meetings, we decided to design a point of care (POC) diagnostic tool for STIs, given the limited access to STI diagnosis on our campus, and recent national cuts to sexual healthcare in Britain. Since our secondary PI is a luciferase expert with plentiful access to a thermostable variant, useful for access in wider settings, we decided on luciferase as the reporter protein. Asal enjoyed exploring safety, social, ethical, and economic considerations associated with POC testing as well as self testing kits as the project progressed.
The design of Cas-Find, and its intended future usage, has evolved as we delved into complex issues- this can be found on our Gold and Integrated Human Practices pages. After meeting a diagnostics researcher, we designed a system that minimises false positives by requiring two independent events to bring about a 'positive' result, and kept a photodiode in mind for cheap but effective hardware. A Biological Safety Officer advised us that cell free kits are easier to license, and stressed the importance of regulatory bodies. From this,she consulted the UK's regulatory body for medical devices, the MHRA, which helped us understand CE rating approval, and the PHS' decision making on self-testing diagnostics.
Meanwhile, we investigated the ethics of using  Cas-Find  in self-testing kits, spurred on by a conversation on 'burying results' and 'pre-test counselling' with a retired HIV social worker. We conducted a survey, and  consulted an ethicist and employees at HIV charities, Terrence Higgins Trust (THT) and National Aids Trust (NAT), all of which evolved into a report to inform our decision making.
Public Engagement
Our public engagement activities can be found on our Silver and Engagement pages. We engaged with families, over 200 12-13 year olds, over 150 16-17 year olds, and adults, as well as other iGEM teams (European and Westminster meet ups; XMU newsletter; Warwick event; Toronto synbio panel).

We finally created an artificial consortium chassis to deal with cholera disease. The different partners are deeper described below.
Mimicking Vibrio cholerae using Escherichia coli
An interesting property of V. cholerae is its quorum sensing autoinducer system based on the production of CAI-1 molecule 13 . The amount of this secreted molecule, produced by the enzyme CqsA synthase, is an efficient reporter of the quantity of bacteria in water. As we were not allowed to work with pathogens in our lab, we engineered the strain E. coli in order to mimic V. cholerae. E. coli was transformed with the cqsA gene from V. cholerae. Since our sensor was V. harveyi, as a proof of concept, we also transformed an E. coli strain with the cqsA encoding gene of V. harveyi. This Vh_CqsA enzyme synthetizes C8-CAI-1, an analog of V. cholerae CAI-1 14 .
We therefore developed E. coli strains which produce markers simulating the presence of Vibrio species in the medium.
The sensing organism: Vibrio harveyi
The easiest way to detect CAI-1 or C8-CAI-1 is to use the quorum sensing pathway of the non-pathogen V. harveyi.  As our project will deal directly with V. cholerae in real situation, the CqsS receptor of V. harveyi will have to also recognize the CAI-1 molecule 13 . To do so, a single mutation was introduced in the gene cqsS changing the phenylalanine 175 into a cysteine.
Figure 2: Closer view of the C8-CAI-1/CqsS sensing of V. harveyi 15 .
When C8-CAI-1 binds to CqsS this activate a dephosphorylation cascade leading to the inhibition of the pQRR4 promoter and blocking the transcription of siRNA 14 . In the absence of this siRNA, translation of the targets genes (i.e. virulence genes) is activated (See Figure 2). We used this system to produce the molecule (i.e. diactetyl) used to activate P. pastoris . The als coding sequence, encoding for the acetolactate synthase Als, is involved in the conversion of endogenous pyruvate into diacetyl ("

Founded in 1996 by an investment banker called Pablo Lagoretta, Royal Pharma is a privately owned alternative investment company that focuses on the acquisition of pharmaceutical royalty interests. It currently manages 10 billion dollars in assets, consisting of 39 approved and marketed biopharmaceutic products and two products in clinical trials and/or under review with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In exchange of its royalties, the patent-holders receive liquidity, the investors then perceive a  royalty payment in the form of a percentage of sales or a fixed amount per unit sold that is derived from the use of a proprietary asset. Payments based on future earnings allow smaller companies to work with more established firms and academia without affecting their already difficult funding situation.
The downside of this funding system is that at the moment it focuses on drugs with blockbuster potential that are marketed by leading pharmaceutical and biotech companies.
Funding cancer through a « megafund, a safer investment » !
Following a talk given on TED.com in November 2013 by Roger Stein, PhD, an MIT research affiliate and a managing director at Moody's in New York. We took a look at his article published in Nature Biotechnology.
He and his coauthors proposed a “megafund” valued at between 2.5 and 30 billion dolars, that would combine debt securities (such as bonds) with traditional equity (stocks). Debt holders would be paid in interest on varying time scales, while equity holders would cash in only when development transactions are completed, explains Roger Stein. “Insurance companies, pension funds, and others who steer away from high-risk investments might be interested in this approach because it offers more reliable, albeit modest, returns,” he says.
The success of a few funded ventures could generate enough profit to offset losses incurred by the majority that fail. Simulations with a hypothetical cancer drug megafund, described in an article in the October issue of Nature Biotechnology, suggest that yields on debt securities could range from 5% to 8%, while returns on the high-risk equity could range up to 11.4%.
According to Stein, the megafund might advance drug approvals in cancer and other diseases because it would allow more compounds to cross a financial “valley of death” between early- and late-stage developments.

Usually an iGEM project mainly focuses on the lab work. We wanted to expand this view by                 investigating how our project might impact the economics of land grabbing by making                 use of the production of terpenoid-derived bioproducts. This resulted in a report, which outlines                 different aspects of land grabbing, such as population growth, prices for food commodities                 on a global scale, political and social influences and how an industrial-scale production of                 biofuels derived from artificial endosymbiosis could change either of these aspects towards a                 biobased production instead of land grabbing for resource generation.
In order to enable a scientific exchange between different iGEM teams, we also hosted the                 ‘iGEM meets Marburg’ meetup for the second time. Taking place in the beginning of august,                 we were able to welcome all German iGEM teams as well as the team from the SDU Denmark for an                 amazing weekend full of different activities and great discussions.
Because we also wanted to reach out to the general public, we had the opportunity to give several                 talks to different audiences, for example a group of American exchange students or during the junior                 GBM meeting in Marburg. Besides this, we were hosting the booth for Synmikro, the Institute for Synthetic                 Microbiology at the University of Marburg, at the Hessentag 2016, an annual fair of the state of                 Hesse. Here we had the possibility to reach out to a vast majority of society and discuss with them the                 goals, methods and possible threats of Synthetic Biology.

CONFERENCE OF CHINA iGEMER'S COMMITTEE
The CCiC was held in Peking University from August 14th to 15th, hosted by School of Life Science in Peking University. It was wonderful opportunity for iGEMers in China to gather together and strengthen the bonds among Chinese iGEM community. The participants include 30 undergraduate teams and 2 high school teams. As one of the three high school participating teams in CCiC, it was an great chance for SKLBC_CHINA to practice for public presentation before the Giant Jamboree and learn more about synthetic biology through other teams' projects. In spite of the presentation, various lectures from ex-iGEMers gave us insprirations on the possible developments of synthetic biology in the future.
Collaborations With Other Teams
This is our second year participating the iGEM competition, although we have acquired the Best Software in High School track last year, there are still a lot things that we haven’t done pretty well. Luckily, this year, we found help from TJU iGEM 2015. They initiate a Handbook program for assistance where other team can get access to the overall necessary information about the competition through such book. Particularly, several pieces of excellent work done by other teams are included in the Handbook, hence we are able to learn from the best projects and make ourselves better this year. Besides, we can get more acquainted with the knowledge of synthetic biology like how to obtain the target genes or how to extract plasmid. This helps us balance our shortcomings and advantages, and we hope that we can get a preferable result this year.
At the beginning of August, we were invited by SCUT_CHINA to visit their laboratory and completed several experiments in their lab with their assistence, advancing our understanding of wet team's works and laboratory protocols.
In order to fulfill the demand of users of WEiGEM2.0, we further developed the syncing function of marked biobricks between PC and mobile phone by scanning QR codes along with SKLBC_GDSYZX .
