Our Project
Polystyrene is a multifaceted material - light, largely chemically and biologically inert, and easily shaped, but also a highly visible pollutant that locks up valuable hydrocarbons. In 2013 the Leicester iGEM team are retaining their focus on polystyrene but will diversify our approach. We have three streams involving recycling, re-using and re-purposing polystyrene.
Recycling – This stream involves building on the work of the 2012 team in environmental prospecting for genes involved in polystyrene degradation. Currently we have isolated organisms from environmentally exposed polystyrene, and are progressing in our aim of adapting the toluene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas species.
Re-using - Consumer 3D printers are now a reality and use a variety of thermoplastics (PS and ABS, for example). While the technology is constantly finding new uses, most involve using virgin plastics, which is not good for the environment. Recycled polystyrene can be used for 3D printing, but has an additional advantage as it is soluble in limonene (an environmentally friendly solvent), but ABS is not. Complex 3D printed shapes require removable support structures - one solution is to print the supports using PS and the object in ABS, with the PS being removed by limonene dissolution. We are adapting limonene biosynthesis biobricks developed in previous iGEM competitions to enable genetically engineered machine biological ""finishing"" of 3D printed objects.
Re-purposing (DNA!) - Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a great insulator, used by the construction industry to make our homes warmer, using less energy. EPS insulation is required to be flame retardant, which is currently achieved by incorporating environmentally polluting halogenated hydrocarbons. Recently DNA has been shown to be an effective flame retardant, but is expensive to produce. We are building a genetically engineered machine with inducible endoreplication (over-replication of DNA). This should yield DNA cheap enough to burn and when added to EPS make it flame retardant and environmentally friendly.

Hardware: E-light 1.0
The  E-light 1.0 hardware system has 3 major components: the light-exposure & bacterial  culture system, the controlling circuit and the computer interacting port.
The  light-exposure & bacterial culture system is based on a 24-well plate  coupled with tri-color LEDs. The controlling circuit utilizes 3 AT89S52-24PU  DIP-40 SCMs (single chip microcomputer) to execute programmed-controlling of  the 24 tri-color LEDs, while the computer interacting port monitors the whole  system through given protocol sequences. The ultimate result is the  programmable operation and real-time monitoring of light-exposure (on both  timing and wave-length) on every single well.
Here below shows the appearance of our device:

Software: E-code 1.0
The  E-code 1.0 software system aims to provide convenient commanding for users of  the E-light hardware system. The software provides two operating modes: the  E.coli-code mode is able to convert any given information into light-coded  files, and therefore turn these files into actual light-exposure commands of  the E-light hardware system. With the help of the coding-plasmids from our  CRISPR-Recombinase system, we can eventually store any information into the  E.coli DNA and of course"

SP_Opto_EL222_non-binding
A SP_insert PCR (JM_068, JM_069) was performed and sent to GATC for sequencing.
The sequencing results proved that the phage contains a truncated version of EL222.
This phage is further used as control for AP_testing.
AP_testing
Cultures of AP_light and AP_dark were prepared and grown to an OD600 of 0.6. A sample was taken to
prove that the cultures were not already contaminated with phages. Then, the two cultures were split into 10 ml cultures and infected with 10 µl of either SP_Opto or SP_Opto_EL222_non-binding (titer: (~1011 PFU/ml) to reach a MOI of 1.
All strain, phage and cultivation conditions were prepared in duplicates. Cultures were cultivated for 3 h either in the dark or under blue light (25 %: 15 sec. on, 45 sec. off). After 3 h 2 ml of each culture was centrifuged at 6000 xg for 3 min and supernatant was transferred into a fresh reaction tube. 1 ml of this supernatant was used to infect a fresh E. coli culture (OD600 ~ 0.6)
which was again cultivated for 3 h under the same conditions as before. This transfer step was repeated twice and final samples of T=4 were analyzed by a Blue Plaque assay (T=4: after 4 x 3 h of cultivation, 3 transfer cycles). On the next day plaques were counted and phage titers were determined:

What is the problem we are trying to solve?
Hexavalent Chromium -- Cr(VI) -- is a highly carcinogenic and mutagenic compound, proven in 2008 to cause cancer in laboratory mice and rats [1]. In 2010, scientists at the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment experimentally determined that ingestion of very small amounts of this toxic chromium can lead to cancer in humans, a finding backed by teams of scientists in North Carolina and New Jersey. Soon after reaching this conclusion, the California and New Jersey scientists conducted independent calculations to determine the maximum safe contaminant level of hexavalent chromium in drinking water, arriving at .02 and .06 ppb (parts per billion), respectively [2]. This evidence communicates, based on California’s data, that .02 ppb represents the maximum amount of toxic chromium that poses no more than a one-in-a-million risk of cancer for people who drink the water daily for 70 years. The EPA-set maximum contaminant level is 1.0 ppb.
Lead is another highly toxic heavy metal, identified by the World Health Organization as 1 of 10 chemicals of major public health concern. The hazards of lead poisoning are substantial; when ingested, lead invades the brain, liver, kidney, and bones. It has been shown to severely hinder brain development and contribute to behavioral disorders in young children, and exposure of lead to pregnant women can result in miscarriage, stillbirths, and malformations. Long-term effects of lead poisoning in adults include increased risk of high blood pressure and kidney damage [3]. The FDA-regulated bottled-water maximum lead contaminant level is 5 ppb, while interestingly, the EPA-set amount is 15 ppb [4]. Per the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, “No safe blood lead level in children has been identified” [5].
Local and National Impact
Northwestern University sits on the shores of Lake Michigan in Evanston, IL, just outside of Chicago. From 2013 to 2015, in water quality tests conducted in Evanston and Chicago, hexavalent chromium contaminant levels were found to be .210 and .194 ppb respectively, 10 times more concentrated than the California-determined maximum [6]. Nationally, over 60,000 drinking water tests were conducted"

Penn iGEM
WEEK 1
June 4 2013 - June 11 2013
Goals:
This was our first week setting foot in the lab as the Penn iGEM team. We wanted to become more acquainted with the lab and start transforming and growing parts that would be useful in our future project ideas. This week we wanted to brainstorm our project ideas further as well as being more competent in basic molecular biology techniques.
Achievements:
We learned how to make competent cells and performed our first transformations of the summer. We continued to brainstorm potential projects and thought about directions we would like to pursue for the summer. Our idea for a project that would revolve around quorum sensing systems is currently being put into motion. We continued brainstorming for our idea about uses for DNA binding domains like TALE, Cas9, and zinc fingers. We grew up and miniprepped our transformations of various quorum sensing parts and learned how to use a plate reader.
WEEK 2
June 11 2013 - June 18 2013
Goals:
This week we wanted to transform some parts for our methylation idea that we ordered from addgene. We also wanted to attempt a bisulfite conversion to test methylation. We had some problems transforming some biobrick parts the previous week, so we wanted to troubleshoot our transformations as well. Another goal of ours was to make more competent DH5-alpha and Dam- cells as well as figure out methylation assays for our promoters.
Achievements:
We worked out the details of one of our potential projects: creating DNA binding domain-methyltransferase fusions. Like last week, we transformed and miniprepped parts that we would need for the quorum sensing project, like the LuxI system. We also transformed and miniprepped the standard biobrick backbones psb1A3, psb1C3, and psb1K3, which would be useful in almost any project we decide to pursue. We pinned down and ordered exactly the DNA binding domains that we thought we would be using and ordered the gene blocks from addgene. We methylated a biobrick part, c0051, with an M.sssI, and used our bisulfite conversion kit for the first time.
WEEK 3
June 18 2013 - June 25 2013
Goals:
It was increasingly important that we decide on"

Wei Liu  Grade 2008
I major in biochemistry and molecular biology and joined in Association for Science and Technology in school of marine life science in ocean university of China in 2008. Though IGEM must be quite familiar to many US students, it’s the first time for us to personally experience the whole process; it’s so worthy and is surely a new watershed and highlight of my college life. Thanks for all my iGEMers and those self-giving friends. I always insist that we should just try it again until we get what we want; I always strike for perfection however tough it is. These beliefs support me to get over all the difficulties and the unexpected. Breathe brand-new atmosphere in iGEM , let’s feel and create new vitality for Synthetic biology !   I am responsible for the whole organization of the team, designing and operation of summer experiments, mission allocation and handling all kinds of affairs and problems.

Yang Liu  Grade 2008
I am Liu Yang, student majoring biochemistry and molecular biology. I am so excited about participating in 2011 iGEM. Here, I want to give my sincere thanks to my team members of OUC_China and teachers who help us selflessly. To many iGEM teams, synthetic biology is an interesting field of biological science; but for us, it’s not just a cutting edge subject, it’s an unforgettable fantasy about dream, dignity and fighting. On the way of seeking, we are afraid of nothing!   I originally propose the idea of interpreting Theory of five elements by the bacteria. I am also responsible for external networks for our team, including ask help from sponsors, team publicity and art design.
Xiaoyan Yu  Grade 2008
Yu Xiaoyan, also named as Don Quixia, is a senior student majoring in marine biology in Ocean University of China, an explorer of freedom and natural secrets, whose interests lie in science and art，believing physics is a critical part of the key to biology's secrets.

Questions were eliminated to ensure that only the same questions got compared. Overall, we had 18 participants in the study; however, one of the participants did not fill out the pre-video survey and another backed out of the study. Their data was removed from the data set, so only 16 participants counted. Of those that were counted, 1 was 50 years and younger, 2 were 71-75 years old, 2 were 76-80 years old, 4 were 86-90 years old, and 3 were 90+ years. 7 of the participants were male and 8 were female. 1 had a high school diploma, 3 had a bachelor’s degree, 4 had a masters degree, 5 had a doctorate, 1 had post-doctorate experience, and 2 had other educational backgrounds. Occupationally, 1 had background in engineering, 2 in education, 5 in science, 3 in liberal arts, 4 in medicine and health, and 1 in another field. As you can see, a wide variety of people we sampled in this study, to account for background differences in the study. Each filled out a pre-video survey regarding GMOs in certain situations. Then, after the video was presented, they filled out a post-video survey about how each participant felt in those same situations. Each of their responses was quantified into numbers, 1 for strongly agree to 5 for strongly disagree. Each of the responses was averaged for each participant, and those averages were averaged again to find general views of genetic engineering before the video and after. The mean value for pre-video data was 2.35 (STD = 0.61), and the mean value for the post-video data was 2.28 (STD = 0.63). This indicates that the video did have some effect on influencing the general views of the participants. However, the statistical analysis yielded insignificant results, indicating that these results could just be due to chance (t = 0.31, p-value = approx. 0.35). This shows that while our video might have slightly influenced the results, these influences were not significant enough to show that change in opinion had occurred. We feel that this might be due to several reasons. One might have been the quality of the way we presented the video. Many complained of not being able to hear the video. Other participants talked about how our video did not go too in-depth in the topic. For future projects, a video"

Conclusion
The three proof of concept experiments presented above - mutanty library activity and sequencing recording, ribosome binding site strength determination and toehold regulatory sequence cross-interaction evaluation - conclude that CAT-Seq catalytic activity sequencing workflow is a precise and high throughput method to screen millions of catalytic or regulatory molecules that allows to precisely link the measured absolute phenotypic data to the sequenced genotype.

UC Davis Promoter Characterization
The UC Davis iGEM team asked us to help in producing a multi-lab, extensive characterization of a commonly used part library - from the iGEM part kit! The team provided us with a protocol and a list of promoters from the parts registry. One of our team members (David Dinh) resuspended these parts from the kit, transformed them into DH5alpha cells and grew them according to their suggested protocol. RFP expression was collected from a plate reader and sent to the UC Davis team. The data we collected is also available here.
TU/Eindhoven: Synthetic Facts Project
TThis summer, the TU/Eindhoven team made a website which they hoped would serve as ""a Fact Checker to help members of the general public associate with the field of synthetic biology. (Their) Fact Checker will become available online and will allow users to both view and submit facts of their own.  Each submitted “fact” will be reviewed and commented on by respected sources. This way it is hoped that (they) can prove or disprove a number of myths about synthetic biology and thereby promote the idea of synthetic biology to the general public."" To help the team, we researched one fact that can now be found on their site by clicking the badge below.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"1 ). Three different scenarios are also shown in each graph: (green) Day, (blue) Night Δ zwf , and (purple) Night.
In these simulations what we are looking for at first is for peaks in growth rate. These can act as attractor states for Darwinian selection. Then for our application specific interests, these peaks will only interest us, if they also require an increase fumarate production. In other words, we want to align the microbial interests, to ours.
The first thing we noticed was that the growth rate for Δ fumC peaks when either J ICL or J MS are 0 during the Day and Night scenarios (fig. 5.2A and fig. 5.2C). This signifies that flux through either of these reactions under those scenarios is predicted to reduce growth rate, and therefore, lead to the phenotypic instability we aim to avoid. Simply put, expressing (part of) the glyoxylate shunt in Δ fumC is predicted to be unstable. This is a prediction that we actually decided to try to test even though we know that it will not lead to increased stable fumarate production (if our predictions are right, of course).
In contrast the Δ fumC Δ zwf strain under a night scenario displays a peak in growth rate at non-zero fluxes for the two enzymes. Moreover, this growth rate peak coincides also with a peak in the predicted fumarate production. This is exactly what we were looking for - a glimpse of hope that if we would rewire the metabolic network we could potentially achieve higher fitness and production (fig. 5.2D).
However, it is important to keep in mind that these simulations were done by forcing the flux through either ICL or MS one at a time, while the other reaction was off. A closer inspection of the flux distributions indicated that the network had sufficient plasticity to still find a steady-state solution in the absence of one or the other shunt enzymes. This happens because, as it is common practice in this type of modeling, the absolute flux bounds through each internal node of the system is unconstrained. Some of the solutions found seem non-physiological, since they involve drastic increases of fluxes that are typically very small in the cell.

We were unable to find a peptide chain elongation rate for S. aureus, so instead we used the values reported in BioNumber 107869
which gives a range of 0.59-3.17 amino acids per second per ribosome in Streptomyces coelicolor, another gram-positive bacteria. Freiburg's dCas9 part from last year
is composed of 1372 amino acids. This translates to a range of 0.0258 to 0.1386 dCas9 molecules per minute per ribosome. We were unable to find ribosome densities in S. aureus, but found two different estimates for ribsosome density in Bionumbers: 0.22 ribosomes per 100 codons (i.e. per 3 nt coding sequence)
and 3.46 ribosomes per 100 codons
. Using our assumption of 3 nt:1 amino acid, we then multiply to get the 0.0057-0.4797 range of dCas9 molecules per minute.
Degradation Rates of dCas9
We were unable to find any specific data on dCas9 degradation, so instead we used a protein half-life of sarA measured in S. Aureus by Michelik et al.
. We chose sarA rather than a protein more chemically similar to dCas9 because data on sarA was readily available and because dCas9 is transcribed using the sarA promoter, which allows us to at least capture sensitivity of the degradation rate to production.
Production Rates from the sarA Promoter
We used the time-series data given by Cheung et al.
to estimate the rate of production from the sarA P2-P3-P1 promoter in S. aureus. The figure from their paper is reproduced below. After diluting 1:100, the S. aureus strains were serially monitored for OD_650. We used data from the sarA+ strain, as that's more like a wild-type S. aureus strain.  Using the laboratory-conditions doubling time of 24 minutes given in given in
, we found that the bacteria would re-enter stationary phase after 2.5 hours; for time-points after 3 hours, the number of number of sarA genes producing fluorescence could be assumed as constant. For this reason, we excluded time-points prior"

Build
We use cmake to manage the build progress, cmake can generate cross-platform Makefile, we intend to make our project could be built in different operating system. Until now, only Linux operating system is tested. Windows and Mac should be supported soon. Download all source code, run cmake-gui to configure the project. Pay attention to the configure information.There should be ""missing ***"" messages when Cmake fail to find the dependent libraries. To fix those messages, one need to assign the path of related libraries by Cmake GUI. When Makefiles are successfully generated, execute the Make command to build.

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.
Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain"

French Meet-up 2015
This year, Bordeaux team hosted the French Meet-up with the help of Cap Sciences (Scientific Museum in Bordeaux specialized in scientific popularization) during the last weekend of August (29-30th). We invited all French and francophone teams. Aix-Marseille University iGEM team, Paris_Saclay iGEM team, Pasteur_Paris iGEM team and Toulouse iGEM team came from France, KU_Leuven iGEM team came from Belgium and EPF_Lausanne iGEM team came from Switzerland and all enjoyed the weekend with us.
On Saturday morning, iGEM Bordeaux organized a small orienteering race in the city. The objective was to answer enigmas about synthetic biology and other iGEM projects to find clues for the next location they needed to go to. Divided into three teams, we were able to visit the beautiful city of Bordeaux which ended in a picnic at the Cap Science Museum.
There, teams presented their projects in front of other teams and general public at Cap Sciences and we talked with the audience about the inconvenient and advantages of each project. Each team had to make their presentation understandable for everyone. We also were lucky to have a theatre expert who gave us constructive feedback on the best way to present our projects at Boston and to a non-scientific public.
When every team finished their French presentation, each team made a very quick presentation of their project in English without a PowerPoint, and then again, the public gave some advice for each team.
Look at our first presentation in French with English subtitles down below!
Look at our second presentation in English down below!
After a long day of walk and talk, we went out for dinner in a restaurant and came back to home to have a well-deserved rest to be ready for the Sunday activities.
On Sunday, we all met at the Jardin Public (Bordeaux Park) to do some activities proposed by iGEM Paris_Saclay and iGEM Pasteur_Paris teams. The first one organized a debate about biosafety, and filmed a short video of iGEM team presentation on biosafety for each project. This encouraged all teams"

WINTER CAMP
After the 2016 Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China couldn’t wait to share their experience of participating in iGEM. With the coming of the cold winter, we came up with an idea to start the winter camp and light the fire. Students of different faculties such as Life Science, Electronic Engineering, Software, Art Design came to our winter camp.
We invited our instructor Prof. Chun Li to give a general introduction about synthetic biology and iGEM competition, which inspired many students’ interest in synthetic biology and they wanted to know more about the logic design and skills required to start a project.
Many of them wished to take systematic courses to have better understanding of the core concept about synthetic biology including “design, build and test”. They would like to not only gain more biological knowledge, but also know how to give a good presentation and integrate the mathematical equations into the iGEM project. Based on their needs, we prepared several lectures for everyone who may be interested in the skills required for iGEM competition and the speakers were our instructors and team members. Here are the topics:
Our GPCR model based on three presuppositions:
(1) The history and development of synthetic biology (Chun Li)
(2) Literature searching and reading (Hongyu Yang)
(3) Photoshop training (Zeyan Li)
(4) Academic writing and English presentation training (Zeyan Li)
(5) System biology and mathematical model (Pengcheng Zhang)
iGEM MEETING
In the late September, in order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a preaching meeting about synthetic biology and iGEM for all the students came from all faculties in BIT. At the meeting, we had a total of three links, the first link was to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the students. The second link was brainstorm， which let students think about our project's innovative points and flash points with based on our project's background. The third link was a free exchange session. Students can communicate with us about things related to our project and team. After this meeting,"

User Interface
The UI is an intuitive web application that enables the user to interact with TERRA. The interface is designed so that it takes the necessary experiment information from the user and sends it to the device. The user will enter how many outputs their microfluidic chip has, the flow rate on the microfluidic chip, and properties about the fluid itself (density, continuous vs droplet, etc.). Given this information we are able to use our TERRA droplet predictive model to calculate a dispense time. The user can then select which wells each output should be dispensed into. This information is sent to the Arduino and enters the back-end software components. The video below demonstrates how an experimenter would use the UI.
The UI is able to facilitate communication between the user and TERRA through the use of Peripheral Manager, a daemon that runs on the workstation and facilitates communication between cloud-based applications and hardware connected to the workstation. This communication link uses WebSockets, a communication protocol that enables two way communication between the browser and server. Peripheral Manager takes advantage of this protocol for serial communication with the Arduino.
Designing the User Interface
When initially designing TERRA our team knew that we needed some sort of platform for the user to interact with our system. During the designing and testing phases of the individual hardware components, a simple Serial Monitor was enough to communicate data via a microcontroller. However, a Serial Monitor is not an ideal platform for users to interact with devices, so we decided to create a user-friendly web application to use as the user interface for TERRA. In addition to the UI, the website also contains full assembly instructions, component descriptions, and other any other relevant documentation for the user to access. The goal was to create a one-stop website for users to help streamline their experience.
The first step during the UI design process was to plan how it would look and create the static page via HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. The initial design, pictured below, was the first iteration of the UI. On the left side the user would enter information about their experiment, such as the number of outputs and the vessel they plan to use. They would then configure each output by inputting"

The use of the Hydrogenase 3 complex to generate Hydrogen within E Coli as a form of biofuel.
The possibility of biological prevention of tooth decay with biobricks.
The application of biobricks to a mixed cell community.
The development of cell free transcription/ translation within a cellular system, for example the phloem of a plant, (although the development of this level of symbiosis may be the stuff of future projects)
The attempt is being made to develop a project that in some ways reflects these interests and possibly taps a common thread underlying them.

Do not work with protective gloves to prevent contamination of your sample with plasticizers
Reaction tubes have to be cleaned with 60 % (v/v) CH3CN and 0.1 % (v/v) TFA. Afterwards the solution has to be removed completely followed by evaporation of the tubes under a fume hood. Alternatively microtiter plates from Greiner® (REF 650161) can be used without washing
Cut out the protein lanes of a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE using a clean scalpel. Gel parts are transferred to the washed reaction tubes. If necessary cut the parts to smaller slices
Gel slices should be washed two times. Therefore add 200 µl 30 % (v/v) acetonitrile in 0,1 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate each time and shake lightly for 10 minutes. Remove supernatant and discard to special waste
Dry gel slices at least 30 minutes in a Speedvac
Rehydrate gel slices in 15 µl Trypsin-solution followed by short centrifugation
Trypsin-solution: 1 µl Trypsin + 14 µl 10 mM NH4HCO3
For this solution solubilize lyophilized Trypsin in 200 µl of provided buffer and activate Trypsin for 15 minutes at 30 °C. For further use it can be stored at -20 °C
Gel slices have to be incubated 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by incubation at 37 °C over night
Dry gel slices at least 60 minutes in a Speedvac
According to the size of the gel slice, add 5 - 20 µl 50 % (v/v) ACN / 0,1 % (v/v) TFA
Samples can be used for MALDI measurement or stored at -20 °C
Preparation and Spotting for analysis of peptides on Bruker AnchorChips:
Spot 0,5 - 1 µl of sample aliquot
Add 1 µl HCCA matrix solution to the spotted sample aliquots. Pipet up and down approximately five times to obtain a sufficient mixing. Be careful not to contact the AnchorChip. Note: Most of the sample solvent needs to be gone in order to achieve a sufficiently low water content. When the matrix solution is added to the previously spotted sample aliquot at a too high water content in the mixture, it will result in undesired crystallization of the matrix outside the anchor spot area

USTC-Software,2014,Team:USTC-Software#biopano.php_-_-_TEXT.html," phenomenon, we keep using new and  sophisticated methods to refine our research and to explore every  detail of life. However, if we widen our perspective, by looking at  our research objectives from a more comprehensive perspective,  we may have some unexpected discoveries.
Features
Our software has many marvelous features, with which your biology research will become extremely easy and joyful.
1. Expansion of single node
In Biopano, every biology part of E.coli K-12 will be displayed as a node of different types and regulation relationship  will be  displayed as arc of different types. They are displayed in the biological network in a visualizational way.  You just need to select a node and click “Expand”, and the nodes associated with it will be “expanded”.  Nodes are connected to each other by all kinds of relationship, so users can see how biological parts are connected clearly,  such as LacI Operon.
However, since there are so many biological parts connected to each other in various convoluted,  the expansion of all nodes will give rise to extremely involved nets, which will fail to convey useful information to the users,  even interfere their thoughts. So you can choose to expand the nodes in a way you see fit. Take Transcription factor CRP as an example.
Biopano displays the network dynamically, which makes you able to tease out the relationship among thousands of materials of  E.coli K-12, satisfies your curiosity and helps you discover unknown biological field.
2. Link Finder
You can input two nodes that seem irrelevant, such as gene A and Transcription FactorB, and the software will  search the route connecting the two nodes for you. Since some routes are too sinuous for further analysis or does not make sense,  you can set a specific number k, Biopano will search and show the k shortest routes for you.
3. BLAST
By BLAST method, Biopano finds E.coli K-12 gene highly similar to the injected sequence.  These genes are regulated by other parts in E.coli K-12, so can provide information of the host environment’s impact on injected  exogenous sequence. Biopano also offers BioBrick helper, enabling you search all kinds of BioBricks on iGEM’s official website.  By BLAST analysis, it helps you design correct gene route with appropriate BioBricks.
4. Data Sharing
Hence, while offering various functions, Biopano also serves as a cooperative network building platform. When you create a project, you can add new nodes, name new biological parts and"

2.From the second question, we knew more than half of the public don’t know any about the window period. We thought this could be the normal phenomenon because this word is a kind of specialized.
3.The third question can reflect that only a small number of people know about the benefits of blood donation, most of them were just heard a little bit about it before, even some people think that blood donation is bad for their health, we were really concerned about this opinion.
4.The forth question is about whether healthy people would like to donate. We first thought that there would be a large number of people would like to join in the blood donation. By the contrast, the result was not as optimistic as we thought. There are only one third of the people would like to do so, and most of the public just not so sure about it or even totally refused.
From these results, we found that not so many people know about the blood donation well and there still was a large number of people held some perceptions. We started to think that maybe the shortage of blood supply mainly caused by the prejudice appeared among the public.
Integrated and Gold
In order to deeply understand how the blood being processed from the donors to the hospitals, our team visited the Blood Center of Shandong province. We were showed around the building and laboratories. The labs there use negative pressure to keep the environment safe and clean. And some detections can achieve automation, which can prevent some man-made operation. Therefore, some pollution possibility can be reduced. The automated equipment is very convenient, not only can save much more time, but also keep the tests into a sterile environment. So，the tests can be more accurate. All the processes of testing are traceable. Each blood sample has a barcode, which can correspond to the donor, the data of each step must be recorded, and stored in the computer system. This makes the blood use traceable for the source of problem.
After the visit, our team members had an interview with the expert of the blood center. We also understand the detections taken in the blood center, and some detections are performed two times. The five main detections are as follows:
Markers of HIV, including HIV antibody and nucleic acid.
Markers of HBV,"

The Project
Project
Our team’s project is Dr. Coli, an E. coli bacterium that produces a drug when and where it is needed in the human body. It does this in an intelligent way"
UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," solving these differential equations paying attention to these policies. This code runs a simulation of 30 generations of E. coli. The unit of time is hour and the unit of concentration is μM. One step of Euler approximating is 0.72 second.
Using this tool, we tried various parameter sets and searched for the parameter sets which make the expression loop successful. The order of each parameter is estimated referring to various literature ( Parameter Estimation ).
Also, we estimated parameters using the data obtained from our experiment ( Parameter Fitting ).
Result and Discussion
The model of the genetic circuit we designed generated correct loops under certain parameters sets and did not generate under other parameters sets.
Therefore, it seems theoretically possible for the genetic circuit designed in our project to behave as expected.
For example, the result of simulation using certain parameters ( Parameter Set A in Section 4 ) is below.
The code (samplechart.java) simulates behavior of 30 generations, so if ten loops of three generations (GFP dominant, RFP dominant and CFP dominant) appears, it means the genetic circuit works successfully. In this graph, there are ten peaks of GFP concentration (green curve), RFP concentration (red curve) and CFP concentration (blue curve). Therefore, it is appropriate to judge that the loop works as designed.
On the other hand, under certain different parameters ( Parameter Set B in Section 4 ), the result of this simulation became the graph below.
In this graph, each curve does not have just ten peaks. It follows that under this parameter set, the loop designed does not work, that is, the genetic circuit does not function as intended.
Stability Analysis of Expression Loops
Aim
We judged whether the expression loops were generated successfully or not, on the basis of the graph outputted by our simulation tool mentioned in the former section. However, this way of judgement is objectively doubtful slightly since there are not mathematical criteria to judge. Also, judging with our human eye is too laborious to analyze exhaustively. To show the stability of gene expression loop requires more mathematical evidence. We conducted an objective analysis of the stability of the loop. If a tool is developed which outputs the result of stability analysis according to the inputted parameters, it helps us to judge the stability of genetic circuit (whether the loop is stable independently of initial states and perturbation of concentration of the factors) under various parameter sets and choose the factor to use in the genetic circuit. So we developed the tool.
Method
We developed a tool which judges the stability of gene expression loop mathematically using a parameter set mentioned in “method” paragraph"

What kind of cells should we use in experiment?  The research interest of Prof. Ding is microbial molecular genetics and synthetic biology. In the early stage of our project design, we consulted Prof. Ding about the carriers built by the system. In terms of this direction,  he gave us suggestions that the system is more suitable to be built in eukaryotic cells and in this way it is likely to have a higher prospect of success in application. Therefore, we chose 293T and Hela cells to build STEP system.
Prof. Dr. Jiang Zhong Executive Director of Department of Microbiology and Microbiology Engineering School of life sciences, Fudan University
Which track should STEP be applied to, therapy or diagnositics? In the brainstoming stage of our project design, we considered using our core receptor system to detect cancer or thrombotic diseases. Prof. Zhong believed that the current methods for the detection of common diseases were mostly based on colloidal gold test paper. However, for specific diseases such as cancer, blood is usually drawn for blood test. The relevant technology has matured with low detection cost. Such a receptor system may be overqualified if it only aim at detecting the occurrence of a disease. Therefore, he proposed that it would be more promising for us to apply our STEP system into a therapeutic project instead of a diagnostic one.
Prof. Dr. Li Chen Distinguished Professor of Fudan University Inventor of first rapid detection kit for salivary-oral pathogens Former technical supervisor of Japan GC Company
Which cancer would be our target? After we introduced our project's design and execution, Prof. Chen commended the originality of the idea of our STEP system, and pointed that the the the tools for researching the system can be enriched further. Moreover, he recommended that we could focus on a more specific and clinical situation, which may make it more attractive to those potential investors. Prof. Chen, who has an education background in biology, once worked in pharmaceutical company and now proceeds research for clinical medicine. From his perspective, figuring out a reliable solution to a single problem is more worthy than a hazy answer to a universal question. Thanks for his working experience in medicine industry, we turned our attention to a specific disease, named ""Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"", as the concentration of D-Dimer and VEGF in blood has a strong correlation with it.

ICP is a pregnancy-specific liver disorder characterized by pruritus (intense itch) an abnormal liver function - The dysfunction of maternal liver could induce stress on the fetal liver as the fetus relies on maternal liver to remove bile. It has been shown that ICP pregnancies are more likely to suffer from meconium staining of the amniotic fluid (MSAF), cardiotocography (GCT) abnormalities and respiration distress syndrome (RDS). - The risk of complications such preterm labor, prenatal death and stillbirth are directly linked to severity of ICP - The morbidity of ICP is geographically and racially dependent.

Mechanism: FXR based activation: - use eukaryotic transcription factors in bacterial gene expression - suggested use of FXR (known structure and DNA sequence) with constitutive promoter expression - a receptor protein of a number of bile acids, which would bind to ligand-bile acid - can act as a repressor or an activator, we would use it as an activator, binding to a promoter region B4-BARE (2.4kb) taken from a gene UGT2B4, (known primers for promoter region) - specified exact FXR binding site, therefore possibility of integrating FXR binding site into another regulatory region - upon binding to bile acid it would activate output gene - In the experiment using FXR as transcription factor in human cells 30mM DCA was used, however presumably lower concentration should be sufficient for triggering of FXR.
Output: - GFP: fluorescence = light indicator = hard to quantify - ligaments: colour = clear indicator = influenced by the red colour of blood cells = cell free mechanism for hospital use = accurate measurement = filter/ membrane mechanism for home use - protein expressed on surface of bacteria causing aggregation (either of bacteria or of bacteria to a substance in blood)
Modelling: - Binding of activator to GFP gene is a positive cooperative reaction. - Once activator molecule is bound to the enzyme, its affinity for other activator molecules increases. - Hence, Hill equation can be used as a model.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#PolicyAndPractices#artificialcell_-_-_TEXT.html," the pure focus on the control and goals of the humans.
On the one hand the term ""living machine"" generates an ethical problem, for the reason that it reduces living organisms to their purpose and implies a total control of created existence. Man breeds and keeps animals for the purpose of procuring food, which includes utilization and control of these creatures. There is an analogy to the organisms of the synthetic biology, however in synthetic biology humans appear as self-creators. Synthetic biology aims the creation of new organisms, in which the structures and properties are artificially defined by man whereas breeding and keeping animals is still subordinated through evolution.
On the other hand, ""living machine"" belies the fact that, due to a lack of understanding any intervention in the genome can indeed provide the desired functionality, but might also have not foreseeable effects. A feature of living cells is the interaction with the environment. It is difficult to assess the impact such interaction for the environment is as expected.
Furthermore, it has to be noted that currently it is possible to manipulate and utilize unicellular organisms, however in the future it is also conceivable to engineer higher organisms. The designation of ""living machines"" then abates these creatures to their pure function.
The concept of ""living"" and ""non-living"" organisms create a hybrid of both and does not answer which properties apply to these exactly. This might implicate associations about properties and facts which do not match the actual conditions in these organisms. Furthermore, the linguistic imprecision could have an effect on future ethical debates since it can open up possibilities for interpretation.
This has, under the assumption of a future ""minimal cell"" the result of changing perspective on life itself. The clear distinction between animate and inanimate is repealed, life as a laboratory adjustable process is demystified.
Artificial or artificially generated - The „artificial cell“
An often used term in synthetic biology besides ""living machines"" is ""artificial cell"" or ""synthetic cell"". Both terms mean artificial, constructed, pseudo and pose as the opposite of ""natural"" (Oxford dictionary).
It should be noted what is exactly characterize as an ""artificial"" cell, as the term has no clear semantic boundaries. The laboratory-designed organisms are made as well as natural cells of organic material and have cellular structures. “Natural"" cell carry the DNA or RNA necessary for reproduction, evolution, and metabolism information as well as the “artificial cell”.
The artificiality of the cells lies precisely in the laboratory completed synthetic production method, which is why they can be labeled as ""genetic artificiality"" (Birnbacher 2006).

Another Composite Part : shTERT+tRNA
BBa_K1722011
shTERT is a cancer specific promoter improved from hTERT promoter. shTERT promoter. The tRNA that is expressed by tRNA gene has CUA as its anticodon, which can pair with the amber mutated stop codon UAG in the mRNA chain to continue the translation of the amber mutated mRNA. Together with BBa_K1722007 and BBa_K1722012, this genetic circuit can specifically recognize bladder cancer cells and express the therapeutic gene out.
Another Composite Part : SV40+Rluc
BBa_K1722012
SV40 is a well-known strong promoter achieved from 2015 iGEM submission kit. Rluc is a widely used reporter gene which can produce Renilla Luciferase. However, different from normal Rluc reporter gene, this one is being amber mutated and the mRNA chain being transcriped out has a terminator inside it. In this way, the whole chain of Renilla Luciferase cannot be translated in natural condition. Only with two other composite parts of our project (BBa_K1722010& BBa_K1722010) can Renilla Luciferase protein being produced.

Blocked slide with a flowcell that has diamonds. Air-bubbles adhere to the diamonds
Zoomed version of air-bubbles adhering to the PDMS diamonds
The same slide, now on a flow cell that has no diamonds. The Bubbles remain, showing that the hydrophobic PDMS remain on the slide and hinder flow into the chamber
Testing flow-mechanics when the whole slide was in contact with PDMS Slides 121 and 314 were plasma activated and stamped. The backside of a flow chamber was put on S121 after stamping, to see whether we're able see a difference in how the cell is flooded if the whole slide is hydrophobic. For Slide 314 the back side of a flow-chamber was put on the slide before stamping.
Slide 121: The flooding worked fine, no air-bubbles stuck to the diamonds. The machine broke down after flooding, therefore we manually incubated with Strep-Cy5 and measured fluorescence.  ⇒ Conclusions: The flooding of stamps works better if PDMS had contact with the whole slide. The stamped protein remains on the slide, even though a PDMS slide was put on top of it. This might be usefull when stamping difficult stamps (DIAChip logo)
Slide 314: The fluorescence was far lower and the slide hardly visible, which indicates that stamping after contact with PDMS is not very efficient.
24.05.2015 - S121 was stamped with bBSA, then the back-side of a PDMS flow cell was put on the slide. The flooding showed no bubbles sticking to stamp or diamonds. Fluorescence shows that bBSA did not disassociate when the backside of the flow cell was put on the slide
Slide 314 - The backside of a PDMS flow cell was put on the plasma activated slide, then it was stamped with bBSA (reverse order than S121) - little fluorescence visible, bBSA did not bind to the glass

We can correct for these effects by applying a mask over the genome which takes into account the amount of RNA transcripts for each position. Moreover, our simple sample preparation method for gene amplification (RPA) and in vitro transcription are able to specifically amplify a region of interest at least 452 times ( notebook of sample prep 15-08-2017). This amplification changes the ratio between true and false positive output probabilities (by the same factor of 452) in favour of on-targeting (Figure 8). We can incorporate this amplification factor in a generalized version of $P_{FP}$: $P_{FP}'$ and we call the amplification factor α:
$$ P_{FP}' = \frac{1}{1+\frac{\alpha \sum_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}} \tag{9}$$
From our experiments, we estimate α$=452$. In the case of no amplification, we can set α$=1$. The amplification step improves the reliability of the system from 10% up to 40-95%, even in the case of higher mismatch tolerance ($\Delta C=0.30$,$\Delta I=0.85$)
Figure 8: Reliability of a positive output for crRNA 1 to 4 on the genomes of four organisms. Reliability of positive output as represented by the ratio between the probability of a true positive output (blue) as compared to a false positive output (orange). Simulation with $\Delta C=0.30$,$\Delta I=0.85$. We take into account a 452-fold amplification of the on-target signal as a result of the gene amplification and in vitro transcription. For each crRNA, the different bars represent the E. coli genome, S. aureus genome, S. epidermis genome and Bos taurus chr. 27 from left to right respectively. The reliability of the system is improved from less than 10% to 40 to 95%.
As such, gene amplification and sensitivity not only increase the sensitivity of the detection method, these two steps in sample preparation also reduce the probability of false positive results and thereby increase the reliability of the detection system. We can now simulate $P_{FP}^\textrm{'}$ for different ratios between on- and off-target cleavage probabilities, and determine the amplification factor required to achieve reliable detection above a desired threshold $\beta$ (Figure 9). Analytically, this ampl"

In our interview, Dr. Evans talked about her inspiration, the generally encouraging feedback about projects, challenges the class met, and what the next steps would be for the class projects. She also provided contacts for more recycling people in the community and insight based on her experience on probable responses to the three proposed implementation methods for our project.
Skype Call with University of Michigan Team - 7/25/18
Ariel and Brittany met with University of Michigan iGEM team on video call to talk with them about their project. They were working with a Cas9 system and had questions about how it could be modeled. We were able to give them initial steps on approaching the problem and explained mass-action kinetics to them. After the meeting, we followed up with an email with resources we used for our model and a presentation breaking down simple generic examples of genetics and enzyme kinetics.
Follow up with Michigan State Team - 7/31/18
On July 31st, Brittany, Ariel, and Elisa did a follow up meeting with the iGEM team from Michigan State University to talk about the model we created for them. They understood the model presentation we created and sent to them, so they had few questions. We are going to stay in contact in case they encounter questions about running the code and/or finding parameter values. We also discussed new collaboration ideas for them to help us get parts into our plasmid. As the lab work has not progressed to the point where we can use their scanning electron microscope, they are willing to try helping us get plasmid 1 created using Gibson Assembly.
Skype Call with Yale Team - 8/6/18
Kaylee, Brittany, and Ariel skyped with the Yale iGEM team to talk about our projects. Both of our teams are making cells that secrete the enzymes PETase and MHETase to break down PET plastic. They have had more success in the lab than we have, so we were able to ask some questions about how they got their plasmid working. They also suggested we try Gibson Assembly and ligation independent cloning for our plasmid. Additionally, they told us they were finding more success with the yebF secretion tag than some of the others they had tried, like our pelB secretion tag. We were able to answer some questions for them about the modeling we had done, our outreach plans, and other work on our wiki.

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," able to have continual workshops every week from July 11th- August 12th, 2011. This was done with the recruitment of volunteers who again shared the same passion as we did in connecting with our community to facilitate that baseline knowledge; to get students introduced or even extend their knowledge on the world of synthetic biology and biotechnology.
The first activity for Grades 3-4 was called, “All About Bacteria: Do You Really Need to Wash Your Hands?” In this activity we introduce kids to the idea of biology, bacteria, synthetic biology, and iGEM. We also introduce them to basic ideas of sanitary techniques and tools used in a standard lab such as petri plates, agar, swabs etc. and how to layout an experiment; what is your hypothesis, results and conclusions? Once we discuss these basic concepts we allow the kids to take a swab of their hand and plate it on half of a petri dish. They then clean their hands with sanitizer and swab the other half of the petri dish. They then receive another petri dish where they can swab other places to find other ‘neat’ bacteria that may be lying around on the floor, counters, door knobs or wherever else they want (except up their nose, in their eyes, ears or mouth!). At this point and throughout the activity, interaction with the kids is key, as they always have stories or thoughts and experiences that are enlightening to share- even to us university students.
Once we explain what incubation is, we allow kids to come in the next day and see all the different types of bacteria that may have grown on their petri plates and come up with conclusions from the results they have seen. We provide them with a record sheet where they are able to write down what they saw such as; morphology, colour, its surface and even elevation. To be able to interact with kids at such a young age and to introduce them to concepts which students are normally exposed to in higher grades, allows them to explore a part of their world that they never knew existed. Building curiosity at a basal level helps us connect with our community and bridge the gap towards making more informed decisions.
The second activity for Grades 5-6 was called, “DNA Extraction from Your Cheeks”. This activity centers around the idea of DNA, where it is found, what it looks like and how every living organism contains very similar genomes, proteins and enzymes. There were four steps to this process, first to collect cheek cells, second to burst cells open to release DNA, third to separate DNA from proteins and debris and finally isolate the"

During the White Crabapple Season Open Day, we invited the Team Nankai_China to participate in our activities. We visit the campus of Tianjin University and our labs together, then have in-depth and friendly exchanges, laying a solid foundation for our future cooperation.
With blooming Begonia flowers, we wondered in campus and enjoy the sunshine. It is the first time we meet while we got on like a house on fire. It was the day of Tianjin University Open Day with amounts of interesting activities. With our commentate, our new friends refreshed their imagine about Tianjin University.
Then we went to our laboratory and have short communication about our labs, experiments and other issues about the preparation in the initial stage of iGEM. Both each other learned a lot.

2. About modeling
Here are some equations we write with NKU to model the uptake of exogenously added AI-2 by each plasmid in AI-2 Consumer Device pLsrACDBFGK interrelated to their project.
To ‘quench’ AI-2 signal in the nature or artificial environment, NKU_China constructed six AI-2 Consumer Devices by overexpression the components responsible for AI-2 uptake (lsrACDB), phosphorylation (lsrK) and degradation (lsrFG).
Matlab Simulations of AI-2 Consumer Devices were given for a better understanding of how the devices work when exogenously AI-2 was added.

IMPACT
Even though we can’t implement our project in an actual wastewater treatment system, we still wanted to make a difference! We decided on two areas where we could make an immediate impact: 1) Raising funds for a water purification charity (Water is Life), organizations that emphasize on environmental protection (Taiwan Environmental Protection Union) and 2) Creating an action plan to highlight current obstacles in effective nanoparticle regulation and propose new policy solutions.

In order to make the public have a better understanding of synthetic biology and IGEM, we held two opening activities which were reported in several media outlets to make our activities more widely known.
White Crabapple Season Open Day：
On 4rd April 2017, Tianjin University opened its doors to the general public for its sixth White Crabapple Season Open Day, where this year we hosted a stand. Over 30,000 people entered our campus throughout the day and visited our Science Popularization Stand.
In this opening day, we designed three sections of the game,which includes cartoon intestinal bacteria coloring, blood test principle showing experiment, optical microscope observation. Cartoon intestinal bacteria coloring is easy to let everyone know the types of intestinal bacteria and the main morphological characteristics, and in the coloring process , our team members introduce some biology knowledge to joiners so that they could know more about synthetic biology and IGEM. Blood type test principle showing experiment, is to show people the principle of the reaction of antigen antibody binding , which lets people know through  using synthetic biology what interesting things we can do.At the same time, our team members introduce our idea in testing BV from sick birds to joiners to help them to understand our project more. Optical microscopy observation is to make more people interested in microscopic life, so they are more motivated to learn more.
In our activities, the Nankai University IGEM team are enthusiastic to participate in our activities, which makes our activities more exciting. We are really thankful to them.
The lecture of iGEM：
To get more students to learn about synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a lecture on iGEM at the school of Life Sciences.
In order to make our propaganda more targeted, we held a lecture facing the students especially those major in biology. We introduced synthetic biology and iGEM briefly. Indeed, the lecture has received brilliant results as we expected. Many listeners expressed great interests in synthetic biology and asked questions actively. Some of them even expressed their great desire to participate in the iGEM next year. We realized that we all have a deeper comprehension of iGEM in the process of our interpretation"

DH5α T9002, 10E-6M AHL, Bright Field
DH5α T9002, 10E-6M AHL, GFP
10th September - 16th September
We received strains from iGEM HQ transformed with the following biobricks: J37015, pSB1A3, I731014, T9002, E0840.
The AHL test used to verify the activity of our T9002-transformed DH5α cells was repeated (see protocols page) to test the I731014 and T9002 strains provided by iGEM.  We used pSB1A3-transformed strains as our control.  Both test strains displayed fluorescence at both 10-6M and 10-8M AHL, whilst no fluorescence was detected in the negative control.  The proportion of total I731014-transformed bacteria that actually fluoresced was quite low however.  (T9002 fluorescence, in contrast, was near to 100% of total bacteria in the sample that was viewed).
Plasmid mini-preps and restriction digests were performed to test the identity of the plasmids.  Single and double digests were carried out for each biobrick.  The results for T9002 and E0840 were as expected and corresponded to the part sequence data.   Both the single and double digests for J37015, however, produced only one band – all running just above the 2000bp marker.  SpeI was used in both the single and double digest and according to the sequence data cuts once in the plasmid containing the J37015 part (pSB1A2).  HindIII was the second restriction enzyme used in the double digests and should cut once in the J37015 part.  We concluded from this information that the J37015 part is not in the plasmid – and the resulting single band corresponds to the linearised pSB1A2 plasmid! The digests for pSB1A3 and I731014 were rather confusing.  We don’t know what went wrong here, especially as we had shown previously in the AHL test that the I731014 part appears to be functioning.
This week we also started on the road to making our first biobricks.  The CpxR promoter was cloned out of the TR235 and MG1655 genomes, and was verified on a gel after restriction digest."

Introduction: Composite part consists of a composite promoter (BBa_K608351)and hokD (BBa_K1497008).Composite promoter (BBa_K608351) is a part of CIλrepressor system.When the temperature is raised to 42°C, CIλrepressor can not bind with promoter ,then hokD gene will be expressed to kill the bacteria.
Qualitative measurement
After 16h incubation of E.coli with device BBa_K1919100 at 30℃, we take 1ml culture in 2ml EP tube and incubate one night .We use Methylene blue solution to identify the difference between 30℃ team and 42℃ team.The result shows that 42℃ team bacteria were almost died and dyed with Methylene blue when 30℃team bacteria survived.
Quantitative measurement
1) OD600:We build two kinds of plasmids to test the expression of temperature-sensitive device(BBa_K1919100-team and BBa_K1919100 with reporter E0450-RFP team).Comparing the same E.coli strain, . Despite of the temperature factor, the OD 600 of 30℃team and 42℃team all rose before 10 hours. Then 30℃team remained the same trend until 14 hours and have a platform for 8 hours then rose again to OD600 1.6. But the 42℃team’s OD 600 showed a significant decline after that rise phase during 10 to 14 hours and then grown steadily.
The OD 600 of 30℃team-RFP and42℃team-RFP also rose before 10 hours together. Then the The OD 600 of 30℃team-RFP held this trend and rose until 14 hours then it still rose in a more gentle way. But the OD 600 of 42℃team-RFP showed a steady trend after 10 hours and grew slightly.
The result of control team shows normal  BL21 strains have a similar K-value in different temperature in 23 hours. Compared with BL21 which has lysis system, we can assure that temperature sensitive lysis system has worked.

PstI restriction site (expand)
The original sequence used for primer design has a PstI restriction site, but our sequencing results suggests that there is no such site. The sequence confirmed pSB1C3-nitroreductase was digested with PstI and run alongside an undigested sample.

Characterisation
Specific activity- BS-nitred
Before cloning the nitroreductase gene into the BioBrick vector, 3 different plasmids containing 3 nitroreductase genes with different promoters (and a control containing no nitroreductase gene) were used to test nitroreductase specific activity. The method is detailed in the methods section.
The change of NADH concentration was estimated by the change of OD340 absorbance per minute, background is subtracted and specific activity calculated. The results are presented in the diagram below. The experiment was done in triplicate. The control only had DMSO instead of DNBA substrate(which was used dissolved in DMSO) showed no change in absorbance (data not shown).
Figure 8: Comparison of the specific activity of 3 nitroreductase genes in different vectors with different promoters and control. Error bars show the standard error of the mean.
BS-nitred was used further for characterisation experiments as it showed the highest specific activity.
Specific activity- Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase in pSB1C3
Specific activity was assessed in the BioBricked nitroreductase using the same method.The results are shown in the diagram below. The experiment was done in triplicate.
Figure 9: Comparison of the specific activity of the BioBricked nitroreductase gene and control under induced and uninduced conditions (+ and - IPTG respectively). Error bars show the standard error of the mean.
This graph shows that only the Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase with IPTG induction shows nitroreductase activity. In addition, this activity is similar to the nitroreductase in the BlueScript vector(diagram above).

Human Practices Summary
Our project encompassed three areas within human practices: research, impact, and outreach. Each allowed us to better understand our project as well as help the community become a part of our experiments. We met with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), lawyers, conventional farmers, professors, environmental scientists, global agriculture specialists, bioethicists, organic farmers, biotechnology companies, and entrepreneurs to change our project based on regulations and professional opinions. We then gathered the thoughts, opinions, and concerns of community members, raised awareness of GMO foods, and invited the community to engage in conversation on a hot topic.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to the different species involved in the pheromone pathway. The model relies upon the work of Kofahl and Klipp [1], whose model of this pathway has been used extensively by many iGEM teams throughout the years and has produced good results [4,5,6]. The model is very detailed and involves 36 different species with almost 50 reactions between them [1]. The modeling part of the project uses all of the ODEs and parameter from their original paper, along with other ODEs stated in Table 3.
Figure 1.The reaction network used in the model by Kofahl and Klipp [1].
As seen in the bottom right corner of Figure 1, the cascade ends with an activation of Ste12 which makes it possible for it to bind into DNA and begin transcriptional activation. This was therefore used as a first step into validating the function of the biosensor. The concentration of Ste12 should be higher in lung cancer patients compared to healthy people, due to the fact that they produce a higher amount of VOCs that can activate the pheromone pathway [7]. To check this, data on different VOC levels was used, both in in lung cancer patients and compared to a healthy control group and a group consisting of smokers [7]. The data of the median level of each group is presented in Table 1 and consists only of n-octanal levels. The choice of only studying the n-octanal levels is due to the fact that no data (kinetic rates v1 to v5 in Kofahl and Klipp’s model, see Figure 1) is available for the two receptors used in this project, thus the 2-butanone levels were omitted. The original yeast parameters of these reactions were used together with the n-octanal concentrations from the three patient groups.
Table 1. Median n-octanal level values for different patient groups [7].
Patient group (n=12)
Controls
Smokers
Lung cancer patients
Median n-octanal values (nmol/L)
0,011
0,006
0,052
Given these assumptions, the simulation for the Ste12 concentration can be run on the three different patient groups, which gives the result presented in Figure 2a. Even though the n-octanal level is about five times higher in lung cancer patients compared to the controls, this only leads to a 50% increase in peak Ste12 concentration. To study whether this affected expression of Cre recombinase another ODE was added into the system, see Table 2, that models binding"

Human Practice Start-up Kit
Start-up Kit is the first comprehensive and handy tool that aims to help iGEM teams - particularly the new iGEMers, in initiating new human practice projects. Not only it gives iGEMers a quick guide to begin with, but also provides them with a preliminary concept of human practice and analyzed data regarding the past projects, which will give teams a jumpstart to flexibly come up with their own novel human practice project.
HKUST iGEM 2014 team spent nearly the whole summer to collect informations from all human practice projects done in the past. This large set of data was used as a base for the handbook, report, interview and the search engine. The serves exist to interpret and use the database in a different way. For instance, the database is condensed into simple numbers in the handbook to represent frequency of types of projects done in the past. Report, on the other hand, report incorporate the data to observe the general trend regarding human practice projects throughout the iGEM history. Interview questions were formed to show iGEM judges’ view on the previously done projects. Last but not least, search engine helps to find the desired information from the mass database more easily. However, due to the complexity and high level of computer coding knowledge required to build the search engine, we decided to reach out for help.  Kevin Christian Wongso, a graduate of the HKUST class 2014, who has a bachelor degree in computer science has lent us a helping hand. Thanks to his help, now users are able to search for information they want by simply typing a few keywords.

This many molecules are computationally demanding to keep track of and the diffusion of these molecules through the cell membrane is relatively fast [3] . To simplify, lower, constant concentrations and higher propensity functions were used. A possible problem with this simplification is greater fluctuations than a more realistic model.
In general, the models seems to be too sensitive with small stimulations giving very large effects. A possible reason is that the values we used for the translation rates are too high, as these are estimates. Another possibility is that the propensity for mRNA decay are more different between deterministic models, as in the references, and stochastic models than expected. This was especially the case for the lux promoter.
All the equations in the model assumed mass action. For the details and parameters used in the model, see Equations .

Lld promoter
In E. coli, the Lld promoter regulates the metabolism of l-Lactate [4] . Two proteins involved in metabolism as well as the regulatory protein LldR is induced by the presence of lactate. LldR in solution will form dimers that will bind to two sites on the promoter DNA. This will block RNA polymerase from binding to the DNA, possibly with a looping structure [4] . If l-Lactate is present in sufficient quantities, it will bind to the LldR dimer and cause a reconformation of the complex. This activates the promoter. A similar system is found in Corynebacterium Glutamicum [5] .
We isolated the promoter part of the operon and coupled it to expression of the LuxI protein from V. Ficheri [6] . As LldR is already present in E. Coli, it was assumed to have an initial concentration as well as a constant production and degradation. A more realistic system could have included a self regulating feedback system, but this would further complicate the model without necessarily increasing the descriptive accuracy.
Binding to the promoter was modelled as LldR in solution forming dimers that could bind to the promoter. Lactate would then bind to the dimer, either in solution or bound to DNA. This gave a quite reasonable behaviour in the presence or absence of lactate, but other paths are also possible. We were not able to find any detailed description of the mechanism.
The plots show the production of the LuxI protein as a response to the presence of lactate. The plot on the left shows a system with a quite low concentration of lactate, 10 in the"

Purpose
Separation and identification of our non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) products, was determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-QTOFMS). NRPS variants were identified by changes in mass/z and column retention time. 
Development of a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spec (MALDI-TOF-MS) method, will allow for a more rapid future analysis of oligo-recombineered strains, producing a library of NRPS antibiotic products. DTU’s 2015 iGEM team was able to, with the assistance of the DTU Metabolomics Platform group, which specializes in analytical chromatography (and is recognized in our attributions page ), and with the assistance from our advisor, to produce a protocol for lysing of the cells, and extraction of the tyrocidine and surfactin molecules, before they were run on the liquid chromatography mass spec (LCMS) for analysis.
Achievements

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Hoax_-_-_TEXT.html," Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student, gathered petitions to ban ""DHMO"" as the basis of his science project, titled ""How Gullible Are We?"" [2]
Jackson's original site included the following warning: [7] [8] Template:Quote frame
A mock material safety data sheet —a list of information about potentially dangerous materials used in research and industry—has also been created for H2O. [9] [10]
Molecular terminology and naming conventions
The water molecule has the chemical formula H2O, meaning each molecule of water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Literally, the term ""dihydrogen monoxide"" means ""two hydrogen, one oxygen"", consistent with its molecular formula: the prefix di- in dihydrogen means ""two"", the prefix mon- in monoxide means ""one"", and an oxide is a compound that contains one or more oxygen atoms. [11]
Using chemical nomenclature , various names for water are in common use within the scientific community. Some such names include hydrogen oxide, as well as an alkali name of hydrogen hydroxide, and several acid names such as hydric acid, hydroxic acid, hydroxyl acid, and hydroxilic acid. The term ""hydroxyl acid"" used in the original text is a non- standard name. [12] Template:Failed verification
Under the 2005 revisions of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry , there is no single correct name for every compound. [13] The primary function of chemical nomenclature is to ensure that each name refers, unambiguously, to a single substance. It is considered less important to ensure that each substance should have a single name, although the number of acceptable names is limited. [13] Water is one acceptable name for this compound, even though it is neither a systematic nor an international name and is specific to just one phase of the compound. The other IUPAC recommendation is oxidane. [14]
Public efforts involving the DHMO hoax
Template:Refex
In 1989–1990, several students circulated a dihydrogen monoxide contamination warning on the University of California, Santa Cruz campus via photocopied fliers. [4] [15]

The Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide website was created by Dan Curtis Johnson ; partly as a foil on the Coalition page, claiming to oppose its ""sub"
Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#NahumNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," while working. I learned that headphones impeded my ability to communicate with my fellow lab mates. After working on the touch surfaces, I was allowed some time to meet with my “mini-team” to discuss the topic we would be working on for the brainstorming phase of the competition. I will be focusing on the electronic lab notebook for the next two weeks! A little later, I enjoyed my first lab Starbucks run of the summer. Around 3pm , we all head over to Microsoft to get a tutorial with some of the new tablet and Windows 8 technology. The trip was great. I had the opportunity to get a peep into the operations of a huge corporation while also learning a lot of new things about different software technologies. I will admit though, at points I felt very confused with some of the topics that the software developers were talking about. Being a biologist and a computer science lab wil be very interesting this summer…
Jun 5: A day in the wet lab
In an MIT Wet Lab
Today I did not have to make the commute to Wellesley because we had our workshop on MIT’s campus with one of my previous professors. The purpose of the workshop was to give the computer scientists a taste of what synthetic biology is all about. We reviewed some basic biological concepts, looked at previous iGEM projects, and did some wet lab work. I was much more knowledgeable on the material we studied today and found myself being a source of help for a lot of my labmates. This team is interesting because we are all very intelligent but hold very different academic strengths. It’s a very useful and humbling experience to be dependent on your teammates for certain topics while being depended on for others. It makes for a very collaborative environment.
June 6: The Research Begins
This morning and afternoon was dedicated to doing research on the electronic notebook. It was nice to have so many other people in the lab during the hours of research because researching for hours can get monotonous and tiring. Whenever I needed a break from the work, I could just close my laptop for a few minutes and talk to one of my fellow labmates. At 3pm, I had my first meeting with Orit Shaer, the PI for our lab, to discuss some of my thoughts on the electronic notebook. She was very helpful in making me see the bigger picture of the project rather than getting bogged down in the specifics of one technical aspect of the notebook or another. I left the meeting with a more refined direction for my research.

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.
Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can"

Researched about different assays for material testing
Monday, June 27th
Contacted 3M again, they are sending us the samples (YES). They should be here by the end of next week.
Dow Corning will send the adhesives on 29th of June
Today the device team focused on the math model for diffusion as weird numbers for the initial amount of peptides that needs to be produced have been calculated. Noshin found a paper with a MATLAB code that can be used to calculate the diffusion across a membrane using Fick’s second law of diffusion. An email was sent out to Dr. Nygren to get his opinion on the code and see if we are heading in the right direction
UPDATE: We meet with Dr. Nygren Wednesday to go over the mathematical model developed. He suggested in his email that the equation is applicable in principle, but the situation is a little different because the membrane and skin surface are probably the main diffusion barriers and the diffusion constant is (very) different at those barriers compared to everywhere else. He also suggest we create a numerical method rather than doing it analytically.
Tuesday, June 28th
The device group continued to work on both learning Solidworks to build the graphical model as well as the mathematical model of the diffusion of BBI through the patch, skin and into the bloodstream.
From our results we calculated that we need 2 g of peptide being produced in the patch. This however is not feasible and needs to be reworked.
Wednesday, June 29th
Protocols Tiff and Dave talked about with Dan
Test how much media go through and if peptides go through; safety mechanism
Can we make dye as a qualitative or quantitative aspect of the assay?
How do we confirm peptides make it through?
Critical: make sure cells stay where they are, and peptides go through
There may be a big difference in terms of the diffusion constants depending on the volume, barriers, material
Dr. Nygren’s suggestions

EZNA gel extraction of C,D,E,H,J,L and N
Refer to section 1.13 of the protocol guide.
Excise bands C,D,E,H,L, and N using razor blade, and the excised agarose chunks needed to be dissolved in a minimum of 1mL of XP2 Binding Buffer per gram of gel. For instance, the heaviest band was 0.27g, requiring 0.3ml Binding Buffer to each eppendorf tube.
Restriction Digest of Gel Extracted C,D,E,H,J,L and N
Refer to section 1.2 for the protocol.
Following the gel extraction spin protocol above, extracted PCR DNA needs to be ‘cleaned up’ of restriction enzyme and agarose. The protocol for this can be found from the last enzymatic protocol in EZNA gel extraction kit. This process is to be done in 30/06 (Day 7).

Dr. Eddy Rubin, Chief Science Officer, Metabiota, San Francisco, USA Dr. Rubin has years of metagenomics under his belt, so we asked him which was better: sequencing-based or functional metagenomics? “Well, functional is great but I’m a sequencing guy... I’m interested in scalable things.” Dr. Rubin’s argument was with the advent of next generation sequencing and better DNA synthesis, you can produce terabytes of data and synthesize whatever you want from it. This is a much more scalable process, you don’t have to spend years designing functional assays. See the rest of Dr. Rubin’s interview here.
David Lloyd, Co-founder and Director, FREDsense, Calgary, Canada David Lloyd was involved in iGEM during his undergraduate degree at University of Alberta and as a mentor during his Masters degree at University of Calgary. During his time at the University of Calgary he, and a team of students, developed a biosensor which morphed into the company FREDsense. We asked for his insight on how to develop an iGEM project into a company. “Spend your time really figuring out what the value your product is going to provide to that customer base. Picking up the phone and having those conversations is really important. It was through that process […] we ended up changing the sensor we were building to look at other market opportunities.” See the rest of Dave’s interview here.
Scott Doncaster, Vice President, Manufacturing Technologies and Engineering, BioVectra, Charlottetown, Canada BioVectra is a contract pharmaceutical fermentation plant that using bacteria and fungi to produce small molecule drugs or biologics. Being in charge of manufacturing and engineering, Scott is well versed in safety practices. Although BioVectra works with BSL-1 organisms, the volume of organisms they use requires them to treat the bacteria or fungi as if they were BSL-2. We asked Mr. Doncaster what safety mechanisms must be in place for large scale fermentation to work. “Containment is key! Rooms have slanted floors so [if a spill were to happen] it all goes into a contained grate, that would get autoclaved in emergencies. The building has been built with special air circulation, sterilization tools, air locks, temperature control and much more.”

Week 6
We have a basic working Core now, using PluginManager to instantiate ClothoTools packages at runtime. I made the new Notepad and simple Kepler RMI connection.  Here is the overall picture of the new Clotho:
General picture of the new core
I also made some Kepler actors for changing spreadsheets. By this week I will have Google Spreadsheet connection and Excel file readers. I hope to make short workflows for wetlab spreadsheets.
Friday
We have a day at Stanford discussion and seminar.
Week 7
I partner up with Nina to make a Kepler workflow from her assembly automation plug-in. There will be RMI actors that connect to Clotho asembly manager to get the inital data, then some computational actors that produce the result files. And actor opening GUI user option. Didn't see it in Kepler. Why.
Week 8
Goal for this week
Make the workflow for Nina assembly automation
Have fun at the synthetic bio BBQ
Have fun working
Tuesday July 28th
I made the first GUI actor that implement my approach to workflows: two ways of runtime user input. A user can put choices as parameters for the workflow before it run. If the user doesn't know what options to choose, run the workflow and there will be dialogs pop up and ask for options, along with displaying more information about the options so the user can choose.
Friday July 31th
Last day of July!!! Two months already passed, and my productive summer almost over. There is only almost a a month left. We say goodbye to Leisa today, she did awesome work and a great member of our group. I haven't finish the workflow yet, hopefully by next week I will have a working beta flow.

+Build and save statistics from trace files
...Analyze each trace files for segments with low quality values, come up with an accurate estimation for the length of the segments.
...This statistics data will depend on some parameters: trace length, sequence length, DNA purity, GC content, sequencing company, and more

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Acceptance_-_-_TEXT.html," Idli or Dosa are not always eaten because it is the only affordable food (meaning they are not the only food basic for some populations), it is noteworthy to see that when we asked people if they ate this two food and why, they replied they liked the taste, smoothness and their special consistence. This shows that the people we asked had the choice to eat it or not.
Graphic 2: Graphic showing the most eaten ingredients per person.
When asked if they would try our idea of adding vitamin-producing bacteria, most of the people said they would try it, as long as it is harmless for human health and proven efficient. We noticed that a slight change in the making of the recipe was not a concern about the participants; a step such as adding a little cube or powder in the recipe doesn't raise issue, as long as the taste is not modified (around half of the persons said that a change in the taste for the worse would be definitely not accepted).
Conclusion :
The main concerns raised were definitely about safety, either from professionals or from citizens. In our project, we used antibiotic markers and we plan to remove them if the project go on to make it safer for consumption. The use of a microorganisms that will be steamed is also a way of making sure that there is an active sterilization and this is why idli was our first choice for the project. Food grade vector are also a good solution to ensure safety, and we consider using it if it works with our vitamin pathways, and maybe get easily to the clinical trials."

This workshop includes instructional and computational components with the focus on engineering bacteria to produce a pharmaceutical compound. The goal of this workshop was for students to develop an understanding of safely creating a GMO            and the computational skills of designing the genetic parts for a GMO’s production. The workshop            comprised of 8 sessions:
Introduction to GEMs and the Design Process -- Introduction of GEMs and discuss examples of their real-world applications, such as agricultural, medical uses and uses for biomanufacturing. Examined when and how to approach a problem using GEMs and provide the (dis)advantages of using GEMs over other existing/developing technologies.
Benchling | Projects, Plasmids and Primers -- Explain the intuition behind using Benchling, a research platform where scientists can design, share and record experiments on one interface, to manage DNA sequence-based projects. Discuss how to create projects and what exists inside a project on Benchling, what plasmids (and linear DNA fragments) look like on the software and how to manipulate them. Furthermore, introduce how to design primers to amplify a specific region of DNA, along with overhang designs for downstream work-ups.
Hunting Down and Manipulating Genes I -- Discuss project explanation and teach the use of BLASTn, BLASTp, tBLASTn, along with the use of the NCBI database and other relevant databases. Select target compounds and begin a mini work session to find a source of DNA to amplify from HEAVY on the hunt down of genes.
Hunting Down and Manipulating Genes II -- Discuss how to put together the various genes for the pathway into a plasmid-based system on Benchling. Discuss the experimental design process to help create experiments.
Metabolic Engineering -- Discuss FBA, knock-out vs knock-down strategies, and gene editing technologies (lambda red and CRISPR)
Designing for Safety and Practice -- Introduce the concept of bioengineering safety and existing pressure to ensure synthetic biology is done safely. Discuss issues with GMO release into the environment and the existing data on this. Demonstrate safety mechanisms to prevent accidental release via genetic kill switches or non-biological forms of deactivation. Discuss how one would implement the genetic kill switches and the types that exist.
Design Work Session -- Time allocated for the completion of participants’ project. Instructor available for guidance.
Presentations and Feedback -- Participants present their experimental design and rationale.

HBUT-China,2018,Team:HBUT-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," influenced by the expression of NcrB gene or its degradation process, because the speed of these two processes is relatively low compared with the competitively binding process. More importantly, based on this hypothesis, we can further assume that the concentration of free state NcrB remains constant during the process of competitive binding. This is because the kinetics feature of the process is similar to enzymatic reactions.
Notations
Ki: the reaction rate constant of each reaction
Ni: the concentration of Ni2+ inside the cell
Ne: the concentration of Ni2+ outside the cell
E: the concentration of the Ni2+ transporter protein NikABCDE
P: the promoter pncrA which binds with NcrB
B: the copy number of the recombinant plasmid in a single cell
LI: luminescence intensity
The construction and the solution of the math model
According to the hypotheses proposed above, the following dynamic
process exists inside the engineering bacteria:
1. The diffusion of Ni2+
We described this process through the differential equations below:
This system of equations is a set of first-order linear constant coefficient differential equations, and this system of equations has analytical solutions.
2. The transcription of LuxCDABE conducted by NcrB
Since the concentration of the free state NcrB remains constant, and the concentration of total NcrB is a function of the copy number of the plasmid, we can present the following equations:
Furthermore, we know that there is an equilibrium in the process of NcrB binding with Ni, which can be stated as follows:
As is proposed above, LI is linearly dependent on the number of free state promoter. That is to say,
Substitute 2.4 into 2.5, we can get the following equation:
Further substitute 2.6 into 1.4, now we have obtained the final expression of LI, in which time and the concentration of Ni2+ are the variables.
Discussion:
1. Luminescence intensity versus time curve with a constant concentration of Ni2+ ions
According to the relevant data in the literature and obtained by experimental measurements, we roughly made a function image of the brightness signal as a function of time, and the image is as follows.
2. Relationship between final luminescence intensity and Ni2+ ion

Furthermore, it might be important to consider which genes to use in the development of GMOs. As synthetic biologists we know that genes consists of four bases, Thymine, Guanine, Adenine and Cytosine, and we know that the difference between genes lies in the sequence of these four bases alone. Nevertheless specific  genes, like genes from animals, might be unethical to use in GMO’s as it would be disrespectful towards  vegans, vegetarians, religious groups etc.
Would people, who for various reasons does not eat meat, accept to eat a product containing genes from  an animal? Is the use of animal genes in GMOs a real ethical issue, or is this exclusively an example of lack  of knowledge? These questions are important for the continued research.
Would the use of GMOs in the agricultural industries have an impact on the job market or cultural traditions?
As mentioned above, genetically modified organisms can bring pivotal advantages to the agriculture and food industry. The production may expand with larger quantities and more uniform breeding,  which has worked as an encouragement of approving GMOs in the agricultural industry.

Safety consideration was our first thought, lab workers and students were all respected all the safety requirements to promote safe works not only in the lab areas but also outside the campus, for example, when we were heading for local Scottish whisky distillery and meetings with other iGEM teams, supervisors always led and guided us.
        
Safety in Collaboration
In the project collaboration with the 2018 Iowa team, one of our newly developed parts was delivered to their lab to allow further characterisation and proof of concept for our project. To do this, it was necessary for us to ship parts internationally. We followed the iGEM DNA submission requirement to send off to IOWA team, declaring in the shipment statement that the package contained ""DNA (non-hazardous, non-regulated, non-infectious, for research purposes only)"". By accomplishing these, we believe we have handled our work with our international collaborators in a safe and professional manner."
UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Spinning Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," to be bio-integrated [2] .
Silk film created by drying dialyzed silk overnight.
Material - Hydrogels
A silk hydrogel is a general term for a variety of ‘gel’ structures that can be created from silk. We chose to create a pH induced gel: the nature of this gel creates a chemically alterable microenvironment that can be tailored to optimize conditions for pharmaceuticals, tissues, or other biological agents. Biomedical applications of this technology could range from pain relievers integrated into a suture to tissue wound sealing.
Optional Processing: Lyophilization
Water can be completely removed from the dialyzed silk by the process of lyophilization, or freeze-drying. In this process, the solution is frozen by liquid nitrogen and is sublimated under vacuum for 2-3 days. This results in a pure silk powder that can be stored indefinitely. This silk powder can also be resuspended in solvents such as hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) in preparation for spinning into a fiber.
Material - Fibers
Silk fibers are the most traditional form. Fibers can be formed from silk that has gone through the lyophilization process and has been resuspended in HFIP. From resuspension, the solution is ‘spun’ into fibers, as detailed below. Silk fibers as a biomedical device are intended to be used as the structural material for scaffolds to assist with re-engineered tissues. Silk scaffolds have the ability to be integrated into bones, cartilage, vascular tissue, and even skin [3] .
Spinning Silk
In order to form fibers from silk, soluble silk protein solutions must be much like how they are in natural spider spinnerets. The majority of spinning methods entail pushing, or extruding, silk solution through very thin channels. During this extrusion, shear forces on the silk solution cause the amino acids of the proteins to align in a way that allows the strong beta sheets of the silk structure to form. Multiple proteins are similarly aligned, causing separate proteins to interact and form larger structures.
Syringe Extrusion
The standard method that we are using to produce silk fibers is syringe extrusion, in which a syringe pump forces silk dope through a small-diameter tube into a liquid isopropanol coagulation bath [1] . This method most directly emulates the process that spiders use. In a natural spider spinneret, silk solution produced in the spider's glands are forced through small-diameter spinnerets, and expelled as solid threads.
A simple syringe extruder setup. It consists of a"
