EPF_Lausanne,2014,Team:EPF Lausanne#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html,".
On August 21st, three founders/organizers of European biohackerspaces – Clément Epié ( La Paillasse Paris ), Nicolas Loubet (La Paillasse Paris and http://umaps.fr/) and Yann Heurtaux (Hackuarium Lausanne) – visited our EPFL lab. We gave them a quick introduction to our iGEM project, demonstrating our microfluidic chips, our bacteria expressing GFP and our colored agar plates. Clément, Nicolas and Yann then described the projects they are working on in their biohackerspaces. It was great fun!
The three biohackers contacted the EPFL iGEM team to build a solid link between iGEM and the biohackerspaces, as La Paillasse did with the CRI-Bettencourt team in Paris a few months ago. This new collaboration between iGEM and biohackerspaces stems from the fact that many iGEM teams give up their project once the contest is over, because they lack means and space to further pursue their goals. The Lausanne Hackuarium intends to collaborate with EPFL iGEM teams from now on to help them continue their projects by providing lab facilities and thinking spaces. Great ideas shouldn't be wasted!
We are excited at the prospect of this collaboration, and so we continue to meet occasionally with the members of Hackuarium. On the 10th of September, our team formally presented our iGEM during one of Hackuarium’s weekly open meetings. The presentation was given to about 30 collaborators from different backgrounds, including engineering, biology design and journalism. Some had never heard about iGEM, and were really enthusiastic about our project. We agreed to do a second presentation after the Jamboree to talk about the results of the project and our experience in Boston.

Killing h.p.
Our main goal is in this, eradicating from the body Helicobacter pylori that lives as the pathogen with pexiganan, which a powerful new antimicrobial peptide. In our project we use pexiganan to eradicate Helicobacter pylori because the pexiganan molecule has a powerful effect on the pathogen. Furthermore, it doesn't have a toxic effect  on our natural body cells. Pexiganan molecules’ dose for destroying erythrocytes is 250 ng/ml, the other dose for  destroying H.pylori is 16 ng/ml.
In gastric fluid acidic pH conditions, the peptide degradation speed is very high; Pepsine, the stomach’s main digestion enzyme, crushes all of the peptide structure molecules; the drug taken for gastric fluid has a very short lifetime. These are all reasons that make it difficult to set an effective dose.
Because of this reason, in our project we aim to start pexiganan synthesis only with the maximum closest reach.
We also aim to produce enough pexiganan molecules to eradicate all of the h. pylori population in the stomach.
In line with our aims;
1. With the parts described previously, our synthetic bacteria will enter into the mucosa layer where the h.pylori is in stomach.
2. We use E.coli in our treatment to continuously product DAMP-Pexiganan molecules. These continuously produce and accumulate proteins that don't have any lethal effects to the cells. Hence, DAMP-Pexiganan molecule’s active site is shut down by DAMP.( TEV protease recognition site located between the DAMP and Pexiganan molecules.) Thus, it goes to the area where Helicobacter pylori is in the stomach until the pathogen detects pexigan molecules  created by E.coli and that allow E.coli's ability to remain alive until producing enough pexiganan.
3. Due to the presence of H. pylori in the environment, extremely high concentrations of NH3 and Al2 molecules induce AND GATE the system. As a result of this activation, TEV protease molecules will be produced. The produced TEV Protease break the large amount of connections accumulated between DAMP and Pexiganan in the cells and releases pexiganan molecules. These pexiganan molecules are active lysis molecules that cause cells to splinter. For this reason, p"

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"). We experimented with different ratios between weight and PDY to find the best amount to add--while we were unable to generate a specific ratio by the end of our experimental time frame, the general consensus was the material should be damp but not soaked. Once the PDY is added to the substrate plates of mycelium were added. These plates were first divided into grids before being mixed in with the substrate in the bag. The larger the amount of substrate the larger the number of plates were added.
Once the bags were filled, they were sealed--making sure to leave plenty of air within the bag--and removed from the autoclaves. The bags were then placed in the 30°C for 1-2 weeks, depending on the rate of growth of mycelium into the substrate. Once there was a decent amount of mycelium grown the material was remixed under the laminar flow head, in order to distribute the mycelium more evenly, and then packed into molds (note that some bricks were also grown just leaving the mycelium to grow until the form was filled). There bricks were then left to fit, some in the 30oC incubator and others in a room temperature growth chamber, for another 1-2 weeks.
Once the mycelium had digested the substrate enough to form a solid block, it was removed from the mold, weighed, and baked at 120°C for several hours. Once the mycelium block was 30% of its original weight it was considered finished material.
Mycelium Glue
In designing our mycelium specific bioadhesive candidates, we looked for protein-based adhesive molecules that could be easily produced in E. coli and B. subtilis. We excluded highly glycosylated adhesive proteins as well as proteins with other significant post translational modifications (PTMs) simply because coordinating large PTMs in B. subtilis in space would be exceptionally challenging and beyond our capabilities for the summer. The last component of our criteria for identifying mycelium specific bioadhesive candidates revolved around the composition of mycelium itself. All fungus, mycelium included, contains an outer cell wall composed of chitin, which makes up the surface that would interface with the adhesive [1].
In nature, various organisms have evolved chitin-binding-domains (CBDs) that allow them to bind tightly to the fungal cell wall [2]. One of these organisms is Bacillus circulans from which we borrowed a CBD sequence [2]. Our first glue candidate uses this CBD in a fusion protein of four CBD’s with GSG"

Production
The basis of our project is the production of Mfp-5 itself. For this, we use a BioBrick made by the iGEM team of Berkeley Wetlab 2009 (BBa_K197034). They attached  Mfp-5 to various membrane proteins  with varying linkers in order to research the influence of these linkers on the activity and to find the best combination for optimization. For our project, we chose the combination with the highest activity:  Mfp-5 linked to OmpA (Outer membrane protein A) with the linker GFP-LVA

Technion_Israel,2015,Team:Technion Israel#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," a strong relationship between the human microbiome and human health and disease, new frontiers in synthetic biology have begun to emerge concomitantly. Namely, rather than engineering a single bacterium chassis as is normally done in conventional synthetic biology applications, we have opted to devise an engineering strategy for a microbiome in order to address health-related problems.
A national research program of the human microbiome has been established in the United States - The Human Microbiome Project (HMP). The goal of the HMP is to demonstrate that there are opportunities to improve human health through monitoring and/or manipulation of the human microbiome 10 . New and promising startups have been established based on the idea of the utilization and adaptation of the human microbiome to our needs. For example, AOBiome, LLC. created a dedicated line of products (named ‘Motherdirt’) - the first line of products for the skin made, which includes live bacteria incorporated into the product itself (Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria) 11 . This product was publicized extensively in the media - In “The New York Times” and “Good Morning America”. In the past several years, several other big cosmetic companies have released products incorporating natural bacteria - “Clinique Redness Solutions Makeup SPF 15” by Clinique and “Cosmeceuticals Unstress Total Serenity Serums” by Christina are few examples of this promising market 12 .
Using this trend in research and cosmetics, we decided to develop a new synthetic biology approach for engineering a microbiome. In our approach, we opt to genetically alter one or more of the bacterial populations that are naturally present to secrete a particular enzyme. Thus, on the one hand we minimally perturb the natural microbiome, while on the other we co-opt it to produce a sustainable treatment of some sort.
We decided to apply this approach on the problem of male pattern baldness.  We planned to alter the most abundant bacterium which is naturally found on our scalp (Bacillus subtilis) 15 and genetically engineer it for our needs: taking advantage of its natural protein secretion pathways in order to secrete a DHT-reducing enzyme (as will be explained in the following paragraph). This new application of the human microbiome usage is a path, in our opinion, to solve a variety of conditions and enhance overall wellness in the future.
Solution
The proposed solution is to incorporate the gene of a DHT-inactivating enzyme into a bacterium that is naturally found on our scalp (B.subtillis). These transgenic microorganisms will be applied on the patient"
NKU_China,2017,Team:NKU China#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," gene. The expression of the lyase is induced by xylose. II. Knock out the colicin gene in Enterobacter sp. FY-07 to eliminate the toxicity. The major concern is whether colicin knockout will affect the proliferation of bacterium. III. Add mf-lon ssrA tag into essential genes using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques. We can use biocontainment signal to control mf-Lon protease expression and block essential genes expression to kill bacterium upon loss of the biocontainment signal. As a matter of time, we only carried out the first strategy and successfully kill the bacterium upon applying the inducer.
3. Safe Shipping
We sent our BioBricks through the standard shipping process required by Igem headquarter.

Applied Design
Required link: 2016.igem.org/Team:Washington/Design This team can be evaluated for this prize. Please write 150 words on why you think your team is eligible for this prize:
In this project, we utilized the engineering design process to take knowledge of a specific need in industry and develop a workable solution, culminating in a functional prototype device. Culture management is a vital task in synthetic biology research labs and in industry, but constantly measuring and adjusting culture conditions is time consuming, tedious, and inefficient. We worked to develop a system using control theory that automates cell culture management by adding inducer molecules in response to RGB measurements made of a culture tube. First, we designed genetic parts using the violacein pathway, which can yield four different colored outputs in response to stimuli. Next, we designed and built a chemostat and Raspberry Pi control system that captures images of the culture tubes, computes the RGB value, and directs the gradual release of inducer chemicals in order to change or maintain a certain color value over time. Finally, we plan to use machine learning to optimize our system, collecting data to formulate relationships between the measured RGB value and metabolite concentration. We hope that this will be an affordable, easy-to-use system that allows for more efficient and precise control of cell cultures, leading to a reduction in cost and waste for labs and companies that put it to use.
Hardware
Required link: 2016.igem.org/Team:Washington/Hardware This team can be evaluated for this prize. Please write 150 words on why you think your team is eligible for this prize:
The hardware component of our project uses control theory to mediate the function of the violacein pathway by automating the addition of inducer molecules and creating a feedback loop for maintaining color levels. To do this, we built a chemostat, which is a bioreactor that keeps yeast in constant log phase by continually expelling the bulk solution while inputting new media. This allows the culture to be kept in steady-state. In addition to this culture management contraption, we also built a system for image processing and response. To control the products being made, a camera controlled by a Raspberry Pi computer will continuously take an image of our yeast cultures. Through processing RGB values, it will determine the amount of metabolite in solution and send feedback signals to the culture management system to change inducer concentration. Thus, our device measures, computes, compares, and corrects, fulfilling each"

Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:
Human error and poor technique can compromise the best of safeguards to protect the laboratory worker. Thus, a safety-conscious staff, well informed about the recognition and control of laboratory hazards, is key to the prevention of laboratory-acquired infections, incidents and accidents.
Waste Handling
Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:
The overriding principle is that all infectious materials should be decontaminated, autoclaved or incinerated within the laboratory.</p> <p>The principal questions to be asked before discharge of any objects or materials from laboratories that deal with potentially infectious microorganisms or animal tissues are:
1. Have the objects or materials been effectively decontaminated or disinfected by an approved procedure?
2. If not, have they been packaged in an approved manner for immediate on-site incineration or transfer to another facility with incineration capacity?
3. Does the disposal of the decontaminated objects or materials involve any additional potential hazards, biological or otherwise, to those who carry out the immediate disposal procedures or who might come into contact with discarded items outside the facility?

Newer PCR machines are capable of creating a temperature gradient in the wells during the annealing. This means that each tube in a row will have a different but fixed temperature. When the optimal condition for a PCR reaction are unknown this technique can be used to screen a lot of conditions during one reaction.  Here is an example of our use of a gradient PCR ( link ).

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," the mapping      of the PDE model to the agent-based model.      The latter model works with discrete objects that      have continuous coordinates, meaning that they can be located                   at any point of the domain.       As we have seen in (11), the agents need the local concentration       of AHL and leucine, as well as the gradient of leucine in        order to update their positions. In the PDE model however,       the domain is discretized into a grid and concentrations       are only defined at grid points. Therefore, in order to       transfer information from the PDE model to the agent-based        model we need to translate these grid values into values       for any given position within the domain. We achieved this        for the 1-D hybrid model by taking the two nearest grid points       to any agent and employing linear interpolation to        derive an approximate local field value. Similarly, for the 2-D       hybrid model we took the four nearest grid points                    and employed bilinear interpolation, as explained in box 3.        With the end result (B3.3), the concentration or gradient of AHL       or leucine can be derived at any point of the domain. Therefore,       the agent-based module has access to the information that it needs       from the PDE module.
Box 3: Bilinear Interpolation
Bilinear Interpolation
Interpolation is used to obtain a continuous function     when a finite amount of data points are known. Piecewise     linear interpolation is the most simple scheme to interpolate     1-dimensional data.
Figure 10
Illustration of linear interpolation. Click to enlarge.
The technique involves defining     linear functions connecting consecutive data points to fill in     the gaps, using (B3.1).
$$      \hat{f}(x)=f(x_i)+\frac{f(x_{i+1})-f(x_i)}{x_{i+1}-x_i}      \cdot (x-x_i) \; \text{for} \; x_i < x < x_{i+1} \;\;\; \text{(B3.1)}      $$
Bilinear interpolation is the generalization     of this interpolation technique to two dimensions,     illustrated using Figure 9.

Illustration of bilinear interpolation. Click to enlarge.
Let’s assume we want to interpolate     a two-dimensional function within a rectangular domain where     the function values are only known on the four adjacent grid     points $Q$. First we linearly interpolate in the x-direction on     the lines connecting $Q_{i,j}$ and"

Market Analysis
This year, the final goal of iGEM_Bit team is to provide the potential versatility, precision, and affordability of JACOB—essentially a representation of modularized biomarker detections—to ordinary communities.  Our plan is to commercialize JACOB to provide warnings for potential disease and develop a self-sustaining facility for production and further research. From market analysis, we concluded the prominent advantages of JACOB and focused on those to provide more competitive products; from direct interaction with commercial industries, we optimized JACOB's operability and compatibility with the market.

TECHNION-ISRAEL,2017,Team:TECHNION-ISRAEL#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Unfortunately, different academic schedules and a lack of time did not allow us to complete this final task.
Team Edinburgh also conducted an in-depth analysis of the synthetic biology learning process and the exchange of skills between advisors and students from different backgrounds. In an attempt to aid them, multiple members of our team wrote in depth reports concerning our personal experiences both learning and teaching different skills that were necessary for iGEM.
Collaboration with Team Tel-Hai
Our collaboration with Team Tel-Hai centered on the topic of ethics. As previously mentioned, our team wrote an ethics handbook we hoped could serve other iGEM teams. After discussing potential avenues of collaboration with team Tel-Hai we discovered that we both were dealing with significant ethical issues and could work together. We sent our ethics handbook draft to Tel-Hai, and they organized a meetup with two professors of ethics from their college. Together, with the aid of their professors, we discussed our ethical handbook, how it may be applied to their project, and the ethics of synthetic biology in general. The advice we received from their professors, as well as their valuable input, was tremendously beneficial to the final version of our ethics handbook.
Additionally, at the same meetup, we supplied team Tel-Hai with standard iGEM primers they were lacking.
IGEM Uppsala Ethics Collaboration
Team Uppsala was kind enough to organize a multi-national (5 iGEM teams from Germany, France, Netherlands, Denmark, and Israel) group discussion regarding ethics and synthetic biology. We participated in the discussion regarding “Social Responsibility.” It was truly a wonderful and eye-opening experience to discover both the similarities and differences of opinion concerning social responsibility and synthetic biology. During our discussion each team presented their project and discussed two fundamental questions in the field of social responsibility:
How can we responsibly and accurately report our project in media and inform public about the science we are doing?
Who do we want to report to? Is it other iGEM teams, journalists or general public? What is our niche?
The full discussion can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHIO7Ios2uc
Mediterranean Conference in Marseille
We received an invitation for an iGEM meet-up in Marseilles, France, organized by Team AIX .  This is the first Mediterranean conference ever held.
Even though we were in the early stages of our project, we decided to participate in this exciting conference. We thought it would be a great opportunity to discuss our idea with people from different countries and cultures. In addition, we were excited to bring our message of “Tolerance”"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-HP G_-_-_TEXT.html," Bioveterinary Research Center in Lelystad, we found that detecting the mecA and blaZ genes was the way to go.
MecA can be used to detect resistance against all β-lactam antibiotics.
Fimme van der Wal (agricultural researcher)
Detection of blaZ is a conclusive result to exclude commonly used penicillin treatment.
Dik Mevius (agricultural researcher)
For further information about these genes check out our applied design and demonstrate page .
After defining our end-users and detection goal, we looked at how we could make our device as user-friendly as possible. From the start of our project, we wanted to integrate the use of tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) which are able to maintain the functionality of other proteins upon desiccation. This fitted perfectly in our design with respect to our end-users, as our TDPs enable the transportation and storage of our detection tool at room temperature. Normally, protein function can be maintained when stored at -80 degrees celsius, something that is not always available at your local dairy farm! We also envisioned that this improved storage method will be advantageous for shipping our versatile RNA-detection tool for broader applications. For further information on our TDPs, check out our TDP design page .
Adding to the storability, we realised that our tool needed to give a readout visible to the naked eye. At a farm, there are no fancy lasers or microscopes, so we had to get creative! We started by designing a microfluidics paper chip with GMOs with a kill switch to detect resistance genes, but gained crucial feedback on this.
Even if GMO kill switches were reliable, there is no public acceptance to use GMOs in the environment. If it will be accepted in the future, it will take years from now to legislate this principle. Innovation based on this gets stuck.
Cecile van der Vlugt (Risk Assessor GMO)
This led us to come up with a new application: CINDY-Seq. This method allows for a simple yes or no answer to the question: is the pathogen causing mastitis in my cow resistant to penicillins, or even all β-lactamases depending on the design of Cas13a, in a matter of hours, without the use of GMOs in the environment. For more information on how CINDY-Seq works, please visit our coacervation design page .
Now that we completed the design of our detection tool, we needed to look at how we could make the sample preparation as simple as"

UNebraska-Lincoln,2018,Team:UNebraska-Lincoln#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," number of approaches in dealing with emerald ash borer infestations. The current methods deal primarily with chemical treatment of ash trees within the vicinity of an already identified infestation. We believe that developing more effective traps is absolutely critical to slow down the rate at which the emerald ash borer is spreading by allowing people to treat their trees very early in the infestation or maybe before it even occurs. It has been shown that by the time the infestation is noticeable in the tree, it is already too late to treat the tree. One of the first indicators is the prevalence of woodpeckers surrounding the tree (Emerald Ash Borer Awareness, 2018). But this alone is not a good enough justification to promote invasive behavior on the tree, so the team sought a method that would promote a non-invasive approach to identifying infestations.
Life of a tree infested by Emerald Ash Borer:
A literature survey showed that it was impractical to chemically synthesize 7-epi-sesquithujene (Crook, 2010), our team decided to biosynthetically produce what appears  to be an extremely valuable chemical. Biosynthesis of 7-epi-sesquithujene requires a long biosynthetic route that utilizes several well-studied biochemical pathways.   The first pathway entails the production of mevalonate from acetyl-CoA. This conversion requires three different enzymes: acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AtoB), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS),   hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), which is the rate-limiting step of the pathway. This mevalonate pathway is encoded by plasmid 100167, which we obtained from Addgene.
Mevalonate Pathway Plasmid Map:
The mevalonate is then converted to farnesyl pyrophosphate via the mevalonate-based isoprenoid synthesis (MBIS) pathway, which requires the activities of five different enzymes.   This pathway is also encoded on the plasmid 100167. Previous report showed that the overexpression of the mevalonate kinase was beneficial to the biosynthesis, since the it is a rate limiting enzyme (Anthony et. al, 2009).  We obtained plasmid 100169 from Addgene, which contains a second copy of the mevalonate kinase-encoding gene. Our project focused on the biosynthetic approach to produce 7-epi-sesquithujene"

The first atempt we took were beads coated in phosphatidyl serine , which would simulate the surface of an apoptotic mammalian cell. Unfortunately, we were not able to detect binding of Annexin-Alexa 488 or bacteria to these beads.
However, these results cannot be taken as a total disproval of our system, since it is not clear how well the phosphatidylserine (PS)-coated beads simulate an apoptotic cell. We came up with the following possible explanations as to why this setup might not be ideal:
It is possible that too high concentrations of PS (85 pM) on the beads interferes with the Annexin V-PS interaction.
The hydrophobic tails of PS might form clumps if they are not embedded into a membrane, thereby hindering interactions.
The biotin moiety required to bind PS onto the beads might be positionned on the lipid such that the interaction with Annexin V is no longer possible
But this initial backset could not stop us! We decided to try a more realistic setup, testing the binding of our E. coli cells expressing the INP-Annexin V construct to actual cancer cells. The results of this experiment can be found here .
Experiments involving mammalian cells
Our first step needed to check the viability of our experimental set-up was to confirm the data found in the literature regarding the sensitivity to TRAIL [ Thomas, 2008 ] and the elevated lactate production observed in cancer cells, but not in non-cancer cells.
Sensitivity to TRAIL
Background
Apoptosis can be induced through a protein called TNF-related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL). TRAIL is a transmembrane protein, which can be found also in solubilised form (sTRAIL)[ de Bruyne et al, 2013 ], that recognizes the death receptors DR4, DR5, DCR1, and DCR2 [ Johnstone et al, 2008 ] and has been used in cancer treatment inducing the apoptosis of cancerous cells but with low cytotoxicity for healthy ones [ Johnstone et al, 2008 ; Zhang et al, 2005 ].
Experiment overview
The first signal in our system is based on making cancer cells apoptotic while non-cancer cells remain untouched. Due to the properties of TRAIL explained before, we used it for a selective apoptosis induction in cancer cells.
The aim of this experiment was to check if cancer cells effectively undergo apoptosis after incubation with TRAIL and how long the incubation should last.

I.Antisense-RNA
Li Xinzhe:""kissing complex""
Instruction of the loop-loop interaction between RNA which called ""kissing complex"".  This structure may improve the effciency of the combination of RNAs.  However, this structure is a little difficult to design.
Chen Wuyang: Zcal
The article presents five kinds of antisense RNA which are able to bind the mRNA of lacZ.  Only the first and the thired kind can repress the expression of lacZ.  This article assumes two essential tips about the design of antisense RNA:
1)The binding site must include the RBS region.
2) The antisense sequence should not be very long.
Zheng Xuexuan: Paired Termini
The article present a conclusion that the ""Paired Termini"" structure which appears at the end of RNA is extrem essential for the antisense RNA.
Zhao Jieming: The repression of the phage gene expression by antisense RNA
There are four factors which determine the ability of repression of the antisense RNA:
1）The intensity of the transcrption of target gene
2）The amount of antisense RNA
3）The length of pairing sequence of antisense RNA and target mRNA
4）Whether the antisense RNA binds the RBS region of the target mRNA(There is also research which suggests the third factor isn't necessary)
The antisense RNA can target the coat protein gene, duplicase, maturation protein gene from the E.Coli. bacterialphage SP.  The maturation  protein gene is most suitable target region, for the reason that the production of this gene duplicates only once in the mature phage
Wang Song: The phage resistibility of lactobacillus mediated by antisense RNA    The author constructs antisense RNA of various length and find that the most effected one is the completely pairing and the longest one.

Materials and Methods
Transformations
These were carried out as per our standard calcium chloride protocol.
Calibration
Both the OD600 reference point and the fluorescein fluorescence standard curve were carried out as per the InterLab 2017 Plate Reader Protocol [2] .
Measurements
For the purpose of the measurements two biological duplicates (colonies) of all 6 test devices were transformed into DH5α, along with a positive and negative control and were grown up in LB broth overnight at 37°C with shaking at 220rpm. These were then diluted down to an OD600 of 0.02 and 100µl of the samples were placed into wells of a clear bottomed black sided 96 well plate as shown as per figure 1. This was placed into the plate reader at 37°C with shaking at 200rpm. Measurements of OD600 and Fluorescence at an excitation of 485nm and emission of 530nm were taken at time points of 0hrs, 2hrs, 4hrs and 6hrs.

April
Week 1: GH, TS, TK
Antibiotic resistance:
After having received our production strains S. blattae and R. planticola we could start lab work with testing them for natural antibiotic resistances. For this, they were grown in culture overnight and plated on LB-Agar plates supplemented with different antibiotics.
Week 2: TK, GH, LK, IF, MS, TS
Antibiotic resistance:
Due to inconsistent results in the week before, the test for antibiotic resistances had to be repeated. We additionally tested for resistance against chloramphenicol and used more different concentrations of the antibiotics and dilutions of the pre-cultures. The results showed, that all production strains have no antibiotic resistance for kanamycin. It can therefore be used as antibiotic resistance on our plasmids.
Bacterial identification:
To check the identification of our production strains, we performed a 16S rRNA PCR. All strains were correct, so glycerol stocks could be prepared.
Competent cells:
For the following experiments, we had to prepare electro competent cells of our productions strains and E. coli DH5α. This was done first for E. coli DH5α according to protocol.
Week 3: IF, NE, ME, MS, TK
Competent cells:
Electrocompetent cells for S. blattae and R. planticola were prepared.
 Week 4: IF, LK
Test transformation:
To check if our prepared electro competent cells were indeed electro competent, we transformed them with a simple vector containing a kanamycin resistance according to protocol and grew them on plates over night. Unfortunately, only E. coli DH5α showed resistance against kanamycin, suggesting that the transformation or the preparation of competent cells was not successful for the others.

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#lab practice#notebook#protocols#charac recomb_-_-_TEXT.html," of the designed logic gates avoids the unnecessary DNA assembling steps putting the recombinases on the same plasmid as the logic gate (which is in any case dangerous as the switch can occur during the first cloning step). Recombinases can be produced independently of the logic gates, in a regular E. coli strain and using a plasmid bearing a different antibiotic resistance than the logic gate to be tested. Soluble proteins from the strain carrying the recombinases are extracted and mixed with the plasmid containing the logic gate assembled with RFP. The mix is boiled for a few minutes and further used to transform E. coli (selecting for the antibiotic resistance of the gate, hence the plasmid containing the recombinase is not selected). The bacteria colour gives the result after culture.
With this protocol, we have been able to test in due time (two week before the wiki freeze!!) the different recombination based logic gates. The results are available in the Results part
. This protocol can be generalized to any characterization with recombinases with a possible amelioration of the specific recombinase buffer.
Recombinase overexpression and extraction
Pre-culture overnight of the strain containing recombinase plasmid at 37°C.
Culture at 37°C for 4 hours.
Centrifuge the culture for 3 min at 13000 rpm.
The cell pellets were resuspended in 600µl Rec buffer 1 (for Bxb1 and FimE recombinases) or Rec buffer 2 (for Tp901 and PhiC31 recombinases).
Sonication of the cells for three bursts of 30s.
Centrifugation for 15 min at 13000 rpm, 4°C, the supernatant containing proteins (recombinases) was collected and incubated on ice.

Safety
As with everything in life, there are always risks and dangers attached with doing lab work. Thus, we have done our best                  to minimize the safety risks by adjusting the environment, using non-threatening Biosafety Level 1 bacteria and strictly                  following the lab safety rules.
General Lab Safety
Our lab in the METU Biological Sciences Department was a BL-1 (Biosafety level 1) facility. BL-1 is the lowest safety level,                  indicating that it didn’t include any pathogens that could be harmful to us. Despite this low risk, we kept our guard up by                  always complying with lab safety rules, wearing appropriate clothing and by working in the hood at all times.
Before we stepped into the lab, we were trained on biosafety rules and how to behave in the best manner to keep ourselves and                  other people safe and secure in the lab. We were also put through an examination that tested our knowledge on biosafety rules                  at the end of those lessons. After passing these exams, our lab experience has started. Our PI, additionally, prepared a                  presentation in which she highlighted all the important points and considerations the day we had our first lab experience along                  with making sure that we were always using personal protective equipment.
In the lab environment, we worked in a class II biosafety cabinet to avoid the contamination for both sides and acted extremely                  cautious in case of any hazards. We worked close to fire and tried to avoid contaminations.
The bacteria we have worked on, E.coli DH5⍺ and ethanologenic strain KO11, were respectively provided by New England Biolabs (NEB)                  and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
We, during our experiments, followed all the protocols supplied step by step, taking all the precautions and never conducted any                  experiments without the guidance and presence of our principal investigator and secondary instructor.

""Unity is strength. . . when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved."" -Mattie Stepanek
UBonn HBRS 2016 iGEM team
The team of the University of Bonn aims to revolutionize paper recycling through a new approach of de-inking the recycled paper. Since both our teams are working with Bacillus subtilis we supported their team with our optimized and functional protocol for the transformation of B. subtilis (Link to our protocol). Thankfully they gave us a protocol for making competent cells to establish in our project. Since we all struggled with the varieties of protocols we came up with the idea to write a guide for “How to Bacillus subtilis”. Both teams tested and evaluated protocols to choose which ones will make it into the final manual.
Bacillus subtilis Manual
-
A Collaboration
This guide offers step-by-step introductions for preparing basic mediums, inducing sporulation, competent cells and the transformation of cells. Our goal is to share this manual with future iGEM teams, lab groups and basically anyone who starts working with Bacillus subtilis. Therefore anybody can benefit of our collected knowledge.

Technion Israel 2016 iGEM team
The Technion team uses the principle of chemotaxis, the movement of bacteria in response to chemical stimuli, as an innovative and easy-to-handle detection method. To determine the behavior of the swarming bacteria, mathematical models are needed. We are glad that we were able to help them in modelling missing parts of their project- the aerotaxis. We were able to model the oxygen distribution for time and location and also the internal energy distribution for the bacteria.

Part OR1D2 Document
Part:BBa_K2288001
Designed by: Jiawen Yang Group: iGEM17_NEU-China (2017-10-10)
Rho-OR1D2(HEK293)
Encoding the fragments of the olfactory receptor OR1D2 with Rho-tag in its N-terminal in HEK293 cells. Once the specific                                         odor, bourgeonal, binds to OR1D2 on the cell membrane, it leads to a series of signaling                                         rally and consequently generates a flux of cAMP which could be detected by a cAMP-activated                                         reporter gene system. The Rho tag was added to its N-terminal, which could improve                                         the olfactory receptor to express on the surface of HEK293.
The whole OR1D2 signaling exists primarily in the olfactory epithelia cells which                                         are not easily cultured and amplified to generate the ex vivo biosensor, nor does                                         a simplified prokaryote can reconstitute the whole OR1D2 pathway. Therefore we chose                                         an easily cultured eukaryotic HEK293FT cells instead to reconstitute the olfactory                                         signaling cascade for the biosensor with a CRE-luciferase construct as the reporter.

Set-up:
1. Run a gel of your digestions and take a picture.
2. Estimate the intensities of your insert and vector where your insert (usually less intense) is considered 1 and your vector is x times as bright.
3. Once intensity is determined perform the following equation:
L = Ligation volume
S = Size of fragments
I = Intensity of fragments
V = Volume ran down gel
i = Insert
v = Vector
4. Ligation volume (Lv) for the vector should be approximately 2 µl.
5. The ratio for the ligation in the previous equation is 3:1 insert:vector but can be done 6:1 by replacing the 3 with a 6.
Reaction Mix:
- 2 µl – Vector
- Li µl – Insert
- 2 µl – 10x Buffer
- dH20 to 19 µl
- 1 µl – T4 DNA Ligase
- TOTAL – 20 µl
Procedure:
1. Add appropriate amounts of dH20, Vector, and Insert in a PCR tube (200 µl). Once added, heat mixture to 65o C for 5 min. This will remove all items that are already annealed to each other causing inefficient ligation.
2. Add then appropriate amounts of 10x Buffer and T4 DNA Ligase. Make sure"
UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"23rd March 2016 -  Project Simulation meeting 2
All team members met up to start to brainstorm ideas. Tactics used to stimulate ideas for our project included talking about certain aspects of synthetic biology that we liked, then creating ideas from those points.
June
Friday 3rd June, 6.30pm -  Meeting with UCL iGEM 2015
All team members were able to gain huge inspiration and insight to iGEM by meeting the 2015 iGEM team. We received downstream transfer of knowledge and lots of tips on how to get started (the do’s and dont’s of iGEM) and inspired whilst brainstorming. We then went to the pub where we had a laid back social session with light brainstorming.
Monday, 6th June, 6.30pm -  Meeting with Paris Bettencourt 2014
All team members were present at a meeting with a team member of the 2014 Paris Bettencourt iGEM team. We received a presentation on their project (what it was, how they obtained data/ evidence). We also got insights to what life is like for the team members post iGEM - how iGEM has affected their lives after the competition, which was very inspiring and interesting to know of. Paris Bettencourt team also shared their general motivation to pursue iGEM and their tips (dos and don'ts of iGEM) as well! Because we were so motivated and excited by the talk, we started to actively start to brainstorm, adding to our never ending list of possible ideas (note: weird and wacky ideas still welcome).
Tuesday, 7th June, 6:30pm -  Meeting with Imperial 2014 + Brainstorm session
All team members got to have another inspiring talk from a team who nearly won the whole iGEM competition in 2014. We got given a presentation about Imperials iGEM project and Imperial also shared some of their stories of the process, what went well, what didn’t go well and what could’ve been better (hence, what we can think about doing!). All team members had a chance to ask questions to Imperial about their experiences, which will help with our organisation as a team throughout this project! We then had another brainstorming session which was one of the most productive sessions so far! We were able to all pitch our ideas to the post doctoral supervisors who helped with assessing the feasibility of certain ideas and helped come up with new and interesting ideas.

CFPS offer significant advantages over traditional in vivo biological systems, as they are abiotic, able to be blotted onto paper, and can be readily stored long-term. Ultimately, the team will be creating a paper-based biosensor that can be used safely and efficiently outside the laboratory environment, in which ‘citizen scientists’ can detect levels of these two toxic heavy metals in their own drinking water. Current city-sponsored water quality test kits are expensive and inefficient, taking weeks to arrive and for results to be published [9]. Additionally, the team aims to create an easy-to-use software-based diagnostic test, in which the colorimetric output produced by GFP reporter can be analyzed and understood in order to take further action.
Specifically, the team will begin our project by creating and selecting for two strains of E. coli that are able to successfully output GFP in the presence of either toxic hexavalent chromium or lead. Building off this in vivo success, we seek to blot these protein-synthesis mechanisms onto paper to create an in vitro orthogonal metal-detection system. Once we determine our cell-free protein-synthesis system is reliable, we will use our software-based modeling analytics to quantify the GFP output, and clearly report the toxicity levels of the the tested water.
In 2015, the Bielefeld iGEM Team had a similar undertaking; their in vivo results were promising, however they were unable to successfully and reliably implement in vitro CFPS lead and chromium detection systems [10]. We aim to build upon and further their approach, optimizing and reliably measuring these cell-free systems and their output, while blotting these systems onto paper.

Our business plan facilitates use of our product over the widest range of clients from single citizen users to whole cities, municipalities, and states. We engineered a way to reclaim a resource from what was otherwise considered a waste stream and concentrated it to increase its value and drive the economics of demand and supply. As the price of phosphorus increases it will become more and more feasible to deploy our PRMs in more places. We will be able to improve the environment and profit from the remediated phosphorus. The flexibility of our system even extends to other compounds allowing groups to cater the reclamation to their individual problem. The flexibility of our business plan and implementation will allow our product to be used by as many as possible, and in doing so, increases the good it can do."

As part of our project, the periplasmic iron/alumin ium-binding loop of the PmrB was substituted with a synthetic sequence - a lanthanide-binding ta g, intended to bind lanthanide ions, with terbium in particular. Such a binding event would then induce the aforementioned conformation change and phosphorylation of the PmrA, leading it to bind to the PmrC promoter, to allow for expression of the Green Fluorescent Protein - our reporter gene. If you wish to study PmrA-PmrB system more closely, we suggest reading following papers:

BBa_K1459011 - PmrB(N-term)
PmrA-PmrB two-component system is native to Salmonella enterica and in its native state it is responsible for chemotaxis. PmrB is a transmembrane protein with iron binding peptide on its extracellular loop. When PmrB binds iron (III) iron, the intracellular domain gains kinase activity and phosphorylates PmrA, which subsequently binds to pmrC promoter and induces expression of chemotaxis CheZ protein. In this part iron binding tag on the extracellular loop was exchanged with a lanthanide binding tag (LBT), to allow PmrA-PmrB two-component system to respond to lanthanide ions. This part was truncated just before the iron binding tag, and PmrB(N-term) is functionally complementar to PmrB(C-terminus).

Vibrio cholerae
V.Cholerae is a thin gram-negative proteobacterium that has a flagellum which gives it mobility [2]. This bacteria is responsible of cholera disease, causing severe contagious epidemia. This bacteria use to grow in basic conditions (Optimal growth pH : 9) [1] with 1-3% NaCl in liquid or solid mediums [3].
1.2 Growth in laboratory
Aeroanerobic bacteria grown on conventional media. Optimum growth in medium with 1 to 3% NaCl pH 9, in liquid media (Colonies in 3-4 h at the surface) or in solid media (colonies in 8-10 hours). The bacterium can also grow on bile salt media. According to these characteristics, alkaline peptone water pH 8.6 3% NaCl can be used as an enrichment medium as well as an alkaline agar pH 9. Colonies are 2 to 3 mm in diameter and are smooth, Flat and transparent. [3]
1.3 Tanks and contamination
Main V.Cholerae tanks are humans and dirty water, it seems that global warming is creating favorable conditions to this bacillus [4]. Even if there are many kinds of this bacteria, only 2 serogroups are directly responsible of Cholera: O1 and O139.

Global One Health blog
The Global One Health blog is an initiative of Wageningen University & Research. Global One Health is a theme that reflects the interconnectedness and global nature of health care. More specifically, it focuses on interdisciplinary ways for controlling the risk of disease outbreaks and reduction of endemic infectious diseases. Not only for human health care, but also for food supply, hygiene, medicines, vaccines, vector control and crop protection. More about this initiative can be found here .
For this initiative, we wrote a blog about the rise of infectious diseases, taking African Sleeping Sickness as an example for the problematic situations in tropical regions with regards to infectious diseases, and how there is a need for a new diagnostic device. Moreover, an infographic was made to visualize our device.
The blog can be read on the website of Global One Health blog (in Dutch).

Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Architecture_-_-_TEXT.html," possible to grow a whole building out of a one cell.
However, the application area must have certain characteristics in order for it to justify the use of biotechnology.
In order for biotechnology to be produced for a certain application area, it should justify the effort, time and cost input needed to produce the synthetic material. It is important that the environment of our desired application area can be reproduced in the lab. Otherwise if the two environments are not identical, the biotechnology might not work as expected, or work at all. Probably the most important specification is that the synthetic product should be particular to an atmosphere. It should be unique from other environments in order to avoid contamination outside the planned sphere of influence.  Furthermore, the application area must have use for a large volume in order to justify the cost of the development. It is also advisable that the application area is similar in environment to other potential application areas in order for the biotechnology to be reusable and easily adapted to other purposes. This would save time and money.
No matter how synthetic biology will be applied to architecture, we can be certain that it will offer novel, maybe unexpected ways of constructing architecture that will succeed and replace conventional technologies.
Advantages and Disadvantages
The biggest current challenge is the need for validation. The most obvious reason is the danger of contamination. Although the dangers of accidental release can be minimized through the use of a fail-safe or kill switch, we still cannot predict exactly how a cell will behave. Therefore, this is still the biggest hurdle to overcome.
Second is transportation, most likely there will be need of a distribution network that can transport the synthetic product from one factory to another. Also, more space might be needed to store the synthetic products as the risks of contamination are greater. Lastly, the cell factory will need fuel to survive and manufacture the synthetic product. Where will this energy come from?
However, the advantages of using synthetic biology will ensure that there will always be work done towards resolving these issues. Better product quality and performance of product could be achieved as using biotechnology will give us more control over the process. Cheaper prices may also be an advantage as we may find cheaper and more efficient alternatives to produce materials. Furthermore, environmentally friendly solutions might be possible as, for example, we may use waste to fuel the material production or could choose to replace the current materials with a new ‘greener’ alternative that have only become available through the use of biotechnology. This would also lead to a larger range of manufacturing techniques which may lead to more competitive prices and also more freedom for designers over material choice.

We helped Freiburg spreading their survey and wrote together with the other iGEM teams a letter to the iGEM HQ concerning property rights . See also our collaborations .
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.
We used a new Policy & Practice approach to address possible application scenarios . We also investigated unwanted impacts of our project in a techno-morale vignette . As a result we adopted our pathway under the aspect of downstream processing.

Communicating with Team HFUT
An integral part of learning from each other is the free exchange of ideas and viewpoints among older learners. There’s nothing like listening to or taking part in stimulating discussions to help us see the other side of an issue. That give-and-take opens our minds and brings us to a whole new level of enlightenment. In that case, we communicated with HFUT.             As a software team, they do not have their own lab. So first of all, we showed them around in our lab. After showed them the using methods of some biology experimental devices, we gave them an introduction of how synthetic biology researchers work, which benefited them a lot.             Three team leaders then introduced their project. After hearing their work of literature analysis and gene relationship visualization, we found it an interesting idea. Also, the others thought our prion project a revolution practice.             In the end, we gave suggestions to each other. To make HFUT's project more adorable, we shared our common way of searching and reading documents.

Social Research on the Energy Issue
Background & Introduction
As previously addressed, the importance and urgency to seek a feasible solution to the energy issue is undebatable. The energy issue is neither just a regional nor national problem, but instead a global one. In response to the urgent need, vast efforts and time have already been devoted to those relevant studies, however, only few of which is really able to be put into real applications. Actually, the biggest obscure restraining the feasible solution to alleviate the energy stress is mainly due to the huge gap between the research results and the massive industrialization. In another word, not only should we emphasize the technological advancements, but also we ought to raise a strong awareness to integrate the scientific results into real industrial application to yield concrete social values.
To understand the energy issue from a border aspect, our team carried out a social research discovering the gap between the academic research and the industrial application, especially in the context of the energy issue. The main objectives of this social research aim at socially figuring out the relevant background as well as getting the project prepared for the further industrialization. We hope to hear various opinions from different aspects, or to be concrete not only the public and the academic, but also the industrial and the authority. Only when we understand comprehensively, could we figure out a series of feasible solutions in the social context, to profoundly contribute to the world.
Our social research started as early as we just decided to work on the energy issue. We built up a long-term real-time interaction with the society, instead of just a simple glimpse, for the comprehensive understanding on the issue required continuous communications and thoughts exchanging. Generally speaking, this social research consisted of two main parts, the public questionnaire and interviews. The public questionnaire was implemented to be familiar with the general public attitudes. We carefully analyzed the data collected, and according to the main concerns and opinions we"

As a result, we should be able to obtain a system that would allow us to measure the rate of electron export in response to an input of arsenate or IPTG. Possible methods to measure electron export include measuring the transfer of electrons to an electrode with a volt meter by comparing it to a reference electrode; construction of a microbial fuel cell or the use of the ferrozine assay to measure the rate of reduction of iron (III) ions to iron (II).
We are also looking at two ways of making genetically modified bacteria safer to release into the environment:
Alternative Selectable and counter-selectable markers
Alternative to antibiotic resistance: We are investigating other ways to distinguish between the cells which have taken up the plasmid in question and those which have not in order to eliminate the need for antibiotic resistance selection. This would reduce the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes if an engineered bacterium were to be released into the environment either deliberately or by accident.
Chassis characterization: Citrobacter freundii
We intend to characterize this 'friendly lemon bacterium' (a member of the gamma-proteobacteria, like Escherichia coli) in order to assess whether it would be a good chassis for cloning and gene expression within synthetic biology and beyond. We want to see what it can offer to this field to assess whether there are some new things it can do, or can do better than E. coli , the legacy chassis. We want to start a dialogue about what a synthetic biology-specific chassis should look like, what it should be able to do and what should be known about it before it could be considered a good alternative for the currently existing chassis.
We also aim to characterize various criteria which would have to be known in order for researchers to start using it as a novel chassis. In addition to characterizing its growth requirements and BioBrick compatibility, we hope to sequence its genome to gain more insight into its metabolic pathways and novel genes.
Finally, we want to assess whether public opinion would favour the less known but safer Citrobacter freundii over Escherichia coli, which may have a bad reputation due to its association with disease, sewage and ability to become pathogenic if exposed to wild type strains.

Further Consideration
At the beginning of the project we considered using our dsRNA-expressing yeast (B. x. Busters/B. x. B.) directly as an agricultural pesticide, but we recognized some potential problems with this idea as a result of our HP activities.
1. Because pines have been almost annihilated in Japan, it is necessary to breed pines anew.
2. If B. x. Busters do not propagate on pines, they will need to be applied/injected every year.
3. It is difficult to control genetically modified yeast once released into the wild.
Thanks to being able to recognize these problems through our HP activities, we were able to consider more realistic uses of our B. x. B. technology related to pines resistance to B. xylophilus.
In Japan, attempts are now being made to make resistant pine trees by hybridizing pines which are surviving in areas where pine-wilt disease was pandemic without using genetic modification. In establishing a new strain of pines resistant to B. xylophilus, attempts are being made to select strains of pine that show natural resistance to B. xylophilus and mate them.
However, this method has several problems and has not been put to practical use [1].
1. The pines are not 100% resistant simply because they show improved resistance to B. xylophilus.
2. In the case of gardens and sightseeing spots, characteristics of the strains such as branching should be emphasized, but such considerations are limited using this method.
3. Under stress, B. xylophilus itself may evolve to become pathogenic to currently resistant pines.
These problems could be solved by making recombinant RNAi pine trees expressing dsRNA.
Figure 1 RNAi pines will solve the problem of pine-wilt disease.
However, applying the same method to make B. x. B. may be difficult in pine trees, especially in a timely manner.
1. It takes at least several years for pines to grow until it becomes possible to evaluate resistance to B. xylophilus by injecting them into the trunk.
2. It is not yet known whether feeding RNAi is effective for B. xylo"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Press_-_-_TEXT.html," The team has developed a novel approach towards bioprinting based on a biomolecular two-component glue, which is composed of the protein avidin and the vitamin biotin that tightly bind to each other. This mild molecular interaction enables the printed cells to adhere to each other, opening up new perspectives for the bioprinting of live tissues and even organs.
After developing their interdisciplinary bioprinting project over the summer in the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra at TUM in Weihenstephan, the team was awarded the main prize of the ""Overgraduate"" section on November 1st, 2016. Furthermore, it won the first prize in the category ""Manufacturing"" and additionally received special awards for ""Best Hardware"" as well as ""Best Software"". Following up on the 4th place for LMU in 2012 and the 2nd place for TUM in 2013, this represents the greatest success for a Munich team in the iGEM competition thus far.
Congratulations to all members and thanks a lot to all sponsors of the team!
The iGEM competition is an annual, world wide, synthetic biology event aimed at undergraduate university students, as well as high school and graduate students. Multidisciplinary teams work all summer long to build genetically engineered systems using standard biological parts called Biobricks. iGEM teams work inside and outside the lab, creating sophisticated projects that strive to create a positive contribution to their communities and the world.
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Foundation is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to education and competition, the advancement of synthetic biology, and the development of an open community and collaboration.

Purdue,2013,Team:Purdue#Project#Standardized Datasheets_-_-_TEXT.html," late May. We sent out a simple survey to gauge how various iGEM teams felt about the current state of the registry, what data is most important to represent on a part page, how often teams find parts with no characterization, and if they would be in favor of a characterization standard for the registry. We asked individuals to fill out the survey instead of entire teams, and we received over 170 responses. Some of the results are below:
The results of this survey clearly validated the need to improve the registry. The answers we received also directed how we were designing the datasheet, and let us know what iGEM teams were looking for in a solution. At the end of this survey, we asked the participants to talk to the rest of their team and see if they would like to collaborate with us by giving critical feedback to our designs.

Overview
The story of our E.coil
When Clark Kent turns into superman, the E.coli grows into the E.COIL!
Here is the story:
Long time ago, Clark Kent grew in the farm. While this summer, our E.coil grows in the LB. What is the difference between our E.coil and normal E.coli? Well, E.coil is super-E.coli! He has the power to produce much more fatty acids than his normal peers. How can that happen? After he “swallows” a plasmid containing all the special genes, he obtains the super power. On this magical plasmid, there are thioesterase, desaturases, fluorescence system and so on.
Thioesterase and fatty acid desaturase are key enzymes for free fatty acid (FFA) synthesis and unsaturated fatty acid production, respectively. They are both extensively spread in animals, plants and microorganisms. This time, we “borrow” the thioesterases from Umbellularia californica and Arabidopsis thaliana, use them to build this magical plasmid and equip our super-E.coli. Also, E.coli contributes to offering its own desaturase to the plasmid.
Besides that, our E.coil can produce the exact fatty acids we want. And this amazing power comes from different operon structures which regulate the expressions of corresponding thioesterases and desaturases. Thanks for them, we manage to produce various fatty acids in a controlled manner.
Considering the strong power our super-E.coli processes, we do want to monitor its fatty acid producing progress. In this case, we design a fluorescence system composed of Transcriptional Regulatory Protein FadR to detect the concentration of fatty acids in the whole system.
In a word, by the ways listed above, we accomplish the switch between production of different kinds of fatty acids by applying different signals to operons, and we can obtain the real time production status of E.coli by fluorescence report.

UMaryland,2015,Team:UMaryland#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," ranged in the hundreds of dollars. Lastly and most importantly, the greatest issue with our design was the inefficiency of the hardware; we found that the peltier units were not able to cycle through the desired temperatures fast enough, e.g., the unit would take 5 to 10 minutes just to rise up to 95℃. After considering all of these factors, we began a redesign of C.H.I.P. to better suit the needs of the “Do-It-Yourself” market.
The idea for our current thermocycler design first came into form when we found that our original prototype was not ramping up to the desired temperatures fast enough. Because of this problem, we looked into other options for heating the machine and, in the process, disassembled a hair dryer to find out how the heating mechanism worked. To our pleasant surprise, we found that the hair dryer was able to reach very high temperatures—much higher than the desired maximum of 95℃ for PCR—in a matter of seconds. We then made a decision to suspend construction on the peltier-centered thermocycler in order to see how successful we could be and how far we could go with making a rapid PCR machine out of a hair dryer. Before this decision, we took into consideration the danger of working with a hair dryer, failure due to uncertainty that the machine could be effectively controlled, and, on top of that, having less time to work on it. Nevertheless, we took the risk and are pleased to show you the results of our efforts—the creation of C.H.I.P.
C.H.I.P.'s Design
The design of CHIP started when we bought a hairdryer in the hopes of using the heating unit as part of our first PCR machine. However, as we were dismantling and testing the hairdryer, it became apparent to us that the heating system inside the hairdryer could reach the necessary temperatures independent of the peltier units already in use. With this in mind, we began working out how to wire the hairdryer so that we could regulate the heating unit and the fan separately.
After a lot of soldering and reworking the internal safety measures inside the hairdryer, we were able to wire the system so that we could turn the heat on and off while running the fan continuously. Using autoclave tape, we secured a sheet of aluminium foil to the top of the heating unit of the hairdryer. The outer casing of the hairdryer had been removed. We placed a heat sensor inside the tin to measure the temperature of the air inside the machine. "

Agarose gel electrophoresis
To separate DNA fragments of different sizes, agarose flat-bed gels were casted in various concentrations (0.6% to 2% agarose in 0.5x TAE buffer). By applying an electrical field (10 to 20 V/cm), these gels were used for analytical or preparative separation. Therefore, the desired amount of agarose was boiled up in 0.5x TAE buffer until it was completely dissolved. After the solution cooled down to 50 to 60°C, it was poured into a flat-bed tray and ethidium bromide (EtBr) solution (0.5 µg/ml final concentration) was added. Finally, a comb was inserted to create pockets while solidification. The gel was put into the running buffer (0.5x T"

He also gave information about how the judges evaluate the modeling tract. After taking up so much new knowledge, it was time for a lunch provided by the TU Delft.
After lunch Anne Meyer continued with a lecture about all the things the jury like and dislike in the iGEM competition. Since she had participated as a judge in the iGEM competition, she was able to gives a lot of useful information that we definitely would use. The last item on the agenda was a practical course in modelling, where we were given some exercises with matlab to see how modelling worked in practice. This gave a lot of insight for students who had never worked with matlab or modelling before. To close the two day lectures, everyone was invited for drinks afterwards in one of the popular bars.
All in all the two days were very informative, we got a lot of useful tips and tricks. Besides that we have a lot of fun. It was also very nice to meet the other teams and hear their project. We would like to thank all the participating teams, old iGEM members and lecturers for their time and energy in organizing and joining the educating and informative subjects.
Cooperations

Team Aalto-Helsinki
We received a request from the iGEM team Aalto-Helsinki to fill in a questionnaire. This questionnaire was about modeling in combination with experiments. Because our modeling is quite extensive, this questions gave us a lot of insight in how we can best implement modeling with science. So we were pleased to help them.

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"A major obstacle in creating recombinant spider silk is the highly repetitive nature of the genes that encode it. Silk genes are comprised of a repetitive core region containing ~100 repeats of a spidroin gene which precludes the use of traditional cloning techniques due to non-specificity in primer binding. While other techniques such as head-to-tail assembly or concatemerization have been developed to facilitate spider silk cloning, none of these techniques can assemble silk genes in a quick and directed manner. We have adapted the use of Iterative Capped Assembly (ICA) as a technique to construct silk genes in a rapid and sequence specific manner. By creating a number of different constructs this summer, we show that ICA can greatly facilitate the engineering of recombinant spider-silk.
Functionalizing Silk
Silk fibers possess the potential to be transformed into functional biomaterials that can be exploited in an array of biomedical applications, from aiding nanoscale drug delivery to simulating medical sutures. However, traditional methods of incorporating functional domains into fibers involve difficult, costly, and time-consuming processes. We propose an in vitro, co-spinning method to quickly and efficiently functionalize silk fibers. In essence, we spin a mixture of wild-type silk dope spiked with a small volume of functional domain. This functional domain which will bind to the native silk proteins when co-spun, thereby incorporating itself into the final synthetic fiber. To ensure proper binding of our functional domain, we created a co-spinning module. This module is a genetic construct consisting of our gene of interest flanked on either side by the N and C terminal domains of Bombyx mori (silkworm silk). When co-spun, the termini on our synthetic protein will bind to the respective termini in the native silk proteins, thereby functionalizing the fiber. Our goal is to develop, optimize and experimentally validate our co-spinning module, and assess its potential as a scalable and powerful tool to manufacture silk fibers with an array of functional capacities.
Honey Bee Silk
In addition to the more well known silks from spiders and silkworms, we decided to also explore silk from the honey bee Apis mellifera. We cloned the honey bee silk gene as well as several variants of it and submitted them as the first honey bee silk biobricks. To investigate its potential as a biomaterial, we expressed the silk protein and confirmed its presence using SDS PAGE.
Protein Expression and Processing
Following genetic design of our constructs, we must express and process them into functional materials. Here, we highlight the methods that we used to take our silks from"

Characterizing BiobBrick Mutagenicity
To demonstrate the utility of our algorithm for a broad range of applications and across diverse gene types, we wanted to assess how many mutagenic sites our algorithm is able to eliminate. For the most comprehensive assessment possible, we calculated statistics for the number of sites in every valid open reading frame (ORF) on the Standard Registry of Biological Parts.
Using software that we wrote last year to wrap the Registry’s API, we extracted sequences and classifiers for every part on the Registry, then filtered those sequences with a heuristic to define genes containing an ORF. In all, we characterized 2,594 genes. With a set of automated scripts, for all of these genes we calculated the number of mutagenic sites for irradiation, oxidation, alkylation, base-runs, and microhomologies in the original part sequence, then calculate the number of all of these sites that would remain after optimization through our algorithm both for each type of mutation and for overall optimization. We also show summary statistics on the percent of sites remaining after directed-optimization.
With this tool, we have expanded the characterization of nearly every gene on the iGEM registry by adding valuable additional information on each part’s predicted relative risk of mutation. This data set, which have made publicly available, is a useful resource for anyone using the Registry for gene sequences in their projects, especially those concerned about the stability, longevity, and safety of their system.
Statistics on Optimization
With the resource we created for characterizing mutation sites across the Registry, we also compiled aggregate statistics to show how well the optimization performs on real gene sequences. As shown on the series of graphs below, mutation types can greatly differ in how well they can be counteracted. For example, on average 37% of pyrimidine dimer sites (weighted based on their mutagenicity) can be removed through synonymous substitutions, while 58% of oxidation and 50% of alkylation sites can be eliminated. Base-runs, which increase rates of polymerase error, can also be effectively removed at a high rate (80% on average, with a mode of having ~100% of runs over 5bp removed).

Mandy has been having difficulty with the items we have to add although I have not even when we try the same activity, which leads us to believe that the names of her items and the items we need do not match up so we will be comparing names of objects tomorrow.
I also changed the scripts within:
Phosphatase treatment
Restriction digest
Gel electrophoresis (Mandy made some changes here too)
They now search for items the same way as the new PCR machine so the order items are added does not make any difference. I then had to change the PCR machine’s cleaning methods so that more objects were accounted for as necessary and were not deleted before they could be used. I believe this could have also been a problem for some of the items in the PCR machine since they were possibly being deleted before they could be checked since the machine did not recognize the materials as something that needed to be kept.
Unfortunately, I was unable to make significant headway on the DNA replication animation due to all of my time spent in the lab. I was able to build a primase that rez the RNA primers, but I still need to set the positions the enzymes will have to get to along the single-stranded DNA.
I plan to insert instructions into the bacterial transformation activity tomorrow, which now allows for bacteria to be grown on plates if more than six questions are answered correctly, each plate having their own specific textures. When the plates with growth are touched avatars are given a short note card out of the three I made on Tuesday and each still require a little modification, but now avatars can complete this activity. I still need to add deletion to the activity so that inventory can be cleaned out though, but the rest is operational and Mandy was able to complete it successfully. Providing significant instruction for avatars will be very important within the lab so I will get the other group members to try and follow the instructions I have made tomorrow.

By using specific mixtures of bases for defined positions in the oligonucleotide synthesis resulting in degenerate codons coding for a defined mix of amino acids in the variable regions of our scaffolds we achieve a theoretical diversity of 1,073,741,824 proteins sequences for each library.
Since the practical diversity of our library is limited by the transformation efficiency of E. coli, the theoretical library size needed to be chosen carefully to maximize the binding the potential while avoiding dilution in unproductive (i.e. non-folding or non-binding) sequence space. Furthermore, due to our evolution system, only a weak affinity is required in the first place which can then mature to high affinity. We decided to optimize the library by using restricted yet proven codon or amino acids set, respectively, for the complementary determining regions (CDRs). As a realistic library size, we obtained for a diversity of about one billion varieties. For constructing the coding sequence, we utilized the IUPAC ambiguity base naming scheme for the ordering of our oligonucleotides at a vendor, which did support the equimolar mixing of nucleotides.
First of all, in our library design, we avoided stop codons to guarantee the synthesis of the complete binding proteins. By exclusion of cysteine encoding triplets, we ensured the absence of disulfide bonds and compatibility with the intracellular and extracellular environment. Furthermore, we preferred amino acids that are beneficial to a high binding affinity. Evolution has optimized natural proteins for specific biological functions. Proteins with similar tasks and features also show similar structures and contain related amino acids. Likewise, the binding hot spots for protein-protein interactions are often enriched in tyrosine, tryptophan and arginine ( Bogan and Thorn, 1998 ). Especially tyrosine is overrepresented in high affinity CDRs in functional antibodies. Round about 40 % of their sequence consists of tyrosine. Another ~30 % is assembled of small amino acids like serine, glycine, alanine and threonine ( Mian et al., 1991 ; Zemlin et al., 2003 ). Scientific studies also have shown the importance of tyrosine in the CDS of synthetic binding proteins ( Fellouse et al., 2004 ). The tyrosine side chain bears most of the contacts necessary for high affinity antigen recognition in synthetic libraries of binding proteins. Firstly, because of its big size to fill large volumes with just a few angels of torsion ( Fellouse"

Part V: Public opinion
Introduction
We wondered how the consumers would have reacted if our solution had been used in cleaning processes in food and cosmetic industries. To have an idea of their opinion, we have sent a survey to our school members. We have received about 930 answers in less than a week, proving the interest raised by our subject.
Studied population
We chose to interview a specific population : scientific students from 18 to 24 years old.
Moreover, their studies, knowledge or interests in biology are different. The survey enabled us to precise a tendency : the use of bacteria in food and cosmetic industries is more accepted by the young population, the future consumers. Furthermore, it gives us an idea about the commercial potential of our solution because it is linked to users' acceptance.
What is the public opinion about the use of bacteria in cleaning processes?
First, we were interested in the attention the public gives to the composition of every day life products.
In general, ¾ of the population is interested and concerned about what kind of substances is used in production processes. So, it seems relevant to ask them what products they are ready to accept. Food and cosmetics are the products people are most likely to be in contact with. So it is really important to know the opinion of the larger public on this matter :
About cosmetics :
r\Remark : the bacteria are indicated as eliminated after cleaning and never in direct contact with the products.
About food :
Remark : the bacteria are indicated as eliminated after cleaning and never in direct contact with the products.
As we could expect, the biological substances are the ones that people are more willing to accept, both in food and cosmetic industries. Moreover, there are not real concerns for the use of living bacteria in these two fields.
The questions of the chemicals and the GMO’s is quite different : they are more accepted in cosmetics than in food (in general, people seem to be more careful on what they eat...). The most remarkable is that the interviewed people have almost the same “reluctance” for the use of chemicals and GMOs. This can be interpreted as the students' sensitization of the negative effects of chemicals.
We find interesting to gather the surveyed ones by age groups :
Some of the surveyed people belong to the 0-17 years old age group, and few to the more than 35 years old. The analysis of their answers lead us to notice that the group above 35 years old has a tendency to refuse GMOs and to accept more easily living bacteria and chemicals in"
