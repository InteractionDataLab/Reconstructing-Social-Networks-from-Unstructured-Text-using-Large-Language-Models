Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

Help from BIT-China
May 2nd, 2018, we borrowed CEN.PK2-1c modified by Team BIT_China in 2017.Their work in 2017 altered a few steps of the pheromone pathway, which were
Knocked out Ste2 receptor in order to eliminate the probability of yeasts getting affected by native ligand-pheromone.
Knocked out Sst2, the GTPase-activating protein for Gpa1p, as a receptor-desensitizing factor in order to eliminate possible up-stream GPCR signal conductive decline due to incessant stimulation.
See resource 1 resource 2
Knocked out Far1, the cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor in order to eliminate side effect to cells’ life circle and formation due to signal intensification in MAPK pathway of the pheromone pathway.
More information
Their modification work provide us with great convenience in our work in 2018.
In August, we borrowed original yeast CEN.PK2-1c from Laboratory Li Chun which Team BIT_China was attached to. The yeast did not undergo modifications below.
Utilizing α-yeast from the lab of Professor Li Peng as a signal source, we stimulated original yeast imported plasmid of report gene in order to test the function of report plasmid.
More information
We compared the result of ligand combination reaction before and after knocking out the relative gene in yeast, verifying the contributions the modifications made in the elimination of side effect.
How we helped BIT-China
In this year, we make a model based on our research of diagnosis model for Team BIT-China to help them construct the relation between Hydrogen peroxide input and fluorescence intensity.
Model Background
According to the share of team member in BIT-China, we notice that when the amount of probes are far more than the Hydrogen peroxide. The fluorescence intensity is probably proportion to the concentration of Hydrogen"

Description of attributes used to assess the biobricks are available through this link: https://2014.igem.org/Team:SJTU-Software/Database/AssessmentModel .
3. Develop a well documented library or API for other developers (rather than “only” a stand-alone app for end users.)
A well documented API documentation was automatically built from source code documentation using doxygen. Download of this documentation is available through this link: https://2014.igem.org/Team:SJTU-Software/Database/FutureDevelopment .
4. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.
We have encountered two safety problems during the development of our software.
The first one is the safety of our server. We have once accidentally upload user name and password of the server to GitHub without notice. Then we have changed the password to get access to the server. Later, we planned not to upload the file which contained the user name and password of server, but we will still compile the file in the executable file. Other users and developers won’t get access to this.
The second one is with the username and password of the users who want to upload biobricks to Registry. We process this in a special way so that the username and password will not be saved locally or anywhere.

The fate of the Gram-negative envelope during holin-endolysin lysis:[2]
In this figure holins are shown as clear ovals and endolysin is shown as notched circles.
a-)Pre-Hole Configuration: Accumulation of holin is present in the inner membrane, while endolysin accumulates in the cytosol. Holin action can be prevented with the inhibitors (shown with star and black ovals).
b-) Hole Configuration: When the holes are formed by holin in the inner membrane, endolysin can attack the murein which is important for cell lysis to occur.
 
Antiholin; It is the protein that blocks the function of holin and it is important for the regulation of cell lysis.[3]
In our system antiholin is constitutively produced by the promoter J23116 and when antiholin level is in between 1000-3000 molecules, the cell will die.[4] Actually,it is the number of free holin molecules that determines if the cell will die or not.
Modelling
KILL-SWITCH MODEL
  The aim of kill-switch model is to predict the behavior of kill-switch mechanism in different IPTG concentrations. We first tried to model mechanism by the help of ODEs. Then we used SimBiology toolbox of MATLAB to simulate system.
Introduction:
As can be seen from the diagram our circuit involves constitutive production of LacI. LacI Promoter is negatively regulated by LacI. The control mechanism of our system is inhibition of LacI by IPTG molecule. Since LacI is inhibited by IPTG its effect on LacI promoter changes with respect to IPTG concentration.  Holin and Endolysin expression is controlled by cI promoter which is negatively regulated by cI.  Our first assumption in the model is that when the free Holin molecules, which means number of Holin molecules minus number of Antiholin molecules, reach 3000[ref] cell lysis occurs. Because cI concentration depends on the activity of LacI promoter, we can conclude that in the presence of IPTG the concentration of cI will be high and expression of Holin and Endolysin will be lowered. Due to the constitutive production of Antiholin, we can say that free Holin molecules will be lowered and chance of cell lysis to occur will drop. However, to understand the"

Figure 3. A schematic diagram of the use of fusion PCR to synthesize a fragment for gene knockout. Flanking DNA fragments are amplified with primers P1 and P2 and with P5 and P6. Primers P3 and P4 are designed to amplify zeocin. The two flanking fragments and the zeocin fragment are mixed and fused together by PCR creating a linear fragment used for transformation. Finally, transforming the linear fragment into S.cerevisiae and homologous recombination will occur and delete the target gene.
Results
We delete the FAR1 gene successfully as shown in the figure 4.
Figure 4: An ethidium-biomide-stained agarose gel showing results of FAR1 gene knockout.
a: The first lane is a 250bp DNA marker ladder. The lanes 2-5 are products of PCR using p3 and p4 as the primers using the knockout Far1 yeast genome as the template but the lane 6 uses the original yeast genome as the template. The bands are correct size of zeocin which is not in the original S.cerevisiae BY4741.
b: The lane 6 is a 250bp DNA marker ladder. The lane 5 is product of PCR using primers inside Far1 using original yeast genome as the template but the remaining lanes use the knockout Far1 yeast genome as the template. The band is correct size of fragment inside Far1 gene.
Until now, we have successfully constructed 14 expression plasmids. The sequence of flag-tag, Rho and our olfactory receptor odr-10 has been optimized in genscript.
We have constructed three devices (DⅠ, DⅡ& DⅢ) to express the olfactory receptor(OR).

Toggle Switch
The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two promoters, each of which is inhibited by the repressor transcribed by the other promoter. We choose pLacI and pTetR as the two promoters, and the repressors are TetR and LacI, respectively. Theoretically, if ratio of LacI to TetR is greater than 1, strong binding of LacI to pLacI repress transcription initiation from pLacI and therefore quantities of TetR will decrease, which in turn relieves its repression to pTet leading to increase of quantities of LacI itself. In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR, whose expression is repressed at an extream low level and the system enters into its 'LacI' state. Similar analysis will do for TetR and the system will enter into 'TetR' state if its quantity dominates. To show transition between the two states, IPTG is added in 1s after the system enters into 'LacI' state completely. The assembling of parts are construcuted as follows:
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli .
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate the state transition:
State of system has changed to 'TetR' state from 'LacI' state after adding inducer IPTG at 40000s.

The 4rd iGEM Competition Asia Conference in Taiwan
The 4rd International genetically engineering machine competition Asia conference was held in Tainan, Taiwan by National Cheng Kong University (NCKU) in August, 2016. More than 20 teams from Taiwan, China mainland and other Asian countries joined the conference for understanding each other and meeting many friends. The conference included official presentations along with Q&A and a poster session. This is the first time we got to know what other teams were doing this year. During the meeting, we introduced our project to all, received much valuable advice and gave much advice about other teams' work, especially the team BIT. And the host guided us to visit the amazing city--Tainan where many treasures and collections sit. We sincerely acknowledge NCKU for their warm service and we gained a lot through the conference.

NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," use renewable resources in propellants, the palm oil use in the energy sector took a big leap. This happened at expense of the rain forest.
Customers
The increasing use of palm oil corresponds, among others, with the industrialization of the food industry. Looking around in supermarkets, palm oil is used as raw material in numerous products, especially convenience food products. But the oil is also frequently used in beauty and household products. Increasing consumption behaviour, demographic growth along with mounting production of convenience products, especially in Asiatic countries, leads to a constantly increase of the palm oil demand. Another point to be seen critically is the use of palm oil in the energy sector. The application as bio fuel and the creation of electricity and heat lead to explosively development in palm oil consumption. In 2017 the usage of palm oil in energy sector was ~60 % in the European Union. As the productivity of the oil palm could never be reached by other plants, substitution of the palm oil with other plant oils seems to be impossible regarding to our current lifestyle. For the production of the same amount of plant oil a much larger area of land would be necessary instead.
That’s the point where we as human are coming into play. The rethinking of the population to conscious consume has to be promoted. The only way to change our situation is to adjust our current live style. Simple things, like fresh cooking and the awareness of buying palm oil free products, also cosmetic products, can have a huge impact. We have to be aware that the consequences of deforestation of the rainforest do not only have impact on our generation but also the following ones. We must not forget: the problem concerns the future of our planet.
Small holders
For the majority of the small holders the palm oil business would not be their first choice for earning their subsistence. The disposal of forest products and natural rubber could be an alternative to palm oil plantations. Beside the independence from the big companies this would also constitute financial independence. The cultivation could be carried out in second-growth forest, there is no necessity for mono cultures and the usage of herbicides could be reduced to a minimum. In addition, depending on the current price level, the profit for selling these products could be higher compared to palm oil. Many of the small holders would prefer other sectors over the palm oil production, yet aren´t aware of alternatives or do not have the financial possibilities for a change. Connection to the market in concomitant with streets and vehicles and corresponding infrastructure are therefore essential.
Biodiversity
The biodiversity of the rain forest is unique and extraordinary. For example, the ecosystem of"

Cardiff repeated the experiment for a 1 in 100,000 dilution and went on to further conduct it using both a 1 in 10,000,000 and in 1 in 100,000,000. However the results from the further two dilutions showed these dilutions did not yield populations of colonies in which we could apply statistical methods of analyse to produce meaningful results. All data that Cardiff contained for us is contained in the table below.
The work carried out by Cardiff supports our claim that the use of UV as a bactericide would not be appropriate within our filtration system as exposure time would be too great when the amount of water we wish to process.
Newcastle
In collaboration with Newcastle the investigation into the effective of UV as bactericide however due to restriction on the device used to generate their UV light the maximum amount of time that they could irradiate the sample for was 10 minutes. This being said the results they obtained for 1 minute, 2.5 minutes , 5 minutes and 10 minutes of exposure were not as expected. Below is a description of our engagement with Newcastle using the AREA framework detailed on our Silver Human Practices page .
Engage
Our communications with Newcastle were mainly over email in addition to one skype call at the start of the collaboration where we discussed what we could do for each other.
Anticipate:
We assumed that the results would be similar as the protocol was detailed about how to conduct the experiment and what devices should be used.
Reflect:
Although the data differs from us it demonstrates the difficulty in scientific communication. It has further motivated us to collaborate with another team to see what their results would be.
Act:
Despite not getting the results we had expected this informed our further collaborations, specifically with Cardiff, to ensure the protocol was more explicit and to continuously make ourselves available for questions.
Possible Alternatives
As a result of a meeting with one of our key stakeholders from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory ("
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"HO endo) which recognizes HO recognition sites and cleaves DNA to become                             linearized 4.
Q3: As our project describes a method that uses recombinase to separate between the gene of interest and the plasmid containing                             the origin of replication and marker gene, we use modelling to simulate a scenario to measure                             the dilution of plasmids and how long the recombined plasmid can be degraded over time.
Nevertheless, after the interview and through further research, we conjectured that a more effective way to digest recombinant                             plasmid is through the use of endonuclease. Apart from considering endonucleases such as a DNAi                             device called CRISPR-Cas3 as a choice for further improvement in our project, our team has continued                             to find potential application that recombinase can be compatible with (See Application page).                             We also designed plasmid simulation where CRISPR-Cas3 replaces Cre-recombinase8,                             but we were not able to incorporate into our project due to the time limitation.
The system works by expressing Cas3 and CasABCDE elements that will complex together and are guided                             by CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) with its spacer which will recognize PAM sequence correspnding with their                             complementary protospacer. The DNAi device will then cleave double stranded DNA, which will be                             degraded by exonuclease activity. The figure below shows the construct design (left and bottom)                             and how Cas3, CasABCDE and crRNAs target their sites (right)
We investigated the pros and cons of using 3 different knockout methods such as Cas9, Cas3 and recombinase,                             by listing out in the following tables
Cas9

Human practices
After we thought about our project, we wanted to know if it could be established or, more specifically, if it is an idea that is profitable.
To know that our project would work, we contacted many experts and explained them our intention. We contacted not only allergists to check if our test strip, which would identify the pollen exposure in the air, can help to measure out the medicine, but also scientists specialized in palynology (the scientific field of pollen) and the German fruit juice industry, because our Escherichia coli would produce pectinase, a substance that is often used in the juice industry to get more juice from the fruit by cracking the cells outer wall.
Another part of our Human Practice was to visit the Marta Event in Herford, Germany. Here you can see more of it at the Marta Event .
We also worked on biosafety issues and biosecurity issues with the iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec team and for our participation we recieved the Dual Use Research of Concern Button.
Asking allergists and professors
Another part of our Human Practice was contacting some allergists to figure out the negative impact and side effects of antihistamines which are tiring but the allergy itself lowers the capability of the affected people. Therefore, we asked an allergist who works at the universiticial hospital of Aachen in the otorhinolaryngology and allergology. She told us about a study at a British school. The result of the study was that during the seasons, when a lot of pollen are in the air and the students take anti-allergenics, their grades differ negatively up to a whole grade(Walker, S., Khan-Wasti, S., Fletscher, M., Cullinan, P., Harris,J., Sheikh, A.: “Seasonal allergic rhinitis is associated with a detrimental effect on examination performance in United Kingdom teenagers: Case control study”, in Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 2007: 120,2: 381-387). So the capability of the student's performance suffers from the medicine and another side effect is fatigue.

1. Cell-Type-Specific Optical Neuromodulation Interfaces: They developed optogenetic molecular methods for making neurons able to be activated or silenced by multiple colors of light, hoping to stimulate and inactivate neurons precisely from one to many at a time, and with more complex spatiotemporal patterns.
2. Gene Therapy Devices: They are developing fluidic systems to facilitate viral delivery in complex tissues since gene therapy is increasing its importance in years to come.
3. Molecular Sensitizers for Optical Manipulation of Biological Systems: They have engineered molecular sensitizers making genetically specified neurons can be activated and silenced by differently-colored pulses of light.
4. Non-Invasive, Focal, and Portable Brain Stimulators: They are applying modern engineering techniques to create a portable, focal, non-invasive brain stimulator that enable a new platform for therapeutic neuromodulation.
5. Principles of Controlling Neural Circuits: By using cell-type-specific optical neural control technologies , they are seeking to discover new principles for treating neural disease.
6. Real-Time Data Mining and Perturbation: They propose to design and develop a system that continuously generates novel data-modeling hypotheses and evaluates them in real time, testing models of ever-increasing complexity on data as it comes in.

The Similarities and Differences Between Our Project and Synthetic Neurobiology Group
The similarity between our project and research in synthetic neurobiology group includes our devotion to developing one non-invasive, focal, and portable brain stimulators, which can apply to future therapeutic neuromodulation.We both use some standardized sets of bioengineering parts, and some design rules for creating the novel neurobiological systems, which make sense and work in a predictable way.
Though we have the same final goal, there are some differences in the design circuits. The main part of the research in synthetic neurobiology group uses optogenetic molecular methods for making neurons able to be activated or silenced by multiple colors of light. In this part, the biochemical circuits mainly dominate the whole process. However, on the other hand, we used the mechanic force to induce the light by changing the conformation of the transmembrane protein.The induced fluorescence phenomenon is directly using physical approach instead of using the traditional biochemical circuits. (See Optomagnetic design ) The circuit concepts we come up with combine both physic and biochemical views; we use physical force to drive the circuit hoping to light up"

The aforementioned skills included the ability to design and troubleshoot experiment and utilising a wide variety of tools to be able to present our information/data in the most visually appealing and engaging way. Through our expansive public engagement and outreach, communication skills and fundraising skills were also gained.
Subsequent to the presentation numerous students were asking questions and seeking further information on the iGEM competition. For our team it was a great experience to present a briefing on our project to other science students in advance of the jamboree in Boston!
Talk by James Watson
In the early part of the summer on the 15th June the Nobel Prize Laureate, molecular biologist and geneticist Dr. James Watson was cordially invited to our University to open a new building. The said building is named after Dr. Watson in recognition of his extensive work to pursue knowledge in an array of modern areas of research. Given his work specifically in genetics and cancer.
DNA is integral to synthetic biology, we thought it would be insightful for us to attend the event. Our team was delighted to be able to attend the opening as well as the preceding talk given by the Nobel laureate. The aforementioned talk was entitled “Towards Curing Incurable Cancer”. Despite the fact he is 88, Dr. Watson illustrated a keen awareness in the ongoing developments in cancer research. He emphasised that he believes the acquisition of a “cure” for cancer is key to its eradication as opposed to the continuous improvement of treatments only. To be specific, he has personally researched into eliminating the anti-oxidative defences in incurable cancers.
After the talk, the official opening took place which featured speeches, canapes and photos alike. After introductions facilitated by the President of UCC, Dr. Michael Murphy, we felt extremely lucky to be able to engage with the Nobel Laureate for a few moments. Dr. Watson was familiar with and very positive about the iGEM competition. It was a privilege to be able to listen to and meet with this renowned scientist. We managed to capture the occasion in a photo with the Nobel Laureate which can be seen below.
Irish Science Week
The Irish Science Week is an annual event held around the country where there are several different free events throughout the week (13th to 20th November). This year we will be taking part on two different events at University College Cork and a nearby community. On 13th of November, we will be running a workshop on the introduction to DNA and genetic engineering. Participants will have the chance to extract banana DNA"

He has established a variety of animal models, made outstanding contributions at the pathogenesis of cancer research and treatment, and he has received many national funds in the United States, so that his research has been well funded.
Professor Li introduced the current research trends of tumor prevention and treatment, made in-depth discussions for cancer stem cells, tumor biomarker, the relationships between the tumor and inflammation. In addition, professor Li also talked about his expectations for good students, which are “motivation”, “detail”, and “attitude”. Professor Li is an excellent scientist, and we would like to follow his path and make our contribution to the scientific research.
2.Law & Regulation
Law & Regulation about gene science and technology
For this project, we modified some genes using techniques of synthetic biology and constructed a recombinant plasmid. The Bifidobacterium transformed with this plasmid can settle in the tumor regions, and secret the apoptin protein, and kill tumor cells. This could potentially be developed into a novel therapy method for the treatment of tumors. To a certain extent, gene modification is gene therapy, and our project is about gene therapy to tumor cells, imperceptibly we may put ourselves in the center storm of ethical and juristical issues. Therefore, to have a deeper perspective about the ethical and juristical issues in China, as well as to better understand the potential biosafety issues of our project, we discussed some questions with two experts in law, Ms. Fang Ruan, a judge from the People's Court of Jinjiang, China, and Professor Zhipeng He, Jilin University School of Law. They shared with us their insights and a great critical thinking of moral and ethical issues. Thanks for their generous help and assistance; we get a complete result in the Human Practice.
Dialogues with law expert, Ms. Fang Ruan
We want to have a better understanding about law and regulation actuality in China. Meanwhile, We have great interest and also are concerned what will happen if synthetic biology is applied to human being. Sooner or later, based on the development of gene therapy, the technique used to modified human being will come true. However, what should we do to guarantee the safety? And is there any law about gene technology? Based on our concern, we have a talk with Ms. Fang Ruan, a judge from the People's Court of Jinjiang, China. She has great experience in judicial work in Intellectual Property Law. In the conversation between Jilin_China and Ms. Fang Ruan, she provided us with a full"

Water, so that the volume of both DNA and water in the tube is 35 μL total
4 μL of React 2 Buffer
0.5 μL of EcoR1
0.5 μL of Xba1
Put both tubes into the 37°C water bath for one hour.  After, place them into the 65°C heating block for 10 minutes.  This deactivates any enzymes in the tube (which is ok, because by now they’ve done all they need to).     Take the insert out, and put it in a -20°C freezer.
Antarctic Phosphatase Protocol
To the vector tube, add 5 μL of 10x Antarctic Phosphatase Buffer, 4 μL of water, and 1 μL of Antarctic Phosphatase.  We do this to prevent the vector from closing up again without any insert.     Put the tube into the 37°C water bath for 30 mins.  After, place it in the 65°C heating block for 10 minutes.
Ligation Protocol
Take the insert out of the freezer, and add 5 μL of insert and 5 μL of vector to a new tube.  Label the rest of each tube as Unligated, put the date on the tube, and stick it in the -20°C freezer incase your ligation/transformation doesn’t work.  To the single tube of 10 μL mix, add 10 μL of 2x Quick Ligase Buffer, and 1 μL of Quick Ligase.  Let this sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.
You are now done.  If you are going to transform this construction product, add all 21μL to a tube of whichever competent bacteria you're using.

- Ways that we could pitch our fragrance idea to the judges could be;  
- new smells/ novel smells 
- Environmentally friendly – less waste products, renewable source 
- Cheaper to produce than what is on the current market  
- High quality  
Roles within the team
Quick discussion on roles within the team took place and initial roles that have been decided upon are; 
- Taylor and Alex- working on the Wiki 
- Brogan- Working on the lab diary  
- What has been done in the labs? 
This week competent cells were made and transformations on the cells were started.  
It was suggested to test the competent cells with the diluted plasmid cells and kit 
Need to calculate the CFU (colony forming unit)/ plasmid mg- there is a spreadsheet on the igem webpage to help with this.

Current Events and General points 
Sheffield   meeting on the 18/07/2014 starts 1pm.  Need 1 or 2 members of the team   to go up to Sheffield and provide a short 2 minute presentation of what   out project is about.   
Elle and Alex have volunteered to go. 
Funding opportunity from ERASynBio 
A2 page application needs to be filled out underlining what our project is and why it  is important.  The deadline for the application is Monday 14th.  
ERASynBio will be supporting 20 European teams this year so we have around 1 in 3 chance of receiving funding. 
Next   week both Mark and Lisa will be back with the team so it is important   to fill in Lisa with what has been happening so she can get up to   speed.   
Our Project Idea 
The project idea has been chosen, we are going with the fragrance and perfume option.  7 sequences has been chosen;  
-S-linalool synthase: (done before)  
-R-linalool synthase 
-Germacrene-B 
-Patchouli oil 
-Limonene 
-Zingiberne 
-Geraniol 
From   these sequences need to make sure none have been done before as we need   to ensure we are creating a new Bio-brick (otherwise we cannot win a   bronze medal) If they do already exist it is advised we should simply   disregard them and move on to another sequence. 
The sequences that we have are quite long so we would need to look at using Gibson assembly in order"

Improve the function OR characterization of an existing iGEM project (that your
team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.
Our software improved from SYSU-Software project in 2015 iGEM competition on model and data, safety, and
strengthened the linkage between software simulation and experiment.
In previous SYSU-Software project CORE, data were retrieved from precursor research and other iGEM projects.
CORE used ODEs as their main model with many parameters to be estimated from various sources, making the results
imprecise in a way. This year we have developed five new models to calculate the data required in our software such
as promoters and RBSs strength, keeping the consistence in the results of different steps. For more details in our model
please see Model .
For safety, CORE took parts and chassis species into consideration but missed potential biosafety problems in prod-
ucts. This year, our project not only discussed much deeper in parts and species, searching all parts in registry,
and pairing Risk Group list from NIH Guidelines with species in our software, deleting those in Group 3 and 4,
but also constructing a chemical ban list from Catalogue of Hazardous Chemicals, deleting the circuit containing
these chemicals and stopping the users who input dangerous chemicals.
For more details on what we have done on safety. Please see Safety .
CORE helped the user construct the plasmids for experiment when results shown. Besides the plasmids, our software
will provide a protocol for realizing the circuit with chosen plasmid and chassis species, and a record frame
for uploaded experiment data, which will be saved in our software for future usage. For more about this system,
please see Design .
Michigan_Software Team have developed a useful tools, Protocol Cat for protocol collection and established
a large protocol database. Our project improved their work from collection to generate a standard protocol
for a specific plasmid and species. For more details can also see Design .
We continued to use the frame of installability test applied by 2015 SYSU-Software team and finished our test of
CRAFT on three systems. With this frame, we also operated installability test for our distributed computing plug-in,
Satellite, on linux. For more about our installability test, please see Demonstrate .

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 4_-_-_TEXT.html,"cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.

SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," which is hard to explain because it’s not                     consistent with the experiment we would describe later (Table 4) . Theoretically, after adding pucM and                     4.1.1.97, the reactions can attain equilibrium more quickly and perform better in urate consuming when                     measured at the same time.
Table 4 Results of separated crude extraction mix experiment. Only with pucL the urate concentration can decrease. The numbers                     refer to the HPLC original peak area.
We still ligated two (pucL + pucM) enzymes system and three enzymes (pucL + pucM + 4.1,1,97) in pathway in one plasmid (transformed                     in E. coli BL21) to test the function (Table 5). Promoters for pucM are chosen based on the range of                     their expression ability. We wanted to elevate the expression level of pucM as much as possible. So,                     J23100, J23106, J23107, J23108, J23117 were chosen. Those pathways with different promoters were submitted                     as parts and details are in the following table.
Table 5 The pathway constructed. PucM is driven by promoters with different strengths.
We used the crude bacteria extraction to test the whole pathway function directly. Before we started to react, the total                     protein quantity of each sample was made the same. 100ul crude extraction was added into 900ul PBS with                     urate (PH=8.0). HPLC was performed after reaction for 2h and 100 ℃ heat for 10min.The results show that,                     pucM did work (Figure 4, Figure 5). The tendency can be explained as follows: when the promoter is too                     strong, it causes excessive consuming of energy in the bacteria, and the expression of the main enzyme                     pucL is thus limited; when the promoter is too weak, the reaction can’t attain equilibrium as quickly                     as with a stronger promoter. So, when measured at the time, if the equilibrium was not attained, the                     performance of the pathway with weaker promoter would be worse. Our modeling result is consistent with                     our experiment result here. However, the result of separated crude extraction mix experiment can't be                     explained with the same theory, because when the continuous measurement was performed, performances of                     different reaction systems with PucL protein were always the same when measured at a time.

The 1st generation CAR molecules only include a CD3zeta signaling domain, the minimal domain for T cell activation,        while 2nd and 3rd generation CARs also include one or more co-stimulating domains from CD28, CD137, 4-1BB, or others. The addition signals enhance cytokines production and facilitate expansion of CAR T cells population upon repeated exposure to target
antigens(June et al., 2018) .
Similar to other types of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapy, CAR T therapy requires drawing peripheral blood from the patients,        Sorting out T cells, introducing new receptors by transducing T cells with lentiviral vectors, and expanding the population in vitro        before re-infusion into patients.
CAR T therapy has achieved unprecedented success in hematological cancer. In several clinical trials using CAR T to treat leukemia        and lymphoma, high percentage of patients experienced partial or complete response(June and Sadelain,        2018) .
The Adverse Effects
However, without proper control after administration of CAR-T cells, severe adverse effects associated with CAR-T therapy may bring        fatal risks to the patients, especially during the clinical trial stages. The most common side effects include cytokine release        syndrome, on-target off-tumor toxicity and off-target toxicity.
cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
CRS is considered the most common acute toxicity in the CAR T therapy, with patients experiencing fever, tachycardia, hypotension,        and other symptoms after infusion of CAR T cells. The cytokines can be produced by CAR T cells themselves or by other immune cells        like macrophages. Likewise, a wide range of cytokines participate in these pathological conditions, including interleukin-6 (IL-6),        IL-2 and interferon-γ(Maude et al., 2014) . The CRS development correlates with high level of        CAR T cells number and peak level of several cytokines and is also related to tumor burden(Brentjens        et al., 2013) .
Neurotoxicity

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Team:UCL London/HumanPractices/Debate
From 2011.igem.org
To help guide our exploration of the social issues around iGEM we held an evening of discussion and debate. We invited people from a wide range of backgrounds: biochemical engineers, social scientists, philosophers, artists, historians, religious representatives, humanists, fellow students and anyone else with an interest in the topic.
We started by explaining briefly what synthetic biology was and how it came about, describing iGEM, our project, and our consideration of social issues so far. Then the evening got interesting; we were hit by a barrage of questions about the role of synthetic biology in society. Here are a few issues that were unearthed during the debate.
Can we draw parallels between synthetic biology and other technological developments to help us understand the current processes and anticipate future issues?
A comparison has been made between synthetic biology and computing; Paul Freemont of Imperial College London explained to The Guardian in 2009 that a comparable stage would be the development of early, noisy, transistors and their fine-tuning by engineers.
Modern computing networks are relied upon for vital public services, and faults can cause loss of life when these fail. Synthetic biology also has the potential to cause illness if things go wrong, and an important consideration is the expansion of its availability to those without training in handling dangerous materials. Controversies such as that surrounding GM foods and MMR vaccines show that research must be publicised early to gather external opinion to help shape regulation and drive research toward acceptable and valuable goals.
How extensive is the garage biology ‘movement’, and should we embrace it?
This was a point of great contention between attendees, with some arguing that the technology is in place for the establishment of at-home laboratories, and others skeptical of the current availability of the required equipment. Most agreed that it would have a democratising effect for science in the future.
What was agreed, however, was the shortening timeframe before the equipment and knowledge is available outside the laboratory. This sparked questions about the safety of so-called ‘garage biologists’ developing genetic creations that could potentially cause a health hazard. With the proper containment, it was explained, synthetic biology can be taken as safe. Outside the laboratory, it is impossible to predict the dangers that could arise from at-home experiments. iGEM and MIT have fostered a ‘hacking’ culture around synthetic biology, similar to the development of open-source software, and this has most likely contributed to the enthusiasm of hobby geneticists.

July
During July, the whole team reviewed the literature. We constructed the plasmid and searched quantification methods for specific proteins. The wet lab started with the knock-out of genes for the development of the right strains and the first mathematical models were made. We want to keep everybody updated about our work by using social media and developing the wiki. Education and events for collaboration between different iGEM-teams were planned. Also practical arrangements for the stay during the Giant Jamboree were made. At the 21st of July, we held a meet-up with the iGEM team of Toulouse to discuss our projects.
June
In June, the new exam period arrived. Members with few examens reviewed the literature and start searching sponsors.
May
The ’Opening Event’ took place on the 20th of May. Here we introduced our topic to the advisors and potential sponsors.
April
On the 21st of April, we shared our topic with the advisors. We started organising  ourselves, by  dividing the team in subteams.

Fermentation Kinetics
Ethanol production rate depends on the cell and substrate concentration. We also considered the mutual inhibition of xylose and glucose fermentation along with the alcohol inhibition. Furthermore, because even when the glucose is consumed completely, the xylose utilization is slower, the phenomenon is shown with a constant (Olsson, Hagerdalt & Zacchi, 1995). Thus, we used the formula developed by Olsson, Hagerdalt & Zacchi (1995) in which the xylose and glucose fermentation was calculated separately and then simultaneously.

The resilience of silk to many different solvents is well known. In order to dissolve silk, we used lithium bromide, a strong chaotrope[1] that disrupts the hydrogen bonds and thus secondary structure of the silk.
We dissolved our silk in 9.3M LiBr at 60 C for 4 hours.
Silk solubilized in 9.3M lithium bromide.
We dialyzed our silk in SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing of 3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoff against double deionized water. We dialyzed for 48 hours with a total of 6 dialysis bath changes. Following dialysis, we centrifuged the solution to remove any flocculents and other insoluble proteins.
Concentration Dialysis
The previous dialysis results in an aqueous silk solution with concentration ranging from 4% w/v to 8% w/v (40 - 80 mg/mL). This is too dilute to spin into a fiber, so the solution must be concentrated by dialyzing against a highly concentrated polymer solution. The polymer solution draws water out from the silk solution by osmotic pressure.
To concentrate, we dialyzed 10 mL of aqueous silk solution in a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette of 3.5 kDa Molecular weight cutoff against a solution of 10% w/v 10,000 molecular weight PEG for 18 hours. This will yield an aqueous silk solution of 15-18% w/v (150-200 mg/mL) concentration. Dialyzing the solution for too long will overconcentrate the silk dope, which will lead to the silk forming a gel in the cassette. Once a silk has gelled, it is no longer usable in any further processing steps.
19% w/v silk dope after concentration dialysis.
Spiking with the NCSilkGFP
NCSilkGFP was added to the silk dope such that the resulting solution had a 1:750 mass to mass ratio of NCSilkGFP to native B.mori silk.
Spinning the composite silk
In order to form fibers from silk, soluble silk protein solutions must be much like how they are in natural spider spinnerets. The majority of spinning methods entail pushing, or extruding, silk solution through very thin channels. During this extrusion, shear forces on the silk solution cause the amino acids of the proteins to align in a way that allows the strong beta sheets of the silk structure to form. Multiple proteins are similarly aligned, causing separate proteins to interact"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting"

BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Modelling#BSIM#GUI_-_-_TEXT.html,", collision signalling, is a very useful diagnostic tool. When a bacterium collides with another bacterium or a solid object, it changes colour. This lets the user know that collisions are working properly, and the total number of post-collision bacteria after a specified time interval can be used as a measure of bacterial motility or density.
Users can choose the initial colour and size of a bacterial population, and specify whether or not they move. For populations greater than 1, the GUI gives unique random initial positions to every bacterium in the population. This is done to avoid the situation in which several bacteria occupy the same space at the beginning of a simulation. For populations of exactly 1 bacterium, the user can specify the exact initial position of that bacterium. User-specified initial positions take priority over random assignments, meaning that no two bacteria will occupy the same area unless the simulation area is completely filled. Under default simulation settings, it would take 1 million bacteria to fill the simulation space. As such it is unlikely that this situation will ever arise.
Screenshot of Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Dialog
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Dialog
Coupled ordinary differential equations are a standard method of describing the dynamics of enzyme kinetics and GRN models. Our GUI needed to have a good way of inputting coupled ODEs, ideally without having to know any JAVA. ODEs are not considered to be simple mathematics, so may not be accessible to all biologists. This is unfortunate, but can't be ascribed to the GUI, rather to the nature of ODEs themselves.
The ODE dialog opens when bacterial populations with either ODE signalling or ODE production rates are added. The dialog opens with the relevant production or signalling sections enabled. Users must then provide a vector of variables, the equations governing the way those variables change over time, and the initial values of each of those variables. The ODE equations may contain an unlimited (but finite) number of parameters, which can be defined in the central-left text box. The parameters could be constants, but could also be taken from the simulation environment. An example of this would be using the chemical concentration at the current location of a bacterium as a parameter.

However, because of time constraints we were unable to express this protein in the same cells as Δ12 and Δ15 desaturases were expressed, thus we couldn’t obtain the 18:4 fatty acid we expected in the beginning. However, we were able show the desaturation activity of Δ6 desaturase as 18:2 fatty acids were detected. The final step was inserting our 3 genes into the submission vectors, ready to be sent off as our new Omega-3 BioBricksTM!

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," schools and universities alike.
An general introduction about synthetic biology by Prof. Ignatova
with three core questions:  what is synthetic biology? where does it come from? how can we use it to shape a better future?
In the year 1980 the term of synthetic biology were conceived by Barbara Hobom for genetically engineered bacteria, who were modified using recombinant DNA technology. In 2000, the term 'synthetic biology' was again introduced by Eric Kool to describe the synthesis of unnatural organic molecules that function in living systems.
One of the mayor advances has been the upgrade of sequencing technologies which allows first attempts to simulate synthetic life.
Other parts of the introduction were approaches developed by Georg Church, Craig Venter, as well as , the metabolic „frustration“ and systems biology that was coming to help with this problem in science.
One of the most famous examples of genetic engineering is the production of Insulin in E. coli.
Subfields of synthetic biology are DNA-based biocircuits, Minimal genomes and Protocells.
Another important aspect of  synthetic biology is biosafety. Assessing the risks of products, functions, or systems is necessary.
Nediljko Budisa
We invited  Nediljko Budisa to speak about „synthetic biology of the genetic code engineering“  for us as well as the public. Nediljko Budisa is scientist at the institute of technology TU Berlin ( www.biocat.tu-berlin.de ).
He gave an introduction to methods for genetic code expansion: state of the art, problems, solutions, and future prospects.
He likes to view a synthetic biologist as an engineer, treating all of the concepts and research are part of minimal organisms or minimal cells with „programmable“ parts. He predicts the possibility of  building complete  biological machines in about 20 years (a little forecast of the future).
He introduced  us to his work on the  process to go  from gene to synthetic protein, employing more than just the  20 canonical amino acids, introducing new artificial amino acids and thereby extending the genetic code. Furthermore he explained the co- and post-translational modifications and general issues of protein engineering with non-canonical amino acids.

In the Q&A session after CCIC's presentation, we resorted to Dr. Guo                         Yutian                         for his                         consultancy,                         one of the judges for the session. He suggested that we directly increase the volume of the                         yeast                         solution used to                         extract the plasmid, and then concentrate the extracted plasmids with low concentration to                         obtain                         sufficient                         plasmids entailed by sequencing.
Project display:
CCIC highly simulates the process of Giant Jamboree, providing us with a precious opportunity                         to                         exercise our                         presentation and poster demonstration.
2. During the poster display, adviser of PKU-China, Li Cheng, suggested that we add the                         necessary                         textual                         explanations in the poster to help the audience understand the contents. He also reminded us to                         pay                         attention to                         the                         academic display specifications of the icons, so as to improve the display of the contents.
3. In the course of communicating with other teams, we gathered some puzzlements about their                         projects.                         For                         instance,                         is it possible to improve the GC content and reduce the difficulty of splicing by codon                         optimization of                         the whole                         genome? What is the formation mechanism of mitochondrial organelle membrane? These questions                         have                         helped us further                         boost the integrity of the collected materials and accumulate knowledge for the Q&A during                         the                         GJ                         presentation.
4. The CCIC Organizing Committee also gave us feedback with particular reference to our                         project,                         suggesting that we                         elaborate the project background and plans for how to verify the genome function in the future.

The world‘s most commonly used insect repellent is DEET. Scientists long surmised that DEET works by blocking insect olfactory receptors for 1-octen-3-ol, a volatile substance that is contained in human sweat and breath [1]. However recent studies show that insects are able to detect DEET and other smells with olfactory and gustatory receptors which means they can sense DEET and avoid it [2]. DEET is often sold and used in spray or lotion with varying concentrations up to 100%. A concentration of 75% provided more than 90% reduction of mosquito bites for up to 8h post-treatment [3]. Even though these are really promising results DEET has side effects. It can act as an irritant and cause epidermal reactions, breathing difficulty, burning eyes and headaches [4]. One really terrifying fact is that in the DEET Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) in 1998, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported 14 to 46 cases of potential DEET-associated seizures, including 4 deaths [5]. Another, meanwhile in Europe and USA forbidden insect repellent, is Dichlordiphenyltrichlorethan (DDT). DDT was the world’s most commonly used insect repellent until the 1970s. It was used in the second half of World War II to control malaria and typhus among the troops and the civilians. For his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods the scientist Paul Hermann Müller  was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1948. Because of its effectiveness it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide. At this point of time nobody foresaw the immense consequences the usage of DTT could have, except Rachel Carson. She had concerns about its use and observed the environmental impacts that coincided with widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States and published the book Silent Spring. The book claimed that DDT can cause cancer and the usage in agriculture was a threat to wildlife, in particular for birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States in 1972. A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. In"

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015,Team:OLS Canmore AB CA#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," safe from anything given off by our assays. We will maintain our safety standards while measuring in our assays to ensure our construct can be the best it can be.
Safe implementation is one of our teams largest concerns as many people in our community, as well as the surrounding area will be effected by our project after implementation due to it being designed for use in wastewater treatment plants, poultry farms, and at rendering plants. Because these are such big industries that effect people on a large scale, we must ensure our construct will not cause harm in anyway before we take it outside of the lab. We strive to achieve a safe and easy working construct when considering the implementation process and the precautions taken to do so safely for everyone. At the moment we are taking into consideration different ways to prevent leaks or exposure of our construct into the environment, water source, and general public. The environment is of huge importance to us because we live in a wildlife corridor outside a national park. We do not want our construct to leak into the ecosystem and cause potential harm, so containment is vital. In order to prevent leakage and contamination, we have been working on the creation of a containment chamber for our enzyme that will be safe and easy to implement on a mass scale. Through extensive research we have determined that a membrane bioreactor or an MBR would be the best way to safely contain the enzyme.
Bioreactor at our local wastewater treatment facility
Membrane Bioreactors are the safest option for a containment vessel in wastewater treatment facilities and on farms due to them being closed containers. Many self clean and will not break with ease (1). Membrane Bioreactors are the absolute best way to implement our construct in the ways of hair as they are the most effective at breaking down waste, have many positives and are the safest containment option. MBR’s are also safe for the environment and animals. Bioreactors of all kinds can be dangerous however with simple training which most people in wastewater treatment plants already have they are safe with little chance of injury, problems or death. The most common safety concerns are as follows:
Bioreactors can be explosive if incompatible chemicals are placed in or around bioreactors
Bioreactors generate carbon dioxide if one is in an enclosed space with a bio reactor they can experience oxygen deprivation
Clothing which is baggy can be easily caught in bioreactor or other equipment associated with bio reactors.
Workers may be exposed to waste contaminants by inhalation, ingestion or absorption.
Biological activity of the bioreactors may be enhanced with the addition of nutrients or other chemical agents. These agents may include nutrients, methanol, or other chemicals"

Methane Biosequestration
Creating Bacteria to Break Down Methane
Environmentally friendly strategy for ameliorating global climate change
Background
Design
Results
Conclusions
Abstract
Global climate change is the most profound threat facing society. Greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane are major contributors, with methane being 29 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Sources of methane include landfills and animal farms. Current methods to control methane emissions include combustion into carbon dioxide, which depletes methane but at the levels present naturally is inefficient for generating energy. We plan to create strains of E. coli that break down methane using methane monooxygenase from methanotrophs, organisms that use methane as an energy source. Methane will be oxidized into methanol, which could be extracted for industrial use, but we plan instead to introduce other metabolic pathways (perhaps in co-cultured bacteria) that convert methanol into cellular metabolites (biomass) or else carbon dioxide. Our biological removal of methane could be implemented into the piping of landfills as an environmentally friendly strategy for ameliorating global climate change.

Global climate change is one of the most pertinent threats facing our world today. Greenhouse gases absorb solar energy and reemit it as heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, causing the temperature to rise. Most people are already aware that carbon dioxide is a major contributor to the greenhouse gas effect. Methane is another such greenhouse gas, and, though not as abundant as carbon dioxide, is actually more potent per molecule1. While most government agencies and companies are working to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the reduction of methane emissions is often overlooked.
The three biggest contributors to methane emissions are fossil fuel production, livestock farming, and landfills. Several ways of managing and reducing emissions are employed at these sources. Legislation passed by the EPA requires oil and gas companies to monitor their methane emissions and forces them to operate under regulations that require emissions to be under a certain quantity2. Methane in landfills is managed by flaring or used in power generators that function as an alternative energy source (Peter Karasik, personal communication, June 17, 2016).
Livestock produce methane gas in their metabolism and manure produces methane as it decomposes. In attempt to control the amount of methane produced by the latter, farms can"

Science Rendezvous Kingston 2017
Promoting Synthetic Biology to the Kingston Community
QGEM strives to make an impact educating the local Kingston community about synthetic biology and the importance of scientific research. This year, QGEM participated in Science Rendezvous Kingston, where we hosted our own booth and organized activities for local families and children to engage in.
One of the activities we hosted at our booth allowed children to carry out their own test tube experiment growing yeast. We set up flasks containing either water or sugar water, then introduced dry active yeast into either medium and sealed a balloon overtop each flask. We had children predict which flask they believed would produce the larger balloon, and allowed them to observe as the process of cellular respiration took place, causing the balloons to expand as the yeast produced carbon dioxide in the flasks. This was a great opportunity for children and their families to learn about a simple science experiment that can be done at home to learn about the wonders of cellular biology!
Another activity that we hosted at our booth allowed children to explore the inside of a human cell at a molecular level using virtual reality (VR) technology. Using a VR headset and the app InCell VR, participants had the opportunity to learn about cell components such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, DNA, and ribosomes all through an interactive game experience. Our VR station was a huge success, especially with the younger audiences!
Finally, we provided the kids with a take-home activity that they could perform as a science experiment on their own with adult supervision. Our take-home activity involved an alternative spin to Gregor Mendel's peas, where we gave kids the opportunity to grow and cross cherry tomatoes. Each family was given a packet of cherry tomato seeds with seeds for red, gold, and black cherry tomatoes as well as an instructions manual for crossing tomato plants. Our activity, named ""Mendel's Tomatoes"", will be a great hands-on supplement for children aspiring to be young scientists to learn about topics such as genetics and inheritance.

Hello, my name is Lucy as you can probably see and I’m from Brighton, but decided to start a bioengineering course at The University of Sheffield. Mostly because we don’t have any good universities in Brighton. We do, however, have an excellent aquarium, which I enjoy visiting very, very much. Because I am running out of the word limit, I feel like I should express my love and passion to iGEM. Team is great, but Piotr Janas is the pillar that holds us together.

In the figures are the FACS test results of our parts., which are EBFP2 without and with intein respectively. The EBFP-A signals tell us that the split florescent proteins could fuse together and emit florescent light.
Without Dox, constructs containing CMV show no florescent signal, which means that one single N- or C- terminal cannot light up. However, once the other half is induced, they bind and emit light.
This serves as an excellent reporter system. We can co-express EBFP2N:IntN and EBFP2C:IntC with target proteins A and B respectively. Only when both A and B are expressed, EBFP2 signal can be conveniently detected by flow cytometry or microscopy. If either A or B is not present, EBFP2 stays in darkness. Therefore, we can easily put our hands on the information about A and B’s expression states.
Although our program is a fundamental one and have no specific practical application in our minds beforehands, our work unexpectedly produces useful tool for genetic research. This is a footnote of the unpredictable and fascinating character of science."

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Geneticframe_-_-_TEXT.html,". Our reporter proteins were GFP, YFP, and RFP (Cherry). We arranged the constructions so that GFP is produced when the cells were induced with low concentrations of arabinose, YFP is produced when induced with medium concentrations and RFP (Cherry) is produced when there is a high concentration. The mechanism that enables this behavior will be explained in two parts, the first part involves the detection of the compound and the second part concerns the production of the reporter protein.
The first part of the genetic construction is responsible for the detection of arabinose. This is achieved by using a series of promoters from the pBAD family that were developed and characterized by British Columbia. Each promoter is activated at a different concentration of arabinose, the strong promoter requires a higher concentration of arabinose than the weak promoter. When the promoter is activated, it enables the expression of a bacteriophage activator that works as a PoPS amplifier. The first amplifier we used was the one provided by the Cambridge 2007 team.  However, for our construction to work, we required two additional amplifiers. So we did some more research on bacteriophage activators and constructed two new PoPS amplifier systems in order to finish our construction. We consider these new amplifiers to be a valuable addition to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, because they come from different bacteriophage families, this means that they produce different activator proteins and they can be used at the same time without causing interference.
Eventually we realized that if we didn’t have a mechanism that disabled the expression of the PoPS amplifiers, when the cells were induced with high concentrations of arabinose, all three reporter proteins would be produced. Once again, incorporating the previous advances of the 2009 British Columbia Team, we were able to overcome this obstacle. The solution consisted in implementing their “jammer” systems, in order to suppress the expression of the PoPS amplifiers as the concentration of arabinose in the medium increases. The full mechanism is explained in the following figures:
Figure 2: shows the sensor part of the final construct

Figure 3: shows the sensor when there is a low concentration of arabinose
Figure 3
Figure 4: shows the sensor when there is a medium concentration of arabinose

Figure 5: shows the sensor when there is a high concentration of arabinose

The second part of the construction is in charge of producing the reporter proteins. According to our research on biological sensors, the reporter molecule must be easy to detect"
Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"RNA plasmid 3. Recording plasmids with 4 repeated target sequences
Keeping Track of Elapsed Time
In comparison to the Individual gRNA system, where there is only one gRNA keeping track of the elapsed time before a stimulus occurs, the Oscillatory gRNA system has two gRNAs that keep track of time.
For our oscillatory gRNA system, we decided to use the blue light inducible promoter, PBLind-v1, and the blue light repressible promoter, PBLrep-v1. The inducible promoter has an EL222 binding region fused to the luxI promoter. In the off state, EL222 cannot bind to the DNA; blue light is necessary for the EL222 transcription factor to bind to an upstream binding region to recruit RNA polymerase that acts similarly to LuxR-based transcriptional activators. On the other hand, in the blue light repressible promoter, the EL222 binding region is located in consensus regions of the RNA polymerase binding site. Since the promoter is constitutive under no light, the presence of blue light causes EL222 to bind to the promoter area and repress transcription through steric hindrance [4].
In our system, gRNA A and gRNA B act as the oscillatory gRNAs. gRNA A is under the blue-light inducible promoter and gRNA B is under the blue-light repressible promoter. Under pulses of blue light, gRNA A and gRNA B are both able to switch on and off, exhibiting an oscillatory behavior.
Initially, when blue light is on, gRNA A leads the base editor to make a mutation at the first time frame. Again, due to the positioning and specific sequences of the repeating frames, the base edit made at the gRNA A target sequence now allows the edited sequence to be recognized by another gRNA-base editor complex. Revealing the oscillatory nature of this mechanism, gRNA B now matches the next repeated unit and the base editor can make a edit at that frame. This process of tracking time continues, with gRNA A and gRNA B alternating.
Marking the Presence of a Stimulus
Similar to the design of the Individual gRNA system, under the presence of a desired stimulus in the system, different gRNA is produced that matches the current frame in time and marks it with a special mutation, converting that location in the recording DNA into an MfeI restriction enzyme site. However, as there are now two gRNAs alternating to keep track of time, there are two gRNAs, gRNA A Stimulus and g"

Our team designed a water filter for sewage treatment named Filter. The filter bead filled with bi-odegradable materials polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) as a solid platform as well as carbon source for our Biofilm x Laccase, so it can decompose azo dyes while letting the liquid flow through the filter.
We find out that the Filter benefits the practical applications for several aspects. First, the con-sumable filter bead is degradable and environmental friendly. Second, Biofilm x Laccase system accelerates the disposal by catalyzing azo dyes degradation in the concentrated filter bead, in turn, saving time and increasing the efficiency. Third, living bacteria in Biofilm x Laccase system sustain longer than other filtration materials such as activated carbon which is easily to wear off by time and needed to change frequently.

Got it!  The problem was the plasmid backbone. It was thought that it was pSB1A3, but in fact it was pSB1AK3. Kanamycin has a ClaI site.
A restriction digest was performed using EcoRI and PstI. The RFP plasmid was also digested with EcoRI and PstI. A ligation reaction was performed in order for the promoter part to switch backbones (from pSB1AK3 to pSB1C3). RFP is also a form of control mechanism to see if the plasmid has the correct insert. Red colonies have RFP, while White colonies have our insert. Overnight ligation at 16 degrees.

Besides the microfluidic chip usd in East-Wind, we have many other chips designed for freeze-dried bacteria checking and the part LuxAB, BBa_K2310100 . We also put the design drawing of the darkroom we use in the accessory below. You can get the CAD files of all the designs here .
We designed the chips in the way of continuous integration, which means you will see the chips from the basic chip in the device, then add the LuxAB, then add the multichannel, then add the valve, and then add the modularization.
-----* Chips *-----
I. The basic chip in the device
This design is what we use in the accessory. The size of the sampling hole and the tube has been tested many times. Making and using of this can be found here . There is a piece of the semipermeable membrane between two layers to avoid bacteria liquid leakage.
II. Add LuxAB
This is the primary chip we design for LuxAB , which is for luciferase outputing chemiluminescence when adding the substrate.
It has an inherent switch that you can't get the signal until a few seconds after adding the substrate. And it only needs one hour or less to get the signal after induction. So we design a set of cell and tubes to add the substrate to the reaction cell (the biggest cell); you can use this construction to control the time you open the switch (get the signal).
This chip has four sampling channels and one detection channel. We have tested the fluid flow in this chip, and we sent this kind of chip to BIT .
The layers should be piled up with the order of 1 to 7 we mark in the picture. And the follow design can be assmbled in the same way.

Although we have made excellent progress up to now, in the last week or so we have been slipping behind - not ideal now we are also a member down. Therefore on Tuesday we had a team meeting to introduce some new rules to make sure we are all working for each other, working for the good of the team and also are aware of the work everyone else is doing. Introducing a team brief at the beginning of each day, a summary at the end of each week and a new deadline system means we will back up to speed in no time.  Due to the technical difficulties we had with the Interlab study we decided to order DNA constructs to approach the task in a different way. This week our constructs have been arriving meaning this lab work will begin early next week. After some difficulties with our Toehold DNA it had to be reordered, meaning this DNA is still highly awaited for!
We Skyped Manchester-Graz this week and discovered the extremely exciting project they are working on. Hopefully we will be able to find areas of our projects that overlap and will therefore allow us to collaborate. Hearing how they are approaching the Beyond the Bench aspect of their project was particularly useful as both our projects involve dealing with disease.
August
Week Ten   3/8 - 9/8
It seems we have reached the stage in our project where the lab work is going to be a main priority as we get busier and busier with experiments to carry out. As the deadline for submitting Interlab data is approaching quickly, we spent week 10 working on constructing our G-blocks, transforming them and plating out E. coli god knows how many times. At the beginning of the week we were mostly optimistic that we should see some form of glowing, however we ended the week on a low as a lack of bright green E. coli has left us in a state of disarray. We sent our samples off for sequencing to try and make some sense of what has happened. Some good news is that our Toehold DNA arrived meaning we will be able to begin the testing of the science behind our project next week, HOORAY!
Away from the practical lab work we have been extremely busy in all other departments. Our model is progressing nicely, hopefully it won’t be long until it is finished.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Regulatory sytems_-_-_TEXT.html,"y 2 are temperate phages present in the vast majority of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains; the genomic positioning of the prophages is illustrated in Figure 2. This strain of pathogenic bacteria infects a broad spectrum of animal species, from reptiles to mammals [1].
Figure 2: The positions of the prophage inserts into the Salmonella genome [Lemire et al., 2008].
Similar to the lambda phage, the Gifsy phages follow either lytic cycle or lysogenic cycle after infecting S. enterica.
Salmonella strains harbor different subsets of prophages and therefore have differences in prophage distribution, lysogeny thereby contributes to the genetic diversity of Salmonella genomes. Since phages are able to switch between these two different developmental states, they are a very interesting example of a natural genetic switch and this is why we choose to use the key regulatory elements from Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 prophages to construct our own bistable switch in E.coli [Lemire et al.,2008].
Chromosomal organization
The overall gene organization of Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 prophages is typical of the lambdoid phage family that is illustrated in Figure 2 [Lemire et al.,2008].
The regulation region of the lambda phage, also called immunity region, is of particular interest to us. This region includes the three promoters pR, pRM and pL, the left- and rightward operator and the cro and cI gene responsible for controlling the switch between lysogenic and lytic growth. The Gifsy chromosome and its immunity region are organized in a very similar way to that of the lambda phage as illustrated by Figure 4 [Lemire et al.,2008].
Figure 4: The immunity region in Gifsy phages is illustrated [Lemire et al.,2008].
Regulation of promoters and repressors
GogR and GtgR are repressor proteins found in Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2, respectively. These repressor proteins are analogous to the lambda repressor protein, cI, previously described. The Gifsy repressors (136 aa) are much smaller than the lambda repressor cI (237 aa) and lack the typical cleavage motif [Lemire et al.,2008]. The mechanism by which the repressors GogR and GtgR regulate the Gifsy promoters, pR and pRM is analogous"

The system of multiple genes vectors is composed of one acceptance vector which could transform artificial chromosome and two donor vectors(322-d1/322-d2) carrying genes. Using Cre/loxP recombination system, acceptance vector accept the gene from donor vectors alternatively to accomplish the construction of objective vectors(Lin et al., PNAS, 2003, 100: 5962-5967；Zhu et al., unpublished). Assembling the four genes(CrtI,PSY,BKT and BHY) and the specific promoters of endosperm by the principle of Gibson Assembly(Gibson, Methods Enzymol., 2011, 498: 349–361).  We got those vectors,(Ⅰ)pYL322d1-CrtⅠ,(Ⅱ)pYL322d2-PSY,(Ⅲ) pYL322d1-BKT and (Ⅳ)pYL322d2-BHY via assembling expression cassettes to donor vectors alternatively. Another time, using the assembly of Cre/LoxP system, transfer objective genes to acceptance vector according to the line of Ⅰ\Ⅱ\Ⅲ\Ⅳ to finish every steps. After the steps ofⅠ\Ⅱ, we got the binary expression vector 380-PC. The second step of Ⅲ, we got 380-BPC. After the Ⅳ, we got the 380-BBPC. Then we transformed the three vectors into Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105.

UCL,2015,Team:UCL#blah_-_-_TEXT.html," These festivals were kept up among the         nobility sometimes for a month--""monath."" The ""hunig monath"" was thus         established, and the next moon after the marriage was called the         honeymoon.
Alaric, about the fifth century king of the Saxons and Western Goths, is         said to have actually died on his wedding night from drinking too freely         of the honeyed beverage,--at least he died before morning,--and it         certainly would seem to be a charitable inference to draw, since he         partook very deeply of the ""festive drink."" It was certainly a sweet         oblivion, ""yet it should be a warning to posterity, as showing that even         bridegrooms may make too merry.""
Dr. Blanchet recently read a paper before the Academy of Science, Paris,         relative to some cases of ""long sleep,"" or lethargic slumber. One of them         related to a lady twenty years of age, who took a sleeping fit during her         _honeymoon_, which lasted fifty days.
""During this long period a false front tooth had to be taken out in order         to introduce milk and broth into her mouth. This was her only food; she         remained motionless, insensible, and all her muscles were in a state of         contraction. Her pulse was low, her breathing scarcely perceptible; there         was no evacuation, no leanness; her complexion was florid and healthy.         The other cases were exactly similar. Dr. Blanchet is of opinion that in         such cases no stimulants or forced motion ought to be employed.
""The report did not say whether the husband was pleased or not with her         long silence.""
There is too much talk in the world about woman's ""_jaw_."" As for me, give         me the woman who can _talk_; the faster and more sense the better.

Characterization
Several kings and great lords are made mention of as being particularly         fond of using the lancet. Peter the Great of Russia was remarkably fond of         witnessing dissections and surgical operations. He even used to carry a         case of instruments in his pocket. He often visited the hospitals to         witness capital operations, at times assisting in person, and was able to         dissect properly, to bleed a patient, and extract a tooth as well as one of the faculty.
The pretty wife of one of the czar's valets had the following unpleasant         experience of his skill. The husband of the ""maid"" accused"

With SZU-China
There is a long tradition of helping each other between SZU-China iGEM team and us. Participating the iGEM competition is a challenging experience for college students like us, such as multitasking with course studies, other research works in the laboratory, handling administrative works, preparing for unsuspected events etc. It is quite comforting to have a reliable ally battling by your side through the toughest days.
There was quality issues with our Interlab study kit. Our sister university, the Shenzhen University solved our problem with lending us their Interlab study kit. In September, when we were all busy with our parts construction work, they found that their pSB1C3 backbone provided by the iGEM kit was not working. As a result, their target gene could not be expressed successfully. After exhausted all the possibilities, including changing their antibiotics, LB agar plate, and all kinds of genes inserted, they came to us for help.
We provided them with the original backbone and pSB1C3 with one of our chromoprotein BioBrick, which had been constructed with red pigment coding sequence eforRed. It is our favorite design in our BioBricks submissions because it could express strong crimson color. The loss of crimson color in colonies after subcloning indicated successful gene insertion. We provided these to our colleagues, which played a great role in their following experiments.
With TCU_Taiwan
This year TCU_Taiwan came up with a great idea to use chromoprotein as a reporter to detecting diabetes. As a diagnostic tool, the bacterial indicators were expected to synthesize pigment as fast as possible when detecting glucose level in blood samples or urine samples.
Our team was also building our chromoprotein BioBricks. We shared our experiences with them them on the long expression time of chromoprotein. We also provided them with alternative suggestions , such as R-GECO which could respond instantaneously. We really hoped our advice could help them to improve their design and results.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Selection#KnockOutKnochIn_-_-_TEXT.html," the transcription activity of the bacterial two-hybrid selection system. The first opportunity is the reduction of the background activity of the promoter. The used promoter BBa_K2082210 is a little bit leaky. Therefore, without any interaction of the two fusion proteins the gene is a little bit expressed.   In the measurement the reporter was brought in the pSB4C5 plasmid. For the plasmid itself a very high amount of DNA was measured after every plasmid isolation. Therefore, we expect it to be a high copy plasmid. Although the promoter is only a little bit leaky, the high amount of plasmid leads to a high number of the reporter gene transcripts. And if every reporter is a little bit leaky, the sole number of the reporter causes a high signal of RFP. This is seen in the figure X,  considering that the RFP signal is extremly high, without any transcription activation through the two fusion proteins.   The second possibility for the low activation rate of the selection system is the native rpoZ gene in the E. coli cell. RpoZ is a subunit of the RNA polymerase I core complex. Under normal conditions the RpoZ protein would be guided by the beta´-subunit to the core complex of the polymerase as the last unit.  If E. coli produces a lot of native RpoZ it competes with the RpoZ coupled with the HA4 Monobody. Therefore, it is possible, that most of the most polymerases build their core with the native RpoZ instead the RpoZ-HA4 fusion protein. In this complex it is not able to be recruited by the second    fusion protein and the transcription activation of the reporter stay off.
An interesting fact is, that the RNA polymerase do not necessarily needs the RpoZ protein of their functionality (Gosh et al., 2001; Mathew et al., 2005). Therefore, the next step for the bacterial two-hybrid system is a knock-out of the native rpoZ gene combined with a knock-in of the beta-lactamase containing reporter( BBa_K2082238 ) in the genome of our working strain JS200 of E. coli. With this attempt it is possible to decrease the background activity of the reporter by only one copy of the reporter left in the cell and to eliminate the expression of the native RpoZ   and preventing the competiton of the native RpoZ with the RpoZ-HA4 fusion protein in one step.

Oligo design
While the recombination frequency of MAGE can be increased by doing multiple cycles, care should be taken when designing oligos to ensure high efficiency for each individual cycle. There are several parameters that can be optimized to increase the recombination frequency.
The oligos should target the lagging strand of the replication fork as this is 10-100 times more efficient compared to targetting the leading strand, and the folding energy of the oligo should be considered, as it may form hairpins if it is too low, preventing incorporation.
The frequency is also dependent on the length of the oligo, as shorter oligos are less efficient due to their lower hybridization energy to the chromosome, while longer oligos have a higher tendency to form hairpins. 70-90-mer oligos seem to be the most efficient in E. coli [16].
Designing many optimized oligos for MAGE experiment is a time consuming task. Considering a 90-mer oligo with a single mismatch and 15nt homology arms results in 60 possible oligos with different secondary structures and consequently different recombineering efficiencies. Much of the time spent on designing oligos can be saved by using the online tool MODEST  [20].
Oligo mediated recombineering in Bacillus subtilis
While the described λ Red reecombineering system is well exploited in E. coli the last years, the technology has not been adopted for genome editing to the same extend in other microorganisms. Application of λ Red reecombineering system has been described in Bacillus subtilis (ARTICLE 2012), but with longer oligos of approx. 2,000 nucletoides generated by PCR [21]. Besides expression of Beta, Sun et al. also expressed homologous recombinases from other phages. The gene product of region 35 (GP35) from the native B. subtilis phage SPP1 to Beta. Gene product of region 34 (GP34) encodes an endonuclease similar to λ Exo and GP35 is a recombinase protein homologous  and GP36 is an ssDNA binding protein [22,23]. This native Bacilli reecombineering system yielded higher efficiency compared to λ Red"

2012/12/1
Zhu Meng got an idea and named it TRANSGENIC DETECTOR：At present, the growing variety of transgenic crops have resulted two types of people holding opposite views. Some approve the development of transgenic crops, believing it plays a good role in people’s health care. Contrary to this opinion is the view that transgenic crops have unknown side effects which may cause disaster. For whatever the consumer’s attitude is, s/he would like to know whether the food s/he is eating is transgenic or not. People who appreciate transgenic technology hope they eat the genuine transgenic crops, while people who don’t fears uninformed taking in of transgenic foods. Detection of transgenic crops, however, can only be done by professional biology companies now, which costs a lot of time and money for most ordinary people.
Based on the background mentioned above, if household transgenic detector can be constructed by applying synthetic biology methods on yeast, the prospects of detecting transgenic food in an easy way will be bright.
To accomplish this goal, combination of yeast surface display technology, the utility of transgenic plant’s selectable marker protein and the autoinhibition function of WIS to achieve cellular signal transduction is needed.
The second igem2013 team meeting:
1. Zhu Meng was chosen to be the leader of our igem2013 team and she seemed confused on how and by whom this decision was made :). Zhu said this decision would put a lot pressure on her. She modestly said she was not the best and to win this competition needed everyone’s efforts.

The readout was performed in the Tecan Safire 2
Conditions: Measurement conditions are listed in assay 25
Results: With the decrease of enzyme concentration we can see that the fluorescence of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 decreases slower than under higher concentrated RNA Polymerase concentration. Hence, the increase of the Malachite Green Aptamer is slower, too. The 1:10 thinner shows no increase of Malachite Green Aptamer Fluorescence and slight decrease of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 fluorescence.
▼2015-09-08  33. Comparison of the Spectra of all ATP Aptamer Spinach2 Variations
Aim: Demonstration of the enhancement of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 made by the software JAWS by exchanging the stem
Procedure:
RNA was renatured in 1x Renaturing buffer
The setup is listed in assay protocol 13
Conditions: The Spectra were measured in the JASCO. Conditions are shown in experiment 14
Results: The results show that the computer enhanced ATP Aptamer Spinach2 has a higher fluorescence than the Szostak ATP Aptamer that we added to the Spinach2. By comparing the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 to the ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 we can see that the  ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 has a higher peak than the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2.
