② E.coli will use carbon sources to maintain its survival, division and proliferation while the accumulation of metabolites is also counted in.
③ The growth model of E.coli is equilibrium increase rather than structural increase, which means the ascending rate of biomass in E.coli increases as the same as the rate for cell weight accumulation.
④ We take lactate as the only one metabolites for accumulation and lactate increase is positively related to its growth rate. Besides, overmuch lactate will inhibit the growth of E.coli.
We further construct the carbon equilibrium calculations for anaerobic lactate fermentation in batches. Therefore, we figure out the following differential equations:

(20)
Owing to the assumption of equilibrium increase in E.coli, the relations between specific growth rate of biomass and concentration of restrictive substrates can reflect in the Monod equations that we modeled. However, considering that the accumulation of lactate may inhibit bacteria growth, we introduce an extra inhibition factor for general Monod equation. Due to the positive relations between lactate accumulation and cell growth, the production of metabolites also share the same relation with biomass increase. In this way, Qp can be represented by using the function of μE.

As can be seen from the above figures, experimental results are very close to the simulation results of Ordinary Differential Equations, thus it is considered a successful model. Based on the growth model of E.coli, We constructed the co-culture MFC model.
Model For Co-culture MFC
We constructed the E.coli growth model and the monocultures Shewanella MFC model into a co-culture MFC model.  In this model, E. coli is responsible for the decomposition of glucose to lactic acid, to provide a carbon source for the S.onedensis, S.onedensis responsible for lactate decomposition of carbon dioxide, transporting the electrons to the anode by  the redox reaction of riboflavin. The simulation Results is shown as follow:

Ilaria and Kaj had some useful tips from the workshop, and the most important message  was..USE THE PARTS FROM REGISTRY.
In the last meeting it was decided, we have to either come up with a new project using  the biobricks or modify the current one to incorporate the biobricks.
S, the first task would be to read up on previous projects and look how they have used  the parts from the registry. let us each read at least 3 previous projects and discuss them next week.. i have made a  list(attached) of the prize winning ones and assigned 3 of them to each member from our  team, emphasis should be on how the biobricks were used.. (If the advisors want to do it as well.. choose any projects u wish.. except the ones in  the list)
Also please send your photos to priyanka for updating on the wiki. We should also have a  group photo sometime next week (when Prof Schwille has time) for wiki
We got a reply from Eppendorf for sponsorship :). their representative is on a tour.. and will be in dresden in the 1st week of june.. and  he wants to meet us.. he will inform us about the date and time later.

Neptune is a design tool that implements the research done by many mentors and graduate student. Before us, other students developed single, abstract software tools toward microfluidic design. These tools saw limited to no use because they failed to integrate into a bigger system. We created the software for the Neptune user interface that wraps these different projects, and we created the hardware control infrastructure for the microfluidics that are generated from this workflow. We have also contributed to the algorithmic libraries of Neptune by developing a tool called Mushroom Mapper, which allows for a higher level of abstraction when specifying microfluidic chip designs. Here we attribute the different components behind Neptune, the ones created by other students and mentors.

Experiment 2: Characterization of the cpxR promoter's response to folding and misfolding proteins through co-transformation of MalE and MalE31 coupled to arabinose promoter in cpxR reporter competent cells
Protocol:
Arabinose inducible promoter (I0500) coupled with standard ribosome binding site (B0034) and the respective maltose binding protein were transformed into competent cells containing pCpxR coupled with RFP generator (I13507). These cells were plated and incubated overnight. Colonies from each of the plates were selected and overnight cultures were prepared at 37 C. These 5 ml overnight cultures were then sub-cultured in 20 ml broth. These were shaken for 6-8 hours and aliquoted into 5 ml cultures and induced with varying levels of arabinose(percent). This was incubated in the shaker for 12-14 hours and RFP output was measured using 555 excitation and 632 nm emission frequency.
Results
Figure 2: RFP output produced by the CpxR-I13507 system when co-transfected with I0500-B0034-MalE (red) and I0500-B0034-MalE31 (blue) at different arabinose concentrations. RFP levels were measured at 555 nm excitation and 632 nm emission frequencies
Figure 3: RFP output produced by the CpxR-I13507 system when co-transfected with I0500-B0034-MalE (red) and I0500-B0034-MalE31 (blue) at different arabinose concentrations. RFP levels were measured at 555 nm excitation and 632 nm emission frequencies.
Discussion of Results and Conclusion
Figure 2 and 3 indicate the RFP output normalized with growth ratio (OD) at different levels of arabinose. Figure 1 shows that CpxR-I13507 is activated at the highest level when MalE31, the periplasmic misfolder, is expressed. This occurs around 0.2% arabinose concentration. Similar trends are observed in the case of MalE which is a periplasmic folder. MalE and MalE31 activate the system at different levels. MalE31 has similar trends to MalE but has"

""People with genetic diseases are going to go on reproducing.""
In My Opinion...
This report marks a positive step in gene-editing research. If more of this can be done (that is, using only non-viable embryos), the improvement on our understanding of early human development could increase dramatically, and could potentially lead to effective treatment of thalassaemia and many other genetic diseases such as Huntington's and cystic fibrosis, which currently have no cures. As of May 2015, four other teams in China are believed to be conducting experiments using non-viable embryos, and Huang's team aims to develop a technique to decrease the number of off-target mutations introduced by CRISPR/Cas9, this time going back to the use of adult human cells and/or animal models.
There is, however, a danger that Huang's paper could be the start of a slippery slope. His research comes as close to the ethical ""line"" as one can get; let us hope that no one stumbles over it.
THE HOW-TOS OF CONSTRUCT DESIGN
One of the main aims of genetic engineering is to get bacteria to make protein s that they cannot normally synthesise. For bacteria to be able to do this, we must take the DNA that codes for these new proteins and transfer it into bacteria, so that they can understand it and make proteins from it. One of the ways that DNA can be moved into bacteria is by using a plasmid.
A plasmid is a circular piece of DNA. The DNA that codes for the new proteins can be added into a plasmid, which can then be put into bacteria (through a process called transfection) and, providing the plasmid contains all the necessary extra features for gene expression, the bacteria will be able to make the brand new proteins. For example, human insulin is made using bacteria that have been genetically-engineered in this way. It used to be that the only way to obtain insulin was purifying it from the pancreas of cows and pigs that had been slaughtered for food. These days, we can put the gene for human insulin into a plasmid, put this plasmid into bacteria and have the bacteria make insulin for us.
The DNA sequences that you want to add to a plasmid can come from a variety of sources. In the simplest case, the"

In Figure 7, lanes 2-5 represent the Lumio stained protein extract of the BioBrick BBa_K2027005 or construct 2 (C2). Lanes 2,3, and 4 are respectively first, second, and third elution buffer washes using the His-tag nickel resin columns. Lane 5 is also C2's extracted protein, however it was extracted using a different protocol, Anti-FLAG. Lanes 6-8 contains corresponding elution buffers of the natural construct (CN), BBa_K2027007 . CN was extracted using His-tag nickel resin columns.
Figure 8 also represents an SDS-PAGE gel containing the protein extracts of BBa_K2027003 (natural construct without the elastin cross-linking domain or SN) in lanes 2-4 and BBa_K2027002 in lanes 5-7. BBa_K2027002 is the fully assembled heterotrimeric coiled-coil collagen fiber monomer, consisting of the domains BBa_K2027004, BBa_K2027005, and BBa_K2027006. Because the fully assembled construct contains three domains, we expected the protein produced would be at least three times larger than the proteins with singular constructs. However, as indicated by the gel in Figure 2, BBa_K2027002 did not produce this size, which suggested that the assembly of all parts may have introduced errors in the protein synthesis.
Figure 8: SDS-PAGE gel of extracted SN and full construct proteins (lanes 2-4 and lanes 5-7 respectively) using Lumio stain
We also explored the possibility of cross-linking the proteins. Our plan was to cross-link the proteins and compare the results with un-processed protein in an SDS-PAGE. Initially, we wanted to test small samples of cross-linked C1, C2, and C3 and S1, S2, and S3 against non-cross-linked samples. We expected cross-linked proteins to have a higher molecular weight than proteins that weren't. Since this was our first time attempting to cross-link proteins, we wanted to test our protocol on only one sample before proceeding on a large-scale cross-linking experiment.
In this experiment, we used pure pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a catalyst for the cross-linking reaction for sample construct CN. PQQ was diluted in a copper (II) solution and"

I’m interested in biology in general but in synthetic biology in particular. iGEM gives me the opportunity to apply my engineer skills on biological system and be creative. Synthetic biology is the playgrounds were you can play with your fantasy no matter how childish it might seem. I like challenges and solving problems using a different approach.
As was approaching the end of my first master year. I became very curious how synthetic biology would work in practice and the huge possibilities it can offer. Hence iGEM is the perfect opportunity to get a flavour of this exciting new field and cooperate with fellow students with the same interest.

Description
What is Parkinson's Disease?
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra in the brain. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter and important messenger between two brain regions, the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum, is necessary for controlled movements. Shortages of dopamine cause communication between the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum to become ineffective and, as a result, basic movement becomes impaired. The greater the loss of dopamine, the worse the movement-related symptoms. This is why many individuals afflicted with PD express symptoms of shaking, rigidity, slowness in movement, impaired balance, and difficulty in walking, among other things. As symptoms get worse, essential actions such as chewing, talking, or even swallowing may become difficult for an individual. Dementia, loss of sense of smell, and cognitive impairment are also apparent in the most advanced stages of PD.
What are the current Treatments?
While it is well known that a lack of dopamine causes the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s, it is unclear why PD develops and why dopamine-producing cells in the brain begin to deteriorate. Despite this, there are a number of established treatments that aid individuals in overcoming PD. However, these treatments, as with all treatments, have theirs own cons:
The most common and effective treatment for severe cases of PD is levodopa (L-DOPA) therapy. Levodopa therapy increases dopamine levels by introducing dopamine’s chemical precursor, L-DOPA, into the bloodstream, often achieved using an oral capsule. Once in the bloodstream L-DOPA can diffuse through the blood-brain barrier and be converted to dopamine by L-DOPA decarboxylase in the brain.
Despite its efficacy, the prescription of L-DOPA therapy is often offset because after the “honeymoon” phase, in which certain symptoms of PD are significantly reduced, the effectiveness of L-DOPA wears off over time, leading to ‘DOPA resistant’ motor symptoms. Furthermore, with oral capsules, additional side effects can result from fluctuating concentrations of L-DOPA in the bloodstream throughout the day before peak dosage and after peak dosage due to the “wearing off effect.” These symptoms include bradykinesia, sl"

Summary
With the spirit of communication, our team members had several communication activities with other igem teams, including attending BGI workshop, visiting Team Hong_Kong_HKUST and Team Hong_Kong_CUHK. While visiting other teams, we exchanged our opinions and discussed our projects more deeply. Eventually we have learned a lot from these communication activities and gained many constructive perspectives to improve our project.
Attending the Workshop arranged by BGI IGEM team
On May 26th , Team SUSTC-Shenzhen-B attended the Workshop arranged by Shenzhen-BGI IGEM team. Seven iGEM teams attended this workshop, including Team Shenzhen BGIC 0101, Shenzhen BGIC ATCG, SCUT, SYSU-China, SYSU-Software, SUSTC-Shenzhen-B and SUSTC-Shenzhen-A. All the teams presented their projects and shared their opinions to each other.And we got great help and lots of good advice from this communication.
Figure1. Xiaodan Zhu(Edgar), the team leader of our team, was presenting our project in the workshop arranged by BGI iGEM teams.
Visiting Team Hong Kong HKUST
In mid-July Boyu Qie, one of our advisors, wrote an email to Professor Chow, the instructor of Team Hong_Kong_HKUST, and expressed we hoped to have a communication activity with Team Hong_Kong_HKUST. Professor Chow was pretty nice and welcomed us go to HKUST and have an open communication. Therefore, on August 18h, all our teammates went to Hong_Kong and had a pleasant discussion with the members of Team Hong_Kong_HKUST.

  iGEM Berlin 2014: A remote control for E. coli
As the first iGEM team from Berlin to take part in the competition, we decided to construct a simple BioBrick that enables synthetic biologists to remotely control the movement of the laboratory workhorse Escherichia coli. A seemingly simple and non-invasive mechanism for this remote control is the use of magnetic fields, which enable a vast variety of applications. In nature, these are already used by several mammals, as well as bacteria for orientation.           Remote-controlled E. coli cells could be used as “bacteria-based nanorobots” in order to maneuver them live in the intestine - targeting diseased tissue or even tumors. Combined with BioBricks from other iGEM teams a local, site-directed treatment of intestine cancer is envisioned[1]. Therefore, we work with the probiotic E. coli strain Nissle 1917, which already has an 80 year history as a treatment for chronically inflamed intestine tissue and is sold commonly as “Mutaflor”[2].           Our experiments should enable us to construct simple BioBricks capable to produce a diverse set of nanoparticles, including quantum dots, magnetic nanoparticles, semiconductor nanoparticles, noble metal nanoparticles and many more[3]. For example, cheap and efficient production of magnetic nanoparticles could be used in hyperthermal cancer therapy. Subsequently, we would like to investigate if our method can also be adapted to the synthesis of rare earth metals, which despite their abundance are not mineable. This would offer an alternative to the environmental hazardous mining operations that are common today.           A remote control for E. coli will enable a whole variety of application relevant for bioprocess engineering. Therefore one can imagine neglecting centrifugation for cell separation - simply use a magnet. Also, it should be possible to use high frequent oscillating magnetic fields for cell lysis or even use rotating magnetic fields for self-stirring cultures in"
MIT,2012,Team:MIT#ResultsTest_-_-_TEXT.html,".  This step was inspired by the mechanism of the cooperative hybridization (Cooperative Hybridization of Oligonucleotides,David Yu Zhang,JACS 2011).  Since B is stuck with a2, it can no longer displace c2 from C, and the readout pathway described above cannot continue. Consequently e2 cannot be displaced from the readout. Therefore we will see no fluorescence.
Experimental result for the in vitro NOT GATE where the output fluorescence is normalized to the highest value of the NOT GATE transfer function and the total volume for each level of input was 100ul.
The relative concentration of A with respect of input and B is extremely important. Indeed if the concentration of A is too low the cooperative hybridization between A , B  and a high concentration of input   can be slow, consequently B can displace c2 from C, that is, we would have a high level of output although the input level is high. On the other hand if the concentration of A is too high, even without the presence of input, B will continuously reversibly bind with A. Consequently B will not displace c2 from C and therefore we would not see a high level of output when the level of input is low.
In addition to the relative concentration of the different components another important point is the absolute concentration of them. This is mainly due to how the cooperative hybridization works. Indeed the reactants are three and the products two, consequently at low concentration the reactants are more favorable in the reaction whereas at high concentration  the products will be more favorable.
Our strategy  consisted first in finding the right concentration to let the cooperative hybridization works and then we tuned the concentration of A to find the right trade of between the interaction of A, input and B when the input is high and the interaction of A and B when the input is low.
Not Gate modeling
Figure 2 - NOT GATE transfer function in vitro and by simulation using the software Visual DSD
The NOT GATE modeling was performed using Visual DSD, in Fig2 the overlay of the simulated transfer function and the in vitro one where the basal fluorescence this time was subtracted.
The simulation helped us to find the right trade off, as mentioned before, in the choice  of  the relative concentration of A with to respect of B and input.
For the rate constant we used the one from  the article ""Scaling Up Digital Circuit Computation with DNA Strand Displacement Cascades, Lulu Qian  and Erik Winfree, Science, 2011"".

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"apeutics ( Netherlands Center for One Heath 2016 ). The problem with prevention strategies and new therapeutics is that they depend on very extensive clinical trials. These trials will take longer than the validation of a detection device, that can be employed for the treatment strategies. Therefore, we focused on developing a tool that could contribute to frontline diagnostics and new treatment methods to stop the increasing use of antibiotics, which we exploit to fight antibiotic resistance in agriculture ( van Mierlo 2016 ).
Our vision
In our project, we developed a versatile, RNA-based detection tool that can reveal antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria. Once you know that a bacterium is resistant to a certain antibiotic, you can develop a more responsible treatment plan, excluding the antibiotics that you know for sure will not work. This approach reduces the development of more antibiotic resistance, thus contributing to the fight against this huge problem.
Which infection?
In the Netherlands, the dairy industry contributes to a large amount of the total revenue of the Dutch food production  ( Statistics Netherlands (CBS) 2015 ). Through our interactions with farmers, veterinarians and health and safety experts we found out that the most common disease in the dairy industry today is mastitis (check out our Integrated Human Practices page for more information). Mastitis is an infection of the cow-udder, causing over 100 million euros of damage annually in the Netherlands alone ( GD Diergezondheid 2017 ). Like most infections, mastitis is treated with antibiotics. As mastitis is a very common disease, responsible treatment is essential to minimise the spread of antibiotic resistance. We did this by testing for whether the infecting bacteria is already resistant to a certain type of antibiotics.
Mastitis is one of the two most common diseases on the farm.
Tjerkje Poppinga (farmer)
Tsjerkje is studying higher professional education livestock farming. She helps her dad on his dairy farm.
Current situation
Testing whether an infection of a particular cow with mastitis is caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria is currently an expensive and laborious process ( WVAB 2015 ). Typically, a farmer will first treat the cow with standard antibiotics. If this does not work, the farmer turns to lab analysis: he/she sends a milk sample to a company specialized in diagnostics, which then analyse what antibiotics are appropriate for treatment. This whole process, from sending in a milk sample to finding out what antibiotics to use, can take up to 3 days [refers to integrated human practices ]. This process adheres to a guideline ( Formularies ) that is followed by veterinarians when prescribing antibiotics.

Preliminary Project Outline
Fluorescent proteins emiting light of various colors upon excitation with UV light
The RMIT University iGEM (Victoria_Australia) team aims to build a biological lighting system via cell free transcription and translation also known as CFTnT technology. This project aims to apply the principles of Synthetic Biology in a simple manner that could be efficient for everyday use. The project concept was developed after the consideration of current energy and climate change issues.  A CFTnT system was chosen because in principle, the lysate used in the CFTnT system may be prepared from any type of cell. Hence, the team thought it would be of merit to develop an alternative light source, which could possibly be powered by a waste material as simple as grass clippings used as the cell lysate. The team also hopes to address cellular and bioprocess problems that arise when employing a CFTnT system and is considering many novel approaches to creating a more sustainable system that can be scaled up for practical applications. Initial experiments conducted by Victoria_Australia RMIT University team will focus on two cell-free systems derived from ''Escherichia coli'' and wheat germ.
Current Status: With lab work nearing to an end, we have created an E.Coli cell free system, transformed and purified fluorescent proteins and are currently working on expressing the proteins in the cell free system and making an iGEM biobrick. Many hours are being put in to finish our presentation and poster with the jamboree not too far away.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved"
ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the natural version of the lldR-promoter regarding its response to a large concentration range of L-lactate in a microtiter plate reader setup .
Results
Surprisingly, what we found was not the expected release from the repression of LldR in the presence of Lactate. Indeed, if no LldR is present in the cell, according to the previous model, the levels of fluorescence should be equivalent as when there is high Lactate and LldR. We can clearly observe additional activation of GFP production! Especially for BBa_K1847007 and BBa_K1847009 the levels of normalized fluorescence upon introduction of lactate into the system containing LldR rises clearly above levels observed without LldR 1 . This interesting finding leads us to reinterpret the present model. Instead of having only repression by LldR, it seems that LldR is required for the transcription machinery. LldR would play a dual role as an activator and as a repressor, as discussed previously by [Aguilera 2008] without experimental support. That made us think that we need to adapt our model to accomodate this interesting and previously unexplored finding.
Figure 2. The wild type version of the LldR-promoter shows that LldR mediates repression, as well as activation of the gene controlled by the promoter
As mentioned above, we then introduced the lactate symporter lldP into our system. Expression of LldP and LldR are present in the natural operon structure, the result of which may be rather low levels of LldR in constructs also containing LldP, when compared to the experiment shown above in which there is no lldP (see the table below).
Figure 3. In the presence of L-Lactate, LldR mediates the activation of the gene of interest controlled by the lldR-promoter. The exact mechanism of this process has not been characterized in the literature.

Levels were calculated using the Salis Lab Ribosomoe Binding Site Calculator in combination with the comparative promoter strength provided with the Anderson promoter collection.

Emily
Today I got sequencing results back for my I0500-B0034 construct.  Unfortunately it does not look like the construction was succesful, as we couldn't find either part in the sequence.  I restarted the construction, transformed it into TOP10 cells and plated on kanamycin for oveneright growth (with Dev's help) and tomorrow I shall start some more verification of these two parts seperately.  Today I also looked into some more possible genes of interest for our various circuits.  I also played around with creating a countdown to iGEM 2010 on our Wiki page.
Dev, Chris, Jeremy
Today, Jeremy restreaked the construct of B0015-R0040, did a PCR on it. He then ran a gel electrophoresis on the five colonies that grew. Colonies 1 and 5 are presumed to have the part desired as observed from the gel picture shown on the right. He also wrote a thank you letter to BioAlberta from which we received $1000 today. Dev helped Emily in her construction of I0500-B0034 through the Quick Ligase procedure. We are using presumed I0500 because we are unsure of the quality of the growth. I0500 has so far, failed to grow consistently. Chris redid the construction of J13002-E0032 to test the YFP from the Registry as well as attempting a plasmid switch of J23032 to a kanamycin resistant plasmid.

IIT_Delhi,2018,Team:IIT Delhi#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," probiotics has come to our knowledge.
Mexico
In Mexico, all food that has been processed or produced by genetically modified organisms are considered transgenic, but food containing GM or transgenic compounds are not identified, even though there are biosecurity laws and norms for regulation, such as SEP, CIBIOGEM, SAGARPA, SEMARNAT, SHCP and the Federal Law for Protection of the Consumer.
In terms of the norm, the Official Mexican, Norm NOM-056-FITO-1995, is in force and regulates everything related to GM mobilization in the country, so all public and private company must fulfill the requirements in the norm to have their food with genetically engineered compounds transit through Mexico. Furthermore, the law of Biosecurity of GMO and the Federal Law for Protection of the Consumer controls the release for consumption and commercialization of pilot projects besides regulating importation and exportation of GM in the country. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
Sweden
In Sweden every substance or combination of substances that is provided under the pretense that it has a preventative or therapeutic effect on diseases in humans or animals states for a pharmaceutical, which is regulated by the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA). When this kind of probiotic is been prepared to be released the Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board and the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics are often involved and give out statements and input in regards to the applications for clinical trials. There all pharmaceuticals that contain any modified organism need to be labeled with “This product contains (a) genetically modified organism(s)”, and all of the trials regarding GM pharmaceuticals are posted on the Swedish Medical Products Agency’s website. In Europe, the following company working with engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge: ActoBio Therapeutics (part of Intrexon) in Belgium.
United States
Engineered probiotics are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, as they are neither a food nor a drug. As a result, they currently do not require large clinical trials like other drugs in America. The following companies working with engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge: Azitra, Synlogic and ZBiotics.
Brazil
There exists no law that regulates genetically engineered probiotics, but in 2018 ANVISA, the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, opened up the public consultation and now genetically engineered probiotics were added to the regulation. Besides, there is no companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics. With this research, we were able to see that there is a growing movement of engineered probiotics mostly in the U.S"
Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"nm fluorescence output for the Mg-chelatase plasmid with mutant and IPTG. MgPPIX concentration increases after day 3.
Discussion
Our graphs of each colony are very distinguishable across the varying ALA concentrations and liquid cultures. We can recognise that the control culture of DH5a cells are much less efficient at producing CPIII and PPIX than the colonies containing the hemH mutant. On the same scale, the control has negligible amounts of both CPIII and PPIX. The experimental results revealed an additional bottleneck for maximum flux through the pathway at the penultimate step. CPIII is the intermediate in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway before the generation of PPIX, therefore, it was produced faster over the first few days before PPIX started to appear. The rates of formation were consistent with the model. As expected, our 0mM ALA tubes did not produce a significant amount of PPIX, and the highest concentration of ALA at 5mM produced the highest yield of both CPIII and PPIX.
We observe the increase in MgPPIX concentration at day 3 in figure 4 above. According to figure 3, that is when PPIX is starting to be generated. We therefore conclude that we only get accumulation of MgPPIX when PPIX increases within the cell and when we induce with IPTG.
The inconsistent colouring of the tubes was puzzling to us. We centrifuged the original samples to observe the pellet size, as we thought differing amounts of substances may have an effect on the colour. We observed different pellet sizes, but did not analyse the composition of each. Our fluorescence results indicated that the hemH mutant was effective at producing PPIX compared to the wildtype. The experiments done in previous years extracted the whole culture, whereas this year we only extracted the cells and this indicated that PPIX was present in the cells of the mutant but not in the cells of the wildtype. We may suggest in the future that the pellets are analysed to determine whether the compositions are affecting the resulting output.

University_of_Ottawa,2008,Team:University of Ottawa#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," The goal of this year’s uOttawa iGEM team consists of generating a yeast strain capable of long term protein expression.
Yeast
Heterologous (foreign) proteins are often expressed in simple microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g. E. coli) or yeast. The two most used yeast species are Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, which are well characterized genetically. Yeast provides several advantages for large-scale production, especially for the production of eukaryotic proteins, including fast growth rate, high yield, post-translational processing similar to mammalian cells (e.g. glycosylation), and efficient secretion systems. In our project, we employ the yeast S. cerevisiae (baker's/brewer's yeast) as the chassis for our expression system.
Pulsate Gene Expression
Gene expression in cells is a dynamic process in which transient responses are often observed.  This can be conceptualized as a “pulse” of protein concentration.  Achieving such a pulse involves a complex network of activities, which makes it difficult to elucidate the mechanisms in naturally occurring systems.  Nevertheless, simple synthetic networks can be created to model this behaviour.  We are working on a feed-forward regulatory motif to generate a pulsate expression of a protein of interest in response to an external stimulus. By expressing protein in short pulses rather than overexpressing continuously, the population may be able to recover from metabolic stress and remain competent for much longer periods of time.
Cell-to-Cell Communication
An important aspect of naturally occurring biological systems is the cell-to-cell communication that triggers the biomolecular responses in multicellular settings.  To build the feed-forward network, our pulse generator system uses signalling elements from Arabidopsis thaliana that have been implemented in yeast [ 2 ].  One population of cells send the signal molecule cytokinin isopentenyladenine (IP), while another population receives the signal via the cytokinin receptor AtCRE1, which induces the pulsate expression of the protein of interest.
Oscillatory Dynamics
After the pulsate protein expression event, the gene of interest in a repressed state.  It is desirable to regenerate the system so that it is sensitive to the provided stimulus again – i.e., so that the protein of interest is not repressed.  This is achieved by expressing an enzyme that can degrade the inducer molecule.    With the signal degraded, the protein of interest and the repressor protein are no longer produced, and the system returns to its initial state. The two populations of"

Cells containing BUK/PTB were fed butyric acid to a final concentration of 50 mM and glycerol to a final concentration of 15%1. The six gene pathway was fed with sodium acetate to a final concentration of 33mM and glycerol to a final concentration of 15%2. To analyse only the intracellular metabolites cells were cooled on ice, centrifuged at 5000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and pellets were re-suspended in 1mL of 6% perchloric acid. After re-suspension, 0.3 ml of 3M K2C03 was added and the cells were vortexed. Cells were centrifuged at 1300 rpm for one minute and the supernatant was filter-sterilised3. Filtered supernatant was analysed through HPLC following the protocol described above.
RESULTS:
In order to analyse the butyryl-CoA we first had to run the standards to observe at what time butyryl-CoA was retained. The results for the retention time of butyryl-CoA are shown in Figure 1.
The first sample that was analysed was the BUK/PTB pathway, the result are shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2 No peak is formed at 2.90 minutes when the BUK/PTB sample is analysed. This suggests that no butyryl-CoA is produced or that it below the detection limit.

We tried to utilize GFP from biobricks distribution to genetically label neuron AWB in C. elegans’ (Caenorhabditis elegans) head. The biobricks part that specifically marked for C. elegans is the BBa_K309016 submitted by iGEM10_Queens-Canada . Unfortunately, the sample status shows that ”it’s complicated”, which means the sample may not have been sequenced or there is some problems on it (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Parts information on BBa_K309016. A) The part registry page for BBA_K309016; B)：Description of ‘It’s Complicated’ in Registry.
To use GFP for C.elegans, we needed to modify and confirm this GFP. After getting sequence of BBa_K309016 sequence, we found that the part doesn’t start with start codon “ATG"". We optimized it by deleting 9bp in front of the start codon. Then the coding sequence starts with “ATG”(Figure 2).
Figure 2. Alignment between BBa_K309016 and BBa_K2492000 (optimized GFP) at start codon.
We successfully improved characterization of GFP for C.elegans. We submit this optimized GFP as our part BBa_K2492000 . We constructed a Str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP fusion gene and injected it into C.elegans. Promoter Str-1 drives the expression of GFP in neuron AWB, which indicate the AWB location.
We capture the image of GFP specifically expressed in AWB with confocal microscope and clearly observe AWB with its dendrite(Figure.3).

what would you grow in your iGarden?
While there is a great deal of information regarding agricultural genetic engineering presented throughout this section, we also took some time to find out what people in our community thought about this international topic. We interviewed and surveyed sixty individuals of the Cambridge community. These individuals were students, local farmers, and patrons of our local farmer markets. We asked which characteristics of plants these individuals would be most comfortable modifying, as well as if they would feel more comfortable growing their own genetically modified foods than purchasing from a conventional farm that produces genetically modified foods. We also asked whether or not each individual had a food allergy, and if he or she would be willing to eat food that was genetically modified to be hypoallergenic.
Of the people polled, most approved of modifying food crops to increase nutritional value (63%) but significantly fewer supported modification of flavor (37%), allergens (5%), color (10%), or sugar content (8%).
Respondents were fairly split over whether they would be comfortable growing genetically modified foods in their own gardens:
For those suffering from food allergy, all were very likely to eat food engineered to be hypoallergenic. Of those without food allergies, respondents were mixed on whether they would eat hypoallergenic food if they had food allergies.
Our survey had too small of a sample size to conclusively say anything about the feelings members of our community have about genetically engineering foods, but they indicate that we have a lot of work to do in making the iGarden safe and positive for others in our community.
Help us learn more about what modifications are important to you and make the iGarden better by filling in our continuing survey!

What is iGEM?
With the help of Ms. Anne Byford, the Gaston Day School iGEM team, consisting of students from the 10th to 12th grades in high school, are developing a bioengineered organism that will detect the presence of nitrate pollution in water. This year 112 teams from all over the world are competing in the Synthetic Biology iGEM competition.
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method.
iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course during MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP). The students designed biological systems to make cells blink. This design course grew to a summer competition with 5 teams in 2004, 13 teams in 2005 - the first year that the competition grew internationally, 32 teams in 2006, 54 teams in 2007, and 84 teams in 2008. Projects ranged from banana and wintergreen smelling bacteria, to an arsenic biosensor, to Bactoblood, and buoyant bacteria.
This year, we expect 120 teams with over 1200 participants from countries across Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the US to participate in the competition. They will specify, design, build, and test simple biological systems made from standard, interchangeable biological parts. Teams will present their projects at the iGEM Championship Jamboree in November 2009.

Synthetic Biology... huh?
The new field of Synthetic Biology was first recognized in 2003. It can be defined as:
A) the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and
B) the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes.

Introduction
In 1994, Calgene, an American company, invented and started to sell surprising item. It was a tomato that can be kept in good quality for a long time. In USA, major tomato production areas were Florida and California, but these areas were far away from big consuming areas. Because of this, all tomatoes shipped out unripe, and most of Americans were not able to get ripe tomatoes. New tomatoes invented by Calgene introduced the anti-sense genes. This suppressed the expression of a enzyme coding gene that is related to maturing tomatoes. These tomatoes stay fresh for long time, standing proof against long distance transport. If you know what I mean, this tomato is just what we call GM (Genetically Modified) food, and actually, this was the first GM food in the world.
GMOs are stronger against diseases, or has improved yields compared to its wild type. After this, GM foods started to be given some approval, especially in North America, while making discussions around world at an incredible speed. GM foods are expected as one of the solutions for food crisis in recent years. On the other hand, GM foods are greatly debated about their risks before birth of GM foods as items for sale.
And this year, we, HokkaidoU_Japan set this as main subject of our Human Practice project.
Why We Chose This Topic
We HokkaidoU_Japan set “Antimicrobial-peptides (AMPs)” as main theme of 2015 project, and all projects are considered to have the application to oral intake. That is, all projects of our team are related with GM foods, and that is why we chose GMOs as topic for our Human Practice.

Week 3: 6/27/10 through 7/3/10
Our project and design workplan has now been finalized!
We are proud to present our main project, a genetic circuit which will enable a lawn of E. Coli to produce a spatial oscillating pattern (stripes) upon the initial stimulation of light to propagate the signaling cascade across the lawn.
This project will build upon creating composite parts made from existing parts of the registry.
Thus, we hydrated, transformed, cultured, and miniprepped the following parts: C0078, C0079, I12006, K274002, I14015, I13453, I15008, I15009, I15010, R0082, J23119, E1010
Light Sensor
Assembly workplan for light sensor is made:
Assembling Part A: I13453 cut with Eco & Spe, RBS cut with Eco& Xba, I15009 cut with Xba & Pst, '1&2' cut with Spe & Pst
Assembling Part B: RBS w/ Spe & Pst, I15009 w/ Xba & Pst
Assembling Part C: RBS cut with Eco & Xba, J23119 cut w/ Eco & Spe
** Began assembling parts A&B
Initiator and Las Receiver
Workplan for light receiver made: R0082-RBS-C0051-B0015
Assembling RBS-C0051: RBS w/ Spe & Pst, C0051 w/ Xba & Pst
Assembling RBS-C0051-B0015: RBS-C0051 w/ Eco & Spe, B0015 w/ Eco & Xba

We must first make stocks of RBS-C0051 because it is used in multiple parts RBS-C0051 will be used in creating the construct that will test/validate the initiator, the actual intiator, and the ON switch.  Thus, there"
OUC-China,2013,Team:OUC-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," to invite Mr. Tong Zhe to give us a seminar on how to learn in the course of doing research. He gave us a talk and answered our questions about scientific research. It’s a real inspiration for us about how to educate undergraduate students to learn by themselves and for themselves.
Communicate with Tsinghua University
Communication and collaboration with other iGEM teams is another important part of iGEM. We help Tsinghua University for constructing and charactering these folowing circuit. And also, In 2011 iGEM competition, we have studied Quorum-Sensing, so we provide some AHLs they required for further experiment.

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM “what kind of human practice are you”?
Science seeks knowledge and is globally positive throughout philosophy. On the contrary the aim-oriented use of science by technique creates more suspicion for philosophers. To serve the good, technique should use adequate means to reach a determined human end, but technique is often accused of drifting towards becoming its own end. For example, what is the point of creating cars with a maximum speed superior to 250km.h-1 when the drive speed limit is below 130km.h-1? In this simple example, speed is technically researched for itself disregarding safety and human regulations. In its scale of values, philosophy usually places human ends on top, and thus technique presents the intrinsic danger of becoming its own end against human interest. At least,this is the classic philosophical critic of technique.
Then we understand why the characterisation of synthetic biology matters in philosophy. As synthetic biology is a practice that seeks knowledge through applications and vice versa, it is not a pure science. Thus, it seems interesting to address synthetic biology some of the philosophical critics that technique faces (I.). But we must also point out the development of a specific technical culture around synthetic biology, and particularly in the iGEM competition; this emerging culture may be to way to adress these critics (II.).
I. Do the Means Justify the End?
Ethics, technique and alienation
Team discussion
I believe that ethics is always necessary when it comes to science and that it is even more important in synthetic biology. The exemple you chose about cars speed limit is really clever. It illustrates exactly what might happens when we lose sight of what matters. Having a way to do something does not mean that you have to do it. Especially when doing those things have negative consequences. Creating cars with a maximum speed of 250 km/h doesn’t have any sense. Indeed, it is just useless. We don’t need our cars to reach that speed. I guess that would be okay if creating such cars had no consequences but it has : it increases the risks of accidents and implies a lot more pollution. So I think that the means do not justify the end. We have to remain responsible in all fields and especially in ours. If we got a tool that can serves a really necessary and good end, that’s okay, otherwise it has to be left on the side.
First of all, I would say that it’s depend on which field you are working in. A foundamental mathematician will not have such thoughts for example (as there is probably no deontology in this field, my remark is probably irrelevant).
As biologist, we are"

This page is designed to help you better understand our model and make your own             explorations. It is powered by our software, Nεtro, which enables you to design and explore your             own gene transcripton network. In this page, we will illustrate four essential parts of our             modelling work. The first two correspond to the Theoretical Basis part, and the last two the Network Modelling part.

This is the result of using our probabilistic model to study a multi-binding                     process, which is corresponding to Figure 2 in 'Stochastic Modelling Of The Hill Equation' (Theoretical Basis).                     You may manipulate the parameters in the model and see how they will affect the probability                     distribution of the states of the receptor with three binding sites.
The diagram of the process is shown bellow (Figure 1 in Theoretical Basis) for review.

You may manipulate the parameters in the model and see how the two models are related and how they                     differ from each other.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Precaution Studies_-_-_TEXT.html,"utionary Principle. Erkenntnis, 80, 1-13. . The epistemological condition is a proposition that stands in reference to the damage condition. The damage condition is the possible harm(s), which can happen as consequences of the activity in question. The epistemological condition is then the evidence one has for the probability that the damage will occur. The connection between the epistemological condition and the damage condition is most often thought of as a causal connection.
The three conditions in the Tripod are also the case dependent part of the Precautionary Principle. The Tripod is therefore the most flexible part of the Precautionary Principle and the different cases then require different versions of the Precautionary Principle: “[...] any statement according to which satisfying a specific [epistemological condition] and [damage condition] is sufficient to justify a specific [remedy]” STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . Which version to choose is specified by the constraints from the Meta-Precautionary Principle.
The last part, proportionality, is a contextualist-based idea. More precise it is the idea that the level of precautionary measures taken corresponds to both the probability and the damage. It is similar to the economic thought of cost and efficiency - if the cost is high, then the efficiency should be as well.
The three elements are the essential parts of the Precautionary Principle when it functions like a decision rule. But it is important to be aware that the Precautionary Principle can function as a procedural requirement, where the Meta-Precautionary Principle is highlighted or as an epistemic rule STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . We will here focus on the Precautionary Principle as a decision rule composed of the Meta-Precautionary Principle, the Tripod and Proportionality.
How does it work?
One thing is understanding the essence of the Precautionary Principle, but when it comes to how it should be applied there are different explications of it. Some interpretations focus on catastrophes (Catastrophic Precautionary Principle), for some it is a maximin rule and others again see it as a minimax regret.
The Catastrophic Precautionary Principle is proposed by Hartzell-Nichols HARTZELL-NICHOLS, L. 2012. Precaution and solar radiation management. Ethics, Policy & Environment, 15, 158-171. and"

Human Practices
Think outside the bench
As a subsidiary of the Nitrogen Project, a multi-university initiative to end nitrate pollution, our focus for human practices was largely based on agriculture. In this page, we will cover the following in detail:
The history of WashU-PSU iGEM teams and the Nitrogen Project
Our conversation with Sarah Carlson, a project manager at the Practical Farmers of Iowa, who argued that synthetic biology could not end nitrate runoff
Our interview of Ray Erhardt, an aquatics engineer, who thought that nitrate runoff must be dealt upstream of wastewater plants and in the fields themselves
We spoke with members of the St. Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board and the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, who both believed other, natural solutions to excessive fertilizer use could be more effective than synthetic biology
We interacted with scientists and researchers at Monsanto and Intrexon who suggested new approaches to our project and backed our research and mission
Our time spent interacting with future STEM students and high school teachers at Wash U and Missouri S&T and teaching them about synthetic biology
Project Formation
For the past two years, the WashU-PSU iGEM team has been working to progress the Nitrogen Project. In our first group meetings, we had to determine if we, too, wanted to contribute. Both of the previous teams worked on finding the genes necessary for expressing nitrogen in E. coli. However, they had limited success – one team claimed to find nitrogenase activity, but the results were never replicated. The other never succeeded in constructing their complex plasmids. However, we didn’t want to abandon their work and shirk the resources and knowledge of the professors and graduate students who we would be working alongside all summer. So we tried to carve out a new niche in the Nitrogen Project for ourselves – and we looked outside Wash U for help.
Enter Sarah Carlson, a project manager at the Practical Farmers of Iowa. Initially, we called her to get a better idea of the environmental consequences of nitrate fertilizer runoff in the Midwest. We explained that the Nitrogen Project aimed to eliminate fertilizer use altogether. Contrary"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"

Type I dockerin domain
Dock1 is the type I dockerin domain of the Cellulase S (CelS), part of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. The cellulosome is an extracellular protein scaffold that displays cellulose-degrading enzymes. These cellulases contain a dockerin domain that attaches to the cellulosome through cohesin/dockerin binding interactions. The interactions are calcium ion dependant and binding is specific, therefore a type I cohesin will only bind to a type I dockerin.

XDock2 is the type II dockerin domain of the Cellulosome Integrating Protein A (CipA), part of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. The cellulosome is an extracellular protein scaffold that displays cellulose-degrading enzymes. The scaffold’s components are assembled by the interaction between their cohesin and dockerin domains. The interactions are calcium ion dependant and binding is specific, therefore a type II cohesin will only bind to a type II dockerin. « X module » is the name given to the 300bp region located 5’ to the dockerin II domain in the native CipA protein. It favors proper folding of the dockerin domain and improves the ability for the cohesin to bind to the dockerin II domain.

The reason Tinsel Purple was excluded is because I ran out of PCR product for the meff Red vector that was designed to overlap with it because this vector was also used for Cupid pink, vixen purple, and prancer purple. I determined to leave tinsel purple out for now because it expresses color the least of these four and thus will be harder to tell if the Gibson assembly was sucessful or not. The Gibson product was transformed into NEB 5 alpha cells then plated on LB plates with chloramphenicol and left on the lab bench for the weekend.

BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," occurring in previous attempts at the agarose-in-plug assay were eliminated by ensuring water potentials of plug and chemotaxis buffer were as similar as possible. Both the beads and the bacteria were found to sink to the bottom of the chamber shortly after inoculation.  This makes the model much simpler, as everything can be modelled in 2D.  We showed that beads need to be left in bacteria for around 30mins in order for significant bead movement to occur.  We currently have not determined if this is because the bacteria form a layer under the beads which stops them sticking to the slide, or if adherence itself is needed for bead movement. We determined the diffusion speed of bromophenol blue dye (which is three times larger than aspartate), and concluded that by 30mins aspartate would have diffused throughout the slide.
14th August - 20th August
Agar Plug Assay
We repeated the chemotaxis assays and found that the bacterial density surrounding the plug varied and therefore we obtained more valid results by using lower magnification and scanning around the whole plug (as opposed to focussing on one area for the whole time course).  This gave a much better overview of changes in bacterial density.
We tried testing bacterial chemotaxis to 1% serine and 1% aspartate in the plug.  Bacterial density around the plug was monitored for 1hr.  Bacteria appeared to be repelled by both the serine (see below)and aspartate at this concentration compared with the control where no chemoattractant was present in the plug.  Research group page (Professor Jong Yoon, Micro/nanofluidic Bio MEMS group) indicates that serine becomes chemorepellent 1M concentration (the same may be true of aspartate).
Control
1%Serine in plug
We have been attempting a 'dead bacteria' control, but have been unable to successfully kill our bacteria without using a method that physically alters them.  We have tried sodium azide (bacteriostatic)- but resuspension allows them to recover.  Kanamycin and chloramphenicol were also used, but only for a few hours.  We might try leaving a culture overnightin these two antibiotics - this should be sufficient to kill them!
BioBrick Transformation
The transformation efficiency should be increased. It was assumed that the quality of the BioBrick DNA is the most important factor to improve. Thus, two punched paper discs of the same BioBrick were incubated overnight at two different"

Since correct assemblies of the construct described above (PlacLacZ-EYFP) should produce blue colonies that fluoresce yellow under blue light, we can get a rough idea of how many colonies are correct by counting phenotypes.
BioSandwich with OEPCR
Assembly produced around 100 colonies on a 100 microlitre plate, about half of these blue, and most of the blue also yellow.

Silk and Bacteriophage
Silk and bacteriophage are both the focus of extensive research and, while neither have discovered the limits of their application, they have yet to be concurrently examined or utilized. While bacteriophage therapy could be developed and employed in a manner similar to that of antibiotics and other therapies, encapsulation within silk fibroin has the potential advantage of significantly extending shelf-life at or above room temperature while maintaining efficacy. This has not only economic benefits – drug loss results in the loss of billions each year to specialized transport and storage – but also increases the potential for global impact by enabling distribution to developing nations with limited means and infrastructure.
Benefits
-   Easy storage; silk stabilizes biologically active substances at higher temperature
-   Effective against antibiotic resistant bacteria
-   Compatible with human tissue; will dissolve predictably
-   Engineered phage can avoid bacterial lysis to prevent endotoxin release
-   Specificity means beneficial microflora remain unharmed
Challenges
-   Safety; some phages can mutate to attack off-target bacterial strains
-   Public perception of bacteriophage; comparisons to human viruses
-   FDA regulations
-   Generation of a sufficiently diverse phage cocktail
-   Bacterial resistance to phage; CRISPR-based immunity

Approach
This project aims to create a silk bandage functionalized with bacteriophage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aereus skin infections that are thermostable at or greater than 25oC for several months.
Bacteriophage Selection
Many naturally occurring bacteriophages can be quite effective against infectious bacteria and would be worthwhile inclusions as part of a phage cocktail. These can include:
-   Sb1 staph-phage (MRSA)
-   PAK-P1 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
-   C1 (group C Streptococci)
-   B30 (Streptococcus agalactiae)
The strains above are well-characterized and would likely be effective in clinical applications, but this is nevertheless a partial list. More bacteria should be targeted, and with a much wider range of phage. Phage diversity can be achieved with conventional"
Duke,2013,Team:Duke#Modeling#Thermodynamic Model Application_-_-_TEXT.html," was calculated using Freg = 1 (no Transcription Factors). Then, the Pbound values for the three cases--1 binding site, 3 binding sites, and 5 binding sites--were calculated for repressor level from 0.1 to 10,000 molecules/cell. Then finally, the Pbound values at these three cases were divided by the basal Pbound value to find the fold change in Pbound for the three cases. The results from these steps are graphed below.
Figure 3.3.2. Graph of Fold Change in Pbound vs. Number of Binding Sites
The black, blue, and red data points indicate the fold change in Pbound when 1, 3 and 5 repressor binding sites are present. Qualitatively, it clearly looks like the slope of the hill function becomes steeper with additional binding sites. When a hill function was fitted onto these data points using ""cftool"" command on MATLAB, it was quantitatively shown that the apparent Hill coefficient increases from 1.00 to 2.99 then to 4.86 as the number of binding sites increased from 1 to 3, then to 5.
The significance of the result above is that a non-Hill equation that models the effect of multiple repressor sites on the probability of RNAP binding demonstrated increase in cooperativity with increasing number of binding sites.
Gene Expression Level vs. Binding Strength of Repressors
Figure 3.3.3. Relationship Between Pbound vs. Kd
Similarly, the relationship between Pbound and the dissociation constants of repressors was studied in this section. In addition to the variables and the values from previous section, a new set of variables were introduced to distinguish between weak and strong repressors. A value of 0.1nM was used for ""Kd,strong"" and this was the dissociation constant for strong repressors. Also, 10nM was used for ""Kd,weak,"" which wass the dissociation constant for weak repressors. Because the strength of binding is represented as the ""dissociation"" constant, higher value translates to equilibrium shifting towards dissociated repressor ([DNA]+[Repressor]) instead of bound repressor ([DNA-Repressor]).
Just like in the previous section, the basal level of Pbound was calculated using Freg = 1 (no Transcription Factors). The key difference was that there were two types of Fregs: one for strong binding and one for weak binding. The effect of different combinations of weak and strong binding was"
UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," enzymes acquired from genetic engineering. Every cell division means the step to their death. They could neutralize enormous amount of pollutant by the moment when the kill switch is triggered after 105 generations. After that, the kill switch, which have never been expressed, will be expressed and lead the owners to death. In this way, we can make them work for a certain period and then make  them commit suicide. This system has advantages compared to a system, in which kill switch is turned on when a cell stimulated by external factors. To turn on kill switches triggered by a chemical, like arabinose, It is necessary to scatter chemical and let it reach GM microorganism. This is not realistic in natural environment. Scattering a lot of chemical can have bad effect to the environment. In the sea, where added chemicals diffuse quickly, or in the soil, where we cannot add chemicals directly to GM microorganisms, we cannot use chemicals as a trigger of kill switch. On the other hand, using internal trigger system used in our project, we need not to concern about requirements for scattering chemicals or diffusion of GM microorganisms.
Let’s think about possible risks on this method. First, we should consider the case when whole system is work perfectly. Does a difference of division cycle among each cell cause problem or not? If 104 times multiplications take only a little time, it seems not to cause problems. However, how about the case where cell division takes significantly long interval?  We think there is not so much problem in this regard. First of all, even if a division interval is long, they must ultimately divide up to all counts, and all cells would be die. Next, we can indicate for two reasons that the existence of cells which are unable to divide couldn’t cause much problem. One reason is that each cell which does not divide into new cells has its lifespan and no choice to death.  The other notable reason follows from the fact that GM organisms exert critical influences on environment when they proliferate abundantly. Inversely, it can be said that if GM microorganisms’ cells with our kill system isn’t triggered, or equivalently the cells has very low level of multiplication, they have few impact on environment. Thus, our strategy utilizing a division as a gene expression trigger has fundamental advantage when we have no option other than the distribution of GMO.
Let’s further examine potential defects and environmental risks accompanied with the system.
You might find defects on mechanism of loop system. Each system is probable to stop or skip process undesiary. If the genetical process of our kill system is stopped, GM microorganisms"

Synthetic Biology on Mars
We held an interactive workshop at a Live Mars event, which over 200 Year 8 students attended! The workshop was led by Rob and Dan with the aim of introducing Year 8 students to synthetic biology, and in particular the use of genetic engineering of fluorescent markers, and its relevance to potential life on Mars. We held an interactive activity for Year 8 students that aided kinaesthetic learning to explain how luciferase from fireflies and GFP from jellyfish can be genetically engineered into E. coli to produce E. coli that glow. To achieve this, they designed and used 3D printed models of jellyfish, a firefly, and a rod shaped E. coli bacterium along with 'gene plugs' of GFP, luciferase, and other fluorescent reporters that students plugged into the E. coli to make it glow different colours. This kinesthetic approach to learning seemed suitable for engaging Year 8 students into a new subject the overall reception was positive.

Mars
Mars is there, waiting to be reached – Buzz Aldrin
May 2008 – This was the first time NASA’s Phoenix lander detected perchlorates in arctic Martian soil. More recently, the space agency spotted perchlorates in the Gale Crates with their Curiosity Rover, which landed on the red planet in 2012. According to investigator at the University of Arizona, the high levels of perchlorate present in the Martian soil and dust particles would be toxic to humans. 2 These dust particles, present on Mars as well as on the Moon, are approximately 1.6 µm. This is very small compared to sand particles, which have range of 0.0625 mm to 2 mm. Due to the small size of these dust particles, they can cause some serious health problems. When exposed to pure perchlorate salts, such as these dust particles on Mars, the toxin can be absorbed through the skin and may enter the lungs. This can cause irritations of the eyes, mucus and skin and could result in coughing and short breathing. During the first Moon mission, the astronauts’ suits were embedded in dust particles which could not be brushed off. Also the Lunar module, including the atmosphere the astronauts breathed, was full of dust. But there are also indirect effects of perchlorate salts present in Martian soil. If future colonizers ever want to cultivate edible crops from the grounds, detoxification is necessary. If not, crops could accumulate the toxic compound in their biomass and become a toxic source for humans. An irrigation study performed with lettuce grown in greenhouses on perchlorate soils with known concentrations, suggested an incorporation into plant tissue of a majority of the compound (around 79%). 3
Earth
Perchlorate was added to the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) for drinking water in 1998 by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after its presence was discovered in drinking water supplies in the southwest of the United States. 9 On earth perchlorate salts are formed naturally in small amounts in our environment. However, most of the perchlorate contamination is associated with military activities or defense contractors. 10 More than 90% of the perchlorate salts are manufactured as ammonium perchlorate to be used as rocket fuel, explosives and fireworks. Recent studies found contamination of ground- and surface waters in at least"

The Promise of Protein-based Technologies
The diverse capabilities of proteins in biological systems have presented unique opportunities in the development of many novel products, and useful technologies, particularly for the pharmaceutical industry. Most notably, of the top-selling non-vaccine drugs of 2016, six were protein-based therapeutics. Five of these six therapeutics were antibodies treating conditions ranging from cancer to diabetes.1
Team UAlberta was greatly enticed by the potential of protein-based technologies, especially for therapeutic applications. However, as none of our members are experts in this field, we set out to gain insights from stakeholders and researchers connected to these technologies.
Interviews
Dr. Mary Hitt
Associate Professor
Department of Oncology
University of Alberta
One of our most motivational conversations was with Dr. Mary Hitt , an Associate Professor at the University of Alberta’s Department of Oncology. In our interview with her, we talked about the role that proteins have in medicine. She identified antibodies and peptides as both falling under the category of protein-based therapeutics, though, noted that each has their own place when it comes to treatments.
Antibody-based therapeutics are a prevalent treatment method for a wide range of diseases. Peptide therapies, which are compositionally similar, are drastically smaller and have simpler structures. Dr. Hitt discussed how antibodies can do much more than peptides, and exhibit greater affinity and stability than peptides. However, Dr. Hitt did note that the faster degradation of peptides can be a potential advantage as peptide-based drugs would not linger in a patient’s system as long as antibodies do. They are also relatively easier to manufacture compared to antibodies.
As an example, Dr. Hitt spoke about using peptides for imaging. Peptides specific to different proteins, such as overexpressed receptors on cancer cells, could be used as imaging agents as their relatively fast degradation, coupled with sufficient affinity, allow them to be introduced into the body for use in imaging studies without the long-term effects that a more stable antibody could have.
Our interesting conversation with Dr. Hitt revealed many insights into the field of protein-based therapeutics. Though challenges were identified, the promise of peptide therapies and the potential of their wider applications drew our team to further investigate protein-based"

The session started by introducing team members, iGEM and the aim of our work. Then we went on to explain synthetic biology and our plan to use it along with bioinformatics to fulfill our aim.
We were considering using either nano particles or bacteria for the delivery of our circuit. Since our ultimate goal is reach a treatment that can be used by physicians for HCC, we asked the physicians attending our session about their preference for the vehicle to deliver our circuit. We explained the advantages and disadvantages of both ways.We found out that the majority of them preferred nano particles to bacteria for delivery. We also found out that the researchers as well displayed more interest in nano particles to be used in synthetic biology research.We integrated their opinions in our project and decided to use nano particles instead of bacteria this year. The session was concluded by answering the staff’s questions and their wishes of good luck.

Chitinase A1
The chitinase is an enzyme whose ability to break down glycosidic bonds in chitin brings more variability into the molecules. Since not just the grade and pattern of deacetylation, but also the amount of connected chitin monomers influences the entire molecule´s behavior [1] , there is a great limitation of the properties and the bioactivity of the products. Its possible implementation in the project shows the future prospects of how chitins and chitosans with all kind of properties can be produced in E. coli.
Introduction
Chitin is a molecule found in fungal cell walls [1] . Many plants possess enzymes, so-called chitinases, which are able to break down chitin and thus help along with its digestion. These enzymes play a role in defense mechanisms of plants in case of fungal infections [2] . Even in human tissues chitinases appear, where they defend us against parasites [3] . Chitinases break down the glycosidic bonds between chitin monomer units and are classified as hydrolases.
In our project, we decided to focus mainly on chitosan pentamers, synthesized and deacetylated by NodC and NodB respectively. However, chitosan's bioactivity and properties are also defined by its polymer length. For this reason, we want to give a first look at how our project could be extended.
The enzyme we use is the ChiA1 from Bacillus circulans [4] . In the strain WL-12, the gene chiA encodes, together with chiB, chiC and chiD, an entire chitinase-system which primarily degrades chitin. This system is made up of at least six different chitinases [5] , in which ChiA1 is believed to be the key enzyme [6] .
The chiA gene is 1983 base pairs long and translates into an enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 69.5 kDa [7] .
Since ChiA1 has been successfully expressed together with our chitin synthase NodC [8] , we originally decided on this specific enzyme. Its enzymatic activity has also previously been tested on chitin pentamers. ChiA1 breaks"

Fig.8 The Communication between FAFU and BIT-CHINA
Time: 2015.8.16.
Location: 712 Meeting Room, 5th Teaching Building, Beijing Institute of Technology
FAFU is a young team, and they have active ideas. While we were communicating about project content, they proposed some useful advice on application for us. As a team with triennial competition experience, we also made some suggestions for their graphic content as well as their project.
6.Communication with BIT[Collapse]
From July to August in the summer of 2015, BIT and BIT-China, two iGEM teams from Beijing Institute of Technology, carried on several communications about the project, daily works, the experimental processing and iGEM matters. We have discussed about problems in each other's project and helped each other to solve the practical difficulties encountered by both sides.
The main content of communications between the two teams:
1. Sharing some experimental apparatus and the experimental reagents with each other.
2. The improvement and optimization of experimental skills and experimental methods.
3. Solving existing problems of both projects. Discussing optimization and suggestions.
4. Team building and interpretation of iGEM rules.
5. Establish the international Human Practice alliance with other schools around the world, and expand the international communication among the iGEM teams.
This year, the communication and cooperation between the two teams are the most comprehensive and in-depth since two teams participated in iGEM, aiming at realizing the goal of working together for better results.
Human Practice Union[Collapse]
Fig.11 The global iGEM Human Practice Union
This year, we led a global iGEM Human Practice Union with other three teams: BIT, CUHK and CGU. We finally cooperated with other 10 teams from Europe, Asia and South America.
This Union mainly has two purposes: the first is to combine with iGEMers all over the world and spread knowledge of synthetic biology. The second is to build up a database which can supplement the existed iGEM database and make it more convenient for iGEMers’ online communication around the world.
However, it is the first year of this union and the time is limited, we firstly made a questionnaire about synthetic biology and"

Austin_UTexas,2015,Team:Austin UTexas#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," local community better understand what synthetic biology is all about, while also promoting STEM education. Over the course of the weekend, we created an interactive synthetic biology booth called ""Painting with E. coli"", where participants can use various fluorescent E. coli to ""paint"" on agar plates. Fluorescent bacteria in the colors red, cyan, blue, yellow, and green were prepared in our lab using BioBrick parts.
Plates decorated by participants at SXSW Create
Initially, participants were hesitant in using E. coli, as they connected it with the harmful virulent E. coli usually reported in the news as causing food poisoning and even deaths. Our lab members spent time talking with each participants to gain an understanding of current opinions on synthetic biology and GMO's, while also trying to correct common misunderstandings and highlight the benefits of the uses of this field. From these preliminary verbal surveys and interactions with the local community, we found the most common worries people have about synthetic biology is bioterrorism, creating radically new pathogens, DIY biology that can be used by anyone for harm, and toxins in GMOs that are unsafe. Our goal was to communicate the effectiveness of synthetic biology in allowing researchers to reduce costs of medicines, such as Insulin, increase effiency in manufacturing, creating biocontrolled bacteria to promote plant growth during drought stress to increase agricultural productivity, among other things. At the heart of the Texas Capitol, with the riffs and runnings of the State Government, policy advocates, and unique conference such as SXSW, we hope to partner with others in improving to the public's knowledge of synthetic biology through outreach, education, and awareness. From a personal perspective, we have encountered peers at the University that are not entirely well-versed on the benefits of this technology, but slowly iGEM at the University of Texas at Austin is making a bigger contribution in educating our peers and reaching out to the entire community.

Collaborations
Our team believes that collaboration makes a better project, so we have taken every opportunity to communicate with other teams. On the one hand, by responding to other teams’ questionnaires, we could extend our advantages and help other teams in completing their projects. On the other hand, we are able to learn and get helps from other teams so that we can improve our abilities to complete our own projects.
1.With BIT-China
1.With BIT-China
We’ve constructed a good collaboration with BIT-China since last year, and this year we further improved it. We have collaborated in two aspects. First, the two teams worked together on modeling building for BIT-China, and the whole process lasted for nearly two months. In this case, our team mainly finished the job to optimize the model and tried our best to solve the equations. The detailed information of the model could be seen in the wiki of BIT-China.
1.With BIT-China
In addition to building model, we also cooperated in experiments. We need to insure that our constructs could express apoptin in Bifidobacterium longum. But the apoptin will be digested by restriction enzymes in Biofidobacterium longum, we need to transfer the device into E.coli to make the apoptin methylated. So our constructs were sent to BIT-China for the confirmatory experiments in E.coli. BIT-China helped us transform the plasmids into cells, and the cells were digested and centrifuged to collect the expression products of the bacteria, and the proteins of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The result was shown in the figure. The construct, J23117, which was used in the InterLab experiments, was also sent from BIT-China as a gift to us, and we used it to finish our experiments. And in this summer, one of our members visited BIT-China in Beijing, and discussed a lot about our project with them.
2.With UESTC_China
This year, we initiated the collaboration with UESTC_China . Our team assisted UESTC_China to confirm the function of their constructs in a new laboratory environment. We use the plate reader to detect the product of the reaction, pNP under 405 nm catalyzed by the"

4) Our model did not consider the size changing and dividing of bacteria. And the tendency of bacteria congregate into small area due to qurum sensing is also ignored.
Model Designing
In chemotaxis, receptors sensing an increase in the concentration of chemoattractant send a signal that suppresses tumbling, and, simultaneously, the receptor becomes more highly methylated. Conversely, a decrease in the chemoattractant concentration increases the tumble frequency and causes receptor demethylation. The tumbling frequency is approximately 1 Hertz, and decreased to almost zero as he bacteria move up a chemtoatic gradient [5].
In the model, the bacteria should be able compare the chemoattractant concentration at current point to the concentration at previous second. If the concentration decreases (i.e. C_t1-C_t2  ≤0), the bacteria will tumble with frequency 1 Hertz. If the concentration increases (C_t1-C_t2  >0), the tumble frequency decreases, and hence the probability of tumbling decreases. From equation 10 in ref [6], we known that even if C_t1-C_t2  >0, the probability of tumbling could decreases to 39%. Therefore, we can conclude the above description into the following statement [8]:
Chemotaxis of bacteria population under laboratory conditions
Under laboratory condition, the chemoattractant diffuses from the source, hence the distribution pattern of chemoattratctant changes with time. In this case, error function (Equation 2) was used to describe the non-steady chemoattractant distribution. The simulation of chemotaxis of 100 bacteria placed 6cm away from the 5mM malate is shown in the movie below.
Chemotaxis of bacteria population in Soil
Malate is used as the chemoattractant in our project, the malate is constantly secreted in the root tip, and the concentration is 0.3mM[9]. In this case, the malate source is always replenished due to continuous secretion from the root tip, the distribution pattern can be considered as steady (i.e. independent of time), and steady state Keler-Segel model was used to demonstrate this distribution (Equation 3 and Equation 5). The distribution was displayed in Figure 7.  And Figure 8 shows the position of lower threshold where the bacteria start to response to malate and the saturation level where"

8) Subtract 0.3ml of supernatant from the Eppendorf tubes – you may need to re-centrifuge the tubes if pellet has resuspended.
9) Resuspend the pellet in the remaining supernatant using a pipette and then plate on agar plates with the appropriate antibiotic.
Diagram showing steps 7-9 of the transformation protocol
Important Notes
When carrying out the incubation at step 6 it is important that the tubes are placed on their sides so that the medium is allowed to aerate. As Eppendorf tubes will be used, the easiest way to ensure aeration is to seal the tubes and tape them down (on their sides) to the base of the shaking incubator. Make sure they are securely fastened to the bottom of the incubator.

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#coli_-_-_TEXT.html," the amount of laccase that oxidizes 1 μmol of ABTS substrate per minute.
To investigate the activity of ECOL at temperatures that will apply at a waste water treatment plant throughout the year, activity tests were performed at 10 °C and 25 °C as described above. The measurements were conducted for 30 minutes. The obtained results reveal a lower activity of ECOL at 10 °C in comparison to 25 °C (see Fig. 28). The received values were used to calculate the specific enzyme activity which was between 1 and 12 U mg-1 , respectively (see Fig. 29). The negative control without ECOL but 0.4 mM CuCl2 at 10 °C and 25 °C show a negligible oxidation of ABTS. The activity of ECOL is decreased to about 90% at 10 °C. An application of ECOL at warm temperatures is therefore possible but during the cold seasons a more cryo stable enzyme would be preferable.
Substrate Analysis
Figure 30: Degradation of estradiol (dark green) and ethinyl estradiol (light green) with the different laccases after 5 hours without ABTS. In the graph it is shown that the bought laccase TVEL0 which was used as positive control is able to degrade more than 90 percent of the used substrates. None of the bacterial laccases are able to degrade ethinyl estradiol without ABTS but estradiol is degraded in a range from 16 %(ECOL) to 55 % (TTHL). The original concentrations of substrates were 2 µg per approach. (n = 4)
The measurements were made to test if the produced laccases were able to degrade different hormones. Therefore the produced laccases were inserted in the same concentrations (3 µg mL-1) to the different measurement approaches. To work with the correct pH value (which were measured by the Team Activity Test) Britton Robinson buffer at pH 5 was used for all measurements. The initial substrate concentration was 5 µg mL-1. The results of the reactions without ABTS are shown in Figure 30. On the Y-axis the percentages of degraded estradiol (blue) and ethinyl estradiol (red) are indicated. The X-axis displays the different tested laccases. The degradation was measured at t0 and after five hours of incubation at 30 °C. The negative control was the substrate in Britton Robinson buffer and showed"

Ideas
Post all of your ideas here! Just a temporary place to share ideas before we get a forum or something else... and maybe also your name, so we know who thought of what if we want to discuss something.
1) Bacteria that could be ""integrated"" (symbiose?) into plants/vegetables/... to enrich them in nutrients? (Gabriela)
2) Bacteria as a diagnostics tool for still uncurable diseases: sensor for a molecule/hormone/... specific of a disease, and would then release a substance which could create a visible phenotype: could allow early detection of diseases (ideally)  (Gabriela)
3) Bacteria for the food-processing industry: they could produce some kind of flavouring substance/vitamin/nutrient which is normally added artificially to a mixture (e.g. a juice...), and could be tuned to produce the substance until the optimal dosage is reached? --> more an industry application  (Gabriela)
4) Sound-sensing bacteria: don't know if it's possible or if a native receptor could be ""tweaked"" for this, but could be useful if we could use sound waves as a triggering signal for e.g. substance release --> going to try to do some research  (Gabriela)
5) Bacteria that could bind to a surface making a biofilm and fonctionalize the surface. To make the surface hydrophilic/hydrophobic or change the viscosity of this surface (e.g. with the movement of their flagella..) (Christian)
6) Use bacteria, like magnetotactic bacteria which produce nanoparticle (Fe3O4 or Fe3S4), to produce another nanoparticle. Or use this bacteria to purify liquid of different toxic metal. Here you have a link to : Biogenic nanoparticles: production"
