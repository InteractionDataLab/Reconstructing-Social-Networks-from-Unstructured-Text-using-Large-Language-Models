TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html,"searchers spread over the country that unite to fight inflammatory bowel diseases
Goal: Get feedback on the application of our device to use it for detection of intestinal diseases.
Approach: We had the great opportunity to join one of the meetings of the ICC, and present our idea to a board of intestinal doctors that were opinionated about the application of our device. The board shared their thoughts on our device and gave us suggestions for further development.
Result: The board could tell us that there are a lot of advancements in the field of research to inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn and Colitis, but that the exact cause of these diseases remains unclear.  Many different molecules (playing a role in inflammation) can be used to detect inflammatory bowel disease in the intestines. One of the most commonly used substances nowadays is Calprotectin.  Furthermore the presence of certain compounds in the intestines can be used to judge the functionality of certain organs (e.g. elastase for pancreatic function).  The ICC was very positive about the idea to create a device for home-usage. Thereby they emphasized that the device should be easy in use and cheap.
However, the doctors were hesitating to believe that DNA could be used as a source of protein-detection. They were very interested in the technique of using aptamers and found it surprising that a molecule with such limited variability in composition could be used for specific detection of molecules. Also they found the use of a bacteria in the intestine quite problematic. They confirmed that regulation is especially tight for the use of microorganisms in medicine. Any method making use of transcription factors will, according to them, by definition be rejected. Therefore they stimulated us to use a different scaffold for our detection-system, unless our device could produce a significant output. For that matter, they were quite interested in the idea of using the bacteria for specific drug-excretion. Thereby they emphasized that this could especially be useful in specific drug-targeting of tumors, by making use of tumor-specific proteins for detection.
Happy team members after a successful meeting!

Existing technologies use for example thymol, a pure toxin. Thymol is not only toxic to mites, but to bees as well. It has to be applied three times a year and interferes with honey, which can make it taste like mouthwash. The ""do not change the consumer principle"" turned out to be an important input point. Rather than requiring that beekeepers have to change the sugar baskets they use (since some of them are not completely dark), we decided adapt the system in such a way that it will not be killed by the light of the sugar basket. A box-like product is the most ideal form since it can be applied to all sugar-water-basket systems.
Collaboration
DAE
We initiated contact with students from the Design Academy Eindhoven to enhance the interdisciplinarity of our project. We met up several times and discussed science, society and where those overlap. Their views on our project and synbio in general helped us in designing our project and adapting it to real life demands. For a concrete collaboration, we asked one of the students – Thieu – to design our end product, BeeT, in a way it could be presented to future users. Our collaboration with the DAE did not only lead to us having a positively received final product design, but also led to our project influencing the design students’ projects.  One of the students gave us the opportunity to have a “real life bee experience”. The aim of this project was to study group dynamics, stress, and teamwork. The task was to prepare a dish (Baklava) like bees would do it. Leif Czakai made a movie out of this.
Synenergene
Synenergene is a four year program to promote the dialogue about the future of synthetic biology between relevant stakeholders, contributing to responsible research and innovation. Synenergene partners, including the Rathenau institute, are in close collaboration with several iGEM teams from all over the world.
Our collaboration with Synenergene consisted of two assessments: an application scenario and a techno-moral vignette. The assessments were intended to help us evaluate the viability as well as the societal impact of our envisioned product. We chose to write a “Resource from the future” for our techno-moral vignette. “Resource” is the magazine and news website of students and employees of Wageningen UR. By writing a Resource from the year 2030 , when BeeT will be available on the market, we aimed"

As we were not able to obtain good plasmid concentration after culture of glycerol stocks and plasmid extraction, transformations were done. Dh5a cells were transformed with pSB1C3 containing FKBP - GFP 10 (pPS16_018) and FRB - GFP (pPS16_019) using the usual protocol .

By Maxence & Victor
As we have met several issues in order to obtain plasmis pPS16_023 (gBlock ATG linker FRB + GFP 11 + gBlock ATG linker FKBP + GFP 10 + gBlock GFP 1-9), we decided to characterize our BioBricks with a Western-Blot with antibodies against GFP. For that purpose, the following clones were put on solid cultures (LB + 30 µg/mL Cm ou Amp) grown at 37°C overnight:
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 6
pPS16_019 (FRB - GFP 11) clone 4
pPS16_009 (GFP 1.9) clone 1
Furthermore, another strain containing the full GFP was cultures in the same conditions: PhB1040 strain 594 (lac-3350 galk2 galT22 2psL179 pGFP) (Amp resistance).

Due to the enthusiasm of the team members, we came up with a variety of interesting ideas during our brainstorming sessions. A few of our discontinued favourites included: a how to survive on mars concept and a means to control the weather (in true British style). At first we found it challenging to narrow our ideas down to one project idea. However, once we explored the potential of each topic in context of the BioBrick components and how we could integrate Human Practices within the idea it became easier. This enabled us to focus upon feasible ideas, with room for creativity, whilst eliminating those which were not suitable.
Next, we looked at existing BioBricks created previously by iGEM teams, and consequently how we could contribute to enlarging the registry and broadening the application of synthetic biology. We found that the whole team really felt that ageing was a great topic to explore within iGEM and has a huge potential to make both social, cultural and economic impact.
BioSynthAge: Do not go gentle into that good night
We envision a time in which the human population lives a healthier life, for longer. We will use synthetic biology to ensure the ageing world population can both maintain their quality of life and extend their lifespan - increasing their ‘healthspan’. The health challenges currently posed by ageing are many and complex so we propose a suite of synthetic biology solutions to tackle these challenges. Our synthetic biology solutions will include, but not be limited to, the following:

Oxidative stress underlies many of the health problems of ageing so we will develop a number of free radical mopping devices. These devices will include"

In our project, we have to model transcription of taRNA. Because taRNA functions only when it is completely transcribed, we model as following reactions:
<img src = ""
"" height=""107px"" class = ""math"" />
We refer to the translational model [8]. Similarly to the transcriptional model we model as following;
<img src = ""
"" height=""106px"" class = ""math"" />
combining reaction2' and reaction2, we get:
<img src = ""
"" height=""20px"" class = ""math"" />
We model the association and disassociation of crRNA and taRNA as a reversible reaction:
<img src = ""
"" height=""45px"" class = ""math"" />
We know that anti-sigma directly affect sigma[20], but a large part of their relation is still unknown. From their direct relation, We model as following reactions:
<img src = ""
"" height=""45px"" class = ""math"" />
We model the degradation as the following reaction:
<img src = ""
"" height=""18px"" class = ""math"" />
We can conclude that reaction formulas of our model are as follows:
<img src = ""
"" class = ""figure"" />
Parameter
We got the parameters mainly from [11]. The summary of the parameters of this model is given in the Table 2 (α = 1/NA V, NA is  Avogadro constant, and V is the volume of E. coli.):

Subsequently, the d-AuNPs were added and their aggregation was analysed. The ssDNAp targeting EPO was compared with a ssDNAp that is not targeting EPO. The on-target ssDNAp stabilized the d-AuNPs as the ratio 620/520 wavelength was lower compared to off-target ssDNAp  (figure 8).
Figure 8. A) Wavelength ratios of 620/520 of d-AuNPs solutions with NaCl concentration of 333 mM with on and off target ssDNAp. B) Visual outcome of the d-AuNPs solution with ranging NaCl concentrations of 0 to 333mM with on- and off-target ssDNAp targeting EPO.
After showing the functionality of the d-AuNPs to detect target DNA, we aimed to determine the sensitivity by using variations of target EPO DNA concentrations while keeping the total amount of DNA constant. We tested concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 1 nM comparing on- and off-target primers and determined our lower limit of detection is 1nM. To achieve comparable results to Baetsen-Young et al. 2018 (29 fM) further optimization are required.
Additionally, we evaluated the influence of background DNA present in the sample. We used 38 ng/µL background DNA, equal to the expected cfDNA extraced during sample preparation. We were able to show that the presence of background DNA does not affect the sensitivity of the prescreening method. Further sensitivity evaluation are required before implementing the prescreening method.
Conclusion
The functionality of the prescreen was proven. We were able to visually detect the presence of target EPO DNA. However, to implement this prescreening, protocol optimization is required to reach a lower detection limit of at least 9 fM, based on data from our model. Thus, if the results of Baetsen-Young et al. 2018 can be reproduced, the detection limit can be lowered to 2.94 fM.
3. Fusion Protein - dxCas9-Tn5
In order to achieve targeted sequencing, we constructed a fusion protein by linking dxCas9 with Tn5 to be used in library preparation for sequencing platform. We constructed the strain that expressed our fusion protein, successfully purified them and tested their functionality in vivo and in vitro. We were able to show targeted integration by our fusion protein in vitro and sequence verified the integration products.

Overview
Health risks and ethical dilemmas are inherent to using gene therapy for human enhancement. Sports is currently the only field where active measures against genetic enhancement, also known as gene doping, are desired. Present gene doping detection methods like nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and the privacy invasive whole genome sequencing (WGS) lack versatility to detect the plethora of genetic differences or require large storage capacities and high processing power. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive package ( ADOPE ) consisting of a cheap and scalable gold nanoparticle based visual prescreening, a newly designed, produced and characterized fusion protein for targeted sequencing and a self-learning algorithm for data analysis to anticipate future gene doping development. ADOPE is versatile, efficient and reliable and can detect low copy number DNA in samples, whereby it not only facilitates gene doping detection, but also blood banks and food safety institutes around the world.

1. Gene Doping: The Threat
Gene doping is a true problem. It is the first doping that could not only find interest in the athlete population, but also in the rest of society. Thereby it is not only a global, but especially an intergenerational problem, given the possibility of (accidental) germ line infections, as well as the extension it finds in the designer baby concept. However, there are many health risks related to gene doping use, amongst which are acute immune responses upon the viral infection, as well as cancer and many unforeseen consequences.
Gene doping as a result of the desire to be perfect is a substantial dilemma, making a strong focus on gene doping and the debate about it absolutely indispensable. The video below gives a summary of our expert discussion at the University of Stirling where we addressed the eminent threat of gene doping.

Also, our members who manage HP seized the opportunity to interact with participants from other teams. Thanks to this event, we arranged a meeting with team CCU-Taiwan shortly after the conference and talked about the collaboration. Throughout the conference, we learned a lot. After listening to our presentation, the professor from NCHU gave us some advice for better performance. Moreover, questions from other iGEMers helped us identify the blind spot in our project. We are looking forward to the Giant Jamboree and hope that we can perform well at the competition!

The main topics of our discussion were the optimization of plasmid resuspension and ligation reaction steps as well as how to measure fluorescence. Finally, before DNA Repository quality control publication on the Registry web site, we cross-checked some parts that showed problems after DNA transformation. Problems had been confirmed by quality control results (parts' sequences classified as ""inconsistent"").
We want even to mention the courtesy of the Valencia iGEM Team, that have advised us about the critical use of GFP and RFP at the same time.

Concluding the iGEM 2007 Project
In the iGEM 2007 we used the LacY gene (BBa_J2210) to design a genetic Schmitt trigger. Since this part was not working well, we sent it to be sequenced and found that it contained a 35 bp insertion upstream the endogenous LacY gene sequence. This insertion probably caused a frameshift in protein translation, making the gene ineffective. So, we amplified the right gene sequence and put it in the BioBrick format. Successive sequencing confirmed the right assembling of this part. We also measured IPTG-induced fluorescence in the genetic Schmitt trigger (see Figure 8) and we assessed the correct function of the new LacY part. To contribute to Registry’s improvement we decided to send this new part to the Registry ( K0790015 ).
Figure 8. Schematic representation of the genetic Schmitt Trigger. The LacI generator module was included to have a constitutive synthesis of LacI repressor protein witch makes up for endogenous LacI. LacY permease introduces a positive feedback. GFP is the reporter for pLac activation. This circuit express high level of fluorescence with very low concentration of inducer (IPTG=1uM). After switching, the fluorescence level f is insensitive to an increase in inducer dosage.

Today I designed sites 5-8 using benchling.
Procedure:
1. The wt cage sequence was copied into a benchling file.
2. The thrombin cleavage site was inserted at the area of interest of each site.
3. The resultant sequence was then codon optimized. Integrated DNA Technologies Codon Optimizer, set to Escherichia coli K12, was used. https://www.idtdna.com/CodonOpt
4. The optimized sequence was then cross checked with benchling’s digest function for EcoRI, PstI, SpeI, and XbaI restriction sites.
5. Any residues containing the restriction site were exchanged with different codons to preserve the reading frame and remove undesired digestion.
Tyler Lee -- Wtleeiv 18:27, 23 June 2015 (CDT)
1.Created Mutant Sequences (9-13) using WT cage sequence from Yeates paper(not fully optimized)
- WT cage sequence was copied onto Benchling and the mutation was inserted onto this sequence    - Then this sequence was codon optimized using the IDT Codon Optimizer tool     - Then the sequence was checked for containing any iGEM restriction enzymes(Pst,EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI,NotI) and were removed                            replacing nucleotides to avoid unwanted digestion.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  For today, the goal is to become familiarized with Benchling usage, and the general idea behind creating the constructs.  First, the Yeate’s construct will be designed based off of Dr. Yeate’s papers in the methods.  From there, the mutants will be created on Benchling.

Research on Public Awareness
We designed a questionnaire on the internet (link: https://sojump.com/jq/9947898.aspx ) and investigated about whether people know about iGEM, and their experiences related to hearing-impaired people. We collected about 500 answers and did data analysis.
Policy and Practice
To obtain more information about the life of people with hearing impairment, we consulted specialists who work in various areas, as well as some relevant local charity or official associations. From the dimension of Policy, Law, Medication, Philanthropy and Research, we consulted lawyers and judges, doctors, professors and managers of several charity organizations. At the same time, we introduced our project and received suggestions to promote our project.
Law
It is said that in China, the Criminal Law and the Law of Criminal Procedure Law aim to embody the humanitarian. Deaf and mute are given appropriate preferential treatment and Summary Proceeding cannot be applied in these cases:
Cases of crime by deaf-mutes can be dealt with leniently.
A deaf and dumb or blind criminal is expected to receive a lighter or mitigated punishment or even be exempted from punishment as the case may be.
A deaf and dumb should be provided for with people familiar deaf and dumb gestures;
A deaf and dumb with no defender should be provided with legal aid;
Forcing disabled people to beg constitutes a crime;
Utilizing and abetting the crime of persons with disabilities should be cracked down according to law, etc.
Technology
The most efficient way to improve hearing so far is using hearing auxiliary equipment. There are two main types of hearing auxiliary equipment: hearing aids and cochlear implants.
Hearing aids: for conductive hearing loss;
Cochlear implants (CI): for sensorineural hearing loss.
We consulted Prof. Chen Fei who studies hearing aids and speech recognition technology for cochlear implants. He stressed the importance of attention to hearing-impaired people, because this big problem has not been concerned enough as it deserved.  Beyond hearing loss, pathologically caused hearing loss may also cause complications. The lowered hearing nerve activity for long is potential to cause inactivation of these neurons and lead to impermanent hearing loss. More significantly, due to communication difficulties or discrimination, hearing loss may cause psychological problems.
CI, together with hearing aids, bring sound to those who have never heard anything. However, the cost of a CIs is higher than 10,000 dollars and requires high medical operation expenses. There are only 20,000 people can enjoy the ease brought by CI due to the high price."

Inoculation of 5/10 Transformation
Transformation was good
I picked three colonies from the 1:1 kanamycin plate and suspended each in 100uL ddH2O (labeled pET 1, 2, and 3 respectively)
Each sample was inoculated in 3 different culture tubes with 5mL LB broth and 5uL 1000X kanamycin and was incubated at 37C.
Sequencing of Silk Biobricks
We sent in both of our constructs to Genewiz for sequencing.
For sequencing primers, we used the iGEM VF2 and VR primers that bind to the psb1c3 backbone, as well as the sequencing primer that we designed to bind to the silk sequence (p13) see https://benchling.com/s/p7bClpzQ/edit
The sequencing results can back and checked out for sample 1 of construct 1 (silk coding region) and samples 1 and 2 for construct 2 (regulartory elements+silk)
We have our first honeybee biobricks!

Maintain a succession of cultures so that live bacteria will be available for each new batch, transferring cells to a new culture at predetermined intervals.
Inoculate vessels containing a nutrient medium. At regular intervals, evaluate the condition of cultures for preservation of desired characteristics, growth, and sterility.  Growth is monitored through comparisons to the ideal optical density and, if applicable, the pH of the growth medium.  Meanwhile, sterility requires the collection and subculture of a sample. Then, examined with an approved identity test using microbiological techniques and/or molecular biology techniques, S. epidermidis should be the only microbe present in the cultures.
Follow the freeze-drying procedure appropriate for S. epidermidis.  Evaluate the condition of cultures for growth and sterility in the same manner outlined in step 5, with the addition of weighing the freeze-dried pellet.
Package the dormant therapeutic donor cells according to the standards to ensure viability when it reaches the point of care.

Safety
Safety: The second question we want to address is what are the safety concerns pertaining to the use of this drug? What are measures we can take to make Staphylocide an effective, easy to use and safe product?
Administrative controls recommended at health facilities
The engineered S. epidermidis cells require a unique treatment protocol that healthcare practitioners must be familiar with. It is important to note that the use of Staphylocide alone will not be able to kill MRSA cells. It must be used on alternating cycles with conventional β-lactam antibiotics to effectively treat the infection. It is therefore crucial for patients to follow their course of antibiotic treatment. Staphylocide will only be available by prescription for patients who have been infected with MRSA. Treatment will administrated at a health care facility where healthcare practitioners can oversee the entire course of treatment.
At this time, we do not know how effective Staphylocide will be as this information would be obtained through lab testing and clinical trials. Relevant factors from the application of our product that would influence the efficacy include the conjugation efficiency of the CRISPRi system, the quantity of donor cells provided during application, and the subsequent use of antibiotics.
As a result, health care practitioners must apply Staphylocide liberally over the infected area and allow treatment time. If Staphylocide must be removed, the necessary actions such as cleaning the infection, assessing the infection, and/or replacing"

Identify - Identify any issues there is with testing the device. Is there any stage in your project that it will be necessary to test your device using animals or humans?
Control- Is there any other ways that it is possible to do such experiments and gaining the data not using either animals or humans? What other experiments could you run that are more ethical?
Inform - How will you reassure the public that your testing method is safe and ethical?
Review - Review the implications of all the methods used during the project. Were any experiments unethical? What could you have done better in terms of the ethics during the experimental stages of the project?
6) Damage to the environment/ecosystem
Many Synthetic Biology research projects plan to introduce genetically modified organisms into the environment. Some devices aim to improve the quality of the environment but in doing so is there some risk that they could change the balance in an essential ecosystem? Another aspect that falls into this category is that during the research stages of the project, a lot of lab equipment is used and there is a possibility of  wastage of reagents and equipment if they are not used in a proper manner. This could cause environmental damage in the form of; unnecessary use of plastics or unsafe disposure of reagents. This section is intended to make you consider any wider environmental implications your device could cause when it is used in its intended field.
Identify - Will your device or research cause any damage to the environment? If so, specify e.g. which species, which ecosystem, what environment?
Control - How can you minimise the damage caused to the environment during your research? How can you minimise the amount of damage your device causes to the environment?
Inform - How can you inform people that you have considered the impact you are causing to the environment whilst carrying out your environment? How can you reassure the public that your device will cause minimum damage to the environment and ecosystems?
Review - After you have undertaken the research project, review the methods you undertook to make sure the impact on the environment was minimal. Review the methods you undertook to make sure the impact your device has on ecosystems when it is used in the field.

For a Safer Genetic Engineering ?
From the debate “Nuclear technology and Genetically Modified Organisms : Can scientists keep control?” we organized, several safety issues were risen and suggestions have been proposed to tackle them.
First, the standardisation of parts makes it simpler to use and share for researchers, but also for malign or careless uses. All the informations related to the iGEM projects are freely available on the Internet without any access control. It has been evoked that, with these informations, anyone with basic microbiology knowledge could try to build his own bio-weapon (like people nowadays can find the recipe to create their own bomb on the Internet) or, on a safety point of view, could misuse a part and accidentally harm people or environment. Yet, would it be a better solution to restrict access to iGEM members ?
It would mean to give up on the valuable “open source” model, where everyone's experience contributes to enhancing our knowledge, including the knowledge about the safety of the parts (what should and should not be done with a part, what precautions you must take, what unexpected behavior has been observed...). Concealing the information would not prevent people from accessing it illegally, as shown by the numerous web security breaches that are regularly reported. This means that synthetic biology should be careful about safety issues, and discussions or reflections concerning the “open source” should not be overlooked.
General safety issues about GMOs have also been mentioned, and the reasons why the general public considers them unsafe. The quick development of plant GMOs was, in the eyes of the general public, a search for immediate profit with few concerns about safety and ethics. And moreover very few efforts of communication have been made, which has created a prejudice about GMOs. We noticed that generally, GM bacteria are widely used in medicine and food industry, but are less known by the public who is less scared about them. Synthetic biology should avoid such a mistake, by communicating to the public before releasing new devices, and ensuring that they will be accepted by a distrust public.
We are not alone to think about all these considerations. A great debate will occur at the occasion of the European Jamb"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html,"b. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the"

P-atp2
P-atp2 (atpB) is an alkali-induced promoter in Corynebacterium glutamicum located in F0F1 ATPase operon (Fig.18). Each microorganism in nature has an optimal pH and drastic changes in extracellular pH values trigger a stress response that results in overexpression of certain genes and suppression of others[17]. The P-atp2 promoter responds to the pH changes from pH 7.0 to pH 9.0, especially at alkaline pH. When the pH value increasing, the expression increased modestly[19]. It is activated by the alternative sigma factor of the RNA polymerase, whose synthesis would be activated when the bacteria are growing at alkaline pH[17][18]. In the C.glutamicum genome, there are several kinds of sigma factors, among them, expression of Sigma H and Sigma W respond to the alkaline shock(Fig.19)[18][20][21].
Fig.18 F0F1 operon
Fig.19 SigH responds to alkaline stress
P-atp2, as a kind of alkali-induced promoter, is believed to control the expression of functional genes depending on the extracellular pH. Because of this, we anticipate that the P-atp2 will control the functional gene to expression when the environment is alkaline. Combing these two parts, it would allow adaptive acid to neutralize alkaline. To achieve this goal of a regulation device that can be used to specific conditions, our main aim was to construct P-atp2, then testing and verifying it.
The promoter P-atp2 is placed in Corynebacterium glutamicum, and we got it by standard methods and the agarose gel electrophoresis was used"

Module 3: Time-delay genetic circuit
In nature, a fundamental “device” in gene regulation circuits is time-delay responses to internal or external stimuli. These devices are involved in essential patterns such as oscillating systems, circadian clocks, cell differentiation and development, to mention a few [ 1 ]. Time-delay circuits have the capability to integrate signals and trigger events after a delay from the initial detection event. There are two approaches to construct a time delay genetic circuit, these are: 1) protein-based transcriptional regulators and 2) RNA-based post-transcriptional regulators [ 2 ]. In order to gain a better understanding into how certain genetic circuits are built and how they work to derive in complex responses upon stimuli, in the field of synthetic biology, the reconstruction of genetic circuits is one of the more investigated topics. Specifically, experiments focused on transcriptional regulation components are relatively well understood and easy to emulate. Although circuits based on transcriptional networks can provide complex behaviors, as the complexity increases it is clear that many natural circuits are not only transcriptional driven but they are controller in other levels such as post-transcriptional regulation [ 3 ].
Based on different literature and the requirements of the project, two genetic configurations, one protein-based and other RNA-based, have been considered as implementations of a time-delay genetic circuit.
Why?
As mentioned in the project description , one important feature of our system is the reset of the signal once the message is received. The time between when the signal (or self destructive plasmid/conjugation plasmid) has been received and the reset (or destruction of the plasmid) is an important parameter which will allow the signal to be send to the next cell (receiver) through the consecutive conjugation system before “losing” the message. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a device which will provide enough time for the two subsequent events happen. This device has been termed the time-delay genetic circuit in this project. In a final version,.... more.

Interest from industy
The farm animal sector is committed to reduce of the use of antibiotics. To realize that ambition, our detection system can help. We have presented our detection system to Hendrix Genetics . Hendrix Genetics is a multi-species animal breeding organization that invests in innovation to improve the sustainability of animal protein value chains. This includes systems to reduce the use of antibiotics. After the Giant Jamboree we will continue discussion with Hendrix Genetics on the use of our detection systems in their programs.
Concluding, the CINDY Seq method is outstanding in rapid and simple detection. However, the key of success depends on the integration and implementation of CINDY Seq. With the current technology available, the product is not yet available for household use and should thus come with a service. The outcomes of our value proposition, market analysis and SWOT analysis show that the method will have high potential to be commercialized and that the IP position is strong due to the pending patent. This is further supported by the interest we have received from the industry.

We put together an exceptional panel of experts and with the help of Ann Van Gysel, Life-Science journalist and CEO of Turnstone ( http://www.turnstone.be ), communication agency based in Gand,                 Belgium, we developed a roadmad aiming at finding the main bottlenecks in “Antimicrobial resistance, Biotechnologies and European Legislation”
We have decided to organize this event in order to have an impact as young students on both European politics and general public. We wanted to show and to prove that you do not have to be part of a big international company, be aged                 or be a university professor, etc. to have an impact on European Legislation.
Our panel was composed of KEY REGULATORS at the European Commission level, Young and successful biotech entrepreneurs, academics and researchers:
Arjon Van Hengel, DG Research and Innovation, Health Directorate, European Commission.                     This Commission department is responsible for EU policy on research, science and innovation, with a view to help create growth and jobs and tackle our biggest societal challenges.                     His presence allowed us to bring the issue to a EUROPEAN LEVEL. Arjon Van Hengel is one of the most influential people in this field and being in contact with him will help us give more visibility to our topic"

MSc. Biomedical Engineering. 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Over a lifetime there are only so many moments where you can join a force of good and become a part of something greater than ourselves. There is a divine message in the code of life - Mankind will be united, we will see past our differences, diseases shall be cured, species shall be saved, Mother Nature shall be defended. In the name of synthetic biology shall we march bravely down not the easiest path, but one that’s true.
Which historical figure would you prefer to be haunted by?
My past self. So I can be constantly reminded of my mistakes, as well as the times I’ve bathed in glory.
Mathias Blicher Bjerregård
MSc. Mathematical Modelling. 8th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Improve my experience on applied data analysis and modeling
How do you want your remains dealt with when you die?
Forget about burial or burning. I want to have my name (or possibly nickname) engraved in the forehead of my skull, and then have it preserved in a glass case. That way I will still be among my descendants, so they always can consult me.
Line Andresen
BSc. Biotechnology. 4th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Synthetic biology is the coolest! I talked to one of last years team members, and I knew I had to be a part of this years iGEM team. I want to use biology to solve some of the problems we are facing and will face in the future.
Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck, or a hundred duck-sized horses?
I would definitely choose a hundred duck-sized horses. Ducks can be aggressive and I wouldn’t want to meet one that is bigger than I am! On the other side, if I could tame the duck, then I would have a pet that might be big enough to fly with me on its back? In that case I would choose the duck!

Eduardo really had a hand in everything - he attended meetings on behalf of our team, he conducted research and assisted in literature review, filled out our lab log books with David (with extreme neatness), and somehow, he was always willing to do more. Eduardo never missed a day coming into lab, and even came in on the weekends.
Eduardo has truly been an indispensable asset to the team and an even better friend. We could always count on him to listen, advise and provide the emotional support in this chapter of our lives. Friends are the siblings that we were not originally given. It is an honor for us to be your ""siblings"" - to be your iGEM family. Thank you, Eduardo, oh Captain, our captain.
David Barilla
You will never meet a kinder, more loyal man than Mr. David Barilla. Although he was extremely busy balancing work, iGEM, and family - he always made time to come to NAIT everyday and work on our project - even if that meant losing precious sleep and workout time.
In our team, David spearheaded the documentation of our experiments and protocols; kept us all grounded and sane; wrote SOPs and logbooks; developed our modified silver stain protocol; and helped in the lab to run experiments (plasmid precipitation, cloning, and mini-prep among many) with Eduardo. David even went as far as learning to code HTML to try and share the load with his more computer savvy team mates.
""Best friends are people who make your problems their problems, just so you don't have to go through it alone."" There is no better way to describe David. He always knows the right thing to say to bring a smile to everyone's face. He has an amazing sense of humor but also knows when to get down to business. Thank you, David. The summer has been an absolutely amazing experience with you in the lab! We will always treasure your random bursts of classic rock and even your incredible (yet sometimes outrageous) ideas.
Johannes Coomansingh
Joe is the light of our team. His incredible sense of optimism has really helped our team stay positive throughout all the speed bumps of our project. Without Johannes to brighten our lab days with his ramblings and non sequiturs, our iGEM journey would have been much more stressful. Thankfully, he was present everyday to keep us lighthearted.
Joe really is Mr. Congeniality. As our Public Relations expert he has really gone above and beyond all of our expectations. Throughout the project"

We have registered the offical team as ordered, we shared a great summer within our team and with iGEMers of other teams. We hope to have fun at the Giant Jamboree 2014.
We successfully completed and submitted the iGEM 2014 Judging form.
We created and shared a description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We’ve get fully prepared to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree. Wish us luck\^-^/
The description of our project has been clearly attributed work done by the students and we have distinguished it from work done by others. The lab work is mainly attributed to senior students, with some materials supplied by our instructors, and the measurement of the concentration of cadmium through precisely physical methods was helped by HIT-Harbin. Our website designer is Li Yao. And the expenses including international travel, team registration, Giant Jamboree attendance and accommodation during our stay in US. was supported by Northeast Forestry University. Moreover, our project was partly supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). Please incorporate the Team Page to evaluate our work.

Lethbridge_HS,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s expertise in the hematology field proved to be very beneficial in aiding with the design of our blood coagulant.
St. John's Ambulance
We were able to conduct a phone interview with Chris, the training manager for St. John’s Ambulance in our province, in order to gain further feedback on our our project design. The interview was centered mainly around the possible application of our blood coagulant and any other considerations we need to keep in mind when designing our construct. He informed us that hemostatic agents as the one that we are designing would be most effective in cavity wounds, which are difficult to treat using the traditional methods of slapping the wound and applying direct pressure to stop bleeding, as is often performed on flat wounds. Chris mentioned several pros and cons of applying our blood coagulant in a bandage or a gel form. Gels are more affected by temperature changes and become less effective in colder temperatures, which is not the case for bandages; however, bandages can quickly dry up in their packaging. Since special training is required to apply a hemostatic agent, it could not be included in a first-aid kit; however, it could still be marketed in stores such as Outdoor World. Chris also addressed his concern that the snake venom component included our construct could induce a systemic reaction when it comes into contact with the tissue. Overall, he stressed the importance of considering the shelf life our hemostatic agent, the application medium of our blood coagulant and if it causes any systemic reactions in the body. Although there are several hemostatic agents already being produced, he liked our approach of using a component of snake venom as it is very different from current methods, that use agents  ranging from shellfish derivatives to volcanic rock . The interview with Chris from St. John’s Ambulance provided us with valuable feedback for us to consider in the further design of our project and its application. In fact, the positive and negative aspects he provided on application methods led us to decide on using a bandage component for applying our product."
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#EngineeringJournal_-_-_TEXT.html," in poor images that we can't visualize the 3D structure. Sometimes the colors were lost resulted in a region of red surface. This problem occurred on all computers with Maya installed, under many different settings, even in Autodesk Max, but not on our in-house expert Merry's computer. For now we just use print screen to get the image and will worry about rendering later.
At the same time Ceser asked us to study the following techniques in Maya: Dynamics, nParticle, and APBS extension of ePMV for calculating the electrostatic force of a protein. Like everything else in Maya, the APBS extension doesn't work as we have intended; for some reason it complains error occurred when executing a line in the script but without the details necessary for debugging. As a result nothing came out of APBS extension. Even worse we were going for the IMD extension of ePMV for calculating the molecular interactions, but that was not released which we just found out this week.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
Turns out by re-configuring the light source immediately after importing .pdb files into Maya, the ribbon and atom models will render beautifully. Unfortunately this trick doesn't work for the surface models. Nonetheless we generated some really high definition pictures (8192*8192 pixels with 220 pixels/inch) for the website. At the same time Justin has been transferred to work on Maya with us. I taught him everything I knew, from creating simple objects to do basic dynamics.
Rai asked me to do some modelling on beta-lactamase, which will likely be the reporter in our system. What she wants to get out of this study is to understand, say given two different concentrations of substrates, at what time will their differences be largest such that we can tell them apart. Unfortunately beta-lactamase is very fast enzyme such that the reaction mechanism is not studied in detail. Then I remembered what my chemical engineering professor taught me: when reaction is fast, model mass transfer. For our lateral flow strip system, the substance will spend most of its time diffusing before react with beta-lactamse, whose reaction will be rapid. Then by timing when the reaction occurs we have a measurement of the diffusion and hence will tell us how much substance was there initially.
Week 14: July 29 - August 2
Cesar asked us (Justin and I) to divide up our work. So I was working on the quantitative modeling while he worked on the qualitative modeling. The task I was asked to do was to figure out how to simulate TALE binding to DNA"
TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescent proteins for quantifiable input and output we designed a functional and robust screening system. For greater detail see Experimental Design . Unfortunately, setting up a working screening system failed twice. Only in redesigning and improving the screening plasmid pSB1A10 we succeeded, but lost precious time.
Ultimately, the two switches displayed remarkable differences in their terminator efficiency, but neither of them responded to their corresponding signal. However, screening one transmitter signal does not disprove the basic working principle of our system. Limited by time, we hope for future teams to take up our work and to use our improved test system that we submitted to the parts registry, for performing successful in vivo measurement.

Considering the high complexity of in vivo measurements compared to other experimental challenges, a robust and easy to handle test system for PoPS-based devices is desirable. As described in Experimental design , we used fluorescent proteins: RFP or mCherry to measure the amount of produced output and eGFP for normalization. Our first attempt, using the screening plasmid pSB1A10, yielded no interpretable results. Switching the fluorescent protein to mCherry did not work either, but after several experimental setups we determined a transcriptional problem causing no reporter protein expression regardless of the inserted part. Thereby we demonstrated the screening plasmid pSB1A10 to be malfunctioning .  Finally a new design based on pSB1A10 lead to a functional and robust screening system (compare Screening system: Backbone BBa_K494001 ). A second promoter with identical induction properties inside the BioBrick cloning site enforces transcription of the PoPS-based device and the mCherry output.
Exemplary, the graph below on the right shows the positive control, induced and uninduced at OD600=0.7 followed by 16 h incubation at 25 °C. Clearly visible are eGFP and mCherry fluorescence in the induced samples. The uninduced control showed no fluorescence at all, demonstrating the PBad promoter to be tight and providing very low basal transcription, what is a major advantage for the screening system. This newly designed screening approach renders the characterization of PoPS-based devices in general and switches in particular easy and robust. The low basal transcription furthermore fulfills one of the most important requirements for the designed switches, since output transmitters may only be produced in presence of an input transmitter. This helps to avoid strong ""background"" noise, which would extremely harden the successful interconnection of several switches.

Collaboration with CCA San Diego iGEM Team
During the 2017-2018 iGEM season, our team, TPHS-San Diego, collaborated with the CCA-San Diego iGEM team. During the collaboration, we discussed numerous issues such as part submission, team wiki troubleshooting, and safety precautions. For part submission, our team received help with the process of submitting the part on the part registry page. They were able to instruct us on this, and as a result, we were able to successfully submit the part. In addition, there were some aspects of coding the wiki that both of our teams needed to work out. Through our collaboration, both of our teams were able to improve upon our website design. Finally, we decided to make a compilation of videos that would be helpful to future iGEM teams, and our team created a lab safety component of the video included in the overall video for iGEM.

In order to enhance the exchange between two teams, we invited the iGEM team of Nanjing University to attend the academic debate (Figure7). Two teams conducted a debate on whether changes in epigenetic modification can determine tumorigenesis at the China Pharmaceutical University Conference Center:
Proposition: CPU _CHINA
Attitude: epigenetic modification can cause disease changes
Counter: NJU-CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications cannot determine tumorigenesis
The two sides held different arguments, and cited frontier knowledge of self-argument and deduction to express their views. Also, two teams obtained a lot of gains during the debate, and made a further exchange on the issue of respective topics.

Invited by the iGEM team of Nanjing Agricultural University, we participated in experience exchanging meeting (Figure 8). The meeting invited Haoqian Zhang, the predecessor of Peking University iGEM team, to share his experience. According to his previous experience, all the notes on the formation of the team and participation in the Giant Jamboree have been described in details and shared with us about the personal experience of participating in the iGEM competition.

Public Engagement and Education
“Synthetic Biology” can sound daunting to even the bravest of academics. We want to change that. Removing the stigma around science might not be accomplished in one iGEM season, or by just one iGEM team, but we know we made a difference this year. We taught high schoolers about bioengineering and helped them gain confidence in their ability. We played with younger kids to inspire them to pursue science. We threw a party to tell the community all about iGEM and what biology can do.  We made an app that will introduce people to plasmids wherever they are. Most of all, we told everyone we met how much is possible thanks to synthetic biology.

Bioengineering Camp
At the end of July we helped RAIN Incubator launch a week long summer camp that introduced incoming ninth and tenth graders to the world of synthetic biology. The campers were local public school students with little to no experience in science. We designed nine experiments for them to run. The first half of the week was spent running agarose gels, learning how to identify cells under a microscope, extracting their own DNA, and creating art in 96 well plates with Bradford Reagent and BSA. The second half of the week we got into more advanced biology. They ran endpoint PCR and learned how to use agarose gels to analyze their results, then split into groups to grow bacteria cultures. We used the BioBuilder kit, Eau That Smell, based on the 2006 MIT iGEM team’s project. For the purpose of the camp, we created a new protocol that showed the students how adding isoamyl alcohol to their cultures affects the growth. They learned that while adding isoamyl alcohol will make the culture smell like bananas, adding too much will, as one camper put it, “make the bacteria smell like feet”.

This year’s iGEM competition has been an exhilarating, instructive and absolutely nerve-wracking experience. A team of 24 students from two different cities got together to create a new milestone in synthetic biology. At the end of this year we are happy and more than proud to look back at everything we have achieved as a team. However, none of this would have been even imaginable without the amazing support of all the people who accompanied us throughout this year. Therefore, we are dedicating this part of our wiki to all the special people who helped us realize our project, no matter if it was with their technical support and knowledge, infrastructure, or organization.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," or had any experience with designing circuit diagrams and circuit board layouts, we had to learn everything in the process. Beginning with basics in electronics over advanced circuit design to programming microcontrollers, the process of creating this hardware tool held many exciting challenges that needed to be faced.
In the process of developing our LED panel, we designed, tested and evaluated several different prototypes until we came up with our final version. In accordance with the most central concept of engineering, our design was enhanced by every cycle of this “design ‑ build ‑ test"" loop.
A demonstrative example of this evolutionary approach is the development of the interfacing options to control the LED panel. At the beginning, we had only one central conceptual idea: We wanted to create a device that uses 96 LEDs to uniformly illuminate an entire microtiter plate.
Different through‑hole LEDs.
Due to their convenient handling, our first idea was to simply use standard through‑hole connected LEDs and control them with a simple on‑off switch. A first test circuit on a breadboard was quickly build, but this design turned out to have several disadvantages. First of all, the construction process is quite circumstantial, because every LED needs to be positioned and soldered by hand, inevitably resulting in inaccuracies which lead to an unequal illumination profile. More importantly, this approach lacks the flexibility that we wanted to achieve, since neither the illumination intensity nor its duration are precisely adjustable. Every LED requires a predefined series resistance, that needs to be newly calculated for every new kind of LED that should be used, leading to extensive work when adopting the device for a new purpose.
Therefore, we decided that a microcontroller is necessary to provide a basis for increased functionality. A microcontroller has a reprogrammable processing unit and offers several general‑purpose input/output (GPIO) pins to control and communicate with other microelectronic components in a circuit design. Our first choice was an Arduino Nano, as it is the most commonly used microcontroller with small dimensions and a convenient programming interface while being comparably inexpensive. The first prototype with an Arduino Nano used serial‑in parallel‑out shift registers to control the LEDs. These electric components convert a digital signal (a series of ones and zeros) into a parallel output. Therefore, they allow to control multiple LEDs with only one digital output pin. This way, this prototype was able to control all 96 LEDs individually, even though the Arduino Nano only has 22 GPIO pins. Nevertheless, the LEDs can only be turned on and off.
The next major improvement was the decision to use a pulse wave modulation (P"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Practices#DualUse_-_-_TEXT.html," the free market that could be used as date rape drugs, as well as instructions of synthesis of these drugs. We were wondering, why these information are freely available and if there are any laws applying publication of sensitive information.
Laws
Our project is aiming to build a biosensor for detecting ingredients of date rape drugs with the prospect of enabling people to protect themselves. Nevertheless, we focus attention on these ingredients and their availability and hence provide knowledge that might be misused to harm people. Therefore we analyzed the legal restriction of the providence of this knowledge not only in our country (Germany), but also in the European Union as confederal institution and in the USA, where iGEM takes place. We did not find laws applying to the publication of this knowledge, which is therefore legally justifiable.
Ethics
While providing this knowledge might lead to misuse, it has benevolent content. By publishing our obtained knowledge, we might inspire others to improve a sensor for the protection against date rape drugs, but also to build other biosensors detecting harmful substances in beverages in hindsight to our aim to provide a modular, extensible tool for the further creation of biosensors. In addition, our knowledge might raise the awareness of availability of the used chemicals in date rape drugs. This could ultimately lead to a more careful handling of beverages or even the overthought of legal obtainability and restriction of these chemicals, as we caused a broad discussion in the media. These findings lead to our ethical analysis in collaboration with experts from microbiology, law, sociology and ethics. Do the potential benefits of the publication of our results outweigh the potential risk? Since we are not providing knowledge how to synthesize or obtain these drugs, we still focus attention on these substances. Therefore, we decided to apply security risk assessment to our project.
Proposed Risk Assessment in every stage of the research progress
Risk assessment
The process of risk assessment as proposed by our team is conducted at every stage of our research. We do not aim for restriction or prohibition of research or progress, but for raising awareness and thereby minimizing the risk of misuse in a process of free and responsible science.
Awareness
We raised awareness in our team and collaborating coworkers within our institution of the potential danger of the misuse of our knowledge and inspired a discussion about the issue.
Training and education
While up to this point in our curriculum and education the dual use issue was not yet addressed, we educated ourselves about the dual use issue by a detailed analysis in our report and fruitful internal team and external discussions with experts on this topic. We further initiated a discussion about the importance of the issue with our team advisors and instructor."

NUS_Singapore-Sci,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-Sci#Cas Writes_-_-_TEXT.html," is a moral enterprise. It is socially embedded and will be part of the society. In recognition for this aspect, it makes sense to engage with all stakeholders. The development is not only related to the experts, ultimately everyone has to take ownership.” In such a process, all stakeholders have to be involved, from the boards that regulate Science, to scientists that research the technology and eventually the public that eventually consumes the technology..  In any implementation of controversial technology, the public is often not included in the decision making process, thus this has caused the public to be skeptical and misunderstand the Science. Involving the public is a useful exercise as they will probably be the future users of such technology, thus they should be given all the information for them to make an informed choice. Borrowing the words of Dr. Kon , “Once the public understand the intentions of scientist, the public is able to then think about the implications of that”. It is a necessity for the public to understand the possible implications of the technology on them and voice their concerns.
Furthermore, Singapore is known as the “melting-pot of culture” as we consist of a myriad of ethnicities and religions. This makes policy making in the country very complex, as there are diverse perspectives from different segments of the population that needs to be taken into account. The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) in Singapore regulates scientific research by recommending guidelines. Before such guidelines are published for the wider community, the recommendations from the committee are consulted publicly and also vetted by representatives of the various religious communities. Referring to an excerpt from our interview with Dr. Kon , a member of the BAC, “in the recent mitochondrial genome replacement discussion, we invited representatives of the Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikhs, Jews, Parsis, and other religions because each religion looks at the technology in slightly different ways. We need to know what all of their perspectives are. We also make a point to consult the religions because it’s not the lay public view but also the views of people who have some kind of religious affiliation.” This exemplifies the typical consultation process for bioethics board in Singapore. BAC places an emphasis on hearing the opinions of all stakeholders, albeit they might be diverging or diverse. The bioethics board takes the onus to compile such opinions, and shape the guidelines to respect the bottom line of all religions and ethical codes.
In conclusion, public engagement is essential to gather feedback from various stakeholders - to improve the ways the experts communicate science to the layman and allow the public to make an informed decision about the technology. The decision-making"

Demonstration of Your Work
We completed most of our design this year. In Sensing System, we selected the most suitable RBS and promotor for our sensing system under the guidance of modeling groups. We successfully constructed the plasmids and confirmed the transformation. In Regulation System, we constructed the plasmids we needed and plotted RFI curve and growth curve. According to the curves, we have proved our Regulation System is worked. In Degradation System, we constructed plasmids containing the genes of three enzymes separately and together. After confirming transformation, we successfully expressed three enzymes separately and together. In summary, it can be safely concluded that our project work!"

April 2015
On the 21st of April, we shared our topic with the advisers. We also grouped into 11 sub-teams ranging from ""Wet lab"" and ""Modelling"" to ""Design, photos and arts"".
May 2015
The ’Opening Event’ took place on the 20th of May. Here, we officially introduced ourselves and our topic to the broad public, advisers, press, and potential sponsors.
June 2015
In June, the second exam period required our full attention. Nevertheless, some team members with a fewer exams already explored literature and started looking for sponsors.
July 2015
In July, the 'real' work began and the whole team reviewed literature. We theoretically constructed the plasmids and searched quantification methods for specific proteins. The wet lab team started generating double knock-out strains while the first mathematical models were made in the dry lab. By developing the wiki and using social media, we kept everybody updated about our latest progress. The sponsor team prepared a folder and a brochure about iGEM and our project. The education and outreach team started planning possible collaborations with other teams. On the 21st of July, we met the iGEM-team from Toulouse to exchange information. Also, practical arrangements for the stay during the Giant Jamboree were made.
August 2015 (part 1)
In August, the double knock-out mutants were verified. While we waited for the gBlocks, we started the InterLab Measurement Study and finished the Lab Safety form. In the second part of August, we started the assembly of the plasmids and BioBricks. Starting from literature, we composed and optimized our own protocols for leucine and AHL detection.
August 2015 (part2)
Also in August, we established collaboration with the Toulouse, York, Marseille and Delft iGEM teams. Team representatives presented our project during the meet-up in Bordeaux. We planned the symposium in September and searched key-note speakers and panel members for the ethical debate. Besides this, customized bacteria stickers were designed for use in schools. Additionally, to have a view on the perception on synthetic biology of the broad public in Belgium, we conducted a survey. This month, we very actively searched more financial support from sponsors.
September 2015
We continued the assembly of the plasmids and BioBricks. On the 7th of September, we organised a symposium where we invited, among others, neighboring iGEM teams. On the 10th and"

Results
When working on our detection system in the lab, we used different cloning strategies for different purposes. For example, Gibson cloning was used to clone the endo-1,3-β-glucanase and dCas9-reporter constructs into a vector backbone. To generate the different guide RNAs we made use of Golden Gate cloning. The entire team put a lot of time and effort into the laboratory work (Notebook), but not all our cloning attempts ended up being successful. However, we were able to achieve positive and good results in the end.
Generation of guide RNA
After using the guide RNA generator from the Peking 2015 team, we verified the constructs by sequencing. RNA was generated with the HiScribe RNA synthesis kit, followed by using a RNA cleanup kit, we were able to produce different guide RNAs. We verified the quality and concentration of the guide RNA using a quBit instrument (Table 1).
Table 1: Concentration of guide RNA measured with quBit.The concentration of four different guide RNAs was measured, concentration ranged between 40 ng/µl to 370 ng/µl.

Endo-1,3-β-Glucanase
The enzyme glucanase is an important part of our detection system, as it catalyzes the hydrolysis of the β-glucan bond in the yeast cell wall, making it easier to lyse the cell and access the DNA. We were not only able to successfully clone the endo-1,3-β-gluanase into the submission vector (Figure 1) and expression vector (Figure 2), but we were also able it induce its expression (Figure 3). Finally, we could also show the glucanase activity in vitro (Figure 4, Figure 5).

In vivo TF characterization
To be able to determine the in vivo activity and specificity of novel transcription factor variants we generated a suite of reporter plasmid systems . We successfully characterized a number of our reporter systems for functionality. We created a number of reporter plasmids to measure TetR activity, which lead to improved characterization data for the Partsregistry.
Microfluidics
We noticed that only a small number of iGEM teams have also made use of microfluidics in the past. Because we think that microfluidics is a useful tool for the iGEM community, we decided to promote the technique by creating the [http://tamagotchip.epfl.ch tamagotchip] live online microfluidics game: from any web browser, you can control the setup located in our lab in Lausanne, as detailed here . In addition, we wrote a guide on the wiki to help future teams get started with these techniques.
In summary, over the summer we:
developed and characterized a new in vivo selection system based on “survival of the weakest”.
created and characterized a set of T7 promoter variants that express with different strengths.
created several TetR variants.
created several reporter systems for the in vivo characterization of TetR.
determined the binding energy landscape of TetR and a number of TetR mutants using MITOMI.
developed a cheap and easy to build a microfluidic setup for the iGEM community

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html," patógeno en la cepa matadora, y otro para el movimiento dirigido de la célula matadora hacia su presa.  El equipo utiliza el sistema intrínseco de detección y movimiento de la bacteria E. coli, que en la naturaleza es utilizado para detectar nutrientes para, mediante el rediseño de los receptores de la cepa matadora, detectar un cóctel molecular secretado por la cepa presa.
Una vez la presa ha sido alcanzada, un nuevo modulo genético es activado, conduciendo a la muerte del patógeno o la célula cancerígena. El equipo de Heidelberg sigue dos estrategias distintas para conseguir la muerte de la célula presa. La primera estrategia se basa en toxinas bacteriales y la segunda usa virus específicos para bacterias. Las toxinas son producidas normalmente por ciertas cepas para matar otras bacterias. Sin embargo, estas toxinas son también capaces de matar células cancerígenas, dando así la a la bacteria la posibilidad de matar dichas células. Para el sistema de prueba el equipo usa información genética de producción de toxinas en bacterias. Esta información será introducida en las células matadoras y modificada para que solo sea activada cuando la cepa matadora alcance la cepa presa. La consiguiente activación  llevará a la producción y secreción de toxinas, resultando finalmente en la muerte de la célula presa.
El segundo enfoque para matar la presa usa virus de bacteria, que de forma natural infectan células de E. coli. Durante la infección, el fago inyecta su información genética en la bacteria, forzándola a producir nuevos fagos que serán liberados a posteriori. Una vez libres, los fagos serán capaces de atacar otras bacterias. En este enfoque, el equipo aprovechará específicamente el efecto dominó, que permite matar un numero elevado de células presa con un numero reducido de células matadoras.
Además del trabajo experimental en el laboratorio, una parte importante del mismo conlleva la creación de modelos computacionales del modulo sensor y matador. La simulación de dichos modelos permite la predicción del comportamiento del sistema bajo condiciones diversas y ayuda a un mejor diseño de la parte experimental.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," probably because the overexpression of glucose transporter genes are somehow toxic to E. coli. Therefore, IDT can’t synthesize the genes which are linked to a strong promoter.
Trouble-shooting 1.
– Amplification of genes by PCR with gDNA
We found a way to directly clone the genes out from Salmonella. Unfortunately, Salmonella is a human pathogen and classify as Biosafety Level 2 agents. First of all, we check the virulence factors (e.g., invasion/adhesion proteins, fimbriae, flagella, type I and III secretion systems)2 and confirm the glucose transporter genes are out of the list.
We sought collaboration with other iGEM teams to got the genes. Luckily, the place of iGEM team CSMU_NCHU _Taiwan is just near our school campus and working in a lab with the materials of Salmonella. They helped us amplify the genes of crr, ptsG and STM1128 by PCR using genomic DNA of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 as template (the gDNAs are recognized as Biosafety Level 1 agents, according the information provided by ATCC ).
Now we could move forward with the PCR-amplified DNA fragments of glucose transporter genes of Salmonella.
Problem 2.
– Promoter was gone in the recombinant DNA
We soon assembled RBS-crr and RBS-ptsG to Double terminator/pSB1C3 (BBa_B0015) to make RBS-crr-RBS-pstG-TT/pSB1C3, so did to RBS-STM1128 to make RBS-STM1128-TT/pSB1C3. But something unexpectedly was happening in the next step.
We are unable to assemble both of the transporter composite parts with Double terminator under CP29 promoter.
A paper demonstrated growth inhibition by elevated transport of sugar phosphates in E. coli with overexpression of a glucose transporter (uhpT) gene3. Sugar phosphates transported through the transporter directly enter into glycolytic pathway resulting in the accumulation of toxic metabolite, methylglyoxal which causes the bacterial growth inhibition or cell death. It could also occur in our situation.
Although different and regulated promoters like PBAD or Plac could save our gene cloning, we still continued to focus on the CP promoter because a feasible promoter working both on E. coli and Lactobacilus spp. and easily applied to industrial manufacture without addition of any chemicals (inducers) are what we want.
Trouble-shooting 2.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Decoy_-_-_TEXT.html," spectinomycin resistance cassette can be selected from a    larger number of decoys. We could not determine the optimal ratio that    would strengthen this layer of biosecurity. For further experiments the    ratio of decoys should be fine tuned to determine the maximum ratio of    spores:decoys that could be used, thus reassuring that unauthorized    parties will not be able to recover the key by sequencing the whole    sample but the intended recipient will still be able to recover it.

For plasmids of category I (see table 1), we combined eight promoters with three ribosome binding sites, a kanamycin resistance gene and a p15a ori, giving us 24 constructs. For plasmids of category II and III we used the same promoters and ribosome binding sites for both transcriptional units, leading to 576 plasmids respectively. For plasmids of category IV we restricted our selection to three promoters and three ribosome binding sites. Since a misbalance of accBC- and accD expression levels leads to inclusion bodies and decreased activity we decided to always use the same promoters and
RBS
for both genes. In this category we get 81 plasmid variants. For categories V, VI and VII, containing the whole pathway, the combinatorial possibilities were very high, so we decided to further restrict the selection by always coupling strong promoters to strong
RBS
, medium promoter to medium
RBS
and weak promoter to weak
RBS
. Therefore, we got a total of 27 plasmids for category V and 81 plasmids for category VI and VII, respectively.   We also considered to integrate one or several genes, therefore we planned to search for integration sites and to characterize them  ( see link to ori characterization of the part collection ).
Biosensors and Product Screening
Our biosensors
The design of our biosensors was largely guided by the goal of having as little impact on the host metabolism, while simultaneously being simple and easy to implement. We chose to design all parts to be compatible with the Marburg Collection, RFC10, RFC25, and RFC1000, to make it as easy as possible for us and future users to implement it and adapt it to new requirements.
Figure 6: Scheme of the 3-HPA sensor
This part enables creation of new LVL0 parts by replacing the parts sequence with the desired insert. The sfGFP expression cassette is flanked by BsmBI recognition sites
Annotation of the location for the regulatory sequences upstream of the HdpR coding sequence was insufficient for us to precisely remove the activator binding site or the constitutive promoter driving HdpR expression. So, we included an about 200bp long region upstream of the HdpR, which should be enough to include all regulatory motifs. Also included is the HdpR coding sequence with its own ribosomal binding site
(RBS).

UT-Knoxville,2017,Team:UT-Knoxville#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," fundraising to cover all costs. We did fundraising throughout the summer whereas Team Aachen tackled fundraising much earlier in the process. Our team members were assigned several companies to contact for fundraising on their own time, and this made it more difficult to ensure everyone was proactive about the fundraising effort. Team Aachen came together on the weekends and contacted companies together. They also suggested doing more research into the company’s profile and finding common ground with the company and the team’s research in order to have more success. They also recommended calling companies over the phone rather than over the email because companies were more responsive that way.
Important Lessons
Focus on a recruitment process that encourages members to understand one another.
Ensure that each member understands the commitment of being on the team.
Make meetings less lecture based and more engaging to members. Encourage creativity and sharing of ideas.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Product Design_-_-_TEXT.html," attain these ambitious global goals. Localization means to put everything within subnational frameworks, from setting targets to deciding the mode of action and selecting indicators for monitoring progress. And from this local perspective, we would like to show Biotic Blue potential to contribute fulfilling these goals, which in our eyes mirrors its impact on our planet and society in the most accurate way (22).
Biotic Blue, to different extends contributes to attain 10 out the 17 goals, showing its capability to influence society on multiple levels as it is shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6. The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Biotic Blue contributes to be attained. (The illustration is a redesign of UN SDGs 2030 [23])
(SDG 6) By minimizing the levels of hazardous pharmaceuticals in effluent wastewater and consequently in the aquatic environment, Biotic Blue increases safe re-use of wastewater and reduces pharmaceutical pollution. It also protects and restores water-related ecosystems including rivers and lakes.
(SDG 11) Helps human settlements, adopting and implementing integrated policies towards inclusion. In addition, Biotic Blue enhances the capacity for more sustainable urbanization.
(SDG 9) Helps the development of advanced regional infrastructure to support sustainable economic growth by upgrading the technological capabilities of WWTPs to treat wastewater.
(SDG 14) Biotic blue helps in preventing and reducing marine pharmaceutical pollution protecting sensitive coastal and marine ecosystems. It stops the exposure of marine organisms to non-naturally occurring in the aquatic environment chemical entities.
(SDG 3)Helps to slow down the development of antibiotic resistance, which comprises a major and imminent threat to human health, by minimizing uncontrolled exposure of environmental bacteria to antibiotics.
(SDG 13) Helps to preserve in sound condition marine ecosystems that play significant role in our effort to restore our planet's climate and mitigate the environmental impact of the human activity-pharmaceutical consumption.
(SDG 8) Biotic Blue is an innovative solution with high additional value that contributes in decoupling pharmaceutical consumption, an indicator of economic growth from environmental deterioration.
(SDG 7) By having lower energy needs than the competitive solutions, Biotic Blue contributes to the improvement of efficient energy usage.
(SDG 17) Biotic Blue is an environmentally sound technology derived from a developed country and can be transferred and diffused to developing countries in order to counter the emerging problem of aquatic pharmaceutical pollution. (Contribution-impact: 3/10)

Computation
The sensitivity coefficients are defined by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation,
<math>\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial s(t,q)}{\partial q}=N[\frac{\partial v(t)}{s}\frac{\partial s(t)}{\partial q}+ \frac{\partial v(t)}{\partial q}]</math>

The choice of <math>s(0)=s_{0}</math> and <math>p_{0}</math> fix a trajectory <math>s(t)=s(t,s_{0},p_{0}</math> , and hence determines the function <math>v(t)=v(s(t),p,t)</math> as well. The equation above can be solved numerically for the concentration sensitivities. In performing such a calculation, we must note that the right-hand side depends on the time-varying value of the species concentration vector s(t), so a simple computational strategy is to determine <math>s_{i}(.)</math> and <math>\partial s_{i}(.)/\partial q</math> simultaneously.

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Notebook#Microbiology_-_-_TEXT.html," to purify fungal DNA, the experiment failed because at a moment open tubes fall and the fungal DNA was lost.
Week 9th-16th October
We isolated a lot of Pseudomonas from strains 201 to 222 that's why we had that much degradation in Quercetin.
Finally with the 9 experiments we made to assay 187 strains, we were able to produce this histogramme.
To be more clear and avoid confusion with the name of the strains we renamed all the strains we have tested on Quercetin degradation. We named them with a S.number if the strain was isolated on a Selective media (M9 + Quercitin agar). We named them NS.number is the strain was isolated on a Non Selective media.
In this histogram, the strains are rated by chronological order. At the beginning of our experiments, we had only strains isolated on Quercetin that worked on Quercetin degradation.
But then we tested more and more NS strains and we had more positiv results, especially in the end of our experiments when we tested on Australia sample and we had lot of Pseudomonas.
Fungal identification
The fungal DNA was purified. We amplified the ITS region in PCR. The gel electrophoresis showed the sequence in all the strains except the FS_F7 and the negative control.
The DNA concentration was quantified  :
-negative control : 5 ng/µ
-FS_F1 : 40,4 ng/µL
-FS_F2 : 66,3 ng/µL
-FS_F3 : 62,0 ng/µL
-FS_F4 : 53,0 ng/µL
-FS_F5 : 35,2 ng/µL
-FS_F6 : 23,6 ng/µL
-FS_F8 : 30,0 ng/µL
-FS_F9 : 68,9 ng/µL
-FS_F10: 45,3 ng/µL
As all the concentration were between 20 and 80 ng/µL the DNA was sent to GATC for sequencing
Week 3d October-8th October
Fungal identification
The fungi were identified :
-FS_F1 : Aspergillus fumigatus
-FS_F2 : Aspergillus fumigatus
