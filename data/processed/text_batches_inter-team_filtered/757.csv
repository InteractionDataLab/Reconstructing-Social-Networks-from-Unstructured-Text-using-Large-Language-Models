ATOMS-Turkiye,2013,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html,"afety issues and questions that may arise for our team.
As an undergraduate at LSU, I performed my thesis work on the synthesis and cellular investigations of a specific photosensitizer that is a chlorophyll derivative called Chlorin e6.  My work concentrated on the applications of this photosensitizer in the clinical process known as photodynamic therapy (PDT).  PDT is used to destroy tumors, and involves three key components:  a photosensitizer, light, and tissue oxygen.
By modifying this derivative through the addition of positively charged amino acids (lysine), I was able to give strengthen its amphiphilic characteristics.  Amphiphilicity is a measure of the extent to which a molecule can behave in both a polar and nonpolar way.  This gives these molecules the ability to dissolve in the blood and also to pass through hydrophobic cell membranes.  After biological studies, I found that the molecular photosensitizer I constructed was very potent in terms of phototoxicity, which means that even at very low concentration there was destruction of the cancer cells.
In terms of biosafety, I want to focus on the basic principles of biochemistry and cell-photosensitizer interaction.  In general, my photosensitizer was much more of a safety risk due to its ability to uptaken into individual cells from the extracellular space.  Additionally, it is not heavily altered by spending time in the extracellular space due to its amphiphilic characteristics. KillerRed, however, is a ""genetic"" photosensitizer that is created within a cell of interest and (as far as we know) can only act upon that individual cell.  This is due to the very unique fact that KillerRed is a protein that folds to form a chromophore that produces 10-fold more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than other fluorescent proteins such as GFP.  All proteins have unique foldings that can be quite sensitive to its surroundings (pH, temperature, etc.) and if a cell containing KillerRed were to lyse and release the photosensitizer, I believe that no other cells would be greatly (if al all) affected due to two main points:
1.)  The KillerRed protein may become denatured (unfolded) due to a change in environment, breaking apart the chromophore and rendering all ROS production to null
2.)  The KillerRed protein maintained its proper folding, but fails to enter any nearby cells due to its size (macromolecule) and inability to be uptaken into other cells"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Modeling2_-_-_TEXT.html," for fun. We choose \(r\) to be normally distributed with a mean value of 0 and a variance of, say, 1. We evaluate the position of the particle at multiple timesteps (with some small time \(dt\) separating them) and plot our solution in the Figure below.
We can do better than this when dealing with systems such as our example in the previous section. We use the Gillespie algorithm to find:
The time taken between reactions
The reaction that took place in that time.
as neither of these could be determined by our initial method [ 2 , 4 ].
1) To find the time taken, we make an assumption about the form of the probability distribution that the time between reactions holds. It makes sense to think of it as a falling exponential, such that reactions more often happen quickly rather than slowly, and that the more probable a reaction is, the shorter the time between subsequent reactions. This naturally leads to the form
\[P(t)=e^{-\alpha_{0}t}\]
where \(P(t)\) is the probability of any reaction occuring in time \(t\), and \(\alpha_{0}\) tells us something about the likelihood of the reaction. We plot this in the Figure. In fact we call \(\alpha_{0}\) the sum of the propensities \(\alpha_{i}\) (where the dummy variable \(i\) runs from 1 to the number of possible reactions, \(N\), that could occur). In the case of our example system, the propensity for the reaction \(A\) to \(B\) would be \(k_{+}A\) and the propensity for the reaction \(B\) to \(A\) is \(k_{-}B\) so in this case \(\alpha_{0}=k_{+}A+k_{-}B\).
To decide the time it took for a reaction to occur, we sample a random number \(r_{1}\) in the range [0,1] and stick that number on the y axis of the graph. We read off from our graph a corresponding time and we're done - we now know when the next reaction took place.
2) To decide which reaction took place, we need the probabilities of each reaction occuring being proportional to the ratio of their propensities. We split up the domain of 0 to 1 into the normalised ratios of the propensities of our problem, recalling the propensities we calculated. We could have, in this case, selected the backwards reaction B to A. We can generalise this to the"

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," model wish to quantitatively figure out the extent of increase in E.coli’s growth rate with the influence of  a certain amount of glucose dehydrogenase. Because of the great complexity of knowing and simulating the whole promoting process,  our model only focuses on the steps influenced by the promoter, who serves as an enzyme in cellular respiration. Both the enzyme and the substrate moves randomly in the E.coli, which induced us to a 3-dimensional random walk model. The initial substrate concentration is set fixed throughout experiments, while the concentration of enzyme (i.e. the growth-promoter glucose dehydrogenase) varies among different situations, simulation with programming is done, and the average combination ratio can be calculated.
This value is then used as the adjustment multiplier of E.coli’s individual growth rate, since their combination stands for the happening of enzymatic reaction. By treating the substrate-enzyme combination rate as a quantified value of E.coli’s growth promoting effect, we further incorporate this term as the change of individual growth rate (no units), which means, the greater this value is, E. coli shall experience a faster growth, and the promoting effect changes, under various content of intercellular glucose dehydrogenase, as follows.
Gene expression level
Following the steps mentioned above, the composition of E.coli population at each time is well known. Our goal now is to find out the relationship between individual plasmid number and the recombinant gene expression level.
We absorbed the queue theory in operational research, by treating the nutrients as customers, and the plasmid in each E.coli as the service station. Given the E.coli’s average nutrient intaking capacity, as well as the plasmid processing rate, the amount of nutrients taken by E.coli and processed by each plasmid are known. Then, with different intracellular plasmid numbers between different groups, the processing ability between individual E.coli can vary, indicating a bigger velocity of reaction with a greater number of plasmids contained.
However, more plasmids can leads to decreasing amount of allocated nutrients on average. Since the E.coli’s nutrient intake ability is fixed,  more plasmid within means less nutrients sent to each of them, this will on the other hand, leads to a decrease in target gene expression level of each plasmid.
Programming goes along with theoretical deductions, by setting the time step as one second, E.coli’s nutrient intake ability is set as at most 10 units, and the plasmid’s average processing ability is 2 units at a time"

Motivation & Idea
Doing the iGEM lab work, cloning some stuff with 3A assembly. Hasn’t everyone wished you could just take your parts, cut the plasmids, mix and ligate them and be done with it? No need for time intensive (and expensive!) purification of the cut plasmids.
We designed a system that will allow you to do exactly that. The idea is very simple:  If we would combine this with parts in the normal iGEM plasmids, we’d get re-ligation products of the original plasmids as well as possible side products (see figure 1). How can we get rid of all of these in one simple step?
Overview over the possible products and side products. By inducing the kill genes in side products or wrong backbones, we can select against bacteria carrying the false constructs.
Quite easily, since the common feature of all the undesired ligation products is that they have (at least) one backbone of the two plasmids, which were source for the parts we want to fuse together. If we put a negative selection marker into the backbone of these plasmids, we can easily get rid of them - not during the ligation, but directly after the transformation.
This method will of course reduce the effective transformation efficiency, because only one out of 10 or more ligations products is desired and able to form a colony after transformation. However, we can easily put a lot more DNA into the ligation reaction, since we can use the whole restriction mixture.
And if we are already improving cloning techniques, why stop at restriction and ligation? Can we not also make plasmid purification easier, which is quite expensive - especially for small iGEM teams with little funding - and also complicated to do using pipetting robots.
How could a one-step purification of only (desired) plasmids from the lysate of bacteria work? We’d need something, that can bind plasmid-DNA, but does not bind genomic DNA. This can only be achieved through a sequence specific binding"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"ac hybrid promoter and initiating the expression of TetR and BeeT’s toxin (Figure 10c). At this point the system has switched to on-state and any small perturbations will not influence the stable expression of BeeT’s toxin. As cells are still in dark, MazE continues gaining over MazF and cells are alive.
Situation 3: BeeT Escapes The Hive
Once our BeeT escapes from the brood cell, the exposition to light would inhibit the phosphorylation process between YF1 and FixJ, resulting in the inactivation of FixJ and stopping the transcription from the hybrid promoter, FixK2 promoter on Kill Switch. TetR can no longer inhibit the ptet promoter and the system switch back to the off-state (Figure 10d). In the meantime, MazF would start being expressed, which leads to programmed cell death reducing the the environmental impact of BeeT.
Figure 10. BeeT light and guanin/vitamin B12 regulation. (a) In dark and prior to sensing of guanine/vitamin B12, LacI is repressing the placI-Fixk2 hybrid promoter and the toggle switch is on the off- state (no BeeT’s toxin production). Dark keeps a certain level of lambda cI preventing MazF expression and keeping the cells alive. (b) After guanine/vitamin B12 perception, the riboswitch on the LacI mRNA attenuates its translation starting the transition of the toggle switch from the OFF to the ON state. The light kill switch remains on the same state. (c) The decrease of LacI initiates TetR and BeeT’s toxin production (on-state). The light kill switch remains on the same state. (d) Exposure to light inhibits phosphorylation between YF1 and FixJ gradually reducing the inhibition of TetR and switching the system back to the OFF state. On the light kill switch, light exposure relieves MazF expression from the inhibition of lambda cI repressor.
Hybrid Promoter Design
In order to make Fixk2 promoter as an inducible promoter for the toggle switch, which could also be compatible with the light kill switch, we had to add additional repressor operator sequences into the Fixk2 sequence. Hence, the whole structure of Fixk2 should be elucidated. However, we could not find any literature demonstrating the definite structure of the Fixk2 promoter (BBa_K592006) from the iGEM parts registry and even the original Fixk2 promoter from pDawn and pDusk system 5 does not have"

Core Algorithmic Approach, Runtime and Distribution
The completed script was “converted” into an executable file along with all included modules using the PyInstaller 2 software. This allowed us to make TaiCO available for almost all Unix-based and Windows platforms. Due to the nature of the supporting PyInstaller software the user has only one mandatory computational task in order to be able to run the software, which is to download the preferred zipped version. The application runtime remains under 5 sec (system dependent) due to the computationally efficient production of optimized sequences codon by codon according to the corresponding maximum \(w_i\) value. In the case of restriction site elimination the selection of codons is performed along with the sequence production and less optimized codons are therefore incorporated. After the downloading procedure is done, the careful reading of the two README files in the relevant folder is strongly recommended. The system compatible version of TaiCO can be downloaded by clicking one of the following links:
Windows: Click here to download Windows version
Unix: Click here to download Unix version
Mac OS X: There is no specific bundle for MacOS, both links from above can be used and after python3 installation the original source code can be ran with the following command : python3 TaiCO.py

These plates (9 in total) were left over night in the incubator (37C) to grow and have a party. In the lab book you can get an overview of what each of the these 9 plates contained, there were of course several controls as you might have guessed. The plates of most importance were the ones containing the transformations containing plasmids pSLD30 and pSLD31, thus from these plates one colony was used for a restreak on a new plate to have as a ""stock"" plate, as well as making over-night cultures.
The over-night cultures, obviously having grown over-night were used to perform plasmid purification (follow protocol) in order to obtain pSLD30 and pSLD31, -80 freezing cultures of the strains were also made and registered in the ""strain bank"" excel file found in dropbox.
So, from A to B, the steps were the following:
PCR
PCR clean-up
Restrictions
Gel-control of restrictions
Ligation
Gel-control of ligation
Transformation
Plating
Over-night cultures
Plasmid purification & -80 freezing cultures
= pSLD30 & pSLD31 plasmids constructed!
Have a look at the lab book in order to get a full detailed explanation of all of these steps and all the small details not mentioned here.
Next step are the insertions of all the FP's (yGFP, CFP & CRFP) into pSLD30 and pSLD31, individually of course.. will make that tomorrow's log.

Lab work (Thomas, Anja, Patrick and Maya) 25/06/10
Today Thomas joined the lab:-)
The 10-1 and 10-2 dilution from the 24/06/10 yielded several hundred colonies which means that the transformation was indeed alright. As it's Friday today, we will wait with the O/N culture till Sunday.
The O/N of strain SP58 showed growth this time. The plasmid was purified and stored together with the FP plasmids. A -80 freezing culture of this strain was also made.To get an overview of the strains and plasmids we have used so far, have a look in the strain and plasmid bank in dropbox-research group-strain and plasmid bank.

At last, we designed a model to mimic the movement pattern and predict the efficiency of the Prometheus E.coli.
Root exudates
Plants secrete both high- and low-molecular weight compounds from their roots, and these root exudates play an important role not only as nutrients for soil microbes but also as signal molecules in plant–microbe interactions (Sugiyama & Yazaki) . In the wild, legume plants establish symbiotic interactions with rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to obtain several nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate. The root exudates of legume plants contain organic acids, including some TCA intermediates, such as malate, succinate, citrate and fumarate. Especially, in response to phosphorus starvation, malonie, succinic, fumaric, malic, citric, and t-aconitic acids were detected in the root exudates (Ohwaki & Hirata, 1992) . Here, we design the Prometheus E.coli that responses to malate and succinate and will swim to the roots to improve the interaction between the roots and fungi.
Chemoreceptor and Chemotaxis
In isotropic chemical environments, E. coli swims in a random - walking pattern produced by alternating episodes of counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation (Fig. 1, left panel).  While an attractant or repellent appear somewhere in the environment, the cells’ locomotor responses specific runs that take the cells in favorable directions (toward attractants and away from repellents), resulting in net movement towards preferred environments.  (Fig. 1, right panel).
Fig. 1  Random and biased walks. Left: A random walk in isotropic environments. When the cell's motors rotate CCW, the flagellar filaments push the cell forward. When one or more of the flagellar motors reverses to CW rotation, that filament undergoes a shape change (owing to the torque reversal) that disrupts the bundle. Until all motors once again turn in the CCW direction, the filaments act independently to push and pull the cell in a chaotic tumbling motion. Tumbling episodes enable the cell to try new, randomly-determined swimming directions. Right: A biased walk in a chemoeffector gradient. As cells swim up"

MIT,2014,Team:MIT#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html," were contemplating several possible delivery strategies, each of which had its own technical pros and cons. However, what we sorely lacked was the point of view of the general public - how would an Alzheimer’s patient feel about receiving our therapeutics? In what manner would he/she prefer to be treated?
       To address this, we designed a public opinion survey, which aimed to determine what method of delivery would cause the least public outcry and be able to be administered as a therapeutic to the largest majority of people. The survey data was useful and provided results akin to those we expected. In general, people are more comfortable with less invasive methods of delivery. This lead to design decisions for our project that are compatible with viral delivery to neurons, that would be (theoretically) administered via blood injection.
       This survey could be easily modified and used for any project considering the public opinion of their research/science. It includes several set-up and gating questions, and is short, simple and quick. More details about our survey may be found here .

Q: How will we deliver our system into the human body?
A:   This question arose at the beginning of our research journey, and continued to affect the direction of our project over the subsequent months. As a potential therapy for Alzheimer’s disease, our system would have to somehow be inserted into the human body. We considered several aspects of this process, and though we would never be performing it ourselves, we sought to design our system such that the safest, most effective, and most publicly acceptable method of delivery would be used.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," of metabolic network maps reveals that, Although often neglected, anabolic pathways are in reality mined with reaction that produce side-products, in addition to the intermediates that will subsequently be (used to synthesize) biomass components. These side-products are usually recycled back via dedicated metabolic routes to guarantee an efficient use of cellular resources. In the case of photosynthetic organisms, given the large energetic requirements associated with carbon fixation, this recycling is particularly important, as it really does not pay off to allow the carbon contained in side-products of anabolism to be lost. This has been used as an argument to explain the extended anabolic versatility of photoautotrophs and their reduced number of auxotrophies (i.e. nutrient requirements for growth) [4]. But hitherto has never been exploited to develop growth-coupled production strategies.
Introducing ""FRUITS""
Building up on the ideas brought forward by the 2015 Amsterdam iGEM team , an algorithm has been developed to 'Find Reactions Usable In Tapping Side-products' – FRUITS. This is freely-available at https://gitlab.com/mmp-uva/fruits.git . It identifies side-products of anabolism that are suitable to be coupled to growth of the cells by deletion of their re-utilization reaction(s). A constrained (e.g. here mimicking industrial conditions) genome-scale model (GSM) of the desired production organism (e.g. here Synechocystis ), is the only input required. Implemented as a pipeline of Python scripts, FRUITS produces (i) a list of all the modeled metabolites that can be produced in a growth-coupled fashion; (ii) the gene deletions that are required for it; and (iii) the computed maximal biomass formation rate along with the predicted minimum flux towards the identified target compounds.
FRUITS starts by evaluating the GSM for reactions responsible for the synthesis of macromolecules (e.g. proteins, DNA or RNA) and their precursors (e.g. amino acids or nucleotides). All reactions identified are then dissected into their products and substrates. A distinction for the products is drawn between biomass precursor metabolites (i.e. strictly used within the anabolic pathway) and co-produced molecules (i.e. that are not necessarily directly used as a substrate in an anabolic pathway). The list of co-produced compounds is then shortened by removing molecules that do not contain carbon (e.g. ions) or that are cofactors that act as energy carriers or redox equivalents (e.g. ATP, NADPH, NAD"

Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample."
UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Alphabrick_-_-_TEXT.html,"abrick.bio,  originated at the UK’s first 72 hour biohackathon at which it won first place.
AlphaBrick allows synthetic biologists to easily design, exchange and create DNA circuitry. The platform enables users to experience a quicker, traceable design process that ensures that decisions are recorded and that subsequent progress is accelerated. It provides a marketplace for lab designs; by facilitating the buying and selling of gene circuit parts, making collaboration easier. The integration of the AlphaBrick platform with Transcriptic’s automated laboratories saves precious time and reduces the knowledge-barrier to using robotic labs. Given our customer interviews, we envisage that this platform will have a big impact on accelerating SynBio research and commercialisation.
We demoed a successful run of our first prototype and MVP with a use-case at the Cambridge Biohackathon using Transcriptic’s automated cloud lab work cell in July of this year.
We have since been working to expand the capabilities of our platform. Our product development team are hard at work on algorithms for effective recommendations for the best combination of constructs when designing a DNA circuit as well as data-mining solutions for notifications about patented DNA sequences.
3. Commercial Potential
Market Opportunity
As synthetic biology technology has been developing even quicker than that predicted by Moore’s Law, the $6.4 billion synthetic biology market is set to grow by one of the biggest compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of any field. The synthetic biology market will make up 6% of the total biotech market. Considering the value system and chains within the synthetic biology field’s workflow, it is clear that there is trapped value with regards to the effieicney, accessibility and user empowement that can be addressed by new computational biology solutions such as AlphaBrick. The computational biology market is set to grow by 21% from it’s current $1.7 billion valuation. This therefore presents an immensely profitable potential market opportunity for Alphabrick.
Competitor Analysis
An analysis of the competitive landscape into which Alphabrick will be released has proved favourable. Alphabrick’s platform, as a whole, does not have direct competitors as there is no commercially available platform that integrates the pains that Alphabrick addresses. When broken down, however, into the individual features that it offers the user, it can be understood to have a number of indirect competitors in the DNA sequence design and automated creation space. While DNA sequences can be designed for the specific purposed of using the Crisper/Cas9 system with Desktop Genetics and more broadly with Benchling, these software solutions do not have the extensive gene construct combination"

Fluorescence measurements are usually hard to compare because they are reported in different units or because people process data in different ways. Standardization is one of the main principles of synthetic biology. Therefore, this year’s iGEM InterLab Study aimed to establish common, comparable units of measurement of fluorescence.
""Without absolute units you cannot even say precisely how much shorter you are!""
InterLab Study,
iGEM
Introduction
""Without absolute units you cannot even say precisely how much shorter you are!""
InterLab Study,
iGEM
All of the 2016 iGEM teams were invited and encouraged to participate in the Third International InterLaboratory Measurement Study. We, DTU BioBuilders, were excited to participate in the study, which will aid the establishment of a baseline for replicability of fluorescence measurements and identify likely key sources of error. This study focused specifically on the standardization of the way fluorescent measurements are made, which allows for easier comparisons. iGEM provided the teams with standard protocols whereof we carried out the measurements using the plate reader. In addition, the teams were provided with a pre-constructed Excel data sheet in order to standardize the calculations and presentation of data.
Devices
The 2016 iGEM teams were provided with three test devices, including two controls, a positive and negative control:
Test Device 1: J23101.B0034.E0040.B0015 in pSB1C3
Test Device 2: J23106.B0034.E0040.B0015 in pSB1C3
Test Device 3: J23117.B0034.E0040.B0015 in pSB1C3
Positive Control Device: I20270 in pSB1C3

Meeting
After talking a little bit through Instagram, we arranged a video chat meeting. We had to get up a little early for this one, but it was worth it. We talked about our projects and proposed how they could interact with each other towards the solution of a global problem, the excess of CO2 in the atmosphere. Our system could act as a signal by being coupled with their pH sensing promoter or it could also identify heavy metals that may appear in their process.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Dental hygiene_-_-_TEXT.html," 6.78, GFP expression gradually increases for E. coliwith BBa_K239009 . The maximum GFP expression is observed at 6.78. GFP expression increases from 13,556.25 at pH 3.97 to 35,569 at pH 6.78. Beyond this maximum, there is a sharp decline in GFP expression as the starting LB broth increases in alkalinity, falling to 7,394 at pH 7,394. Conversely, for the control, a sharp increase is observed from pH 5393.5 at 3.97 to 38854.5 at pH 5.08. After this, the general trend is one of increasing fluorescence as pH increases, but the increase is more gradual.
From this experiment, we have established that BBa_K239009 (Spy Promoter) previously used to characterise protein misfolding can be used as a pH-sensitive promoter, as well. Thus, we have improved the function and characterization of an existing BioBrick Part.
Green light-inducible device
As a means of adding specificity of application to our existing devices, we designed a ‘template’ green light-inducible device (GLID) with blue output (amilGFP), adapted from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. There are three components of the system: the chromatic acclimation sensor (CcaS), the response regulator (CcaR) and the PcpcG2 promoter. CcaS is a histidine kinase which is activated by green light and can catalyze phosphorylation of CcaR, leading to its activation and induction of gene expression downstream of PcpcG2. In our design (Fig. 4), there are two independently inducible promoters (Ptac and pBAD) allowing for fine tuning of gene expression by modifying the amount of IPTG and arabinose. This device contains an improvement of the existing part of the device ( BBa_K592019 ) because it constitutes a self-contained functional system with an improved RBS for PcpcG2 adapted from (16), suspected to increase the level of expression of the genes downstream of the promoter by about 40 times compared to the wild-type promoter.

This can already be seen in the samples before purification (figure col 1 lane 2-5, figure col 2 lane 2-5). The conclusion is that the fusion protein probably breaks at the linke, due to two bands at approximatly the same height as dxCas9 and Tn5.

Our project is divided into several parts, and they all advance in parallel. We also planned for a series of activities, ranging from lectures to demonstrative experiments, to get students aware of the existence of iGEM, and, what is more, the importance of synthetic biology. Also, we do communications with professors and students outside the team and that has proved to benefit us a lot.
Early the spring semester, several lectures were delivered for recruitment in HIT, during which our team supervisor and a few old members came to share their stories with iGEM. They narrated by own experience how iGEM has made a difference in their lives, and they also explain the basic idea of iGEM as well as our project this year. More than 50 students were attracted to the lecture and five of them were finally admitted as new members of our team.
After recruitment, a new series of lectures are well prepared for training. All new members are required to come for a better understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology. Renowned professors as well as experienced team members are invited it.
Prof. Xing as a Consultant
Accidently, we got the information that there are other professors in HIT who also think highly of the iGEM competition, which excited us a lot. By great efforts, we successfully get through with one of them. Professor Xing Defeng, Cheung Kong Scholar of China, had an impressing talk with our team. He shared with us his own understanding for iGEM and synthetic biology. And he also clarified to us how the idea of iGEM could be applied in his own field. He agreed to join us as a consultant, and two of his students come to our team as members.
NEAU as a New Friend
During the recruitment lecture in spring semester, we met with several students coming from the iGEM club of Northeast Agriculture University (NEAU). They had never participated in the iGEM competition before but were preparing for a long time. The lack of practical experiences stays as a barrier in their way to iGEM. Aware of the situation, we decided to give a hand to them.
We invited representatives from this team to attend our weekly meetings and participate in the training courses for new members. Also, a few students from NEAU joined our experiments for project in the summer vacation and took an active part in it. We have been sharing knowledge, ideas and passion throughout the project.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," B. subtilis using PCR product. Unfortunately, each trial gave us different results. For the first trial we used frozen B. subtilis cells (1% xylose, 10% glycerol). The plates did not contain any colonies on the selective pates. Therefore, we concluded that there may have been a problem with our stock. We tried again using a different batch of comK cells (1%xylose). The results are shown below.  We successfully transformed B. subtilis using DNA amplified from the thrC vector using primer set 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (500-125 bp of homologous sequence). We were unable to successful transform bacteria with primer product containing 50 bp of homologous sequence, this was expected based on the literature. A few of our selective plates showing  transformed with PCR product and digested thrC vector (plate A) are shown below. We got a single colony for B. subtilis transformed with PCR product using primer set 2 and 4 (215 bp and 125 bp of homology, respectively). It was surprising to see higher transformation efficiency using primer product 3 (190 bp of homologous sequence) compared to primer product 2 (215 bp of homologous sequence) since transformation efficiency is found to decrease with a reduction in homologous sequence.  We did not control the DNA concentration which could explain these results.  Furthermore, we used B. subtilis stock cells that were made competent using 1% xylose and stored in 10% glycerol. We are currently working on optimizing the Zhang protocol, we expect to see greater efficiency once we confirm  the best conditions for inducing competence.
Figure 3: B. subtilis was transformed with DNA containing various lengths of homologous sequence and was plated on selective spectinomycin plates. Plate A shows B. subtilis colonies transformed with digested thrC vector  (700, 1300 bp of homology). Plate B, C and D show B. subtilis transformed with PCR product 2,3 and 4 respectively (215 bp, 190 bp and 125 bp of homology).
Week 19: September 2 - 5
We continued to work on transformations but we were consistently unsuccessful.  After trying to transform cells that were made competent the day we transformed them, we turned to transform with glycerol stocks of competent cells that we had made earlier. Unfortunately, neither the fresh nor glycerol stock cells led to successful transformation.

Industry Description
Our product belongs to two industries: eduction and small-scale research. The biotechnology education market is steadily increasing as new discoveries come to light and equipment costs decrease.
Target Markets
We have identified three markets: Education, Citizen Science and Field Research.
Education: Our primary market is science education in UK secondary schools. When At present, schools are reported to have too little equipment for effective practical work and unable to offer a full range of practical lessons.
http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBAHoldings/PolicyAndInternationalRelations/ClientForums/Schools/Events/Archive/2004/DesigningFromInsideOut/AndyPiggott.pdf
2.     Better science laboratory facilities in schools should be a top priority http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2010/BetterLabs.asp
3.    The new facilities enable the pupils to gain a better understanding of the subject through more ‘hands on’ experience . Science departments receive £9.89 per pupil .
Citizen Science: Citizen scientists is a term used to described amateur or nonprofessional scientists that has gained popularity in recent years, including in research , science magazines and the maker community . As it is is difficult to estimate an accurate figure of molecular biology citizen scientists, we choose to approximate the size of a group by using the example of the DIYBio network. DIYBio presents a growing citizen science community of molecular biologists, biotechnologists and bioartists. Projects range from microbe mapping to yeast printing . DIY Science can be considered as an alternative approach to scientific experimentation . One common barrier is access to the technology, where cost and skills are both problems.
Field Research: A range of fields, from textile conservation to evolutionary biology, require the use of biotechnology, in particular PCR.
Market Analysis
As of January 2013 there are 3,281 state-funded secondary schools in the UK with approximately 3.2 million pupils. Schools submit yearly budgets on the July 31 .
As of October 2013, there are 42 groups declared worldwide and 3353 members on DIYbio Google group mailing list.

The palm oil industry is well-known for having a short payback period and is highly productive. If replaced by another sector, the new industries run the risk of being far less economical and efficient. Moreover, the palm oil industry is able to provide a better living for the workers by allowing the government to be able to provide basic facilities for the workers and the families in some properly planned plantations and mills.
Without the steady business for the countries that the palm oil industry provides, and without a real viable alternative to the wealth of income generated through this sector, it is probable that the unemployment figures will rise[10] and the living standard of the people who work in the palm oil industry might drop even lower. Therefore it is imperative to consider the implications of removing the palm oil industry completely from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia before introducing a synthetic alternative to this naturally-occurring product.

ULB-Brussels,2011,Team:ULB-Brussels#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html,".
To ensure a high quality of work, we build our project on three complementary and parallel axes: a first group called “wet lab” which manipulates and construct, a second called “modeling team” which works on characterization and third called “Human Practice Team” which will speak now.”
Another member of the ULB team took the word to explain the bioethics part of the project:
“We will structure our defence in two parts. In a first part, we worried about the antibiotic resistance that was inserted in the genome of our bacteria. For the anecdote, the bad reputation of GMO’s is due to the use of antibiotics resistant genes in corn BT176. After a few years of exploitation, it appeared that this sort of GMO could have a negative effect on human health and on earth. Some people who ate this corn were sick and cultivating it could contaminate the ground with the resistance to antibiotic (but it wasn’t proved). Since these days, people are frightened by this new way of cultivating that they associated as dangerous for themselves. The problem comes from the fact that no one ever told them that the danger comes from these antibiotics resistant genes and not from the organism itself. So today, we would like to reassure people about the fact that this gene can be removed from an organism. And that is how we want to defend our project, by removing this gene from our bacteria.
The second part of our bioethics project consists in collecting the public opinion about GMO. That is why we made a survey composed of three parts. The first consists of 16 items that measure the people’s acceptance and tolerance of GMO’s. The second part is an informative text about the advantages of GMO’s. The third part contains the same 16 items. Thanks to this questionnaire, we’ll observe the influence of positive oriented information about GMO on public opinion. After a statistic study of the results, if we measure an effect, we would like to create an information brochure, available everywhere, about the benefits that we can take from the research and the development of GMO’s.”
Reflexion following the debate:
After this presentation of both the projects, the professors (panel members) presented themselves and gave to the public their opinion about synthetic biology and bioethics. They also asked questions to the teams, in order to better understand notions which weren’t presented in a clear way during the projects’ presentations. They expressed critics which were very constructive. For instance, they talked about notions such as horizontal transfer, a notion which wasn’t, at that time, taken into account by the KULeuven team. That’s why our debate was"

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," how in some ways it is important to think about whether cell-free systems are seen as ‘legally living’ even if they are not considered living biologically. This is discussed in the cell free report linked below.
Safety and Ethics:
As with all synthetic biology research we had to consider any potential dual-usage research concerns. This links to the ‘FINK report’ which Dr Louise Bezuidenhout informed us about that mentions the 7 experiments of concern. This allowed us to clarify that our project did not include any of the experiments of concern as defined in the report.
With our device there are not many dual usage concerns. This is primarily because it is a cell-free technology and a diagnostic device. However its application could prove to have dangers for example in the data collection that would result from diagnosing many patients. Louise highlighted a very important consideration in thinking about what data will be collected and how it could be managed and used. Additional infrastructure and servers may be needed and this is an additional cost and management that the government or medical authorities would have to be consulted on. This is important because we would not want our technology to become problematic rather than useful due to bugs in the data management.
Conversely, there can also be ‘good dual use’, in that there is currently a lack of understanding on the transmission of chagas disease, and more data in this area could improve this and lead to more effective vector control efforts etc.
The diagnostic is not in itself dangerous but there may be issues in creating it in terms of containment. There are also concerns about disposal and so having our device cell free and with no needles involved allows the standard clinical waste procedures to be followed.
Political, Societal and Cultural Considerations:
In our meeting with InSIS we were advised on the practicalities and nuances of dealing with areas that are not so exposed to new scientific developments, as follows. In an ideal situation, we would want to educate and engage with all publics around the world; however, as a part of our policy and product marketing it is not necessarily a good idea to try to engage with local communities on synthetic biology as it could be more damaging than helpful. This is because there is a tendency to lump synthetic biology with GMOs which often have an associated fear factor. This would not be helpful for encouraging parents to get their child checked for Chagas; and while it is not information that should be hidden from people it is not something that needs to be actively pushed on them.
It would however be necessary to engage with other stakeholders, like governments, regulators and the entrepreneurial public on this. Towards this aim, we developed a policy"
Wageningen_UR,2013,Team:Wageningen UR#Masterclass_-_-_TEXT.html," the years
When scientific outreach is continued over the years (and therefore over different teams), it can be reflected upon, thus allowing for progression of the work, rather than starting all over again. In our case, we were able to use the outreach activities of one team as study material for a communication sciences project. And this project could subsequently be used as material for a workshop next year. Planning outreach activities with teams elsewhere in the world is difficult. However, your institute’s team of the previous years are usually still close by, and could be used as local expertise, and it thereby becomes a relay baton of scientific culture that is handed down from generation to generation.
Reflecting on the Science cafe
With the workshop fresh in mind, we organised a Science cafe, this would give us the opportunity to apply our new knowledge not only for the organisation itself, but also for an analysation afterwards. We invited three speakers with a different background to start up a discussion about synthetic biology. During the science cafe the three speakers presented themselves very differently. Prof. dr. Arnold Driessen presented himself as an expert on synthetic biology but he also wanted to show the usefulness of his research and synthetic biology, by showing examples of the research performed in his lab and by giving applications for that research. Dr. Dirk Stemerding presented himself as knowledgeable and as responsible, showing that he knew the needs, problems and arguments from both the public and the scientists. Pieter van Boheemen was part of the people, just a normal guy doing some experiments. His main goal was entertaining the public and he did so by telling personal stories and jokes. That Pieter van Boheemen was a man of the public was reflected during the aftermath of the discussion, when people kept approaching Pieter van Boheemen. His more personal approach did make him more accessible to the people. On the other hand it was our personal opinion that Pieter van Boheemen did not present himself as a professional, which may cause people to find him less credible then the “experts”. The key question therefore seems to be whether we as iGEM want to present ourselves as professionals and loose some of the connection with the public, or is our connection with the public more important than coming across as “experts”. Or is there a golden mean? As for the Science cafe the speakers formed a nice combination and where it started out as one-way communication it ended in a satisfying discussion where both the public and the speakers were able to speak out.

Characterization/expression
The promoters in the TetR-pTet constructs are supposed to be inhibited by TetR. By induction with doxycycline, the repressor is inhibited, and thus pTet will be active. In this case, GFP will be expressed  after induction with doxycycline. Source: Aagaard, L., et al.: A Facile Lentiviral Vector System for Ekspression of Doxycycline-Inducible dhRNAs: Knockdown of the Pre-miRNA Processing Enzyme Drosha. Molecular  Therapy, 2007. 15:5, p. 938-945. (Link)
To test if the Tet promoter could be fine-tuned using different concentrations of doxycycline, we ran FACS (Fuorescence-activated Cell Sorting) on E. coli expressing GFP controlled by pTet, regulated by TetR with  and without LVA tag. A wild-type was used as control.
Figure 1: Results of the FACS before and after induction with doxycycline.
Comparing only the strains expressing either variants of TetR, the results of the FACS illustrates that without induction with doxycycline, GFP is still expressed. Most likely because the promoter is leaky. Despite 100% of the cells being fluorescent in the absence of doxycycline one can see that the fluorescence intensity is markedly reduced in the constructs containing TetR repressor. There is a very little variation in expression of GFP upon induction with low concentration of doxycycline. At high concentration of doxycycline (2000 ng/mL) it can clearly be seen that TetR (+LVA) inhibits pTet at a weaker extent than TetR without LVA.
Although the FACS results indicates that the pTet inhibited by TetR with LVA tag is the most responsive upon induction by doxycycline, we argue that the effect seen is due to overexpressing of TetR repressor. The hypothesis is based on the poor median fluorescence compared to un-regulated pTet promoter, even at doxycycline concentrations inhibitory of cell growth. pSB1C3 being a high copy plasmid leads to a high number of repressors, thus a higher concentration of doxycycline in needed to induce the expression from pTet. The LVA tag destabilizes TetR thus lovering the number of TetR proteins. This could explain the better response from induction of"

I was lucky she was born on vacation. Considering my graduation, I had a lot of support from my colleagues and most teachers understood that I had to breastfeed her from time to time. The fact that I did a night course also helped. So I could easily breastfeed her and go to classes. My grades actually got better during my third year because my time was sacred. The only difficult was that some teachers did not understand I had to take care of a baby, but most of them understood I could not go to some classes. My daughter spent a lot of time at IFSC… I had a lot of help from my teachers and colleagues. The University’s support was very helpful, because I could leave her at the campus daycare.

So we had our prototype, but was it any good? In order to find that out, we contacted the iGEM team from Groningen (NL) and asked for their help. They agreed to test our methodology of 3D printing bacteria by using our Biolinker prototype and even took it one step further by using a different bacterial strain, B.Subtilis. They succeeded at using our prototype and our methodology was also compatible with their strain. You can find the extensive report of our collaboration here.
Characterization
1. Characterization of movement in xyz
Our printer is like a bike equipped with two different gear wheels to enable changes of the printing velocity. Using a camera, we recorded nine runs of the printhead along a ruler. Using this video data, the distance covered in time steps of 1.0 seconds was measured. The average distance covered in 11 seconds was 6.57 cm.
After changing the gear, the same experiment was conducted now at a lower tip velocity. Here, the average distance covered in 16 seconds amounted to 3.44 cm.
From these data, the velocity during each time interval was calculated and the velocity distribution was plotted in the following graph. The average velocity of the fast gear wheel was 0.6 cm/second.
For the slow gear wheel, we found an average velocity of 0.21 cm/second which is approximately ⅓ of the velocity achieved by the larger wheel. From the graph we can observe that the velocity is 0.2±0.1 cm/second.
While the fast gear wheel prints with a velocity distribution of roughly 0.6±0.2 cm/second, the slow gear wheel prints at roughly 0.2±0.1 cm/second. Thus, to cover a fixed distance of for instance 0.6 cm, both gear wheels print with the same precision: 0.6±0.2 cm. However, practical experience showed control of the printhead movement and ink flow rate fine tuning to be easier with the slow gear wheel.
In order to characterise the movement in the z-direction, a similar experiment was conducted: movement of the printer surface along a ruler was recorded with a video camera. Due to the reduced velocity in z-direction, intervals of 3 seconds were chosen this time. The experiment was repeated five times and the average distance covered is presented in the following graph:
The sigmoidal shape of distance covered by the stage is explained by the arm moving the stage being fixed to a wheel. When turning, the increase in z-direction is very little,"

The only VEGF-scFv in iGEM parts collection (BBa_K1694003) has no known structure, so we found ourselves another one with experimental structure (PDB ID: 2FJF & 2FJG, Figure 2) (BBa_K2886002). We then add a signal sequence to it as well as a transmembrane linker (BBa_K2886000) to help it appropriately locate on the cell membrane. In addition to that, we want to test another receptor, which is the binding domains of a natural VEGF receptor, the kinase insert domain receptor (KDR). We cloned the two IG-like domains of it (BBa_K2886003) to the extracellular domain to test its efficiency. By making use of fragment from endogenous receptors, we hope to achieve the goal to reduce the possible immunological rejection while keep the orthogonality of STEP system at the same time.
Figure 2. Crystal structure of VEGF Fab in complex with VEGF, PDB ID: 2FJG.
For D-Dimer, we were only able to find a MA-15C5 scFv of it. So we simply attach it to the TC and PC chains and test the whole system.
To see if the STEP system works and to optimise it, we have to fully test it in vivo. Considering the practicability, we decide to use human HEK293T and HeLa cell line as our chassis. These two cell lines have the advantage of handleability and effectiveness and with them we are able to carry out our experiments with ease and reliability.     The first thing we need to confirm is that our extracellular domain works, or more specifically, that the two chains can correctly locate on the cell membrane and that they can bind when target ligand is added. To that end we design a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) test. We remove the intracellular domains of both chains completely and instead attached the N- and C-terminal of a split ECFP (BBa_K2886004 & BBa_K2886005) respectively. It means that if the receptors are expressed on the membrane and can efficiently bind to the ligand, we’ll observe the fluorescent signal after induction. We took the ECFP from a previous part (BBa_E0020) and split it at the A155 site and use the addition of le"

William_and_Mary,2017,Team:William and Mary#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," about synthetic biology at a career fair for middle school students, and taught about 75 Girl Scouts about synthetic biology.
Working with our university community: We organized a Bioengineering Speaker Series to connect students and professors interested in synthetic biology research. We helped students in the Biology Club get started on synthetic biology research projects. We hosted legislators and others responsible for funding synthetic biology research in Virginia public universities in our lab. Going forward, we are creating a student organization for students who want to be part of our outreach efforts with the local school system.
Working with the scientific community: We presented our research and the field of synthetic biology at a local community lab. We also presented our research at a conference for women in the bioscience field.
Sustainable Impact
The most important part of our outreach this year has been a focus on creating a sustainable impact. Part of ensuring our projects were sustainable was making sure that teachers and stakeholders influenced the paths of our projects. By working to meet their needs, we helped establish a long-term connection that will continue past the length of the 2017 project. Our outreach efforts will continue in the following way:
We updated and distributed our synthetic biology activities booklets to teachers, and have posted it publicly on our wiki.
We have helped our teacher community partners get their students involved in a long-term synthetic biology research project organized by the Biology Club at William & Mary.
We created a searchable and user-friendly outreach database with past iGEM outreach projects that can be used to find a vast array of educational activities.
We are in the process of establishing a recognized student organization that will help build long-lasting infrastructure at our school for synthetic biology and STEM outreach.
Outreach Database
We aim to expand the infrastructure of sharing and building on past projects in the human practices aspect of iGEM. iGEM has already established such an infrastructure for the scientific research portion of teams’ work to ensure that scientific research is rigorously characterized, accessible, and centralized on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. We want to help bring some of these same concepts to the Human Practices aspect of iGEM - that is, a strong culture of documentation of activities and their outcomes, and a standard way of characterizing them to facilitate sharing of what has worked and what has presented challenges. We have created a comprehensive database that includes outreach projects done by gold-medal teams in the past two years. The approximately 1,500 entries are in a standardized format that makes it easy to assess and compare projects. Additionally, each entry contains descriptive tags, enabling users to search for specific project categories. We would like to help establish this database as a central part"

SCUT-China_A,2017,Team:SCUT-China A#Project Lysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"        We chose SRRz lysis gene to create our lysis module. The SRRz gene is from phage. It consists of three                     parts S, R, Rz.
         The product of S gene would cause lesions on the cytoplasmic membrane through which the product coded by the R gene escapes to the periplasm and causes murein-degrading, while the Rz gene’s product may be an endopeptidase that can cleave the oligopeptide crosslinks in the peptidoglycan                     and/or between peptidoglycan and the outer membrane. [6]
Method
Lysis experiment
1. Grow the cells on 5 mL LB medium+Chloramphenicol overnight at 37℃ and 220 rpm.
2. Take 4 mL cultures into 200 mL LB medium+Chloramphenicol in a conical flask.
3. Incubate the cultures at 37℃ and 220 rpm for about 1.5-2 hours.
4. Set the instrument to read OD600, measure OD600 of the cultures.
5. When the value of OD600 is about 0.6-0.8, divide the 200mL liquid into 12 cuvettes. Each cuvette                     contains 10 mL cultures.
6. Then add metal ion solution with these following concentration, each concentration has 2 replicates.
7. Incubate the cultures at 37℃ and 220 rpm.
8. Measure its OD600 at 0.5h ,1h, 1.5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h.
Result
Lysis gene expression
         We have developed the lysis module ( BBa_K2360000 ) and five metal detecting module for E. coli BL21.                     Combining the lysis module and detecting module, we have constructed five devices which can respond to                     different metal ions.
         Because the lysis gene will be expressed when the detecting module makes a                     response to the metal ions, which will make bacterial cleavage, resulting in the decrease of OD600, we                     measured the growth curve of our engineering bacteria in different concentration of metal ions to prove                     its function.
         As shown in the growth curves of E. coli with cadmium detecting device (figure                     1), the growth rate of E. coli BL21 is decline obviously after adding the concentration of Cd2+ from                     10-8M to 10-5M, indicating that this device can"

The promoters used in this study are shown in Table 12 and were cloned into this plasmid together with GFP as the reporter gene. This was done using Gibson assembly with 20 bp overlaps after cutting the vector with SacI and XbaI.
By using a replicative plasmid instead of chromosomal integration, a higher copy number can be achieved which will make sure that even weak promoters give a detectable signal, which will be compared against the signal from the TEF1 promoter.

Indeed, figure 18 lane 2 and 3 shows intense bands on position ~250bp and ~470bp respectively. This indicated the success of targeted integration by our fusion protein. Moreover, the absence of these bands and the stronger presence of other unspecific bands when sgRNA was omitted (figure 18, lane 4 and 5) or when Tn5 was used (figure 18 lane 10 and 11) confirmed that targeted integration is specific to sgRNA targeted fusion protein. Moreover, the absence of integration products on the other negative control (without fusion protein, adapter, or target DNA) on figure 18, lane 6-9, 12, and 13 confirmed this further.
Figure 18. 5% TBE native PAGE stained by EtBr and imaged by GelDoc system. A: Lane 1: DNA ladder (100-1000bp), lane 2: amplified product with fw EPO lane 3: amplified product with rv EPO, lane 4: amplified product with fw EPO without sgRNA, lane 5: amplified product with rv EPO without sgRNA, lane 6: amplified product with fw EPO without fusion protein, lane 7: amplified product with rv EPO without fusion protein, lane 8: amplified product with fw EPO without adapter DNA, lane 9: amplified product with rv EPO without adapter DNA, lane 10: amplified product with fw EPO with Tn5, lane 11: amplified product with rv EPO with Tn5, lane 12: amplified product with fw EPO without target DNA, lane 13: amplified product 2 without target DNA.
To confirm that these two bands represented the expected integration products, we isolated and sequence verified them. Figure 19 shows the sequence alignment between the two fragments and the target EPO gene. From the sequence alignment we can confirm that integration occured upstream the sgRNA binding site. The overlapping alignment between the two products  suggested that integration does not always occur at the exact base pair position (~10bp variation), which might be the result of the flexible linker between dxCas9 and Tn5.

Therefore, the team believes that it is important to explore the Human Practices with regard to public perception of such a system. We wanted to further understand what the public’s views are in Singapore, beyond the knee-jerk aversion, and how we would change their point of view to accept such a tool, which will potentially be a faster and an equally reliable indicator of cancer.
As laws regarding the use of such bacteria-based tools are not spelt out in detail, an official opinion about this has not been established. As such, we wanted to ask how participants would react to such a medical procedure, what their concerns would be and how we could potentially address those concerns.
We carefully crafted a questionnaire which tackled several aspects of introducing a new medical procedure. This survey was distributed online to various age groups in Singapore to assess and thoroughly investigate the public receptivity to bacterial cancer diagnosis and therapy. Questions were asked on how participants felt about such procedures in general, and they went on to identify their perceived safety level of this new tool. The most commonly listed medical risks were also extracted from the survey results.
The pilot survey, with 163 contributors, revealed that there was receptivity to the bacterial detection system, as opposed to our initial hypothesis and worries. This was promising in the continuation of the Human Practices, as it showed that there is a potential demand for the system. However, the questions also established that the public had concerns about its safety, and it became an issue we needed to tackle. We also carried out this survey in two other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and these surveys will be discussed after the following pages.
The two key points obtained from the survey administered in Singapore are as follows:
In the above figure, 93 out of 163 participants (57.1%) of people fall within the 4-to-5 range of receptiveness. This shows that the majority are potentially be receptive to the RIOT System as a commercial medical procedure. Unlike our initial fears, it appears the majority would not reject the system out-of-hand.
However, after analyzing the safety concerns of the respondents in this next figure, it is clear that the same participants do not deem the system to be a safe one, with only 33.1% of them falling in the 4-to-5 range.  It is clear that many of them continue to express reservations about safety.  Therefore, our team has identified the issue of safety to be the weaker link when implementing our system. We then integrated the above results to illustrate the connection between receptivity and perceived safety, if any was present. Figure 1"

Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

Human Practice
(1) We have been to three tobacco factories (Hefei Cigarette Factory, Zhangzhou Cigarette Factory and Wuhu Cigarette Factory) to research our project. We knew a lot about tobacco and tobacco waste, and we had a fresh understanding of pathway of producing the prodrug. (2) For the purpose of collecting the community’s views about tobacco and propagating iGEM synthetic biology, we designed a questionnaire and have collected hundreds of results. (3) In the “Science Open Weekend”, we opened the lab for thousands of people to visit. (4) We finished a lecture in the high school to publicize iGEM and synthetic biology knowledge. 5. We actively communicated with local high schools and gave them help of founding new iGEM high school teams. 6. We attended the Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference and Central China iGEM Consortium with iGEMers all over the world. 7. Communication and cooperation with some iGEM teams.

Integrated Human Practices
During the visit to the 3 tobacco factories, we have learnt a lot about tobacco industry. We considered to use pure nicotine or nicotine in environment to produce 3-succionylpyridine before, but after the visit, we decided to use tobacco waste as our raw material. Our human practices helped us a lot in our project, making our project more close to real industrial production, and we have designed our whole system based on our human practices.

Model Your Project
(1) Single-cell model is consisted of 22 nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We use Matlab solvers to simulate the change of species concentration along the time. Then we analyze the condition of initial steady state and nicotine sensing state with defined parameters. These results strongly prove the feasibility of our design. (2) We analyze the impact of different combinations of promoter strengths and copy numbers to the initial steady states and outputs with nicotine input. Our simulation results present the tendency of initial state change and the signal shifting. According to these phenomena, we can choose the appropriate promoter combinations and plasmid backbones for the realization of our design. (3) In simulation, we change the value of promoter strength and nicotine input. From the simulation results, we acquire the best time for sampling, signal measurement and product collection.

Notebook – Results – 4. CULTIVATION E.coli
Autoinduction reagents were added to the medium in each tube. We give certain treatments to the culture medium which are glucose, fructose, glucose + fructose, or honey. For glucose, fructose, and glucose + fructose treatments, the final concentration given for each tube are gradually increases from tube number 1 - 12.
Figure 1. Cultivation Results of E. coli DH5-alpha/Bba_J04450 with glucose treatments
As shown in figure 1, the medium showed the gradual color change from red to yellow. It proves the catabolite repression mechanism is work in our system. The addition of glucose  decrease the expression of mRFP gene, more high the amount of glucose presence in the medium more decrease the expression of mRFP gene.
Figure 2. Cultivation Results of E. coli DH5-alpha/Bba_J04450 with fructose treatments
As shown in figure 2, the medium showed the gradual color change from red to yellow. It proves that fructose and glucose exhibit a very similar trend in catabolite repression by repressing the expression of the mRFP gene. The similarity of the fructose and glucose induction patterns might be due to the fact that fructose and glucose both utilize that PTS, leading to low levels of cAMP (Chu et al, 2002).

We didn’t have much experience in it so it was challenging. We asked for advice from different people to design our leaflet and every member in our team took part in sending our leaflets. We were happy to see that many students were interested in the volunteer programme and we gave introductions and explanations with patient to let them have proper understanding to our programme. We also have our advertisement online to let more people know about it. It was nice to watch our plan come true step by step and we hope more students can take part in this good cause.
Future work
We will inform the students who are willing to attend the lecture given by Dr Xie and during the lecture we iGEMers will also share our experience as hospice volunteers. We hope this lecture will be able to let them have proper understanding of being a hospice volunteer. Then we will interview them and choose students who are suitable for the job to form our volunteering team.
After that we will give training to volunteers and organise them to visit the hospice department of the hospital twice a month. Before the visit we will spend time to ask the infomation of different patients. We hope the volunteers can bring joy and relief to the patients.
The end but not the end
We began with learning about tumour and lung cancer before we choose it as the theme of our iGEM project and now we extended it to hospice care which focuses on those patients who were hopeless to be cured. In the fight against disease, human being cannot always win. In this desperate fight with cancer,  people need care more than cure. The development of science and technology is aiming to do something good to human. What we have done is far from enough. There are still misunderstandings against hospice care because of our customs especially taboo about death. We want more people to understand hospice care then pay attention on it, join it and promote it. A tiny team with tens of undergraduates may not be able to make a big difference but if there are slight changes or improvement made by our effort, that’s all we are persuing for."

With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Our Petal Death Protein (PDP) part (BBa_K179200) was design to produce a modest amount of Oxalic acid. The PDP gene was obtained from Dianthus caryophyllus (Carnation) (Clove pink). PDP catalyzes the production of Oxalic acid from Oxaloacetate: Oxaloacetate + H2O = oxalic acid + acetate. The first 3 amino acids represent a propeptide and are not included in the PDP sequence. The PDP gene is under control of the constitutively active medium transcription promoter (J23107) and a strong RBS (B0034). This combination was chosen to allow us to tune the amount of oxalic acid produced through control of PDP production. Mutation of the transcription promoter to strong or weak activity will result in more or less PDP production and subsequent changes in oxalic acid production. The same principle can be applied to the RBS from strong to medium to weak. We tuned the oxalic acid production to achieve mite death at the lowest possible concentration while preventing any possible harm to bee health.

The Nuclease is from Staphylococcus aureus. This part is the same as BBa_K729004 (UCL 2012) with the addition of a C-terminal his-tag. The Nuclease is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of both DNA and RNA at the 5' position of the phosphodiester bond. The α-Dextranase gene is from Chaetomium gracile (Fungi). It performs hydrolysis of 1,6-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in dextran. This is"

Protocol
Weigh 35g of LB-Agar powder mix per litre of media desired. One litre makes 40-50 plates. Ensure that that the mixture volume does not exceed half of the volume of the flask/contained used, as it will boil over in the autoclave.
Dissolve LB-Agar, using water from one of the wall mounted Nanopure filters. Add a stir bar and use a magnetic stirrer to facilitate mixing.
Cover the flask with aluminum foil, and secure the foil with autoclave tape. The foil should be somewhat loose (to avoid building pressure in the flask while sterilizing and blowing the foil off), but not so loose that lots of liquid can escape.
Put the flask in a plastic autoclave tray, load into the autoclave, and sterilize using the 20 minute liquid program.
Once the autoclave finishes venting (which can take twice as long as the sterilization proper), check that the foil covering is still in place. If it is not, the media is contaminated! Unload using the insulated oven gloves.
Allow the media to cool until it can be handled without the oven mits. The cold room can be used to speed this up. Alternatively, if a large batch of media is prepared flasks may be kept hot in the prep lab water bath, to avoid all of them cooling at once. Agar polymerization cannot be reversed once it starts, but media can be kept from solidifying by keeping it hot.
Once media is cool, add other desired ingredients. Use"

Codon Optimization
The genetic code is a degenerate one; there are more 3-part combinations of nucleotides than there are amino acids. The topic of codon optimization-that is, the cell's preference for one codon sequence over another in translation-has been heavily researched in an effort to determine the optimal genetic sequences for an organism. This project looks at the effects of repeated amino acid sequences of varying lengths and codons and their effect on the cell.
Codon Optimization
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
Data Collection
A 6-repeated sequence of a single threonine codon was successfully ligated into the initial construct. The resulting fluorescence was measured using a TECAN machine. The results are displayed graphically below.
The figure above demonstrates the fluorescence of both mCherry and GFP when the ribosome translates four 6-repeat sequences of a single codon of threonine. mCherry levels fluctuate while GFP fluorescence remains the same. Further characterization with repeating sequences will provide more quantitative data, but preliminary testing suggests that with constant levels of GFP, the cell is able to send tRNA strands complementary to each threonine codon without disturbing GFP production. Thus, the codon sequence with the highest mCherry expression indicates the most preferred threonine codon.
Additional Testing
Several more repeated sequences of identical and non-identical single amino acid codons are intended for testing in this construct. To view the completed and prospective sequences , please visit our Parts page

Jilin_China,2016,Team:Jilin China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," also asked their advices on our project.
3.International Forum
Professor Yun Dai from Jilin University gave a lecture about precise targeted therapy and drug-resistance in hematologic malignancies. We consulted him about drug-resistance. He told us there are two kinds of drug-resistance: primary resistance and long-term resistance. He also used one repressor named HDAC as example. It has curative effect to treat neoplastic hematologic disorder, but it has unsatisfactory result to treat solid tumors. Although HDAC is effective in vitro, it still needs more experiments to be verified. He also mentioned that if we want to develop a real drug, we should consider safety tests, pharmacology researches and clinical trials as well.
3.International Forum
Professor Cheshi Chen from Kunming Institute Of Zoology, CAS, gave a lecture about the development of new animal models for breast cancers. He discussed four kinds of common animal models: spontaneous animal model, experimental animal model, implanted tumor model and PDX model. He also mentioned some alternative animal models of breast cancers in addition to these commonly used laboratory mice.
Assistant Professor Boyi Gan from the University of Texas MD discussed energy metabolism and sensing in cancer. We asked him some questions about current cancer therapies. He told us that although radiotherapy and chemotherapy have low targeting, these two therapies are still major treatments in clinic application. Some new methods, such as targeted therapy and immunization therapy, may demonstrate better targeting effects, but they still have many weaknesses. Targeted therapy is designed to treat patients with specific mutations, so the rates of mutation largely determine the efficacy of the treatment. Immunization therapy can educate patient’s own immune system to cure cancer, and it is now widely used in clinic. He suggested that our group should verify whether bifidobacterium could educate human immune system.
3.International Forum
Assistant Professor Xiangwei Wu from the University of Texas MD gave a lecture about early-disseminated tumor cells as a biomarker for colorectal cancer early detection. A specific feature of the apoptin used in our project is that it only enters into nucleus of solid tumors but stay in cytoplasm of normal cells. We consulted him whether the apoptin could be used as a biomarker as well. He said that we should first use nude mice to figure out whether MCF-7 cells can multiply in vivo by subcutaneous injection. Next, we should use CTC cellular immunostaining to figure whether the apoptin could work well.

pArs_mRFP (BBa_K1106003)
A promoter sensitive to the presence of the arsenite ion. It codes for mRFP to produce a red fluorescence when in presence of arsenite, working as a biosensor. This part is from Team: Buenos_Aires and was characterized in our lab as a collaboration between TecMonterrey and Buenos_Aires.
New parts we created
Hip-1 (BBa_K1166000)
Composed of the HIP-1 promoter with the FNR expression cassette upstream for a stronger hypoxic regulation, this promoter will start translation in coding sequences 3' downstream in a hypoxic environment.
His-TAT (BBa_K1166003)
A biobrick that includes the TAT signal peptide that can be fused to any protein for an easy internalization into mammal cells. It includes a 6x His-tag for easy purification.
TAT is a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) derived from the transactivator of transcription from HIV and has been used to internalize a range of large and small molecules from peptides, DNA and antibodies, to liposomes.
TRAIL (BBa_K1166004)
Contains the T7 expression cassette for the soluble part (aminoacids 98-281) of TRAIL with an N-terminal histidine tag (x6) to enhance its purification. It is known to cause apoptosis by binding a membrane receptor.
TAT-Apoptin (BBa_K1166005)
Codes for the T7 expression cassette for TAT-Apoptin composed of a N-terminal TAT translocation peptide, followed by a linker (GGGGS), a histidine tag (6x) and by the same linker fused to Apoptin. Apoptin is a protein from the Chicken Anemia Virus known to cause apoptosis in human cancer cell lines only using a pathway independent from P53 by a phosphorilation in the Threonine 108.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," but it is there. Now the people start to think what is next, what do we do now to fight malaria. Fosmidomycin can offer an alternative that already had successful clinical trials. We can work out a proper therapy, that works even when artemisinin does not. So, we also have practical approach, that simply helps. But you have an approach that is not just theoretical, sure you still have to figure some things out, what is normal for every company and every startup, but it is something you can grasp. My question is if we do not fund this project, what happens next? Then you just had a good idea and all around the world people have good ideas. But sometimes you have to follow up on your idea and develop it into a relevant application. That is something we could coach and help.
Oda (translated): That are some skills not everybody has.
[We talked about the patent and the possible financial support of our project with Mr. Oertel and Mr. Lindemann]
Dr. Hutchinson: It seem putting a commercial hat, although I am a clinician, this could have tremendous utility, if in fact it really is preferential, that mosquitoes prefer that trap over human skin. It could provide personal protection. They have been telling you about Deutsche Malaria Gesellschaft and what we are up to? Yes? And how possibly the two elements of all this, what you do and what we do, could possibly complement one another. He has been telling you that? I have to check up on him. [chuckle] He may not get it right and I do not know. Thank you.

He was a so called iGEM Ambassador working on the competition and he was from Brazil and we talked with him in Marburg at an iGEM meetup. But he did not have specific contacts connected to malaria. We talked about possible application not just in Africa, but also in South America. We always just hear about Zika virus coming up, but there are possible other applications of our trap.

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," point of view could be different.
Practician survey
Our first questions were asked to get to know our 51 practicians. Despite the fact that most of them were still students (Graph 1), there were also nurses and lifeguards in our population samples. Hence, the majority of them already have more than a year of experience with patients (Graph 2) and they regularly use band-aids (Graph 3).
Now, the most important questions were about our project. We explained to each of them what we were doing and why, then we asked two concise questions. The first one was about which benefit could be gained from antibiotic-functionalised cellulose in their dressings using Cerberus (Graph 4). They had to give a score from 1 (no benefit at all) to 10 (huge befits). Their evaluation was very positive for this application of Cerberus with 49 persons out of 51 thinking this will be an improvement. The second question was more global and about the interest of the Cerberus project for the society (Graph 5). Here again, the results clearly demonstrated a strong interest for the possibilities brought by Cerberus.
Patient survey
First, it was more difficult to interview patient than we had expected. For most of them, this was felt to be an intrusion in their privacy and they did not agree to be observed and questioned during treatment. Our population sample is therefore small (9 people) and conclusions should be considered with reservations. Another consequence is that our population was young (around 20 for most of them; Graph 1), likely because young people were most receptive to what we were investigating. In any case, this is another bias for this survey.
We enquired about their needs for dressings and their feelings about them. Most of them were suffering from a wound (Graph 2) and needed dressings for a week or two (Graph 3). Interestingly, the dressing is often perceived as a source of discomfort (Graph 4) and about half of them were worried about changing it (Graph 5). Clearly, this means that new solutions reducing treatment duration or frequency will be a relief for the patients.
We then explained our project and asked if they thought that Cerberus could help to improve the dressing treatment they needed. The results (Graph 6) clearly indicate that their appreciation of our product is positive. The last question was more general about how Cerberus and its many applications could be relevant for society. Again, the responses were still in a range from positive to very positive, however with less enthusiasm than for the first"

UVR8 - dTetR fusion: a UV sensing protein
Three different fusion strategies were carried out to verify the best UVR8 dTetR fusion [ link to the partsregistry ]. Tet DBD stands for TetR DNA binding domain.
1. Full length UVR8 without a linker
2. Full length UVR8 + [GGS]x2 linker (+6 aa)
3. Truncated UVR8 (-13 aa which are not seen in the 3D structure)
You can find the split TetR DNA binding domain containing a BamHI restriction site which allows it to be fused to any protein of interest containing the corresponding restriction site. This allows you to test if a protein of interest is able to dimerize.
p-ABA generator
We constructed one pab operon consisting of the pabA and pabB/C gene from Lactococcus lactis to overexpress p-ABA. Therefore we used the biobrick parts BBa_K137055 and BBa_S04039 as a template to construct the wished composites.
Biobrick K909016 will be used to show that p-ABA is produced, while the operon can be cloned downstream to any promoter.
Dual input promoters
In our case we want the decoder to have AND logics. Therefore we designed 3 different dual input promoters, all of them derived from the Lambda-phage promoters PR and PL:
1. Modified PR promoter with operator sites OR1,OR2 and LacO1

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota#Templates#home_-_-_TEXT.html," biochemical network of methylmercury conversion in E. coli and to determine the effects of changing methylmercury concentration on the conversion rate. A combination of enzyme kinetics and protein expression equations was in the model. The reactions below shows the four-step reaction network for the conversion of methylmercury to volatile mercury using the mer operon in E. coli. This network involves the transport of methylmercury into the cell, its subsequent conversion into ionic and volatile mercury, and the transport of volatile mercury to the extracellular space. This simplified network follows the proposed mechanism of the mer operon and it captures the primary steps of methylmercury breakdown in E. coli. Furthermore, a system of ordinary differential equations was used to model the biochemical reactions taken place at each step of the conversion process. The cofactors were not included in the equations because at sufficient concentrations, they do not significantly alter the rates.
Mathematical Modeling
The equations used in conversion steps 3 and 4 are extracted from studies done by Maria on ionic mercury uptake by E. coli
cells (Maria, 2010). These equations can be used because ionic mercury is converted into elemental mercury which in turn
diffuses into the extracellular space; these two steps were described in the Maria paper. It is assumed that methylmercury
and ionic mercury have similar orders of magnitude of transport rate into the cell.
Since step 2 is not explicitly included in the Maria paper, a different approach was used to determine the equation. During
our literature search, we did not find any primary publications that specify the methylmercury conversion behavior of both
MerA and MerB. Our pBBRBB plasmid is designed in the way that the mer genes are induced in the presence of methylmercury and
ionic mercury. Through our literature search, we were able to calculate the steady state concentrations of basal and induced
states based on the presence of methlymercury and ionic mercury in the cytosolic space. Therefore, we used the below
equation to extrapolate the reaction rates of both the mer proteins. For details, please see Supplemental Materials A.
The above equations show the reaction rates of the mer proteins under induced steady state. To represent the full MerA and
MerB expression, we include terms for the basal protein expression, the induction of the Mer proteins, and the degradation
of proteins. For details on the calculations, please refer to Supplemental Materials A. We have determined from our
calculations that Va and Vb resemble Vmax in the equations.

Policy And Practice
We took a number of approaches in considering the potential impacts of our project.  From the many potential applications of our switch, the main question we posed was regarding Biodesalination: Would the general public be comfortable with using our bacteria-desalinated water?  The following section describes a more factual and theoretical approach, but click here for more information on our public outreach events at the Glasgow Science Centre.
We've also submitted a piece of artwork for the special ""Best Supporting Artwork"" award.  This was a comic strip featuring our team mascot, Wilkins, which told the story of our project in a way that was colourful and simple to understand.  It can be found here .
Biodesalination
Biodesalination is becoming of increasing interest as availability of freshwater decreases around the world. Freshwater only consists of 2.5% of the worlds’ water with only < 1% percent available for use. Many countries around the globe rely on desalination for their freshwater. The need for a low energy desalination method becomes more apparent since 40% of the worlds’ population live areas that are dry or semi-dry and experience droughts.

However, current methods of desalination are energy intensive and therefore expensive. Two widely used methods for desalination are thermal and reverse osmosis. Thermal approaches involve evaporating salt water and then condensing it as purified freshwater whereas reverse osmosis approaches involve forcing the water through various membranes in order to remove the salt.
The cost to fill an Olympic swimming pool (2500m3) with desalinated water from seawater using a thermal approach by an average sized desalination plant can range from £1500 to £3100 and for a similar sized plant to do the same but by"

EDUCATION
7th Grade
Introduction to Synthetic Biology
Through interactive activities, our team introduced the basics of synthetic biology and common lab techniques to over 200 seventh graders. Using dyes, students learned how to use micropipettes and run gel electrophoresis. Using simulated DNA parts (promoters, open reading frames, etc.), students also learned to design plausible DNA constructs to solve theoretical scenarios. (Whole team activity)
Kindergarten
Principles of Observation
We introduced kindergarteners to science with four simple activities. In one activity, we taught them how to use a microscope to observe the intricate details on a 100 NTD bill. In another, we used balloons to introduce them to “invisible forces” such as static electricity and electrical charges. (Whole team activity)

In order to obtain the parameters, Monod growth model is linearized by inverting and factoring out umax  and we get the Lineweaver-Burk plot (Rorke & Kana, 2017 ).
Figure 10: Lineweaver-Burk plot of un-engineered KO11.
Furthermore, instead of just a point estimate of the fit, we wanted study the predictive posterior distribution of the model. By them we calculated the model fit for a                  randomly selected subset of the chain and calculate the predictive envelope of the model. The grey areas in the plot correspond to 50%, 90%, 95%, and 99% posterior regions                  with the data obtained from Olsson, Hagerdalt & Zacchi (1995) for un-engineered E.coli KO11.
Figure 11: Predictive envelopes of our model.
After determining the parameters, we used Monod equation with the fit data to demonstrate the cell growth.
Because our experiments were incomplete and we were not able to measure the change in substrate concentration, only the specific growth rate of our bacteria were calculated                  with the data obtained from our wet lab team: KO11, KO11 with FucO, KO11 with GSH, KO11 with GSH and FucO. They measured the change in cell concentration with OD600 in 10mM                  furfural. Then the change in the specific growth rate were compared in percent. The results were used to redesign the Monod model that are shown below.

Figure 15: Monod equation that is redesigned by our experimental data for E.coli KO11 with both GSH and FucO gene inserted.
Result
Insertion of FucO gene increased the cell growth rate by 10 %. Insertion GSH gene increased the cell growth rate by 18% percent. Insertion of GSH and FucO gene increased the growth rate by 120 %. Thus, the best improvement was observed with the dual expression of FucO and GSH gene and demonstrated by Monod equation.

Our hope is to design our device for point-source filtration, so attaching it to the end of a factory pipe filtering out heavy metal content before it enters the ecosystem. However, there are many other applications for our project.""
Environmental Water Samples
Instead of solely analyzing water samples from our area (Fall Creek in Ithaca, NY), we were curious to see how many other areas around the United States had traces of heavy metal contamination. Thus, we sent out a request for other iGEM teams to send us environmental water samples from their areas. We got responses from all across the nation, ranging from California, Utah, Michigan, Indiana, and Connecticut. In return, we analyzed their samples via ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectromy) and generated an individual water quality report for each team. Our goal was to develop a better understanding of heavy water contamination in drinking water in the United States, and the analyses returned a surprising variety of heavy metal concentrations in environmental water samples.
Risk Assessment
As engineers not only do we strive to design and create, we must ensure that whatever our product, it is safe for use, production, and marketing. In addition, we analyzed risk for community, the organism, the environment, and industries. In total, we conducted three different approaches to our risk assessment for Lead it Go. The first was developed by Cornell’s Environmental Health & Safety Department, pertaining specifically to work with recombinant organisms and the possible ramifications if they were to be released into the wild.  The next, CEA (Comprehensive Environmental Assessment) was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency as a general environmental risk assessment and modified by both the Woodrow Wilson Center and our team for use on our synthetic biology project. Finally, we strived to embody the design principles set forth by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, to implement synthetic biology for the betterment of humanity. Each approach has its limitations, but all of them have helped to inform our project design, research practices, and considerations for further development of our project.
Publications
In addition to doing outreach through our local paper (the Cornell Daily Sun), we collaborated with Elsevier Connect , an online publication platform that has over 70,000 unique viewers per month. We would like to thank Dr. Alison Bert very much for her support and guidance throughout the Elsevier Connect editorial process. Both pieces will be available in the coming month, and will be linked to on our social media pages.
