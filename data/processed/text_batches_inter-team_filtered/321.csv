Let the picked single colony grow in 2YT medium with the associated antibiotics for 12 - 18 hours in a 37°C incubator until OD600 0.6 - 0.8 is reached.
The single colony growth should be serially diluted and plated on plates with the appropriate antibiotics and either 100 mM glucose or 100 mM arabinose. Plates are grown for another 12 - 18 hours.
In parallel with the plate assay, a 50 ml starter culture for starting the PACE turbidostat should be inoculated using the pre-culture from *step 2*. Bacterial starter culture should grow to log-phase density (OD600 0.5 - 0.8).
If the plate assay shows a positive result by displaying delayed growth of the bacteria on the arabinose plate, the 50 ml starter culture can be used for inoculation of the turbidostat.

About Us
Team Queen's Canada 2016
The Queen’s iGEM team consists of fifteen undergraduate students from a variety of different disciplines. Common among all our team members is a passion for synthetic biology and an eagerness to learn more about it while contributing to advance the work done in this field. Having the advantage of being from diverse backgrounds, each of the members has uniquely contributed to our 2016 research project.
Dragos Chiriac
Dragos is in his fourth year of Life Sciences. He is proud to be this year’s official pancake chef and Co-Dictator. When he is not maintaining strict order within QGEM or flipping pancakes, he can be found trying to showcase a harmony between hip-hop and nature with his wardrobe. Viewing himself as the Drake of synthetic biology, this year Dragos hopes to drop the hottest drug of 2k16. In the future, Dragos plans to pursue a career in research.
Jia Tanwani
Jia will be starting her first year of Medicine in the fall at the University of Toronto. This is Jia’s second summer being involved with QGEM. She eagerly joined QGEM in 2015 to be part of a team that works to solve real-world problems and is currently one of the co-directors in addition to leading the Policy & Practices component of the 2016 project. When she’s not teaching synthetic biology courses or sending emails, Jia loves to go shopping and enjoys tagging her friends in Facebook memes. In the future, Jia plans to continue pursuing innovative research that fuses her interests in medicine and synthetic biology.
Danai Topouza
Danai is in her fourth year studying Biology and Computer Science. She saw QGEM as an opportunity to be an active part of an exciting research project, learn more about synthetic biology, and put her programming skills to work. Danai is planning to pursue graduate studies that combine her interests in genetics and computational biology. When not debugging, Danai enjoys spending time outdoors, trying out new restaurants, and watching horrible movies.

General Cre reporters
The design of our reporter cassette is very similar to other Cre reporters used in research: a single promotor is followed by to protein coding sequences, of which the first one flanked with loxp sites, whereby it can be removed from the DNA [Nagy 2000] .
Our reporter cassette contains a constitutive promotor (the ADH promotor, BBa_J63005 ), followed by a RFP gene and the ADH terminator ( BBa_E1010 and BBa_K392003 ) which are flanked by two loxp sites with the same orientation. Behind the second loxp site is the gene encoding for the luciferase (see Figure 1). This setup leads to expression of luciferase only after the Cre recombinase has cut out the RFP-tADH region.
Figure1: Processing of the Cre reporter cassette.
Our reporter is able to permanently save information, because the Cre induced switch to luciferase expression is irreversible. Without deactivation of the Cre recombinase this process will occur in every reporter within a given cell. In order to relate the luciferase signal of a population of biosensor memory cells, it is therefore necessary that the reporter is only activated within a fraction of the cells. This can be achieved by activating the Dronpa caged Cre construct only for a small amount of time, when taking the ‘snapshot’. This leads to a statistically determined reporter activation in some of the cells, because the concentration of of the Cre construct stands in relation to the activation state of the sensor.
On the one side the time frame that is necessary for activation of the reporter, in such a way that an intermediate number of cells is activated, has to be determined empirically for every combination of sensor and promotor, which can be time consuming. On the other hand all this work done to calibrate the CREllumination memory system can also be used in other beneficial ways.
If the interplay of sensor, promotor strength and Cre activation time are well characterised, any one of this factors can be controlled quite easily. For example assume a sensor measuring a very weak signal which can not easily be determined: using a longer activation time of CREllumination system, the strength of the luciferase readout can easily be amplified.
Introduction
The first step to establish a memory system was to characterise different promoters and check whether they were suitable to be used for expression of our construct.

5. Diet-mediated tumor chemoprevention and                     inflammation relief
Although the use of immunosuppressive agents can have a good effect, it also has certain side                     effects(eg. increasing the risk of lymphoma) [1]. In addition, we need to consider the high risk of                     colorectal cancer in patients with IBD in the design of the project [2]. Therefore, we hope to                     combine the cruciferous vegetable diet with the engineering bacteria that release myrosinase to                     chemically prevent tumors [3].
Myrosinase is present in cruciferous plants such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and Chinese cabbage.                     It can convert the precursor glucosinolates in cruciferous plants into sulforaphane, a well-known                     anticancer substance [4]. Sulforaphane is an activator of Nrf2, which induces Nrf2 activation and                     translocation into the nucleus, and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) to promote                     transcriptional activation of the phase II metabolic enzyme gene [5]. As a result, sulforaphane, on                     the one hand, can eliminate cancer cells by inducing phase II reaction; on the other hand, it can                     alleviate inflammation by inducing antioxidant enzymes (such as HO-1 and SOD) to resist oxidative                     stress.
In addition, cruciferous vegetables are metabolized in the body to produce ligands for aromatic                     hydrocarbon receptors, which activate the aromatic hydrocarbon receptors in intestinal epithelial                     cells and immune cells to relieve inflammation, improve intestinal epithelial barrier tightness and                     enhance the ability to inhibit tumors[6, 7]. Therefore, we call on everyone to eat more vegetables!
Figure 4. Diet-mediated tumor chemoprevention and inflammation relief.
In our project, we chose the myrosinase from horseradish because it exhibits high catalytic activity                     at physiological temperature and pH [3]. We fused the myrosinase and the secreted protein Yebf and                     used a constitutive promoter to activate expression of the fusion protein. In this way, we can get enough myrosinase in the intestinal environment to make the cruciferous vegetable diet play an                     effective chemical prevention of"

This is the stage we are at with our project. Most of the Easter vacation was spent finalising our project and the last few weeks have involved sorting our DNA sequences and playin around with SnapGene. Currently, we're making sure that our constructs comply with IDT DNA synthesis rules and double checking that everything is in the right place and right order to put into plasmids when the DNA arrives. After adding the final touches to our constructs, we should be ready to order by the end of next week.
THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION - IMPLICATIONS OF DNA AMPLIFICATION
Introduction
During our time in the lab, we have been getting to grips with several important biochemical techniques, one of which is the Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR. This is a technique which is used to amplify the DNA in a sample, copying it many times so that you end up with a quantity of DNA that can be used for other techniques and analysis. As I'm sure you can imagine, this is very helpful in the lab, but it also has many implications for the outside world.
What do you need?
DNA template: the template is essentially the thing you want to amplify. The reaction can't make new DNA by itself, but it can copy existing DNA to make more of it. You also need to know the base sequence either side of the section you want to copy because you need to design primers.
Primers: In addition to not being able to make new DNA, the reaction needs a small stretch of DNA to latch on to to start the copying process. These small stretches are called primers. They need to be designed so that they have a complementary sequence to the template, so that they can stick, and be extended according to the sequence of the template.
dNTPS: These are the building blocks of DNA. They are the individual nucleotide bases (A, T, C, and G) and are added sequentially onto the end of primer in order to extend it.
Enzyme: The enzyme is the thing which performs the reaction. Without it, the reaction would be unable to proceed at any appreciable rate. During our project, we’ve used two different enzymes for PCR: Q5 and Phusion. Due to the characteristics of each enzyme, you need to use different quantities of the other reaction mixture components. For example, the Q5 mix already contains dNTPs, but Phusion doesn’t. Enzymes may also have different optimum"

Dr. Martyn Dade-Robertson
The trajectory of my research and teaching to date has been underpinned by a conviction that architectural design theory and practice have a significant contribution to make to contexts beyond the built environment. I have also looked to move past technological speculation in areas such as digital technology and Synthetic Biology to develop and explore experimental prototypes, seeking to ground speculative discourse in practical reality. Through the development of core research programs in technology and scientific areas such as Synthetic Biology, my aim is to develop a rigorous intellectual engagement with new types of material systems and practices.  I have published more than 20 peer reviewed publications including the book The Architecture of Information (Routledge 2011) and received more than £400,000 in research income working on projects which span architectural design and digital technologies. My research group ArchaID is the basis form both my research and teaching and more information can be found here.  I am always keen to talk to promising prospective PhD students in areas of Architectural Design and Computation and Architecture and Synthetic Biology. I have a particular interest in design and emergence through computational and biological systems.

Photoinduction
Introduction
Photoreceptors are light-sensitive proteins, which are able to perform specific actions (e.g. act as kinases) upon light induction. They typically make use of photopigments (like flavin and bilin), which are structurally changed (photoisomerization) or reduced (photoreduction) as reaction to excitation by photons. Some photoreceptors can be activated and deactivated by light; others follow an exponential decay to a ground state after excitation. The rate constants for this reactions can be computed from the number of induction events, i.e. the number of photons causing such an event.
For E.colipse we needed to know the activation of various receptors (Lov-Tap, BLUF-EAL, Ccas1, Cph8, UVR-8) to predict the behaviour of our system. For each of these receptors we tested several light conditions and computed the effects of visible and UV-light. In particular we analysed the amount of UV radiation detected by the receptors.

Q5. Who is responsible for the safety of biology labs at your institution? What are the guidelines for laboratory biosafety?
Teng Fei who is is a professor at our college (College of Life Science and Health, Northeastern Universtiy). Here are some guidelines of laboratory safety regulations:
1. Every students should consciously abide by the laboratory disciplines and safeguard the order of the laboratory.
2. Must carefully prepare before experiments, familiar with the purpose of this experiment, principle, operation steps, Understand the significance of each operation steps and understand the use of instruments, otherwise you can't start the experiment.
3. Experim ental mesa should be clean and tidy, and instruments, medicines should be placed neatly. Common reagents should be covered tightly in place immediately after used up. Don't make the reagents, and drug sprinkled on experimental mesa. You are not be allowed to leave the laboratory untill you clean the mesa and ensure all the instruments are turned off.
4. Waste liquid will be poured into the water tank with water at the same time. Must use strong acid, strong alkali solution diluted by water. Waste paper and other solid waste can be throwed into a cylinder which can be dealt after experiment. Don't throw Into the sink or throw everywhere.
5. To achieve sterilization, open uv lamp for 30 to 60 minutes in sterile room space for 30 to 60 minutes.
6. Check the equipment, must be separately sterilized before moving in sterile room.
7. Dress white coats, sterile working clothes, gloves.
8. You have to sterilize your hands before the operation in aseptic environment .
9. Movements should be light and not too fast to avoid pollution. Move glasses softly in order to avoid damage.
10. Must operate in accordance with the relevant provisions of sterile operation.

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Human Practices#gifts for the world_-_-_TEXT.html," on this country-wide stage, sharing our work and faith with the public in our unique way.
The initiation of our idea came from our faith. Nowadays, the modern social division of labor is becoming more and more specified, as two main components of this large well-function machine, science and art, seems to get into more narrow paths. Many supported to look and work at them separately, due to their contrary traits of representing sensibility and sense. But we are determined to be the pioneers of the new land. We believed in the possibilities we could create through blending science and art. Then we found color. As a fundamental element of art and an important characterizing signal in science, we backtracked the history of how color take shape realistically, and how scientists and artists were correlated with color.
Aiming to collect videos which introduce scientific phenomenon to the public and encourage more creative work about science popularization, Institute of Physics Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing Association for Science and Technology and many other organizations held a “3 minutes for science” activity. We UCAS-China team presented our video “What is color”, which concerns the scientific knowledge of how colors are produced by pigments and how we human see this colorful world.
After our video was posted on the Internet, a total of 4001 people “like” it and we won          the first prize finally. We were acknowledged and encouraged by audience and competition judges, even were invited to attend an art and science forum held in Beijing on Nov 3rd. It was a meaningful attempt in science popularization, which was as important as scientific research itself.
Daily iGEM
How to bring science and art into people’s daily life and encourage everyone to dance with imagination and creativity? After Giant Jamboree and far more than iGEM competition, we are determined to have more people in our new ear of art-and-science combination! Maybe begin just beside your pillow, starting from your first sight of every day’s new world!
In Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference, we UCAS-China put forward the idea of making an iGEM calendar as a gift for the world, which was cordially supported by BNU-China. With shared enthusiasm in introducing iGEM and synthetic biology in an artistic way to people from every corner of the world, no matter which field they come from and how much they know about science and art, we collaborate to present a gift which could dip your daily life in scientific and artistic enjoyment! So, here came our Daily iGEM!  20+ items of knowledge point relating to synthetic biology, 20+ stories"

Copper Etching
The Effect of A. ferrooxidans
Maker Faire (Copyright © Andrew Cribb)
The Project
The Columbia-Cooper iGEM team is working with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans to create a light-controlled printed circuit board manufacturing process. This bacteria’s metabolism relies on its ability to oxidize iron; the iron can then be used to oxidize, and in turn solubilize, copper. By genetically altering the bacteria, we will install a light sensitive mechanism which will enable controlled copper etching, leaving a finished circuit board. Once a blank printed circuit board is placed in a thin layer of solid media, the bacteria will be applied onto the surface of the media and light of the appropriate wavelength will be focused on it in a desired pattern. The light sensitive mechanism in A. ferrooxidans will activate a self-destruct mechanism preventing copper etching in these locations. In the end, the circuit board will be ""etched"" by the bacteria everywhere that is not illuminated, leaving a desired pattern on the circuit board under the cells in the path of the light.

iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method.
Genetics
Our Genetics Team was responsible for designing and implementing a series of genes which would allow us to exert light based spatial control of apoptosis in E.coli, and eventually transition into A. ferrooxidans. This design includes the expression of a light sensor, which, when exposed"

UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#description_-_-_TEXT.html," for our project?
How can we implement a solution that is scalable and thoroughly designed?
Focusing on a broader scale, we decided to commercialize our solution and make it industrially suitable. To do this, we had to answer another set of questions:
What factors do we have to consider to make a bio-production platform?
What are the key regulatory obstacles that our team will have to overcome?
How can we implement our technology in a way that is scalable and cost-effective?
What are the driving costs for factor of production and how can we decrease them?
Focus 2: Leveraging a Xenobiotics Approach against Bacterial Contamination
ROBUST Method
In searching for novel bioprocessing technology, our team came across a method developed by the Stephanopoulos Lab at MIT, known as ROBUST. Here, engineering microbial consortia to express complex biosynthetic pathways for efficient production of valuable compounds occurs; the team modified organisms to utilize unconventional nitrogen and phosphorus sources, thus conferring a competitive advantage to the host organisms. This is the process of using xenobiotics, or substances that are not naturally occurring in an organism.
Our team decided to implement the ROBUST method and apply it to unconventional carbon sources, deciding to modify cyanobacteria to uptake a selected carbon source so that it would gain a metabolically competitive advantage over any potential contaminants.
Carbon Source Selection
A key component of the protocol was to determine a carbon source that was rare enough that most pathogens would not be able to metabolize it. After discussion with a Virginia startup that focuses on synthesis of unconventional carbon sources, we decided that tagatose would be the ideal carbon source because it had value as a standalone product and as an intermediate for our ultimate goal, which was to produce biochemical substances of value such as medicine or biofuels.
Focus 3: Engineering microbes to produce tagatose
Constructing a metabolic map of tagatose production
Because organisms do not naturally synthesize tagatose, we had to construct the metabolic pathway for this reaction to occur. We used a number of sources, including documentation from Kegg Pathways and Brenda in order to determine how we could use naturally present sucrose and convert that into tagatose.
Ensuring environmental safety
After discussions with several professors and industry experts, we also realized that we needed to find some method of containment in case the microbes were mistakenly released into the environment. Therefore, we decided to implement two steps: (1) We wanted to use a salt-induced promoter because this could function as a potential on-off switch, and (2) We introduced a flag tag that would turn off"

Explore how we tested our COMBs experimentally
Clickable Outer Membrane Biosensors - Design
We have developed Clickable Outer Membrane Biosensors as a universal membrane sensor platform for biosensors. Our dream is that any chassis may be functionalized with COMBs. This chassis should then be able to detect virtually any biomarker and translate detection of this biomarker into any desired response. To obtain such a system, it is of the utmost importance that the system is inherently modular. The modularity of our system is reached through rational choices for the recognition element, the scaffold and the signaling components for our COMBs.
The recognition elements - Aptamers
Molecular recognition is central to biosensing [1] . The moieties responsible for molecular recognition are better known as recognition elements. Recognition elements frequently used in biosensors are aptamers. These aptamers are small oligonucleotides which fold spontaneously into intricate three-dimensional structures. These structures fit perfectly into a wide range of disease markers, with affinities reaching into the low nanomolar range. Through modifications, these aptamers can be attached post-translationally to our proteins, resulting in a truly modular membrane sensor platform. Read more on aptamers:
Aptamers are folded oligo- nucleotides (orange) which perfectly fit into biomarkers (purple).

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.
Additionally, the “group favorite” and “starRating” fields are also     important for individual evaluation of the parts, which doesn’t get     the deserved attention from the iGEM groups. “Group Favorite” defines     the confidence on the part by the designer group. “StarRating” defines     the related part in terms of popularity and usage efficiency among the     groups. According to our observations, most groups are not aware of     either of the fields or they are used incorrectly or ineffectively.     For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and expected results the StarRating should be at least     2 stars, but for most of the parts in 2010 distribution, it is very     difficult to observe a part whose “StarRating” is above one. For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”

Groningen,2009,Team:Groningen#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," Try to avoid this, try going directly to protein.
Model degradation? (How?)
Model interaction of relevant substances. This requires reaction formulas for all the substances with (known) reaction rates, as well as information on how the substance diffuses (unless it is assumed the model is ""well-mixed"").
Link to the world outside the cell and macroscopic effects, like cell density. Note the medium is usually well-known.
Create a kind of mind map of the processes involved to show how the model could be refined.
Formulate what aspects of the modelling results are essential. So, for example that some concentration rises as a result of the presence of a substance, or that the bacteria actually float. (Can we use mathematical topology as a criterium?)
This can be done using one of the following methods:
One ordinary differential equation per substance involved, reflecting the different reaction formulas and rates.
If the spatial distribution of substances needs to be taken into account partial differential equations can be used. This is probably not necessary when talking about large numbers of bacteria.
Stochastic modelling can be used if needed (if we deal with very low concentrations for example).
Questions:
What exactly is the role of a kinetic law in modelling a reaction?
A kinetic law is usually a generic equation describing the rate of a certain class of reactions in terms of the reactant concentrations and some constants. (For example the Michaelis-Menten equation .)
Purpose of Modelling
Descriptive, it can help describe the system.
As verification of the design.
Predictive, it can help predict results to aid in selecting physical parameters. (How many copies of a gene? What concentrations? etc.)
As tool in designing tests. What tests will give the best discrimination, etc.
Literature
See our literature list for a full overview of all literature. For our team members that are looking for books on the subject, have a look under code 605B (Bernoulliborg library, lower floor), as well as 605C/D/E (A and Z also exist but seem to be less interesting) and 610A (and possibly 625, 715).

From Figure 4 (bottom) it can be seen that a small peak forms just after 2.90 minutes but this is not significant.
From this preliminary experiment we conclude that the next step is to find the optimum conditions for growth and induction based on both the amount and concentration of butyric acid/sodium acetate used and to use mass spectrometry to correlate the exact mass of butyryl-CoA from the BUK/PTB pathway to the butyryl-CoA standard. We would also need to check each of the individual genes in the pathway to check that they are functional and also determine if the pathway is being blocked at any intermediate step.

The idea is to introduce a pathogen or predator, in some cases also a competitor for some resource, of the snails to be reduced. In the ideal case this will lead to the local extinction of the vector, however if the species supposed to reduce the vector is not chosen carefully it can become too wide spread, out-compete other species as well, or generally damage the ecosystem if too successful. There is always the risk of accidentally introducing an invasive species if this type of approach is taken. Furthermore the number of vectors is most likely to only be reduced, so the risk of infection would remain.

4. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe.
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
No risk of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety araised in our KIT-Kyoto iGEM 2013 project. All our lab work was performed following the guidelines of the safety standards required by biosafety level 1 and the guidelines established by Japanese goverment and our institute.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
No. We developed the parts using genes derived from S. cerevisiae under the control of T7 promoter. Since S. cerevisiae is a quite harmless and edible microorganism, our materials are harmless.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No. Our genetically modified E.coli is not pathogenic for humans and the expression of introduced genes can not be induced without IPTG.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
No. Our parts do not contain any gene sequences that cause potential danger and disservice.
5. If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? (Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a-d of the previous question.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
We plan to develop a genetically modified E.coli with the ability to produce ""fragrance"". If our parts were widely abused, our environmental odor and smell might be changed dramatically and people might be suffered from it.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks? (For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis, etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iG"

At high concentrations of Sodium nitrite, the OD values showed a sharp decline, which can again be attributed to high concentrations of nitrite (>2mM) being toxic to the cells.
6. Nessler’s test (LB growth)- Cultures of our clones were grown anaerobically in 5ml of luria broth, along with standard DH5α cells, used as control. These were then subcultured into 50 ml cultures, also grown anaerobically, with different concentrations of Sodium Nitrite. After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and nessler’s reagent was added to a 1ml aliquot. Nessler’s reagent forms a reddish brown precipitate on reacting with ammonia, and is extremely sensitive. This culture was then centrifuged at maximum speed (13,400 rpm) for 10 minutes, and the media was decanted and dried out, leaving only the red ammonia pellet. This was then weighed against DH5α culture (given the same treatment), using the DH5α treated sample as blank (mass of ammonia pellet taken = 0). This experiment was also successful, showing trends as expected. At high nitrite concentrations, the pellet size reduced drastically (the reason being toxicity at high nitrite concentration).

In fact, before our arrival, we thought to work together on a project of human practice, addressing lectures related to iGEM and synthetic biology to high school students in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum, as a continuation and expansion of our HP project Sowing Tomorrow's Synthetic Biologists . We provided event planning and contacted with the person in charge of museum, ZJU designed and printed the post and tried to contact with teachers of several high schools in Hangzhou. However, due to summer holidays, it was difficult to call together high school students. Unfortunately, in the end we had to give up this collaboration. However, we still motivated members of ZJU iGEM to continue propagating Synthetic Biology to high school students in Hangzhou.

Visiting Team OUC-China
Our exchange of ideas with ZJU was very helpful to us, and we thought it would be a good idea to organize another outreach communication. From July 28th to 30th, the other team members went to Qingdao and had an in-depth discussion with Team OUC-China regarding our projects and human practice ideas.

In another well, have the same circuit with a different promoter, to show that transcription factors are sequence-specific. Provide a cool explanation of what is happening. Alternatively, we could flow in IPTG, or whatever. The cool thing is, we're using microfluidics to illustrate the mechanisms of DNA transcription. It's educating people about genetics, synthetic biology, and microfluidics. Getting the player to flow in dNTPs, ribosomes, and stuff will illustrate live the importance of every component.
Software
All the components to the software part exist, the challenging part will be to glue them toge ther in a stable and secure way.
As Sebastian pointed out, the video stream and user input can remain completely separate. With this in mind, here's a tentative outline of the system: a cheap PC receives video from the USB microscope (webcam) and controls the actuators through an FTDI USB interface (serial communication through a USB port). The PC also runs a web server, to stream live video and receive commands from players. Players remotely control the game through a browser-based interface.
Video
The video stream can initially be setup using Ustream, who provide an embeddable player to stream live from a webcam. We can later figure out how to pipe a different stream to Ustream, to add our image processing layer in between. In later refinement, we can replace Ustream by our own streaming server, if judged necessary.
The image processing layer could probably be written using the Python Imaging Library, or one of the (probably many) augmented reality libraries for python.
Game
Controlling the solenoids from the PCs can be done from python. The PySerial module makes setting up of serial communication simple. The problem will be to make it stable, detect dropped sockets, etc. Activating a valve will be as simple as sending the corresponding stream to the microcontroller via the serial socket. The microcontroller looks after activating the desired valve.
Next, that python program must be hooked up to a server, that can be controlled from a standard web-browser. Therefore, the simplest option would be to run Apache with mod_python (or lighttpd or Nginx or whatever is the most fashionable webserver nowadays). mod_python loads a python program when it is initialised, and feeds it GET or POST requests from connected http clients. This will make it straightforward to link GET requests to corresponding valves: for example, if client requests http://www.example.com/valve_open/3 , Apache will pass onto the python script"

Procedure: Degrading the July 14 Biofilms
The biofilms created on July 14 grew successfully. The solutions used to degrade the biofilms were Mr. Clean, Lysol, Fantistik, Tilex, and GreenWorks cleaner. Water was used as a control. 3200 μL of solution was added to each well and Petri dish. 30 mins after the solutions were added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing July 14 Biofilms
To reculture the biofilms from yesterday, 200 μL of LB media was added to one well for each Petri dish that had been degraded with cleaner. The media was moved around the rim to where the biofilm had formed. Then the media was pipette back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
This process was repeated for each of the cleaners and the control listed above in the procedure for degradation of the biofilms.
The Petri dishes were left to air out on a sheet of paper towel.
Procedure: Creating Biofilms.
Biofilms were made in 5 35x10 mm Petri dishes by putting 14.85 mL of LB media, 15 μL of KAN, and 150 μL of RFP into a 15 mL falcon tube. 3 mL of this solution was then pipetted into each Petri dish.
These were left in the 37 ˚C incubator for 24 hours so that they could grow.

Results of the Reculturing of July 14 Biofilms
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Anileen Pageni and Kieran McCormack
From the overnight cultures of the July 14 biofilms, the ones recultured after the use of water and Tilex were red confirming we had recultured the two cultures. The one recultured from GreenWorks was also successful. Although not very red, it had an orange tinge indicating the presence of RFP. The Lysol reculture was more yellow in culture colour but might have been successful. The same results as previous for Fantastik showed no culture growth.

""If it is not documented, it doesn’t exist."" - Louis Fried
Obviously, Louis Fried was wrong - and luckily so, we might add! But it is true that if it is not documented, we don't know whether it exist. So please, click through the tabs below and catch a quick glimpse of our most treasured moments of the summer. We kept a calender of special events since the start of the project. And if you have the yearning (particularly after reading our Results), open up our thorough protocols below.

Lastly, in the protocol we developed there is a step in which the farmer gets external help to purify RNA and measure its concentration. It would, of course, be ideal if the farmer would be able to perform these steps himself. This would require some extra training for the farmer and an improved centrifuge. Also, a way to detect the purity of the RNA has to be developed without having to use expensive equipment. We envision this to be a really cool future iGEM project!
Comparison with other potential solutions
A different solution to this problem, is that the antibiotics test that is currently performed by a diagnostics lab, is performed by the farmer himself. This, however, means that the farmer still has a waiting time of at least 12 hours and that he/she would have to receive special training to be able to handle micro organisms. Comparing this to our solution, we see that we offer a more rapid test that, for the most part, can be performed by the farmer him/herself and does not require an ML-1 environment at the farm.
To what extent does our solution solve the problem?
Two major challenges are identified considering the development of a diagnostic tool. There is low commercial attractiveness as diagnostic tools are not reimbursed in our current healthcare system, which means that they will have to be paid for by farmers or doctors themselves. Also, the use of rapid diagnostics limits the amount of antibiotics used. Therefore, the commercial interests of pharmaceutical companies is low ( van Mierlo 2016 ). Concluding, the commercialization of diagnostic tools is challenging.
A perfect new diagnostic tool would answer the following questions ( O’Neill Commission ):
Is the infection causing the illness bacterial or viral?
If it is a bacterial infection, what type of bacteria is causing the infection?
Are the bacteria causing the infection carry resistance genes against the prescribed drug?
Are the bacteria causing the infection susceptible to the prescribed drug?
In addition, our application focuses on the detection of resistance genes. However, in order to solve the resistance problem, future diagnostic tools should shed light on other questions, as mentioned above. Our versatile RNA-based detection tool can also be applied to answer many other questions (also see our Entrepeneurship page ).
Impact on society
The demand for rapid detection tools to help decision making on antibiotic treatment is not only valuable in the veterinary field, but also relevant in the rapid diagnosis of the well-known MRSA (Meth"

Also decided to miniprep more of the plasmid that was used for the ligations.  This includes pRS306, Z0279 (which had been chosen by mistake), Z0842 (which requires another scheme for ligation into pRS306), and Z0507 (which we might need should the current ligation into pRS306 fail).
However, decided against doing this tonight because the only available LB + Amp media appeared to have chunks of some white cloudiness.  Does not appear to be contamination, but will leave it out on the table overnight to make sure.  (Also, it did not make sense to add antibiotic to the remaining 50 mL of plain and clear LB because of the small mass of antibiotic required (0.5 mg).

Public Engagement
Introduction
Our team recognized the need to extend our project beyond the lab and involve the members of our community. Through a number of diverse activities ranging from presentations at city hall, to a fun filled information night for parents and teachers, we spread information about synthetic biology, and the issues found in ink production. Overall, the engagement activities helped inform the public of iGEM and our project.
City Council
Members of our team decided to present our synthetic ink project to city council members to inform them of all the benefits that iGEM has to offer. During the presentation, members of city council expressed their interest in mostly the marketability of our project, and where it would lead us in the future. They gave us great recommendations for how to move forward with the project and expressed interest in helping us out. For instance, contact information for other large ink companies were shared with the team in order for us to gain more knowledge on the ink industry. Councillors also expressed confidence in our project by showing their support.
City Hall Public Forum
Following the presentation at city hall, a public forum was also conducted where members of city hall, and citizens could ask questions about our project. It also allowed us to inform them about iGEM and synthetic biology. Through this, we gained the attention of the local media. Global News Lethbridge interviewed a member of our team. This was a great opportunity to spread the word on our project and iGEM. The visit to city hall was quite rewarding, and very beneficial to the development of our project, as we learned citizens’ opinions on our project.
Shine on Festival
As part of the University of Lethbridge's ""Shine on Festival"" Homecoming Event, our team secured a tent to spread more information about our project and iGEM to the community. Members spoke with a variety of people including professors, university students, and children. We were even able to persuade a few high school students to join the team next year! As well, through advertising our Gofundme page, the event posed a way for our team to gain funds for our project. Promoting the synthetic biology community and the involvement of"

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,", A beta-oxidation was digested with XhoI and HindIII, and C beta-oxidation colony 4 was digested with SalI and KpnI. The digested samples were run on a 1% LMP gel together with undigested PhaC as a control. Two bands were observed on the gel.
Because the results from the digestions were not conclusive, we made more overnight cultures of A beta-oxidation colony 1 and PhaC colony 2, and C beta-oxidation colony 4 for plasmid miniprep and digestion confirmation experiments. The digested samples were run on 1% LMP. The bands seemed very smeared for the lanes with loaded DNA. We searched online for reasons why the bands appeared this way. We concluded that the DNA may have been degraded due to the continuous freeze-thaw that the samples went through. We decided to modify our experiments so that plasmid miniprep and digestion confirmation happen on the same day so that the DNA is kept in good shape.
We decided to run another digestion confirmation this time alongside undigested ligated insert+vectors and undigested pET29b as controls. No bands were observed for many of the samples.We decided to make 2 sets of overnight cultures of the PhaC-pET29b colony 2, A beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 5, and C beta-oxidation-pET29b colony 4, and B beta-oxidation colony 5. The A beta-oxidation part was successfully transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). This allowed us to begin preliminary experiments to test if our bacteria are capable of PHB production while we carried on ligation experiments. We discussed some experimental conditions for our tests.
Week 18 (AUG 28 - AUG 31)
We labelled the tubes with numbers seen in the table. The plasmids were isolated from these plasmids and samples from the isolated plasmids were digested with different enzymes. Some samples were left undigested.

Preparative Work
We obtained pSB_LIC (part K155000 ) by round-the-world PCR amplification from pSB1A2 , using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase.
↓
The linear PCR product was then blunt-end ligated to yield the circular plasmid submitted as part K155000 .
Problem
NB. Our intent was to use pSB1A7 , but the sample from the registry supposed to contain it, didn't.
Intended Usage
We used a complete GFP sequence for a proof of principle of our method.  We also attempted to create an xylE BioBrick for the University of Lethbridge team .

Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," collected from the plate reader experiments showed a slight difference in optimal pH for the pH sensitive promoter asr. As can be seen in Fig 4A and 4B the maximal fluorescence observed from GFP fluorescence per unit of absorbance over time was at a pH range of 8 which is significantly higher than what we were expecting from the results observed in Fig 3. This may have been due to the cell growth time. For PgadA we observed a coherent trend of optimal promoter function around pH5/pH6 as can be seen in Fig 4A and 4B.
Figure 4: 96 well plate reader experiments. Full time frame showing trends in GFP per unit of absorbance over 20h. The two pH sensitive promoters cloned with downstreamgfp were transformed into MG1655 E. coli cells, 5 ml of these cells were incubated for 16h at 37oC. After 16h, 200 ul of the overnight cultures were introduced into 1.8ml of MOPS pH adjusted LB for the respective pH values.  200 ul of each pH-cell buffered LB was transferred into each well. A negative control containing no cells and a negative control containing non-buffered fresh LB were also transferred in 200ul samples into the plate. Data represents the mean value of 3 repeat samples for each construct. Fig 4A - shows GFP fluorescence for PgadA-gfp and Fig 4B - shows GFP fluroescence for Pasr-gfp
Figure 5: 96 well plate reader experiments. 16h time snap-shot out of the total 20h which can be seen in Fig 4. 16h was the average time of overnight cultures thus this would have been enough time for the cell growth to stabilize and adapt to the conditions.

Bile Salts Sensing Device
Introduction
Bacteria that live in the intestine must be able to withstand the antimicrobial properties of bile salts1. Two mechanisms that bacteria have developed to withstand bile salts are modified membrane structures and efflux pumps to transport bile out of the cell1.
This part of the construct consists of biobrick BBa_K318514 which consists of the acrRA operon containing a RamA binding site, acrR and acrA genes.
S. enterica has multiple efflux pumps, including AcrAB. The transcription of proteins required to make this pump can be induced with the help of a transcription"

Overview
In designing the E. coding system, composite parts BBa_K2761009, BBa_K2761010, and BBa_K2761011 were built based on the work of Núñez et al. and Farzadfard et al. They include new basic parts for the iGEM Registry, as well as some improved parts from previous fellow iGEM Teams. Each new basic part is included and described separately from the corresponding new composite part which are used for the E. coding system.

Public & political engagement: round table - european parliament
September 28th 2018
During this event we were especially proud to gather a public of scientific and non-scientific public. We were delighted to see non-science students being interested in the life-science project that we presented and interact with all                 of our guests. We organised a networking drink right after the event to foster those interconnections. It was a great opportunity to exchange ideas!
During our European Event, Biotech4Change ( http://biotechforchange.eu ) we aimed at having a global impact, not only on general public but also on politicians, entrepreneurs and field workers.
For more info check our Human Practice page: https://2018.igem.org/Team:UCLouvain/Human_Practices
We put together an exceptional panel of experts and with the help of Ann Van Gysel, Life-Science journalist and CEO of Turnstone ( http://www.turnstone.be ), communication agency based in Gand,                 Belgium, we developed a roadmad aiming at finding the main bottlenecks in “Antimicrobial resistance, Biotechnologies and European Legislation”
We have decided to organize this event in order to have an impact as young students on both European politics and general public. We wanted to show and to prove that you do not have to be part of a big international company, be aged                 or be a university professor, etc. to have an impact on European Legislation.
Our panel was composed of KEY REGULATORS at the European Commission level, Young and successful biotech entrepreneurs, academics and researchers:
Arjon Van Hengel, DG Research and Innovation, Health Directorate, European Commission.                     This Commission department is responsible for EU policy on research, science and innovation, with a view to help create growth and jobs and tackle our biggest societal challenges.                     His presence allowed us to bring the issue to a EUROPEAN LEVEL. Arjon Van Hengel is one of the most influential people in this field and being in contact with him will help us give more visibility to our topic"

iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania
Aalto-Helsinki took part in a Vilnius-Lithuania team organized 3-day Biohackathon Lab Issues, which took place in Vilnius University Life Sciences Center in August 2018. This has been a great opportunity to meet other iGEM teams, scientists and the broader community and all together to work towards the same goal- help scientists solve problems they face in their labs every day.
Our Biohackathon team.
Collaboration overview:
Work towards a common goal: Improving the Lab Work. The topic of the biohackathon has made ourselves to step back and look at the issues we encounter daily in our work, think about the future developments and what improvements could be done. This has been a moment where we could apply our iGEM lab work experience for the common good of the scientific community, apply the learnings for the new developments making the lab more efficient, precise, and meeting the current needs.
Live the iGEM experience. This has been rather a unique opportunity to visit the hosting Vilnius-Lithuania team, it’s home university, workspaces and spend the time together. Also, other than the hosting team we met a couple of other teams (from Lund and Groningen). This has been a great chance to learn about each other’s projects, progress, issues encountered and help each other by sharing the knowledge, experience, contacts and establishing collaboration opportunities.
iGEM involvement in the local community. BioHackathon was hosted by Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team. Participants were both iGEM teams and the local community members interested in the topic. In our hackathon team, we were happy to have us join a non-iGEM’er, who brought us some fresh perspective and extra programming skills which were very needed at that moment.
Learning environment The BioHackathon gave us a chance for us not only to learn from each other but also from the experts. We have been mentored by the experts from the different fields and had a chance to hear the lectures given by a Scientist Urtė Neniškytė, Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius and an Entrepreneur Evaldas Pabrėža who have shared their insights gained through years of experience.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"

Unlike atom economy, which evaluates the theoretical waste of raw materials expected to be generated in a chemical process, the E factor shows the amount of waste produced in practice during the process, considering every piece matter involved in a chemical reaction, as well as yield, reagents, solvent losses, all process aids and energy. Water is not typically included in E factor calculations in order to prevent skewing, and give results that act as a better metric for comparison [4].

Based on the information in table 5, and knowledge of fermentation, we can conclude that biotechnologically based processes are the more environmentally friendly when compared to chemical synthesis. A shift in production of L-DOPA toward biotechnological solutions would help achieve the target set at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) for chemical synthesis to stop methods leading to adverse effects on human health and the environment by 2020 [5]. E factor is a relatively new metric that considers the economic value of eliminating waste and avoiding the use of toxic/hazardous chemicals as opposed to a purely yield based analysis, moving in the right direction for creating a more sustainable chemical industry for the future.
Table 5 Summarising the E factors of L-DOPA synthesis methods[1]
Methyl Bromide and safety/environment
Another important factor in deciding on an industrial process are health and safety, both of employees, the general public and the subsequent cost to treat harmful by-products. As mentioned above in table 5, all the chemical syntheses processes produce methyl bromide (MeBr): a volatile organic neurotoxin regulated by the US Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act with permissible exposure of only 20 ppm. Common warnings concerning exposure include: Acute toxicity (oral, dermal, inhalation), respiratory sensitization, germ cell mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and multiple organ toxicity, toxic to aquatic life, lethal.
Table 6 Amount of MeBr produced in L-DOPA synthesis
MeBr gas (boiling point 4C˚) can be treated by either pyrolysis or scrubber decomposition. Thermal decomposition (pyrolysis) is the primary method for dealing with volatile organic compounds, in the case of MeBr, however, hydrobromic acid and other harmful decomposition byproducts are formed depending on temperature, time of exposure and gas mixture components. The other treatment option is scrubber decomposition, in which MeBr"

Internal Slow Start
Compared with some other similar type DC switching power supply converting chip, TPS5430 has a better performance in high conversion efficiency.
Fig 1: In the condition of 12V input voltage and 5V output voltage, the relational graph between conversion efficiency and output current can be seen as follow.
(2) Inner structure and function
① Oscillate or frequency
Regular 500kHz slew rate makes it produce a more accurate in the same requirement of output ripple output inductance.
② Reference voltage
Through scaling temperature to stabilize the energy band gap, the reference voltage system can produce an accurate reference signal. After testing, in the proper temperature, when the 1.221V voltage output, it can keep the balance of energy band gap and mu-circuit.
③ ENA and Slow Start
When ENA voltage exceeds the peak value, the converter and the slow start inside will begin working. And when it is lower than the peak value, the converter and the slow start inside will stop working. When the ENA foot landing or the voltage is lower than 0.5V, the converter will stop working. ENA foot can hang in the air.
④UVLO

- To register the strain an information sheet needs to be filled in and submitted to Jaqueline
- Strains should be frozen from overnight culture in 30% glycerine (e.g. 600ul liquid culture + 900ul Glycerine (from 50% stock solution))
2.) Labwork:
Cellulase:
pJET_cellulase transformation and restriction worked fine in TOP10 and was then transformed into BL21 cells. Restriction showed a fragment of the correct     size, however sequencing failed. Activity plates showed no activity so far, but will be incubated over a longer period of time and in addition singularised     to avoid contamination of other colonies.
Scaffoldin:
Trafo in Top10 and BL21 did not work, which is why the TOPO cloning may be problematic.
- A control with an empty vector should be run.
- If the annealing is successful the bands should change in a reaction, which can be verified to exclude those issues.
- In addition Primers should be designed from within the sequence to verify the ends of the scaffoldin. Primers should be around 18bp long and 200bp within     the construct, which also has TOPO overlaps
- In addition the scaffoldin band of the PCR could be correct, but with an impurity alongside -> transformation should however still work to some extent     (second problem?)
- For the covalent binding stick to the protocol an do not reduce salt concentrations
- For electroporation the TOPO cloning mixture needs to be desalinated with microdialysis, otherwise the trafo won't work
Recommendation: Check salts, positive control, annealing conditions and sequencing after PCR purification.
RFP:
Sequences are 100%match, but colonies show no fluorescence. Therefore, restricted RFP sequences will be ligated into pBAD in order to verify its function     in the target plasmid.
GFP sequences for Primer design and corresponding plasmids/colonies can be acquired from Jaqueline.

As the main goal of our project is to create a yogurt enriched with β-carotene, we set out to transform this biobrick (Figure 2) into yogurt bacteria.  We chose Streptococcus Thermophilus, a common lactic acid bacteria found in traditional yogurt. We decided against other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus due to S. thermophilus being 1 of 2 bacteria species required to be in yogurt [10] , as well as its ease of transformation due to Natural Competency . S. thermophilus already contains the crtE gene and so can synthesize geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (Figure 1).  We decided to keep crtE in our previously assembled biobrick as it would increase the concentration of initial GGPP in the pathway, rather than completely hijacking the supply of GGPP in S. thermophilus, which could lack efficiency and be toxic.
To simplify this process, we decided to use a known shuttle vector pMG36ET to transform both E. coli as well as S. thermophilus. This allowed us to assemble and clone our genes in E. coli and directly transform S. thermophilus for testing.
Figure 3.  Production of β-carotene in Top10 E. coli.  Our biobrick, lacking a promoter (Figure 2) was transformed into Top10 E. coli cells.  After transformation, these cultures were centrifuged to form a pellet. Pellets made up of cells containing our biobrick (A-C) had a distinctive orange colour which could be attributed to β-carotene production. To compare any colour differences between pellets more easily, untransformed Top10 E. coli was used as a comparison (D).
Gene order
It has been shown in the past that specific orders of the three genes at the end of the lycopene biosynthetic pathway can negatively affect growth of E. coli at both 30°C and 37°C [11] . To prevent this, we assembled our biobrick as crtEBIY (figure 2), which optimized production from the biosynthetic pathway and ensured that there would be little to no effect on growth [11] .

For all the obtained structures, the RMSD was under 10Å, which is the threshold between good and bad results, considering the flexibility of the single-strand nucleic acid molecules.
We are currently not able to predict G-quadruplexes or pseudoknots in the sequences, but we tried with some atom pair constraints to force them in the structures:
Fig. Thrombin aptamer, without and with constraints.
Fig. Scores without (blue) and with (orange) forced constraints for pseudoknots and G-quadruplexes.
A Student’s test with a threshold of 5% to compare the two groups’ means of RMSD returns a p-value of 0.02, meaning that forcing the constraints is a treatment that gives significantly different (better) RMSDs than not forcing them.
Fig. Human telomerase RNA without & with forced constraints
Fig. Scores without (blue) and with (orange) forced constraints for pseudoknots and G-quadruplexes. (Student’s p-value = 1.12 10-6).
As shown in the two examples above, forcing bases pairing did not change the potential energy of the predicted molecule (no modification of its stability), but enabled the improvement of the models, with results closer to the reality.

As a conclusion, our method is relevant and gives good results.

Results
The structures computed by our tool look similar to PDB structures obtained by X-ray crystallography.
The shape of the molecule is very important, because the given structures are used for docking simulations with the aptamer’s target.
This is this procedure that helped us obtain the 3 PDB structures of the 3 aptamers against HBsAg[9].

We got a lot done today. Casey sent us a lot of new art over the weekend, so we incorporated that into our design. Now the plasmids are color-coded based on their outputs. We also made the bacteria on Mars cluster around the resources they are using. We fixed the duplication bug we were having, and added a glowing outline to the changing status bars.

6/1/2015: Day 1
Today was the first day and I feel so overwhelmed (in the best way) and excited to be introduced to all of these new CS softwares and applications of CS in education.  We began with a lab orientation, and then split off into our teams to begin brainstorming and training.
The iGEM team (Rachel, Sam, and I) started by researching iGEM medal requirements and gaining a deeper understanding of the iGEM competition.  We had already done some prior research about the iGEM competition and previous Wellesley iGEM teams’ projects, but getting familiar with iGEM requirements made me begin to more fully grasp the great effort and time that would be put into these projects- but also made me all the more excited to be pursuing them.
We downloaded the software that we would be using (Cornerstone SDK) and spent the rest of the day exploring the provided examples and examining the different ways we could interact with the Widgets.  I feel very excited and optimistic about the upcoming work.
6/2/2015: Day 2
Today we began work on our own example application!  We created our own basic “Hello World”-level app that featured rectangles, which upon tapping specific ones, would duplicate below where your finger touched the screen.  We started playing around with the shapes, and changed the rectangles to circles.  The signature for creating circles seemed to be very simple and similar to drawing rectangles, but by examining the different parameters that each method took in, we became introduced to new concepts such as Nimble Vector2fs.  As of now, we are trying to restrict the Widgets to the screen and prevent them from accidentally being pushed offscreen and becoming inaccessible.
6/3/2015: Day 3
After changing the Widget shapes to circles, we ultimately changed our main Widget shape to be an ellipse.  This choice made us start to consider other ways that we"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," our project, we wanted to integrate the use of tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) which are able to maintain the functionality of other proteins upon desiccation. This fitted perfectly in our design with respect to our end-users, as our TDPs enable the transportation and storage of our detection tool at room temperature. Normally, protein function can be maintained when stored at -80 degrees celsius, something that is not always available at your local dairy farm! We also envisioned that this improved storage method will be advantageous for shipping our versatile RNA-detection tool for broader applications. For further information on our TDPs, check out our TDP design page .
Adding to the storability, we realised that our tool needed to give a readout visible to the naked eye. At a farm, there are no fancy lasers or microscopes, so we had to get creative! We started by designing a microfluidics paper chip with GMOs with a kill switch to detect resistance genes, but gained crucial feedback on this.
Even if GMO kill switches were reliable, there is no public acceptance to use GMOs in the environment. If it will be accepted in the future, it will take years from now to legislate this principle. Innovation based on this gets stuck.
Cecile van der Vlugt (Risk Assessor GMO)
This led us to come up with a new application: CINDY-Seq. This method allows for a simple yes or no answer to the question: is the pathogen causing mastitis in my cow resistant to penicillins, or even all β-lactamases depending on the design of Cas13a, in a matter of hours, without the use of GMOs in the environment. For more information on how CINDY-Seq works, please visit our coacervation design page .
Now that we completed the design of our detection tool, we needed to look at how we could make the sample preparation as simple as possible for a farmer, as farmers like to do most things themselves.
We try to do most things by ourselves to prevent high bills from the veterinarian.

In the case of mastitis, the pathogen is present in the milk of the infected cow. By hitting the books and optimising existing protocols, we came up with an easy method to prepare a fresh milk sample for the detection tool. To know more about which methods we came up with, look at our sample prep design page where we describe this extensively.

Composite part Plan A:
For L. rhamnosus
This is the same “Plan A” for E. coli but adapted to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, since it is a natural probiotic organism. Plan A which consists of producing the soluble form gp130 attached to novel signal peptides for secretion to the media, this proteins will form a dimer with gp80 found in the gut, which will then attach to IL-6 and form a stable trimer capable of blocking interleukin inflammatory signalization. The construct is codon optimized for L. rhamnosus GG, it has promoters, RBS and terminators that have been used before for L. rhamnosus. It also contains two restriction sites, between the iGEM prefix and suffix, to ligate the Lactobacillus ORI site.
Soluble forms of both receptor IL-6 subunits are present in human blood, in general, soluble receptors for several cytokines have been detected in different body fluids, these are believed to help modulate cytokine response by binding the ligand and thereby reducing its bioavailability. Since the combination of soluble gp130 and gp80 can act as an antagonist vs the cells with membrane-bound receptor (IL-6R) [1] , the Plan A strategy was developed as a first approach towards developing our psychobiotic.
The system is first regulated by a spaCBA promoter, which allows the expression of the nsrR repressor protein (of PyeaR promoter) and then the cassette regulates the expression of gp80 and gp130 with the PyeaR promoter, after it senses nitrosative stress. Reporter fluorescent proteins iLOV and M-Cherry will help corroborate expression of both systems. iLOV will be attached to the Pbad-nsrR system and M-Cherry to the PyeaR-gp80-gp130 system. Both glycoproteins (gp) have a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to themselves for purification.

This supports the decision of letting him work at home, for now there is no need of cooperation between the two of us. For now I studied nDynamics per request of Cesar in case the quantitative modelling will be focused on spatial problems, and then moved on for the modelling of β-lactamase, a request from Rai with newly found papers on its kinetics.
I also took some time doing readings on Fogler's book Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering. This is because my prior study of enzyme kinetics was still confusing, mostly because the Cornish-Brown (2012) book was not presented in the way consistent with my chemical engineering background. Fogler's book, especially Chapter 7, bridged the gap.
Week 17: August 19 - August 23
Meeting with Cesar resulted in the topic of the quantitative modelling being set to the interaction & interaction of TALE and DNA. During the meeting Justin reported his progress on his last movie, which he completed using key-frame. To this Cesar pushed us try harder with nDynamics and Justin responded by that he needs at least a week to study the techniques properly. At the same meeting Iain asked us to start writing our progress report and filling in the wiki.
While Justin practised at home, I was working on the quantitative model. I adopted the approach of Markov chain by modelling 2D TALE-DNA binding on the strip, with discrete time and space. Since TALE is immobilized to the strip, with each time increment the DNA moves according to the movement rule specified by me, and when certain conditions are met it can either be bind to TALE permanently or can exit the strip. The difficulty was to translate those rules to the transition matrix, whose n-th power gives us the probability of state transition after n-th time increment, which we can obtain the probability of DNA capture. This model essentially hides unnecessarily fine details such as how TALE binds to DNA, and focus on the efficiency of DNA biding directly. The probability of DNA capture obtained from the model can be tested against empirical data such that certain parameters (i.e. the rules) can be modified to better describe reality.
So far a model with hard-coded constants was constructed as a proof of concept. The revision of the code with functions were partially done but was not tested for all combinations of TALE and DNA. So far the model has only considered 1 TALE and 1 DNA strand. The movement rule is a type of Brownian motion, with no TALE-DNA dissociation, with no noise or false"

Initial email to Mathews
Hi Dr. Mathews,
My name is Amrita Goyal, and I am a member of the Harvard iGEM team. We are looking for the cDNA for the PhyB, PhyA, or PIF3 components of the light-activated signalling system in plants. We were wondering if you had these genes available in a suitable vector that we could obtain. Our goal is to subclone these genes into a yeast-two-hybrid system. We would really appreciate it if you had a sample available that one of our teammates could pick up.
Also, if you have an extraction protocol for phycocyanobilin, or know someone who does, we would also appreciate that information. Thank you so much!
Sincerely,
Amrita Goyal and the Harvard iGEM team
Mathew’s Response to me
Hi Amrita,
Sorry for the delay in responding -- I've been doing jury duty.
We can help with a PHYA cDNA clone, in either pUC 18 or a bluescript vector.  We don't have PHYB or PIF clones, or an Arabidopsis cDNA library.  But depending on your timeframe, I could help with PHYB and PIF clones.
For a phycocyanobilin extraction protocol, I recommend you get in touch with someone in Clark Lagarias' lab (cc'd on this message).  Their web page is at:  http://www.mcb.ucdavis.edu/faculty-labs/lagarias/
We may have some phytochromobilin, but we have no phycocyanobilin.
Let me know when you'd like to pick up some PHYA clone, and I'd love to hear a bit more about your experiments.
Cheers,
Sarah

Kyoto,2018,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," salt tolerance. The budding yeast itself also has a mechanism for exporting Na+ out of the cell.  It is also known that budding yeasts, in which Na+-exporting genes have been destroyed and the mechanism are failed, are very sensitive to the high salt concentration in the medium, suggesting that these genes contribute to salt-tolerance of budding yeast. Hence, we assume that if these mechanisms can be combined, it is possible to develope a ""biological desalination"" device that stores Na+ in the vacuoles of budding yeast and lowers the salt concentration of the environment.
We further investigated and noticed that team Aachen 2017, tried to create a similar budding yeast. We contacted the team Aachen and heard a detailed story. Here we proposed a question to ourselves. Can we combine genes of salt-tolerant plants and genes of salt-resistant and build a desalination system which team Aachen did not develop? We started to create budding yeast by expressing various genes and set ""creating the device that minimizes the salt concentration of medium in the test tube"" as the primary goal.
3)  Aggregation system for increasing the efficiency of recollection and biosafety
As mentioned above, we initially aimed to create a yeast that removes salt in ""test tubes"" in order to promote the usage of the biosensor, which detects trace elements contained in test samples such as blood and waste liquid, without being inhibited their function by salt in solution. However, from the activities in Human Practice, we have found a new goal that this system can also be used to solve the social problems such as a salt damage. In order to use our device in the real environment, we have to incorporate a mechanism that prevents genetically modified yeast from diffusing into the environment. For this purpose, we tried introducing an aggregation system to collect yeast efficiently after lowering the salt concentration in the environment.
4) Calculating the amount of yeast necessary to lower the concentration through mathematical modeling
The advantage of a salt removal system is that you can easily control the amount and combination of components because they are artificially defined. You can use different factors depending on the situations, such as a difference in initial salt concentration of an extracellular fluid, a difference in target salt concentration, a difference in time required for salt concentration manipulation, a difference in a required amount of yeast etc. In order to enable this flexible application, it is necessary that our system is sufficiently understood, and mathematical modeling is properly done. By using the results of this modeling it is possible to estimate the optimalamount of yeast input when using our device."

Cornell,2014,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,". It is also true that neither plasmid nor chromosomal DNA would be able to escape the fiber reactor, so engineered DNA would never have contact with the environment in the first place.
Impact:
This year Cornell iGEM surveyed a variety of people to get a better understanding of the general public’s opinion about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and the bioethics of the various applications. Not only did we create a survey and get hundreds of responses to pool data from, but we also did a general social networking project called Humans & SynBio. Similar to Humans of New York, Humans & SynBio features individual interviews urging people to think deeper about synthetic biology and uncovering their various opinions about it. Interestingly, we discovered that many people are unclear about the definition and purpose of synthetic biology. In addition, we noticed general hesitence towards acceptance of synthetic biology within food and animal products, but acceptance and curiosity about integrating synthetic biology in human life quality improvement. In our case, an overwhelming number of people thought that our project was an ethical use of synthetic biology. Albeit, it is important to consider the limitations of our survey, which are discussed later on.
So how do people’s opinions about synthetic biology affect the risk assessment of our project? Well, consider this: a project that people know very little about will generate fear. In our study, we found that a lot of people find genetically modified organisms to be a “risky” topic, but if we explained to them our project in more detail, they were more willing to accept it. Thus, there is a need for a broader education about synthetic biology to the public and a need for transparent communication between scientists and the community.
Economic Analysis
Bioethics
We designed our project in accordance with the ethical principles identified by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (2010). Our primary motive is public beneficence: to improve global environmental and public health by remediating metal contamination in water. We have also demonstrated responsible stewardship by considering the environmental implications of our project. The ecological impact of placing our genetically modified strain in water would be minimal because our filtration system will not allow bacteria to escape, and we have structured our future directions around risk management for the future. In addition, our project is an intellectually responsible pursuit: it cannot foreseeably be used to cause people harm. In the spirit of democratic deliberation, we launched our Humans & SynBio campaign, to get people thinking and talking about the ethics of synthetic biology. Our proposed system would be easy, cost-effective, and potentially usable on a global scale. Additionally"
NUS_Singapore,2016,Team:NUS Singapore#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". The dynamics of the inner model are governed purely by diffusion-reaction dynamics:
where c is a vector containing all the concentrations of the N substances in the bacteria and Ri (c) is a function that returns the rate of change of ci due to interactions between the substances. As the use of a cylindrical bacteria and subdividing rings imply, this system is solved within cylindrical coordinates. 2 Note that it is assumed that the concentration fields and interactions with the cylinder are independent of the cylindrical azimuthal coordinate. The two models are coupled via diffusion across the walls of the inner model. Effectively, we considered the concentration difference within the cylinder and outside the cylinder, and permitted free diffusion. The discretization of Fick’s first law of diffusion was done assuming that the distance between the outermost rings of the cylinder and the outer environment is the interval between each ring within the cylinder. Subsequent inner model diffusion-reaction dynamics then propagate the resulting changes at the edge of the cylinder inward. 3
1Strictly speaking, the model operates on the volume integral form of the diffusion-advection equation. The presence of divergence operators on both terms on the right of the diffusion-advection equation converts the volume integral into surface integrals (divergence theorem), which are easier to handle. Furthermore, the integral form ensures the conservation of substances and number of bacteria in the absence of other influences. 2The rate of change due to diffusion in the inner model is computed using the integral form of the diffusion equation. Apart from the ease of handling and the conservation of substances under diffusion, this formulation also sidesteps the problem of computing the Laplacian of the concentration field at places where the radial coordinate is zero. The Laplacian involves a reciprocal of the radial coordinate, which will blow up when the coordinate approaches zero. The integral form, however, does not involve that reciprocal, preventing the occurrence of that asymptotic explosion. 3Strictly speaking, the user is free to substitute the diffusion across membrane with their own transfer processes. This is easily controlled from the “user_parameters.c” file.

Introduction
The idea behind the work of the transcriptomics group is to try and detect any changes in gene expression when E. coli is grown alongside strongyles as opposed to just being grown in a normal lab environment. The aim for this undertaking is to find any and all genes which might be expressed exclusively in proximity to the worms - giving us a prime opportunity to work some biotech magic and find a way to make a diagnostics tool that would allow the bacteria to detect strongyle parasites by using this bacteria gene.
The way we decided to approach this was by running a full-scale transcriptome sequencing on the entire E. coli genome, both in bacteria grown normally and grown alongside the worms. By doing this, we would be able to quantitatively determine the differences in gene expression and pick out the expressions that are different.
For this, we created an eight-step pipeline starting from lysing the bacteria to extracting their RNA contents, to refining, and finally sequencing the genetic material using Oxford Nanopore’s MinION device - which you plug in to your laptop. That same laptop will then be used to understand what exactly is going on in the bacteria.
Figure 1: Flowchart with all steps of the transcriptomics outline.
1. Worm Culturing and Lysis of Bacteria
E. coli cells are cultured in minimal media (M9), exposed to the nematodes and lysed. A special reagent (RNAProtect, QIAGEN) is used to assure RNA is preserved during the process. It is important that the cells are harvested during their log phase, which ensures the maximum yield of information since genetic expression is at its highest.

2. Total RNA Purification
The RNA is extracted using QIAGEN’s RNeasy Kit. Two cultures are purified in sufficient amounts to allow duplicates - one worm group and one control group. The RNA is quality checked and then stored.

Copper
There are some possibilities for the contamination of drinking water with copper, for the production of pipes, valves and fittings copper is used (Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, Fourth Edition). Copper is an essential trace element for humans, animals and plants, but an overdose can lead to anemia, liver and brain damages (US EPA ORD NCEA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) 2014). Additionally, high input of copper is associated with aging diseases as Atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease (Brewer 2012). These damages can finally cause death. The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 2 mg/L in drinking water (Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, Fourth Edition).
in vivo
Our sensor for copper detection consists of CueR a MerR like activator and the copper specific promoter copAP. The promoter is regulated by CueR, which binds Cu 2+ ions. We also used a sfGFP downstream the promoter for detection through a fluorescence signal.
For our copper sensor we used the native operator of cooper homeostasis from E.coli K12. We constructed a part ( BBa_K1758324 ) using the basic genetic structur shown in our biosensors .The operator sequence, which includes the promoter (copAP),  is regulated by the activator CueR. In BBa_K1758324 we combined a codon optimized version of cueR ( BBa_K1758320 ) under the control of a constitutive promoter with sfGFP under the control of the corresponding promoter copAP ( BBa_K1758321 )(figure 2).

Summary
When fresh food display in a supermarket, it is necessary to detect if bacteria contaminate food or not. But it is hard to design an economical mechanism that can count the population of invading bacteria at real time and control the time of storage. To overcome this problem, our team design a genetic circuit in in E. coli that has counter and timer functions. The engineered E.coli works as a referee that can report us the situation of food using fluorescent proteins with different colors. Green fluorescent light means the referee system is turn on and environment is safe; yellow fluorescent light means the system lose freshness; and red fluorescent light indicates the storage time is up or has bacteria contamination, the environment become dangerous!
We used LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system in bacteria to design the bio-counter that can report the population of invading bacteria. Quorum sensing is a bacterial communication system that allows bacteria to sense their population density through the diffusion of a chemical signal, the concentration of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL). As the bacteria grow, the concentration of AHL increases and diffuses within the media. When the concentration of AHL reaches a threshold level, it binds the N-terminal domain of a LuxR protein. Then the LuxR/AHL complex binds the lux box within the luxPR promoter to activate transcription of the downstream red fluorescent protein (RFP).  Because the concentration of luxI protein determine how fast the AHL be produced, the counter sensitivity can be controlled by the expression level of luxI protein, that is determined by the strength of TetR repressible promoter. If external bacteria invade the system, the extra AHL produced by them will induce the RFP translation to warn us the contamination.
The second function of bacterial referee is a controllable bio-timer. The concentration of lactose control how long the timer work. When added lactose is consumed by E. coli, the RFP start to translate and green fluorescent protein (GFP) is degraded. Therefore, the media turn from green color to yellow color (mixed color of green and red light), yellow color to red color step by step. The red color in the final step warns us that time’s up and the product"
SCU-China,2018,Team:SCU-China#attribution_-_-_TEXT.html,". It was our great honor to invite professor Yang Zhang to address several talks related to plant synthetic biology. Laboratory safety was also be emphasized. Considering the short time of winter training, we didn’t prepare experiments as before this year. Timetable of this year’s winter training is shown in figure 1. Students in winter training mainly are reserved team member selected before. The training is not obligated to reserved team members. Though our materials are not available to all students in our college, people who are not in our reserved team but want to participate the training is welcomed. Training material is totally available to them, too. Students will be grouped before the training, including people who are not in our reserved team. Brainstorms were held every night based on groups. On the last day, we will hold project defense to show our primary ideas about project. During this year’s final defense, we held a live on www.bilibili.com and invited team members from Shandong to watch it.
Figure 1. Timetable
From Marth to June, we held group meeting almost every week to study the outstanding projects in 2017 iGEM. Students were required to do presentations in the group meetings to help themselves understand the design and experiments, and A comprehensive test was used to determine the team member and reversed team member in this year. Experiments were started in July and continued to the last day before wiki freeze, with human practice and collaboration keeping in line with it.
Thanks to the attempts at standardizing team structure did by former SCU-China iGEMers and the help of our instructors and college, we generally form an inheriting structure, though it may cause that we have many team members every year. After a whole year’s competition, several junior students become group leaders who take control of the team organization, experiments and so on. Most sophomores in the team are developed form the reversed team member in the last year and they become the main part of our team if they determine to remain and pass the test mentioned above. Freshmen were encouraged to participated in winter training and were required to attend the group meetings. Experiments were mainly completed by juniors and sophomores while human practice was mainly accomplished by freshmen under the leadership of senior grades students.
Nowadays, SCU-China is not just an iGEM team but also a platform for students in Sichuan University to practice the experimental skills, to learn and understand the synthetic biology, to work together and to complete the project designed by ourselves. With the encourage of college, our education parts of human practice become easier to accomplish (see human practice). By integrating"

Spun a fiber of cellulose acetate (with a little bit of ""cheating"" though)
20% w/v cellulose acetate dope
loaded into a 10 mL plastic syringe with a 27.5 gauge needle (luer lock attached)
extruded at a rate of 6 uL/min into water
upon extrusion, the dope would blob up, so I had to use tweezers to gently pull the mass away from the needle tip. Upon doing so, a thin fiber would follow
this fiber was not uniform at all, as it depended on how fast I was pulling the rest of the cellulose acetate away from the needle tip.
a fiber was also formed when extruded at a rate of 1 uL/min. I had to do the same pulling to get the fiber to form."

7. The plasmid design: After finishing our design, we clicked on the bottom, then the shape of our plasmid came out. So we had a system that will produce AmilCP, a kind of blue protein when it detects UV.
Validation experiment
Confirmation
After we constructed two plasmids, Escherichia coli DH5α was transformed with plasmids and positive clones were identified by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction endonuclease digestion. Photo.1 and 2 show the confirmation result. Further confirmations were finished by sequencing.
Photo 1. After incubating for about 18 hours, the positive clone turned blue.
Photo 2. The Colony PCR showed the result of Transformation.
Experimental data
After the sequencing confirmation, Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with plasmids. We didn’t have Liquid culture systems with UV light, so we used plate cultivation. We placed the dish on a 10-15W weak intensity UV lamp at a distance of about 30 cm and took samples every few hours. 22 hours later, we got the blue bacteria moss (Photo.3 ). The bacteria had been broken by ultrasonic crusher, and then we used the OD588 to measure the concentration of the blue protein (Photo. 4).
Photo 3. One of the plates after exposure to UV for 22 hours.
Photo 4. The mixture of bacteria after broken by ultrasonic crusher.
Simulation validation and result analysis
But unfortunately, collecting bacteria from plate may cause some system error, and because of this,  reproducibility of OD588 was not so good. Using it to validate our simulation is meaningless. Hence, we decided to collaborate with  SCUT-China_A and used their project's data to prove the accuracy of our simulation. Picture.2 and 3 show the simulation result and the experimental result of their project.
Picture. 2 The simulation result of our software.
Picture. 3 The experiment result, data from SCUT-China_A.
Picture. 4 Our software simulation shows preferable performance.
Compared with experimental data of SCUT-China_A, our software simulation showed preferable performance (Picture.4). The result proved that our simulation works. After 7 hours, the experiment data was higher than predicted value, potentially caused by bacterial reproduction.

Wiki Design
We have done our best to make our wiki's design simple enough so that anyone can easily understand our projects and perhaps easily edit our wiki. We have designed the size and color of the characters and tried to give it a good visualization aspect. The members of the wiki's team met and discussed about the design on a daily basis at school. So everyone was able to see it at home, after school hours. We also inquired for other member's opinions about our wiki at regular meetings and tried to improve our wiki with their recommendations.
