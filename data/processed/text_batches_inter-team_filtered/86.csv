The fact that Tyr294 is located near the cyclopropane ring in the active site of ACC deaminase strongly suggested a direct catalytic role for this residue in the ring-opening reaction. The reactivity of Tyr294 may be enhanced by hydrogen bonding to Tyr268, which is only 2.8 Å away. Previous studies shows that these two tyrosine residues are strictly conserved among the known ACC deaminase homologues. The conserved presence of the two-tyrosine system in ACC deaminase homologues suggests a significant function for this tyrosine pair. To probe the possible involvement of the two tyrosine residues in the reaction, previous studies where the Y294F and Y268F mutants were prepared, suggested that both exhibited chromatographic behavior and spectral properties identical with those of the wild-type enzyme. The PLP content in the Y268F and Y294F mutant proteins was also the same as that observed for the wild-type enzyme. These mutant proteins were capable of binding ACC in the active site. However, no ACC deaminase activity of the Y294F mutant enzyme was detected using the coupled lactate dehydrogenase/NADH assay, and no keto product was generated as assessed by 1H NMR spectroscopy after a 24-h incubation period with the substrate. The activity of the Y268F mutant  also dramatically diminished.
After a detailed analyses of the structure and kinetics of ACC deaminase 1TYZ, we came to conclude that the crystal structure of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboyxlate deaminase complexed with ACC is in optimal state, and therefore any mutation done to residues such as Try 294, Glu295 that are in in close proximity to the cofactor Pyridoxal Phosphate will completely destroy the structure of the enzyme rather than promoting its activity. It was also concluded from our homology modeling that the gene of ACC deaminase from Pseudomonas sp. which we extracted from a root endophyte, was the closest match to the 1TYZ ACC deaminase used for structural modeling.
Homologous Alignment Modeling
After analyzing the structure of 1TYZ using the protein program PYMOL, we used Phyre2 to produce 3D protein structures of three different ACC deaminase genes from one bacterium and two fungi. After producing a pdb file for each of the genes, Phyre2 also produced a homology comparison to each of the ACC deaminase structures submitted to the"

Potential as a Therapeutic Probiotic
We interviewed Dr. Ellen Zimmerman to discuss our project and obtain her feedback regarding our design and the ultimate goal that our probiotic could achieve. Dr. Zimmerman is a gastroenterologist who also performs research pertaining to IBD and Crohn's disease. She was very excited to hear that we were pursuing bioengineering to unleash the potential therapeutic effects of butyrate in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. She informed us that ""many patients with serious inflammatory diseases are known to have low butyrate producing bacteria... While repairing the microbiome has not been made possible yet, filling in the gaps with essential metabolites might as well allow for therapy.""
This highlights the potential of butyrate as a therapeutic because “butyrate is considered a good guy in most settings"" and is not known to induce adverse effects. Finally, she said that, as a physician, she has to ensure her patients can maintain balance in their lives in order to manage their symptoms, and diet is a key player in the game of balancing. She said that ""if there were a probiotic that could alleviate the painful symptoms of these inflammatory diseases allowing patients to function with minimum inhibitions, many patients would be willing to try it despite the stigma that seems to revolve around GMOs. Once success of treatment is well documented, the patients will pursue it to relieve their symptoms."" This statement gave us hope and a perspective that this project can serve as a stepping stone towards treatment opportunities.  Dr. Zimmerman was impressed with the project goal and encouraged us to pursue the idea of a probiotic that can be used for therapy with minimal to no side effects. Her enthusiasm and support of our project goal encouraged us and strengthened our resolve towards the project goal.
From these conversations, we also made a key modification to the design involving colon cancer. Our initial idea to relieve cancer symptoms was to insert a heme-inducible promoter in our bacteria that would sense bleeding in the gut. The thought process was that by recognizing the presence of blood, the bacteria would be induced to release"

Figure 7: Model for how TlpB Senses Acid: In low pH conditions (shown on the left), TlpB’s periplasmic domain is ina ‘‘relaxed’’ or expanded state due to decreased hydrogen bonding to ureaand consequent lowered urea-binding affinity. However, in high or moreneutral pH conditions, TlpB’s periplasmic domain is in a ‘‘tense’’ or condensedstate with increased urea-binding affinity. The state of the periplasmic domainis relayed through the transmembrane region, which affects CheA’s phosphorylationstate, ultimately affecting the flagellar motor and dictating stoppingbehavior. TlpB dimer is shown in orange, CheA in red, CheW in green, urea inpurple, protons in blue, and phosphate in black..
By sequence analysis, H. pylori TlpB is organized like a typical member of the MCP superfamily of transmembrane receptors with two transmembrane helices (tm1, tm2) per subunit bracketing an extracellularsensing domain[2,7]. The extracellular-sensing domain is responsible for detecting ligands directly or indirectly via interactions with periplasmic-binding proteins. Continuing from tm2, the C-terminal portion of the MCP is cytoplasmic and mostly helical. It contains a histidine kinase, adenylyl cyclase, methyl-binding protein, phosphatase (HAMP) domain, followed by a helical domain and a segment that binds to the CheA/CheW histidine autoki-nase complex[2,8]. Phosphorylation of CheA in response to an extracellular signal in turn controls downstream compo-nents that modulate activity of the flagellar motor. MCPs dimerize at the membrane, forming a four helix bundle with ligand-binding domains in the periplasm, whereas trimers of dimers assemble with CheA and CheW to form a high-perfor-mance signaling array located in the cytoplasm[2,9].
In low pH conditions , TlpB’s periplasmic domain is in a ‘‘relaxed’’ or expanded state due to decreased hydrogen bonding to urea and consequent lowered urea-binding affinity.

The course provides teachers with advanced synthetic biology instruction while simultaneously conducting in-classroom activities which connect to the Virginia Science Standards of Learning.
Upon completion of this course teachers will receive credit toward their Virginia State Teacher Licence which must be renewed every five years.
This course will give teachers the background knowledge and lesson suggestions needed for the successful implementation of new synthetic biology research into their classrooms. The program varies in the complexity of the lessons depending on grade level. The higher level lessons include completing a series of wet lab experiments. These experiments help students develop a proficiency in bioengineering techniques, however, they require access to a lab, equipment, and reagents not always available at schools. To reduce these barriers we began a partnership with Thermofisher Scientific which will help improve student access to hands-on activities related to synthetic biology.
Registration for this course opens in November for teachers in the Williamsburg-James City County School District.
The original mini-proposal can be found here
Thermofisher Scientific
Students learn best when they are able to relate what they learned in class to a hands on experience. Thus, laboratory experiments are ideal for establishing and building upon foundational knowledge.  However, our lab cannot invite or visit all 29,000 students in our own district. As the Standards of Learnings are updated and more teachers begin incorporating synthetic biology into their classrooms, we are working to support them with the help of corporate partnerships.
This year, we connected with Jennifer Daugherty, a Regional Sales Manager for Thermofisher Scientific, to create a large scale program. The goal of this initiative is to improve student access to hands on synthetic biology experiences. We are currently working with Thermofisher and our community partners to create a program that will have the largest possible impact on the most students. Some program options create protective equipment kits including gloves, goggles, aprons etc. which would be distributed to students around the district. The other two programs connect researchers and iGEM members with students for a day of hands on experiences and challenges. The potential programs are outlined in this presentation .
We are in the early phases of this partnership, but the development of this program will benefit both the students who receive educational support, and the employees who have the opportunity to enjoy a day supporting science students in their community.

Multiple Start Codons
A frustrating yet commonly observed phenomenon in the lab is the production of unexpected proteins. These occurrences may be explainable by multiple start codons in the mRNA strand. Codon slippage is a theory practically untouched by research, and this project aspires to shed some light on the issue.
Multiple Start Codons
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
Background
mRNA is the molecule that carries information about the sequence of amino acids in a protein. However, much like the lines on a sheet of paper, the protein coding sequence of an mRNA molecule does not start right at the beginning, or top of the page. Instead, once the mRNA is bound by a ribosome, a start codon must first be read before the protein can be translated. This start codon is generally AUG, or Methionine.
The Problem
Once this start codon in read the ribosome will continue reading and building the polypeptide (protein) until a stop codon is reached. But what happens if you have two AUG codons close together? That is the question we are attempting to answer.
We are trying to understand what happens when there are two start codons very close together, but out of frame. Out of frame refers to how the ribosome reads the mRNA. Remember those codons and how they are groups of three bases on the mRNA? The reading frame refers to which group of three. If you start at one base and read the bases in groups of three from that point on, that is one frame of reference. If you then move your start point ahead one base, then you are reading in a new reading frame. If you advance you starting point one more base, that is the third reading frame. If you advance it again you are now back in your first reading frame, but you have skipped the first codon. We are looking into what happens when you have multiple start codons close together, but in different reading frames. Which frame will be preferred?

Dundee,2013,Team:Dundee#Project#MopTesting_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 1: Periplasmically-located PP1 can remove microcystin from solution. E. coli cells (0.5 ml) containing (i) an ‘empty’ plasmid  vector, or the same vector producing PPI fused C-terminal to either (ii) the TorA signal peptide (TorASP-PP1) or (iii) the first 36 amino acids of the cytoplasmic protein NarG were incubated with TBS buffer containing 5 nM microcystin for 1 h at room temperature. The concentration of microcystin remaining in solution after pelleting the cells was determined by competitive ELISA.
How efficient were our ‘Mop’ cells at cleaning up microcystin?
We started with 1 ml of a 5 nM solution of microcystin, which is approximately 5 pmoles (5 x 10-12 moles) of the toxin. If we multiply by Avogadro’s number (6.02 x 1023), this gives us approximately 3.01 x 1012 molecules of microcystin in the experiment. From measuring the optical density of our re-suspended cells, we determined that we added 2.04 x 1010 cells to the experiment, and since the counting experiment showed that each E. coli cell has approximately 200 mops in the periplasmic compartment, there would be a total of 4.08 x 1012 accessible mops in the experiment. We therefore estimate that approximately 70% of the periplasmic mops had bound microcystin during the course of this experiment.
How relevant was the concentration of microcystin used in this experiment?
The main route of human exposure to cyanobacterial toxins is through contaminated drinking water. For two drinking-water supplies in Alberta, Canada, levels of microcystin ranged from 0.15 to 4.3 nM (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed an upper limit for microcystin-LR of 1 nM in drinking water. Our ‘Mop’ cells when exposed to microcystin levels similar to those found in Alberta drinking water successfully reduced the concentration of the toxin to safe levels according to WHO guidelines (2).
Developing a prototype ‘Mop’ device for application in freshwater systems
We wanted to trial a device that could be used to clear cyanobacterial toxins from freshwater systems such as Clatto reservoir for example. Our main concern was in ensuring that our genetically engineered bacteria could not escape from our"

The reason we chose this part for contribution is because there was no sample for this part in iGEM HQ. Besides, there is only a few characterization for this protein complex. However, this protein complex Ccm A-H is an essential component for cytochrome c. Any iGEM team or researchers want to mature cytochrome c aerobically needs this part! For its great importance, we chose this part for contribution!
1. Plasmid construction and co-transformation of ccm A-H and mtr CAB
We amplified gene ccm A-H from the genome of E.coli(BL21) by PCR and inserted this gene to pSB1C3 with promoter pTet upstream successfully. The sequence of ccm A-H was validated with DNA sequencing by Sangon. Besides, we constructed another plasmid pM28 with promoter T7 and gene mar CAB downstream. After the construction, We co-transformed these two plasmids into strain BL21. Then we picked some colonies for cultivation and confirmed the co-transformation of these two plasmids (shown in Figure 1). We inoculated confirmed colonies to 2x YT media and cultivate it for 12 hours at 30˚C, 250 rpm. 2 mL of overnight culture was used to inoculate 200 mL 2xYT media and were grown for 16 hours at 30 ˚C. After cultivation, we confirmed the maintenance of two plasmids in BL21 by bacteria PCR (shown in Figure 2).

(2009), the DNA aptamer–MB and aptamet–QD sandwich assay components remain adherent to the inner surface of the polystyrene cuvette for days to weeks and they have much stronger adherence in comparison to antibody–MBs, which fall away from the collection site when the magnetic insert is removed, but a very thin brown film sometimes remain. They explain it with the fact that antibody coated–MBs adhere to polystyrene cuvettes with lesser affinity at neutral pH and most proteins adhere optimally to polystyrene microtiter plates only at elevated pH.              Given that aptamer based optical biosensors represent an unexplored field, we expect many exciting opportunities for aptamer based bioelectronic devices.

Me-EDA, are used in the paper, was commercially available, whereas 4-(dimethylsilyl)-anilin is not. The expert opinion of various professors of the chemical institute of our university implied that the synthesis is to dangerous for our team internal biochemist, who has a bit of organic lab experience. So we lastly found a group willing to cooperate and synthesising our molecule. Later on they also supported us regarding general chemical matters of this subproject.    For the SELEX part, we got help of Dr. Murat Sunbül from the Jäschke Lab, who is experienced in aptamer development.
week 10-16.07.2107
The plan was to produce the enantioselective molecule we want to SELEX against later on. To start with, we needed the protein. As described in the Supplementary Materials of >""Directed evolution of cytochrome c for carbon–silicon bond formation Bringing silicon to life“, further on referred to as S.M. (p.3 (B)), we expressed and purified the Rma cytochrome c TDE (triple mutant. Thereby IPTG initiated the expression of the T7 Polymerase in the bacterial strain BL21 (DE3), in turn triggering the production of cyt c from  the pet22(b) plasmid. Purification was facilitated though the apparent colour of the heme cofactor of the protein, which coloured the sample brown-red (Bild1) and therefore enabled an easy identification of the wanted fractions.
week 17-23.07.1207
The purity of the previously extracted protein was determined via a NuPAGE () and the concentration through the ferrous assay (S.M). The reactions of Me-EDA and 4-(dimethylsilyl)-anilin were performed with purified cyt c as well as whole cell solution. Both samples were treated as described in the >“Preparative-Scale Whole-Cell Biocatalytic Reaction“, whereby anaerobic conditions were mimicked through Nitrogen Gas washing of the reaction vial. Purification of the product through silica column chromatography delivered 25 fractions. Simultaneously, for the SELEX part, the RNA-library given to us by the Jäschke Lab was amplified. Therefore, a large scale PCR was conducted with primer ordered by IDT, in whole taking a volume of 10 mL (Bild). Next, the DNA was purified through Ethanol precipitation.

Two leaders in the field, Rabbi Moshe Tendler, PhD and Rabbi J. David Bleich, PhD have both written many articles in the field, but are still researching the particular legal aspects of the in vitro meat question. For exploring the morality underlying the rules of kashrut I owe a great debt to the works of Michael Wyschogrod, BSS, PhD, Leon Kass, MD, PhD, and Rabbi Meir Soloveichik, PhD. The articles and personal input of these authorities were invaluable in composing this review.
Main Points for Further Discussion
• Is such a product kosher? Is it acceptable for a vegan or vegetarian?
• Would such a product considered meat in terms of kashrut? Could it be eaten with milk?
• If stem cells could be induced to differentiate as pig cells, could we produce kosher pork, or other non-kosher animals?
• Is the method of cell harvest important? How does the prohibition against eating from a live animal impact this issue?
• Is the relationship of the initial cell sample to the finished product analogous to that pork bones to gelatin?
• Is the relationship of the initial cell sample to the finished product analogous to that of animal rennet to the cheese it produces?

Results
We cloned the PCB generator from already existing BioBrick parts: <partinfo>BBa_I15008</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_I15009</partinfo>. We tried to use the BioBrick part <partinfo>BBa_M30109</partinfo> which failed. Sequencing this part showed that it does not consist of the sequences which were expected form the data on the part registry. Therefore we ordered the pJT122 plasmid that contains the coding region of Cph8 from Addgene and cloned our own plasmid containing the PCB generator as well as the coding region for Cph8.  As a reporter we cloned a LacZ conding region behind the ompC promoter .  For our experiments we will use the strain JT2 (RU1012 ∆PompC-lacZ) , which has a knock-out of the EnvZ kinase. As a result all phosphorylation of OmpR and therefore lacZ-expression is under the control of Cph8.

4. Successfully constructed the testing circuit of toxin proteins according to two kinds of inhibitors.                                 [For example, Part: BBa_K2120400 ]
5. Tested the lethal effect of producing DSB through coupling sgRNA and Cas9
Experimental details [Expand]
1. Constructing the testing circuits
The DNA Agarose Gel electrophoresis showed that the whole length of the first circuit is about 1500bp, the second circuit is about 1400bp.
Fig.1 DNA Agarose Gel electrophoresis results of mazF
Fig.2 DNA Agarose Gel electrophoresis results of hokD
2. Testing the lethal effect of toxin proteins MazF and HokD by measuring the growth curve.
The testing groups are the two circuits above (mazF and hokD), while the control is the empty vector. Add arabinose or not, there is another comparison. We used 0.01% arabinose to induce the PBAD promoter when the OD600 is 0.6. We measured the OD600 every hour until the bacteria reached the flat stage.
Fig.3 Compared with the negative control (the empty pSB1C3 vector), OD600 of the two circuits containing toxin proteins are obviously lower, and the difference is evident as time going on. No obvious difference observed among the three groups with no induction. It showed that toxin proteins didn’t leak out.
Through the growth curve, we concluded that toxin protein HokD and MazF have different lethal efficiency. Depending on different situations, we can choose either of them.
3. Replacement of the RBS to adjust the lethal effect as well as the threshold
Through one-step mutation, we have separately replaced the B0032 (33.96%) with B0031 (12.64%) and B0034 (100%). Here are the sequencing results.
Fig.4 The successful sequencing results of 4 mutations: B0031+mazF; B0034+mazF; B0031+hokD; B0034+hokD
We used 0.01% arabinose to induce the PBAD promoter when the OD600 is 0.6. We measured the OD600 every hour until the bacteria reached the flat stage.

PCR Amplification
Amplify using the cycling program shown below:
Intitial denaturation at 98C for 30s
Denaturation at 98C for 10s
Annealing at 64C for 45s
Extension at 72C for 30s/1kb (determined by multiplying the length of the template (in kilobases) by 30s)
Repeat steps 2-4 for 25 cycles
Final extension at 72C for 10min
Hold at 4C
Cleanup
Use the standard Qiagen spin-column cleanup procedure (or equivalent), noting the procedural modifications described below. Do not use the spin columns provided with the RDP kit. They have a special cleanup role following the BsaI digestion step.
When the Qiagen PB buffer mix is added to the column, let stand one minute before centrifuging (or filtration if using a vacuum manifold).
Following the Qiagen PE buffer wash step, elute the DNA from the column into a 1.5mL microfuge tube using 50μL TE buffer, then repeat with a second 50 μL elution into the same collection tube yielding a final volume of ~85-90μL.
Determining the quality and quantity of the PCR Product
For a more accurate measure, use a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Use 2 μL of the recovered sample. Remember to zero the instrument using the same TE buffer that was used to elute your sample.
If a NanoDrop spectrophotometer is not available, use the procedure below.
Product size and purity
For products with an expected size of 0.2-10 kb, set up a 1% agarose gel using a 1:50 dilution of 50x TAE stock buffer (Tris-Acetate-EDTA @ 2M ) in deionized H2O for both the gel and running buffer.
To prepare a gel sample of your PCR product, add 1μL of the DNA to 9μL of load mix (LM).
Note: In order to minimize the interference of dyes with subsequent band quantification, only bromophenol blue has been included at considerably lower than standard concentrations to mitigate the masking of bands in the 300-600 bp range. Store remainder of PCR product at 4C

Overview
 
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is one of the most harmful types of air poisoning around the world. CO gas is mostly released from the internal combustion of engines as well as the use of fuels such as wood and coal. Since CO is highly produced in urban areas, it presents a big danger for any living organism. The aim of our project is to convert CO into CO2 biologically, which then can be converted into oxygen with photosynthesis by photoautotrophic organisms. In order to achieve this, we plan to construct a biofilm containing the enzyme Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase (CODH). With the production of this biofilm, it may be possible to obtain a biological filter that can fix the ratio of CO and CO2 present in the environment. We also try to integrate a kill switch, previously developed by Berkeley, to our system for safer use of our biofilm as well as a cell limiter for better characterization of the biofilm activity.

As a result, PSII remains in detergent micelles. Because PSII is a membrane protein, it is not stable in a non-membrane environment. Thus, incorporating protein into liposome membrane will ensure to preserve activity of protein for further use, homogeneity of protein insertion in the lipid layer, control the orientation as it will ensure the transfer of electron onto the gold nano-wire, morphology and size of the reconstituted proteoliposomes. The homogeneity of size and distribution of liposome is controlled by extruding it through a polycarbonate filter with 0.4μm pore size.
Escherichia coli Total Lipid Extract was dissolved in organic solvent, chloroform and brought down to a concentration of 20mg/ml. Thin film was created in the glass vial by evaporating the chloroform using dry nitrogen gas in a gas fume hood. Upon evaporation, the lipid film was rehydrate by suspending the film in buffer (5mM MES, 50mM KCl, 200μM Pyranine, 2mM MgCl2 pH 6.5) to a final concentration of 15.34mg/ml. The lipid film was vortexed and sonicated to emulsify in buffer, subjected to two freeze-thaw cycle, and then extruded through a 0.4μm nucleopore polycarbonate membrane 21 times to form liposomes (Avanti Polar Lipid, Inc.). The liposome was stored in -80°C until needed for use.

The GoldenBricks: A fast cloning technique
for the PartsRegistry
Introduction
Context
Cloning is probably the most tedious and less rewarding task when engineering living entities through synthetic biology. With the development of the restriction enzymes and efficient DNA ligases, assembling small and large DNA pieces has become a common practice in biology, but as everyone is using their own sets of enzyme and assembly method, making large DNA constructs is still a challenge today. The first indisputable advance in the domain came with the invention of the first standardized DNA cloning method: the BioBricks [1]. The standard BioBrick format (BBF RFC 10) make possible to clone together all kind of genetic parts (called ""bricks"") using only four different enzymes: EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI. But the real power of BioBrick standardization lays in the possibility to build database made of these DNA pieces that anyone can be assembled through a standard method. The PartsRegistry today contains almost over 3,000 basic characterized biological parts [2] and is a sources of inspiration for thousands of biologists around the world.
If biobricks have opened new perspectives for engineering organisms and have proven their efficiency over a decade, their use is limited by the fact that the fragments can only be assembled one by one. On the top of this, the process is very difficult to automatize, because of the number of DNA purification step required. IGEMers today spend most of their time assembling genetic parts together, leaving little time for characterizing them and testing their systems.
Several cloning techniques capable of assembling multiple fragments at the time have been invented since the rise of the Biobrick format. The most popular one is probably the one known as the Gibson method [3] that can be used to assemble up to four fragments at the time on a regular basis. The Golden Gate technique [4] (>20 fragments at the time) and its new evolution, the MoClo [5] (47 fragments in two times reported) are leading the way of another kind of cloning technique based on type II restriction enzymes. More efficient than the Gibson cloning, the Golden Gate also have the huge avantage that it can assemble more parts at the time, no matter their size. Moreover, Golden Gate do not imply any DNA modifications, which noticeably reduce the probability of having a mutation at the ligation scar.
If these new techniques dramatically speed-up the assembly of DNA pieces,"
Macquarie_Australia,2017,Team:Macquarie Australia#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," 3 consecutive lanes within the green lines for each sample):
Pre-incubated: gRNA + enzymes (incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes in all samples)
Incubated: gRNA + enzyme + PCR product (further incubated for 1 hour at 37°C)
Deactivated: gRNA + enzyme + PCR product (further incubated for 1 hour at 37°C) and a deactivation step of 20 minutes at 80°C.
Our experiment used a commercial Cas9 with nuclease activity as a control (see Figure 2). From this sample we have been able to better interpret our results. The pre-incubated control shows an upward gel shift of the gRNA (Figure 2A), indicating commercial Cas9 binding to gRNA (Figure 2B, lane 2). Upon incubation with the PCR product, there is a disappearance of both higher bands and loss of smearing, suggesting the formation of a stable conformation of gRNA, Cas9 and the target PCR product. The deactivation step causes the disassembly of the gRNA/Cas9 complex, resulting in the reverting of the gel shift of the PCR product and the gRNA, and also shows specific cleavage of the PCR product. Absence of the protein bands after deactivation is likely due to denaturation of the enzyme that results in protein aggregation/precipitation.
From our results we observed the different truncated protein sites in the four samples: WT (dCas9), 3P, 5P and HNH (see Figure 1). The EMSA performed suggests binding to gRNA of mutant dCas9 in WT, 3P, 5P and HNH samples. This is evident from the observation of gRNA complexes shifting upon incubation with DNA. Protein shifts after incubation with the PCR product suggested that the mutants retained the ability to bind the target DNA. Deactivation of the protein DNA complex reversed the migration shift of the PCR product, providing further evidence that the dCas9 binds to the PCR product, while not having nuclease activity.

Tec-Monterrey,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," from Saccharomyces castellii successfully provides S. cerevisiae with the silencing mechanism. Introducing the AGO1 and DCR1 genes, together with an antisense sequence for the ERG9 gene, a separate module for the platform is generated.
Promoters for P. pastoris
When working with P. pastoris as an expression system, a need for a controlled expression evidences a lack of related parts in the registry. Therefore, the characterization of four inducible promoters is presented. The registry’s insufficiency of expression tools for alternative systems like this yeast is thus addressed. P. pastoris offers an expression system that has proven useful in substantial protein production, especially in molecules requiring post-translational modifications. Cultures of this yeast are able to achieve relatively large cell densities, allowing greater amounts of biomass to be used for production. Also, this organism is non-pathogenic and regarded as biologically safe, making it a relevant alternative for expression systems.
Using GFP as a reporter for the strength of each promoter, the detected fluorescence is registered as proportional to the level of expression of the gene. The emitted radiation can be quantified by a fluorescence microplate reader, as well as by fluorescence microscopy, using specialized software (ImageJ) for an objective appraisal of the images. The results here presented reveal the successful implementation of the promoters in the system and the functionality of this product of gene expression. Further characterization includes the detailed study of the effect of inducer concentration in the medium over time.
We are aware of the characteristics of GFP that make it a non-ideal reporter chromophore. The availability of molecular oxygen in its surroundings is a source of variability in its fluorescent activity. Also, the correct folding of the protein takes a certain amount of time and also depends on the medium’s conditions, inserting noise into the results. However, GFP provides an easy way to track gene expression in simpler systems. The data to be collected on promoter strength is purely relative and specific for its setup, providing a general baseline for their usefulness on other projects.
The availability of inducible promoters for a biosystem is useful when a tight grip on expression of the genes of interest is desired. Applying the modular biofatory design strategy, they come extremely handy if the purpose is for each module to be expressed at different times. It would be possible to construct a mathematical model quantifying the effect of each of the separate modules using distinct promoters for each group of genes associated to a specific function of the genetic construct.

Variability - As part of the Interlab study, we analysed two separate bacterial transformants in quadruplicate. This allows an examination of the variability between replicates and between colonies. Between replicates, variation was minimal. However, between colonies containing the same device we saw a degree of variability in growth and fluorescence, thus affecting FL:OD. Figure 2 shows high levels of variability between max OD and Abs measurements of Tests 2 and 4. Fluorescence and subsequently FL:OD are directly affected by growth, but factors including inaccuracies in growth set up and the user taking the samples could have also affected these. As plasmid copy number will not be equal, this will also manifest in readings over time.

Conclusions and Future Work
After carrying out the InterLab Study we decided to take a high, medium and low expressing device and analyse their sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions. We also looked into how automation could reduce variation between results.

Interlab Devices in Different Contexts
We looked at the impact of temperature, pH and media on how high, medium and low expressing devices performed. Tests 2, 5 and 6 were selected from the Interlab Study after initial results were analysed. Single colonies of each transformant were selected and grown in LB+Chl, then washed and diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 in 100 ul media. Transformants were analysed in quadruplicate, with bacteria and media pipetted onto the plate using a pipetting robot for maximum accuracy. Once set up, the plate was incubated at specified temperatures in a plate reader with double orbital shaking, taking readings every 10 min"

With addition of D-psicose, EGFP can be successfully produced.   With their visual designer and the embedded mathematical ODE systems model, they constructed our device A and dynamically analyzed the amounts of materials in it. They pay attention to the expression of EGFP, since its amount can be evaluated in unit of optical density. Related formulas and parameters are shown below:  $$\frac{d[PsiR]}{dt} = \frac{k_{PsiR}[gene_{PsiR}]}{1+[Psicose]^{n1}}-d_{PsiR}[PsiR]$$ $$\frac{d[EGFP]}{dt}=\frac{k_{EGFP}[gene_{EGFP}]}{1+[PsiR]^{n2}}-d_{PsiR}[EGFP]$$
Production and Conversion Rate Simulink Model
The Establishment of Production and Conversion Rate Simulink Model
To understand how we get psicose in a deep view, replication, transcription and translation are involved to describe the synthesis of psicose and thus come to our production on a large scale. As we all know, the enzyme will degrade due to the mutation of coding sequence during DNA replication and the transcription error.
Although the rate mutation and transcription error are one in 100 million and one in 10 thousand, the yield of psicose may not decrease because even errors happen in the process of replication and transcription, the type and order of amino acid may not reverse as well as the function of our enzyme which lead to the same catalytic rate of the original one.
However, the butterfly effect tells us that we cannot ignore the small change in our system, even it is little enough for us to ignore. Considering the mutation rate and transcription error, the production of psicose is closely related to the cycling times, error rate and original production. The production of psicose is a function with variables of cycling times, error rate and original production.  $$Prd(t)=Prd(t,Times,errRate,oriPrd)$$ Where Times is the cycling times of psicose, errRate is the rate of replication and transcription error, oriPrd is the original production of our system. The errRate is influenced by the replication error rate and the transcription error rate. Meantime, the more replication and transcription errors we get, the lower or higher production we will get.

The answers to these questions are the first point of interest of the    study: What is the current perception in the sending of sensitive    information?
We found out, by asking to our survey respondents if they would send    highly-secret information by regular mail or email (Graph 3), that  46%    of the population would not trust sending such    information through those conventional means (either by post or email)    39% commented that it would depend on the destination of the    information. Survey respondents commented that the locations where the post    service is efficient and reliable, could be considered as an option:    however, in places where such systems are not completely efficient,    they would not consider it as an option.
By analyzing deeply each individual responses we found out that 84% of the survey respondents that would not trust to send sensitive information through conventional means belong mostly to Latin American countries (taking only into account the nationality of the survey respondents: Mexico, Brazil, Guatemala and Costa Rica) In contrast, most of the percentage of the people who trust sending such information by both post and email correspond to European Countries. It might be that in Latin American countries the efficiency of the post is low compared with the European service. We truly believe that the improvement of the current post services in Latin American countries will lead to an enhancement of the current postal services, and also will open the market to our system in a near future.
“89% of the survey respondents send information through    digital means, but 46% would not do it if it is highly-secure    information”
But such a low trust is not limited only by the physical means of sending.    Actually it is more pronounced when it comes to the digital storing    and sending of information. From the total of our survey respondents,    76% does not feel that the information on the internet is safe from    digital espionage. (Graph 4)

“What is contrasting is that 89% of the survey respondents    use digital means to send information, but 76% consider that such    information is not safe from digital espionage”
Actually, according to our surveys respondents, private companies    are the principal target from digital espionage (the aim of the digital    espionage is to obtain information) and consequently of the theft of    information (theft of information “occurs when attackers steal data    with the aim"

Moreover, improving the binding ability of the PC chain and exogenous ligand can help promote the combination of TC and PC chains, which leads to a higher output. It follows that we obtain a method to improve the system efficiency while preventing system saturation output from decreasing: improving the binding ability of the PC chain and the exogenous ligand while reducing the binding ability of the TC chain and the exogenous ligand at the same time. This will be one of the ideas for our further experiment.

SYSU-Software,2016,Team:SYSU-Software#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,". Of course, it must be
very kind for those who really make an experiment with hundreds species of bacteria.
How to ask other users calculate my design? This question really inspired us to add some parts in Designer and Square: in
designer the users will have a number related to their design and their help request will be shown on the Square. With this
number, other users can help calculation in their computer with Satellite on their computers.
Jiajing Li, PhD student at UCLA
Background Information: Jiajing Li is a PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles campus. He is now a student on
human genetics.
Some Feedbacks:
“The adjustable promoter and RBS in CRAFT Designer is a very smart design, but you should ensure that the recommended
promoter and RBS is the most appropriate.”
“CRAFT Designer have done well on biosafety problems, but you should consider the situation when someone use the
designed system, whose targets are safe on your catalog, to produce other dangerous products.”
“How many photo do you have on earth in your icon setting?!!”
Inspiration:
To prove the combination recommended by our system is the most appropriate, we design a validation experiment to
measure the efficiency of recommended promoter, RBS and other combinations, and the results indicated that CRAFT
Designer have successfully provided the appropriate combination.
Jiajin Li’s biosafety concern also reminded us to add a report system in our Square, with which other users can report to us if
they find someone try to design systems and use their products for dangerous motivation.
As for the photos in icon setting, just try or you might find something interesting!
Future Works
Distributed Computing Plug-in
Recently, our distributed computing plug-in Satellite have only been tested on voluntary computers, and it can only run on
linux system and is complex when installing. Therefore, we need to spread Satellite, improving the calculation ability of CRAFT
main server and simplify the installation in the future.
User Data
CRAFT is a newly designed software, with a few users and insufficient experiment data, thus the self-revised algorithm, which
largely depends on experiment data, can’t work in this newly released version. Therefore, with more users and more data, our
software can modify the parameters in the models, ensuring the results more practical.
Application
CRAFT aims at designing solutions in real and complex environments. We will transfer data in real problems into our software
and craft a synthetic biological system in solving these problems."

Concrete properties
Concrete has a high compressive strength (3000 to 4000 psi) and a very low tensile strength (between 8% to 15% of the compressive strength.). Cracking is due to the low tensile strength.
In reinforced concrete the steel reinforcement provides the tensile strength lacking in concrete. Steel has tensile strength equal to approximately 100 times that of concrete. Steel reinforcing is also capable of resisting compression forces.
Concrete and steel work very well together in relation to temperature changes because their coefficients of thermal expansion are quite close to each other. For steel it is 0.0000065 per unit length per degree Fahrenheit, while for concrete it is about 0.0000055.

Brown,2009,Team:Brown#Project Histamine Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html," those most likely present in the ligand binding pocket of RBP.
3) Used UCSF Chimera to mutate all the identified residues in RBP to alanine (which has neutral chemical properties, and almost no side chain), thereby effectively creating a ""blank"" version of RBP that has no specific binding pocket for any ligand (removing its binding affinity for ribose)--called the polyala RBP.
The polyala RBP.
4) Replace ribose in the alanine-mutated RBP (polyala RBP) PDB file with a 3D structure of histamine in a low energy conformation.
5) Used Rosetta's Ligand Docking mode on 100 of Brown's Center for Computational Molecular Biology ( http://www.brown.edu/Research/CCMB/ ) clustered servers to simulate the docking of histamine into the polyala RBP. To dock histamine into polyala RBP, Rosetta Ligand uses Monte Carlo minimization to find the relative orientations of the ligand and receptor that minimize steric contacts between the two while still keeping histamine roughly within the original ligand binding pocket. This produces 10000 PDB files of histamine docked to the polyala RBP.
6) Next, we sorted the 10000 docked PDB files by their interface energies between ligand and protein. We selected the top 2500.
7) Next, we took the top 2500 and input them into the Rosetta Enzyme Design mode, run on the same cluster. We specified the residues mutated to alanine as those to re-design by mutation. The redesign process attempts to stabilize the protein-ligand pair by mutating residues at certain specified locations, those we originally mutated to alanine. This redesign process used Rosetta Design’s probabilistic simulated annealing algorithm to find the particular residues that minimize total energy between protein and ligand (minimized energy indicates a stable state, favoring binding). Because this process is probabilistic, final designs are not guaranteed to yield the lowest possible energy conformations. However, by doing thousands of designs in parallel, we increased the likelihood of isolating mutations that result in histamine binding.
8) Finally, we sorted through the output designs using several criteria: predicted interface energies between the protein and histamine, amount of hydrogen bonding between the protein and histamine (H-bonds are very good for ligand binding), and predicted folding ability of protein. We filtered the final designs to only those with a total score better than or equal to that of the scaffold RBP. We then set cutoffs for"

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ible to infectious diarrhea [2]. Alfred Nissle                 put the bacteria cultured on the agar plate into gelatin capsules and seals them with paraffin to make                 the drug Mutaflor [3]. Subsequent studies have confirmed that EcN lacks virulence factors and has                 obvious probiotic properties, and is a safe and effective carrier for the treatment of inflammatory                 bowel disease [1]. EcN has excellent biofilm formation ability, so it has better                 colonization ability than other probiotic carriers, and it can inhibit the colonization of pathogens                 [4]. In addition, EcN can inhibit intestinal pathogens by secreting microcin and inducing                 epithelial cells to secrete defensing-2 [5, 6]. Due to the excellent properties of EcN, in 2004, it                 was recommended by the German Society of Gastroenterology and Digestive Diseases (DGVS) as an                 alternative to the UC standard for the treatment of mesalamine [7]. However, there are also some                 negative reports that EcN is not completely safe [8]. Therefore, we hope to use the modified EcN strain                 SYNB1618 as our final chassis. SYNB1618 lacks colonization ability and is completely eliminated within                 48 hours in the mouse model, so it is a safer chassis [9]. As a consequence of limited time and effort,                 in our experiments, we only used DH5α and BL21 strains to test the performance of our system.                 Nevertheless, we hope that our engineered bacteria will be filled in capsules and taken orally to treat                 IBD in the future.

UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Customizing Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," two different silk monomers, Major Ampullate Spidroin 1 (MaSp1) and 2 (MaSp2).  The MaSp1 monomer contributes strength to spider silk while the MaSp2 contributes more flexibility. [4] As a proof of principle we hope to show that by assembling these two repeats into one protein at different ratios, we can create silk with a spectrum of strength and extensibility.
Fig 2: Variations of the MaSp1 amino acid sequences between different spider species [6]
Iterative Capped Assembly
Assembling spider silk monomers such as MaSp1 and MaSp2 together can prove to be rather difficult. Due to the repetitiveness of our silk monomers, common techniques such as Gibson assembly and direct synthesis of a full-length gene product could be ineffective and less efficient in building silk sequences. Therefore, a technique called iterative capped assembly (ICA), which allows rapid assembly of repeating monomers, would be a better option in working with our highly repetitive sequences. This technique has previously been applied in order to assemble other repetitive modules.  For example, ICA has been demonstrated to efficiently assemble very repetitive transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) up to 21 monomers long [5] .
ICA allows the assembly of silk monomers in different ratios and orders into a custom gene sequence of modifiable length. Gene monomers are assembled individually into a growing chain that is anchored to a solid foundation through streptavidin-biotin interaction.
Silk monomers for ICA were built using PCR to attach BsaI recognition site onto the MaSp sequences, as well as different end extensions in the form of 4bp overhang that is essential for ligation. BsaI is a type IIs endonuclease that cleaves outside the recognition site and therefore generates overhangs that are still part of the native silk sequence. This leaves our digested products, or building blocks, free of any remaining recognition site, which is usually formed with other types of restriction enzymes.
Fig. 3: Schematic of ICA from Briggs, et al. [5]
We have designed 3 types of overhangs that the Bsa1 enzyme can generate. These are the A overhang, (AGCA),  the B overhang (TGCA) and the C overhang (TGCT).
The key idea here is that monomers with the same overhang are complementary and can be ligated together. Each silk monomer was modified via pcr to have one of these overhangs at the"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.

There is about 70% reduction of induced colony formed compare to the non-induced ones, so we can say this device is functional properly. We assumed that if the induction started inside the tube, the cfu will drop dramatically.

Fig.4 The DNA cleavage image from genscript.
The problem with Nucleases are that it might leak during synthesis or subclone construction, so our plasmid came very very late. The assay was carried out by genescript technicians during our subclone preparation. In the graph, DNA is quite completely degraded, which means our part worked as expected.
Thermal Regulator
-can it work
First, we characterize the Thermal Sensitive Regulators, to see if they work. We simply put them into 37 degree Celsius shaker and 42 degree Celsius shaker, and see if they glow as we expected.
K2572000 is TlpA39, which was selected out with the same method as TlpA36, we thought that 39 degree might be a good temperature for human, which was not too high to hurt people, also not too low to mixed up with others. K2572001 is Tcl42, quite similar with TlpA protein and its originated from bacteriophage, which with regulation system cl repressor.
However, we found that Tcl38 is not working as we expected, and after sequencing, we were quite sure that the reporter gene was lost. So, in the following characterization, Tcl38 was used as a negative control.
-as we expected
Then we performed the characterization under different temperature. Petri dishes were placed into incubators with different temperatures and grew for 24 hours.
We can see that at 35 degree Celsius, TlpA36 starts to derepress. At 37 degree Celsius, TlpA39 starts to derepress. At 39.5 degree Celsius, Tcl42 starts to express. Leakage was observed, transcription of pTlpA was initiated below the expected temperature. ETH Zurich iGEM2017 improved this by simply increase the expression of TlpA protein, since they assumed that the leakage was caused by lack of repression.
We used plate reader to characterize this set of Thermal Regulators, they were incubicated under different temperature and transformed to plate reader after 18 hours.

(pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," risks involved may be particularly hard to foresee (e.g., interactions in the environment) and be linked to misuse and dual use practices in connection with the knowledge produced by the iGEM projects. In case of controversial projects (higher risks), the expected benefits should be superlative.
Do you think iGEM-team should discuss ethical problems about their project or is this something that is unnecessary?
I think that iGEM teams should discuss the ethical issues involved in their project. It is both a necessary practice and a good exercise.
Education
In our hunt to understand the complexity of ethics in science we have decided to also include the end user to our discussion. That is why we organized a panel discussion on the topic of ethics in science called Ethics of Engineering life. This event was our major collaboration with iGEM team Stockholm and together we managed to attract more than a 100 people to discuss their opinion with us. We have invited three experts from the field and had a two hour lively discussion with the audience on the most crucial topics in ethics. After the event the discussion continued during snacks and coffee.
Our team was also part of Synbio Hour where we presented our project and talked about the Ethical part. We have presented this part of the project during the Student Science Conference as well. Our team members also represented us abroad when our team member Sanka gave a presentation during Biosummit in Boston. In attempt to talk to other teams we have organized three webinars. You can read more about those and more in the Collaborations .
Integration
To explain how we used our ethical research and integrated it in our project, we need to start from the choosing of the project. We felt the need to start assessing the possible implications of our project very early on. So we thought answering a couple of questions and talk to different people from the university while choosing the project would be the best way to go.
iGEM Uppsala team takes pride in letting the students of the team do all the heavy lifting and come up with a problem and a solution for their project themselves. We brainstormed ideas, did a lot of research about what can be done and then shared our project with professors and fellow iGEMers to check if we have something plausible. This is how we got from about 50 ideas to only 4.
Sound great, but we are talking about research and ethics are nowhere to be found! Well fear no more. This is a stage where we need to come up with a final decision. We have four potential projects. All of which seems realistic enough to be worked on. All of which seems to have caught"

Introduction
In our project, we want to use Cre-Loxp recombination, a site-specific recombinase technology to carry out inversions in the DNA of cells which can change the initial ‘AND’ gate to the ‘OR’ gate. Due to the fact that the inversion is invertible, what we expect to achieve is that to a great extent the genes are transferred from initial state to the desired state.
The mathematical model of the whole process can be divided into two parts：Part 1: Construction of DDE equations to describe the process of the generation of Cre protein and Cre protein binding to Loxp sites. The result shows that the concentration of Cre protein and Cre protein binding to Loxp sites grow to a peak and then degrade to zero. Part 2: Using Gillespie algorithm to simulate the stochastic process of the reversal after Cre binds to Loxp sites. We can see from the result of this part that the inversion only happens when Cre protein binding to Loxp sites exists and about 50% of genes flip to the state we want. To analyze the property of this model, we then design the Part 3. Part 3: Sensitivity analysis of several parameters. We analyze three parameters and the third parameter –the degradation rate of Cre protein –have an obvious effect on the final percent of the genes in different state, which inspires us to introduce a feed forward to the system to increase the percent of the genes flip to the state we want, so we have the Part 4. Part 4: The addition of the feed forward part and the analysis of the new model. By introducing a feed forward to the system, we do get the desired result that more genes flip to the state we want.
Mathematical Model:DDE equations
We construct DDE equations to describe the process of the generation of Cre protein and Cre protein binding to Loxp sites. The result shows that the concentration of Cre protein and Cre protein binding to Loxp sites grow to a peak and then degrade to zero"

News: iGEM Meetup Last Weekend -  a great success!
Last weekend, six iGEM teams from all over Germany – namely Braunschweig, Darmstadt, Bielefeld, Tübingen, Freiburg and Munich – met with our team in Aachen.
Welcome teams!
All teams were welcomed by our three beautiful receptionists.
The weekend started with a welcome ceremony for all iGEM teams in the Couven hall on our RWTH campus. This a game of “Synthetic Biology Jeopardy”, developed and programmed by our team member Michael. The game was divided into three rounds: two preliminary rounds and one final. In the first round, Munich alias “Bier”, Tübingen alias “Most” and Bielefeld alias “Bielefeld” challenged each other in the categories Abbreviations, Amino Acids, Bad Science Movies, Part Categories and Sponsor Logos. With 2400 and 800 points teams Most and Bier, respectively, advanced to the final round. Though the team Bielefeld came in last, they got another chance to proceed to the final round by substituting for Freiburg’s team which didn’t make it"

2. The functionality of the surface display system was visually demonstrated
This observation suggests that our primary objective of binding NoV to E. coli using surface expressed scFv was achieved. In addition, this result further solidifies the functionality of INPNC-His surface display module in E. coli. This visual demonstration of the functionality of INPNC surface expression modules encourages further application of this part by future iGEM teams. We added this observation to Penn2012's parts experience page.
3. INPNC-expressing E. coli was observed with characteristic deformity
When comparing SEM pictures, we noticed that E. coli using INPNC system seems to be more elongated compared to those with BclA system. To confirm this, we determined aspect ratios of all E. coli from the SEM pictures using ImageJ (see Materials and Methods for more detail ). By Welch's t-test (two-sided), we found that E. coli with INPNC system were in fact more elongated than BclA system expressing E. coli (p=0.0015 <0.05).
We have also made a growth curve of the INPNC-His- and BclA-His- system expressing E. coli. (Fig13). It shows that INPNC-His-scFv expressing E. coli has significant delays in growth compared to its BclA counterpart. The results from the growth curve and elongated shapes both suggest that the expression of INPNC-His-scFv to the outer membrane caused significant stress and deformation to the host E. coli.
Fig13 Growth curve of E. coli.
Measurements were done for 10 hours, but the graph only shows 4 hours of measurement since the medium saturated within 4 hours. We used E. coli harboring BBa_E1010 as the control.
3-3 Tertiary Stage: We succeeded in observing the binding of CBD to cellulose
As shown in 3-1, we observed the expression of INPNC-His-CBDcex on the membrane fraction. We next tested the passenger protein's functionality, e.g. CBDcex's binding to cellulose.
1. Observing the binding of E-coli to cellulose on a macroscopic level
CBDcex’s binding to cellulose was initially examined by measuring the optical density (OD600) of cell suspension before and after incubation with cellulose, as well as its washing buffer"

FUTURE WORK 
The Role of Pattern Formation
Pattern formation is of fundamental importance in the coordination of multicellular behavior in a community or a large complex system. In physics and engineering, precisely control of the size of the parts and verification, validation and predictive capability of engineering system performance lay an important theoretical foundation for the application in actual engineering. [1] In biology, a vast range of intracellular and intercellular coupling mechanisms lead to the formation of patterns that govern fundamental physiological processes, such as embryogenesis, tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. [2][3][4] Also, the ability to engineer synthetic systems that can form spatial patterns is a critical step towards tissue engineering, targeted therapy and fabrication of biomaterials. [5][6] As the number of system components grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to coordinate component inputs and outputs to produce the overall desired behavior, which definitely restrict the application of gene therapy , tissue engineering and fabrication of biomaterials.
Perspective and Outlook
Based on this motivation and our experimental results of forming quasi-hyperbola at the present stage, we are going to conduct and adjust experiments according to a more accurate modelling, which expect higher accuracy. As to modelling, because nonlinearities and stochasticity arise naturally, tools from the fields of nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics are extremely useful both in the generation of design specifications and for careful comparison between experiment and computational model. [7] Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal which kinetic parameters most significantly affect ring development over time. Construction and study of such synthetic multicellular systems can improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring developmental processes. Then it will lead us to understand and explain nature better. Based on a more accurate experiment and modeling, we will consider increasing the communication between the cells, introducing quorum-sensing in order to build more complex mathematical shapes, exerting environmental stimulus. Such systems level bioengineering can synergistically target multiple pathways, symptoms or targets, such as multiple cell populations or organs creating the potential for innovative environmental and therapeutic applications"

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," box, I started a new one called functional parts only box #2 and the new mini-preps can be found in there.
The digestions mentioned above can be found in the working box, which is pretty much filled up, so a new one should be started of those as well.
If all the verification PCR's turn out to be good tomorrow, I suggest getting started on the next set of pATxx series and pushing forward as much as we can to get our construct done.. awesome work so far!!
02-10-2010 Repressor group Annemi
Made minipreps of the overnight cultures from yesterday. Made with 4mL culture. They are stored in the freezer in a blue thingy. Should be easy to find. Ran a gel of the minipreps.
The T-group grabbed the thermal cycler before me, so I didn't make the PCR on the minipreps. But from the gelpicture it looks like we might have an insert:)
Did restreaks of the transformations which had grown.
01-10-2010 - Thomas - Antiterminator group
Ran a gel of PCR products of pAT02, 04, 06 and 07 (from 30-09) and then a PCR clean up and another gel of that. Both gels looked good, each band was the expected size. The purified PCR products were then digested with X and P.
Overnights were also done of the pAT01, pAT08, pAT11 and N+1C3 restreaks from thursday 30-09.
01-10-2010 Repressor group Maya and Lisa
The restriction products from yesterday (G1, G2 and RFP), and the PCR products RFP and GFP were purified and run on a gel. Everthing looked good, and this was the first time that we could actually see G1 and G2 on the gel after restriction. This was probably because two pcr products were pooled in one clean-up, and because the restriction was done in only 50 ul total volume rather than 100 ul.
We re-did some of the ligations that didn’t work yesterday. These were:
L1: pSB4A5 + G1 + GFP (Did work yesterday, but was repeated anyways)
L2: pSB4A5 + G2 + GFP (Did work yesterday, but was repeated anyways)
L5: pSB2K3 + BADZ1 + RFP
L6: pSB2K3 + BADZ2 +"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"

Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

DLUT_China,2018,Team:DLUT China B#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"                         nanobody in order to increase the interference of nano-antibodies on liquid crystals.
Firstly, We constructed two plasmids, pET28a and pBAD. The first plasmid pET28a contains a                         nanobody and a gene with an aldehyde-based catalytic substrate tag. The second plasmid, pBAD,                         contains the FGE (Formylglycine-generating enzyme) gene. Then we changed the conversion plan                         several times due to poor conversion efficiency, and finally got a satisfactory conversion                         rate.
We wanted to see that the substrate tag can be finally expressed at the inactive end of the                         nanobody in E. coli BL21, and has little effect on the conformation of the nanobody. In the                         cell, the substrate tag was converted to an aldehyde group by FGE treatment. Subsequently, after                         the transformation of aldehyde-based nanobody, we disrupted the cells by sonication and purified                         the disrupted cell suspension to obtain the nanobody we needed. Next step, we combined the                         Nanobody with C18. We have obtained a better experimental protocol by changing the                         conditions.
We designed a liquid crystal cell as the observation carrier. Firstly, we modified the slides                         with DMOAP which can induce vertical alignment of the liquid crystals, making the initial state                         of the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell black. Meanwhile, we modified the slides with                         APTES so that they can be attached to the β2-MG; Then we added β2-MG                         nanobody to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides were assembled, and the                         liquid crystals were added. We can observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell under                         the microscope to judge the β2–MG of the detected sample concentration.

Cornell_NY,2016,Team:Cornell NY#Integrated PracticesSomething_-_-_TEXT.html," Dr. Nydam lent us a field guide for mastitis that gave us a solid foundation of how we should move forward with bacteriocin testing. He also agreed to provide us with infected milk samples that we could use as test targets, and genomic preps of Lactococcus lactis and Bacillus subtilis, two promising bacteriocins that required genes too large to synthesize.   We then spoke to Dr. Nydam about the milking shell that we were developing for the milking machine to aid in the prevention of the disease. He particularly liked the iodine spray, UV light, and cold shock modules. He thought the idea of the cold shock was extremely innovative, but suggested that we talk to more experts to discover if physiologically it would work. No research seems to have been done on the temperature that would be required to achieve the cold shock.  We also spoke to Dr. Nydam about our ideas for the app we are going to give to farmers. He referred us to research articles he had read that would help us with the economic analysis of treating or culling a cow. He told us to refer to the published scientific literature for the most accurate descriptions to be used for CowMD, but that the symptoms for each type of mastitis often blur together so a search engine taking inputs of symptoms would not be useful. In addition, he was fascinated by the somatic cell counter and urged us to further pursue that option. While there are tests like the California Mastitis Test that already allow farmers to quickly detect mastitis, this new innovation could change the way the disease is approached and dealt with by farmers.   Dr. Nydam praised us for choosing a project in the dairy industry because of the strong agricultural presence in New York, along with the connections that Cornell has. Overall, Dr. Nydam emphasized something that everyone we have met has said: farmers want ease and effectiveness. Throughout the rest of the creation process, we kept that in mind through the rest of our project.

Windstott Farm
839 Indian Field Road, Genoa, NY 13071
The first farm recommended to us by Blane Murray that we visited was Windstott Farm, located in Genoa, NY. This farm was unlike other farms that we had been to, because it was a robot farm, and we were beyond excited to gain a different perspective on the needs and processes carried out at traditional dairy farms. We spoke to Bill Kilcer, the owner. He implemented robotic milking machines around 7 years ago for his farm of 130 cows. Robot"
EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," and level 2 labs. Anything involving normal E. coli is a level 1 biosafety risk. To give you some idea, you run the same risks of infection in a Level 1 workplace as you do in your own kitchen or at a pharmacy.
Does Switzerland impose any particular laws on biosafety?
There are two main federal laws that govern most biosafety regulations at the local level. One is ""La Loi sur les Zoonoses"" which translates as ""The Law on Animal Infection"" and the other is ""La Loi sur le génie génétique"" which translates as ""The Law of Genetic Engineering"". At the more local level, two ordinances play a major rule in sculpting our own protocols: one is the ""Ordonnance sur l'utilisation confinée"" (OUC) which defines the boundaries for genetic work, and the second is the ""Ordonnance sur la protection des travailleurs, collaborateurs exposés contre les risques liés aux microorganismes"" (OUM). The latter is more directly relevant to the work done at the EPFL. Finally, there is a local directive -- which does not have the force of law -- that tells us how to run our risk analysis for the labs at the EPFL.

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#humhub_-_-_TEXT.html," the survey respondees 6 teams did not collaborate, but 5 of these had looked for collaborators. All of these teams also replied that they had had problems contacting other teams. This is probably the main reason why they aren’t collaborating with anyone, but it might also be that they haven’t been able to find but a few interesting teams who unfortunately haven’t replied.
The Promise of HumHub
The Hub holds promise to solving many of the problems pointed out earlier. As the Hub could be used for iGEM communication alone, there would be no unnecessary distractions. It however works quite similarly as e.g. Facebook, and most team members would find it easy to use as they are already used to the way Facebook is set up. It would also remove the necessity of multiple platforms for intra- and interteam communication as is the case with e.g. Aalto-Helsinki at the moment. It would also help the problem of communicating with teams in countries where there may not be access to Facebook, or where Facebook may not be popular. If HumHub would be spread out through the headquarters, teams would be encouraged to use it and the communication between teams would likely be much easier.
Obviously it’s a question of getting used to things. A new platform doesn’t solve the problem that team members need to get used to checking a new place for information when they start with an iGEM project. But if HumHub became the norm of communication within iGEM, it’d be adopted by new teams fast and with little effort and it could also function as a means to find other teams to work with. Contacting others may also become more simple as teams would have less communication streams from different platforms coming in. If everything was focused on one platform, noticing new messages and replying to them may be more likely than staying on lookout for invitations to collaborate coming through e.g. Facebook, Twitter and email."

"
NUDT_CHINA,2018,Team:NUDT CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," market and we were lucky enough to interview Dr. Zhuo Song. As the CTO, he provided us with very pertinent ideas about our project as well as comprehensive answers to our problems, which inspired us quite a lot.
Our interview questions fallen into three aspects as follows:
The first is about the limitations of existing methods of reducing gene expression such as gene knockout, RNAi and novel gene editing techniques. We hope that through having a clear view on what problems still exist, we can know which kind of improvements that we actually need to focus on.
Dr. Zhuo told us that all traditional methods of reducing gene expression had efficiency problems and moreover, they also yielded unknown effects.
The next one is safety issue.  Although there are few clinical applications to degrade intracellular proteins at present, there is a general trend in market demand. The main problem is that the biological complexity leads to unknown practical application. Therefore, safety is the most essential topic we need to consider about.
Considering the safety issue about our project, Dr. Zhou raised two aspects.
1.Unknown effects in vivo environment
Dr. Zhou mentioned that the purpose of protein-specific degradation technology is to degrade abnormal or overexpressed proteins. The implementation of this method in vivo must ensure that it does not introduce other problems that are adverse to the organism. It should be noted that in vitro and in vivo environment are not equivalent.
2.Excessive protein degradation
From an evolutionary point of view, it is only the amount of protein present in an organism that determines its actual function. Therefore, the degree of protein degradation on the biological effects should also be taken into account. For example, the removal of certain overexpressed proteins may affect the normal physiological activities of the organism.
Last but not least, it is about the possibility of application. We hope based on his abundant market experience, Dr. Zhou can give us more detailed suggestions about the approaches to clinical application and marketization of our project. Here are some significant answers we get.
1. What difficulties do you think our project will meet in the result transformation?
Dr. Zhou: The first thing must be considered is security issues. Also, you have to look for clinical trials of medical institutions that are willing to cooperate. What’s more, you need to pay attention to the negative or positive result of the standard.
2. During the transformation of achievements in China, the situation that the intermediate process of commercialization and industrialization of scientific and technological achievements is missing, always occurs, which is related to both universities and enterprises. Can you give some suggestions to avoid the ""blank"" area?
Dr. Zhou: Much of the reason for the"
