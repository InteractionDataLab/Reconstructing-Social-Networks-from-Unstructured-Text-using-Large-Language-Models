ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#HumanPractice#NRP59_-_-_TEXT.html," synthesis of studies on biological issues of GMPs.
Interestingly, throughout the whole project, focus lied also on the communication of the results to the Swiss public and to the politicians, the decision makers.[3]
Results
Swiss agriculture in the mountains, an environment worth protecting
The results of 5 years of work in 30 projects worth an investment of 12 million Swiss francs (ca. 13 million US dollars) of NFP 59 were published on August 28th and a 300 pages long book was published online on September 11th in German and French and later, on September 21st in English.
The results of the NRP stated that there is no or very little risk of GMP for health and environment. At the same time, specifically for Switzerland, the benefit of using GMPs is low as well given today’s circumstances. Never the less, with new breakthroughs in research, the benefit of GMPs could increase, making them more attractive for Switzerland. From the analysis of over thousand studies from worldwide research about GMPs, no risks could be concluded. Any problems that occurred are not caused by GMPs but arise from bad agricultural practice such as extensive monoculture. The same result is found by the 11 projects of the NRP that dealt with environmental risks of genetically modified strawberry, potato and wheat: neither soil fertility nor microbes or useful insects were harmed by planting GMPs.
From a social perspective, 80% of the Swiss like to have the choice between gene-technique-free food and genetically engineered food which would be bought by 25 % of the Swiss. NRP proposes that the coexistence of genetically modified and non modified plants could be established in Switzerland with ‘zones’ of cultivation. Being a small country in the beautiful Alps, Switzerland has at the moment many small sites where crops can be planted, compared to bigger countries that can have much larger fields. The findings of NRP specifically evaluate the Swiss situation.
It was pointed out that outdoor research is necessary to evaluate the potential of GMP, since the behavior in controlled greenhouse environment might differ from the behavior in real nature, to good and to bad account [4].
Reactions
In March 2010, a preliminary report [5] stated that there is no off target effect observed for mildew resistant wheat. Neither plant louses nor other insects like flies that are domestic in Switzerland showed a different effect when fed with wild type or genetically manipulated wheat. Later, it was found out that even though wheat is resistant to mildew and showed a higher yield in the greenhouse, it performed less"

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," the GMO guidelines of the country allow the usage outside of a S1 laboratory.
The alginate capsules
To validate the persistence of the alginate capsules we cultivated beads containing encapsulated bacteria in LB medium (without any selective antibiotics) for several time periods (1h, 2h, 3h). Hourly OD600 measurement of the LB-Medium showed that there was no bacteria escape occurrence.Therefore we postulate that due to efficient fixation of the bacteria in the alginate polymer encapsulation escape is not possible. To validate that the absence of growth was not due to cell death in the encapsulation process we  dissolved the capsules in 55 mM sodium citrate for approx. 45 minutes. We analyzed  1ul of the solution through light microscopy and noted cell movement and activity. An increased OD600 after 1 hour of reculturing proved the viability of an uncertain percentage of cells in the capsules. Capsules were as well cracked mechanically and analyzed in the light microscope, where cells were visible in the alginate structures but did not show any movement. We did not measure the power needed to crack the capsules but did need several approaches before we finally managed to crack down the alginate structure to pieces which were small enough for microscopy. Due to our experience with capsule treatment we can assure that breaking of capsules and therefore GMO release will not occur in daily handling of the device. In addition even cracked capsule fragments still fix the GMO’s fierce enough to provide biosafety.  To determine lysis of capsules in solution - especially keeping in mind that the pH of vaginal samples which will be needed for chlamydia-testing is about 4.5 to 4.7 we incubated capsules in 100 mL 1 mM HCl and another sample in 100 mL 10 % acetic acid. As expected capsules dissolved quickly in both acidic solutions. After 15 min incubation about 75 % of capsules in the HCl-solution and about 50 % of the capsules in the acetic acid were already dissolved. Both solutions presented a pH of 1. Comparing these solution times to approx. 45 min solution time needed in sodium citrate (pH 7) we do not expect our capsules to lyse during approx. 30 min incubation in vaginal sample in the device. In addition capsule solution time correlates with solution/capsule ratio. We did not perform further testing but expect that lysis of capsules reaches a saturation at one point due to protonation of the used acid.
Risk assessment of our bacteria
Above we have highlighted many aspects of biosafety concerning the release of our bacteria"
Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Texttest_-_-_TEXT.html,"iled coil, called Metal Binding Domain (MBD). MBD reduces cost of metal binding. And then high-performance bioabsorbent was accomplished by inductively expressing MBD on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli cells. The following function test results showed that our bacteria can absorb more than 95% of 10-7 mol/L Hg (II) in 5 minutes; in consistent with previous work that artificial MBD chain can simulate the in vivo metal-binding ability of dimeric, full-length MerR.
    Additionally, we noticed that MerR family TFs share a high homology at their metal binding domains (Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007), which implies that our strategies of bioreporter and bioabsorbent engineering might be applicable to other cases. We then expanded our reverse engineering strategy to another common toxic heavy metal, lead (Pb)(Borremans et al., 2001; Chakraborty et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2005; Julian et al., 2009; Mergeay et al., 2003). We primarily took system (lead resistance operon) apart, followed by description of function, structure and operation of PbrR, a lead responsive regulator. Then modeling was conducted to analyze the characteristics of PbrR and topology of its regulation behavior. Knowledge from the analyses confirmed us the possibility to design

ECE 172 seemed to have trouble growing on the plate (no single colonies, just one big lump at the start of the streak)
ECE 150 grew too well! (possibly hard to pick out single colony)
Tubes:
ECE 176, 172, 153 seem to be quite clear!!
ECE 150, 151 had strange floating 'colonies' in the tube
All other tubes were quite cloudy

NEPTUNE DESIGN MOTIVATION
Neptune was designed to help lower the barrier of entry to microfluidics to any biologist by providing accessible, parametric, and free tools which can be used to make many iterations of devices quickly and cost-efficiently. We accomplished this by the sum of all of our deliverables that we are presenting and contributing to the iGEM community.

VALIDATION OF CONTRIBUTION
Your browser does not support the video tag.
NEPTUNE SOFTWARE DELIVERABLES
Neptune is an Open Source tool. All software components are readily available for download and installation by anyone on either Github or NONA.
Through Neptune’s Software User Interface, biologists can build their chip from the ground up. By creating a project in Neptune, a user is provided with all of the necessary tools to successfully build their device. At any point while using Neptune, the user can refer to their dashboard for helpful hints and progress tracking.
First, the user will be able to specify their design at a high level on the Specify page. Through the simple IDE tool, they can specify their design in terms of the inputs, outputs and any operations and features between those two in the Liquid Flow Relations (LFR) file. All of these operations and features are defined in the User Constraint (UCF) File, which is provided to the user by default. However if he or she wishes to add to or change the UCF file they may do so on this page. Once the user is finished describing their chip in the LFR file and have made any edits necessary to the UCF file, they can compile their code and move on to the Design stage of Neptune.
In the Design stage, the user is provided a more detailed description of their microfluidic in the form of a MINT (Microfluidic Netlist) file, which is automatically outputted from the Specify stage. If the user wishes to work with"

For this year’s iGEM team sponsorship, the CPL was interested in having us explore and work on cell mediated cytotoxicity, which is a subject area that they had not begun working on. We needed to obtain new cell lines and gene constructs from collaborators for our project as they were not already available in the lab. Additionally we needed to establish gene transfection techniques and killing assays. We obtained several natural killer cell lines from Lewis Lanier’s lab at UCSF. We also obtained plasmids containing single-chain antibody (scFv) constructs against the cancer antigens mesothelin and CD19 from the laboratory of Michael Milone at the University of Pennsylvania. Our host lab advised us on this early system work and also set up the Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) for the scFv constructs as they are proprietary. How was this years project put together and accomplished? Earlier in the year, Ryan Liang and Ethan Chan from last year’s iGEM team started working in the lab to start growing the cell lines, work out plasmid transient transfections, and killing assays. This early work was planned with feedback and advice from members of the CPL lab. This way Ryan and Ethan could get a jump start on some of the basic systems of the project before the rest of us arrived in June. The summer goes fast, so the project area needs to be defined and planning is necessary so we can accomplish something in 3 months.
Once all of us arrived for the summer, the advisors and instructors arranged a two-week Bootcamp where we learned about cytotoxic cells, the immune response to cancer, principles of protein signaling modules and circuits, and synthetic biology. They also introduced to us the previously described use of scFv modules with signaling domains to direct the cytotoxic response towards cancer cells (Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) as well as other receptors and signaling domains important in the cytotoxicity response.  At the end of the Bootcamp we were challenged by our advisors with two topics for a team challenge: 1.) how could we create synthetic logic gates to address different cancer vs normal cell antigen expression scenarios, and  2.) how could we create enhanced killing through the use of synthetic biology. We split into two teams and brainstormed and then we presented our designs to the entire group."

Saturday
One precious colony from the entire Gibson reaction! We're growing it up to test it tomorrow with IPTG and the MG2+ so we can see if it is what we thought it was.
Because of the ludicrously low efficiency of the Gibson demonstrated by weeks of effort, PJ has offered to run a Gibson and transformation in parallel with Tom to see if our master mix or transformations are at fault. We discovered that, for a two fragment reaction such as we have been doing, he usually gets thousands of colonies with only 3 μl of the final transformed cell suspension. We, on the other hand, got about one hundred with 200 μl. Obviously something is going rather wrong.
It could also be that our gel extractions are not very effective, given that the verification gels we've been running show that our DNA solutions are about 2 - 6 ng/μl (as opposed to 10 - 30 that we should be working with). If PJ and Tom get the same results as each other, we'll know that's the problem.
Some of us are beginning to get a bit panicky that it's already September...
Sunday
Well, the good news is that the colonies picked from yesterday seem to be fluorescing, indicating that they have indeed been transformed with the plasmid we had hoped. Unfortunately, they are fluorescing, indicating that the inhibition that should be caused by the lac I repressor is not working. Perhaps there are upstream regions that are vital to the successful function of the repressor, perhaps the riboswitch is messing up its function.
Initial search results indicate that magnesium is a considerable component of normal e.coli growth mediums such as LB broth. It tends to be in the area of 200 μM, well within the theoretical sensitivity range of our riboswitch, possibly explaining the fluorescence. Unfortunately, magnesium is also essential for growth, so we'll have to transform this construct into bacillus before we can properly determine its functionality.
Debugging of the Gibson protocol is also continuing, with Tom trying several different techniques to determine the best way to extract DNA from our gels. Sodium acetate shows initial promise, though more tests will have to be done to determine its efficacy.

Kill Switches
Introduction
Synthetic Biology has a vast array of potential applications beyond the limits of a sterile laboratory; from the degradation of explosive residue left in soil to enhancing the nutritional value of crop plants. As a result, it is necessary to implement control mechanisms over these synthetic organisms to ensure that they continue to function correctly and can remain contained to their intended environment.
Kill Switches: What are they?
Kill switches are devices incorporated into synthetic organisms which offer a potential mechanism of regulating the life cycles of the organisms. They are often designed such that they operate to terminate the organism when its intended function has been fulfilled. This concept is termed induced lethality.
Kill switches will often comprise a toxic gene product under the control of an inducible promoter. For the purposes of laboratory testing this promoter will likely be responsive to a simple common molecule which can be added to growth media, for example a sugar such as arabinose. However, this would ideally be responsive to a molecule indicative of the progression or completion of the cell's intended function. This could be concentration dependant or even just detecting the presence of the molecule such as in a biosensor.
Why we wanted one
As our synthetic E. coli are designed to degrade the residual explosives found in the ground at munition waste sites they would in theory be used actively in the soil. It would not be possible to simply release synthetic organisms into the environment without implementing essential biosafety mechanisms and it was therefore necessary for our project to include a kill switch.

Ligation of DNA
Ligation is the process in which a digested plasmid is covalently connected to an insert (PCR product), which has been digested with the same restriction enzyme(s). If both, the insert and the plasmid, had been digested with only one enzyme, it is strongly recommended to dephosphorylate the plasmid prior to mix the ligation sample. Otherwise it takes your whole Master thesis or Ph. D. thesis until you find a plasmid containing the insert. We are using the T4 DNA ligase, which is a standard enzyme for ligation. In contrast to the NAD+-dependent DNA ligase, which needs NAD+ as a cofactor, the T4 DNA ligase uses ATP. Moreover, while the NAD+- dependent DNA ligase can connect only DNA fragments with sticky ends, the T4 DNA ligase can ligate sticky and blunt ends.
The Material
T4 DNA ligase
10x Ligation buffer (keep aliquots on ice, contains ATP)
The Procedure

Moreover, the ligation/re-ligation ratio will tell you whether it is worth to analyze your clones.

Medical Society
The presentation given in the Judd medical society was focused on the issue of iron deficiency and excess iron in the body. The talk covered the prevalence of iron deficiency in the developing world and how our project is specifically designed for this demographic. The medical society presentation was a good opportunity to focus on the potential of our project in the real world before our interview with the haematologist. The medical society is attended by students from all years but primarily by sixth form who have an interest in studying medical sciences therefore the talk also covered why healthy iron is so fundamental to life and addressed common misconceptions surrounding anaemia and iron deficiency as well as discussing some of the latest research which illuminates just how harmful excess iron can be in body. We raised awareness about iGEM and synthetic biology among students who have expressed an interest in medicine and hopefully shown them the global positive impact can have in the medical field."

We began looking into using the Goldengate assembly method, but two gene elements contained a cut site that needed to be mutated out. We performed Site-Directed Mutagenesis using the Lightning Kit in the hopes of mutating out the cut site, but results were not successful due to mishandling during the protocol, so the procedure was set to be repeated. Gibson assembly of AVPR2-TEVs-GV16 continues as we re-PCRed the AVPR2 DNA segment and re-run the entire Gibson protocol, picking 20 colonies in a determined attempt to obtain a successful result.
July 10
Jenny and Jon - SDM Colony counts were approximately 50 for the control, 20 for the TEV, and 0 for the Gal4VP16. There is a chance the TEV and Gal4VP16 labels were switched, which we'll find out after sequencing. Six colonies were picked from the TEV plate and inoculations were accidentally run for 22 hours at 37C.
July 9
Jenny and Jon redid the SDM for Control, Gal4VP16, and TEV using the Lightning Kit, following pages 7 and 8 of this manual: www.qcbio.com/stratagene/210518.pdf
We used 1.5uL 100mM stock of the previously designed primers. The final reaction volume was only approximately 45uL, as we only had about 5uL of 5ng/uL dsDNA for both the Gal4VP16 and TEV reactions. We got the DNA from the dilutions that Divya and Tyler previously used.
For transformation, we followed the standard protocol instead of the one outlined in the manual and outgrew at 37C and incubated at 30C for 16 hrs.

The bacteria used are Escherichia coli XL-1-Blue and NEB Turbo (High Efficiency), which are commercially available E.coli strain derived from E.coli K12 and used for routine and widespread molecular biology studies. Derivatives of K12 are avirulent and may be considered to be ACDP biological agents hazard group 1 because they have an established record of safety in the laboratory with no adverse effects on human, animal or plant health or the environment. Furthermore E.coli XL-1-Blue is incapable of survival outside the laboratory.
Safety Issues
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
No facet of our project would cause significant safety issues. All work is to be contained in PC2 labs. Processes carried out will be done so only after training is received and will be supervised by a skilled instructor to ensure the proper protocols are followed. Our labs will also diminish risks by avoiding the use of carcinogenic products like ethidium bromide, and instead use a more safe nucleic acid stain. This stain – GelStar - does not require UV light to be visualized but blue light, making it safer. The environment will be protected from contamination by waste products because any dangerous material will be disposed of in the correct container (e.g. biohazard containers for biological waste such as E. coli colonies), autoclaved and disposed of responsibly by the university. Team members will also be taught proper molecular biology skills and aseptic techniques. Public safety is ensured as no member of the public is permitted access within the PC2 labs unless approved by the university. Team members will follow proper PCR facility procedures like washing their hands with disinfectant before leaving the laboratory to avoid transmitting potentially harmful material to the public/environment.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, o Did you document these issues in the Registry?  o How did you manage to handle the safety issue?  o How could other teams learn from your experience?
None of our newly engineered BioBrick parts raise safety issues. On the contrary, our system may actually help in reducing risk overall because if the platform works it will reduce the usage of chemicals associated with protein purification.

Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then"

After heat purification, we see a distinct band at around 31 kDa which is not present in the negative control. We can therefore hypothesize that this are Encapsulin monomers. All the other proteins that surrounded it before heat purification                       are not here anymore. This show that the Encapsulin has not been denatured during the process of heat purification, unlike the other ones. On top of that, we also still see the higher molecular weight band. This purification method                       is therefore suitable to HexaHistidine Encapsulin and allow us to get rid of the majority of the non desired proteins, as it can be seen on the gel.
The high molecular weight band on our SDS-PAGE gels gives good hints that the Encapsulin properly assembles in its spherical form. However, we performed DLS measurements to assess if fully assembled 60-mers nanoparticles occurred.

Figure 8: DLS measurements of Encapsulin K2686002 using a Zetasizer Nano ZS from Malvern Analytical determining the average particle size using volumes, intensities                     and counts. The refractive index chosen for the particles was the ""protein"" presetting and the refractive index of the medium was approximated to be that of water. These plots shows a peak at 21.037nm,18.166nm and 32.674nm which corresponds                     to the encapsulin protein cage within the literature (Putri et al., 2017; Moon et al. 2014) when taking into account the peculiarities of each measurement method, since Intensity is highly sensitive to small amount of larger aggregates                     (these could be some small aggregated proteins, explaining the larger size of the peak). The counts and volume based methods require the refractive indices and absorbance coefficients to be known (these were merely approximated) creating                     a source of error ((Stetefeld, McKenna and Patel, 2016)(Zetasizer user manual)).

SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#officialjudging_-_-_TEXT.html," wanting to tackle was that  of GMO’s and the way they are perceived by the public.
The idea
At first we talked about just making one movie where the different teams would contribute with their part and the editing would be spread out amongst the teams. This approach was abbandoned though and each team was then tasked with producing their own movies. After a couple of weeks of planning, writing scripts and making mission statements for our movies we were ready to shoot the first set of interviews. By making this video we hope that the average joe might understand or at least appreciate our efforts to better the world, and not perceive our hard work as a means to corrupt the natural order of things.
The message
The purpose of this video is to build a bridge between scientists and the general public. Using it as a way to inform people in general about the ethical and philosophical aspects of genetic modification and how human technological advancement has enabled us to manipulate naturally occurring systems into workhorses of great benefit to modern society. By openly discussing the issues that arise when dealing with GMO’s we hope to remove the stigma that has surrounded the field for a long time and try to dispel any rumours that people might have heard. We want to achieve this by showing the world what scientists think about the issues regarding genetic manipulation.
The video
The video will focus on the way humans have taken advantage of the fact that microbes behave as small molecular machines. We will take a look at what makes these machines “alive” by interviewing Martin Hanczyc who is a specialist on fundamental living systems. In our interview with Martin Hanczyc we will focus on what it means that something is alive and how life is “simply” a set of chemical reactions happening under thermodynamically favourable conditions. One can not deny that the biotechnology industry is big and ever growing. One of the key players on the market is Novo Nordisk who produce insulin for diabetes patients  using genetically modified organisms. We wanted to hear what a global company the size of Novo Nordisk has to say when faced with the ethical dilemmas that arise on the field of synthetic biology. We believe it is important to show that companies like Novo Nordisk are not just out to generate money, but are actually striving to better the lives of people around the world. We had the chance to interview Esper Boel who is vice president of the biotechnology group at Novo and a man with more than 30 years of experience in the field. From our interview with Esper we learned that the people working at Novo Nordisk are dedicated and hard working on making peoples lives better. You can"
Aberdeen_Scotland,2010,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#Evolution_-_-_TEXT.html," the brightest colours and thus use the strongest ones. Once we had this, we could put the proteins through the system again as initial conditions and then we would have a more distinctive switch.
Pros
Directed evolution can systematically perturb and distinguish components then, using these perturbed components, we can gain further insight into the functionality of the normal circuit.
If some of the pathways enhance the desired performance, then iterative rounds of random mutation of the circuit and screening for the desired properties may provide steady improvement.  This only works if the initial design is close to a better design.
Why use maths to model directed evolution?
There are three primary limitations that mathematical modelling can overcome:
 
1. The evolutionary space for a genetic circuit is too large to explore efficiently.
 
2. Refining our parameters is much easier than improving (or altering) the system experimentally.
 
3. Although selecting for independent properties is possible, it usually requires setting up multiple rounds of screening or selection.
Procedure
 
1. We first took the basic program where we integrated the system, plugging in an estimation of the parameters.
 
2. For each parameter, it yielded the value for which we obtain the largest difference between GFP and CFP.
 
3. We then fixed our chosen parameter and continue the program with the next parameter.
 
4. This can be done over and over for each parameter of the model, eventually producing a clearly defined switch that will somewhat resemble our original system.
 
5. Repeat these steps for each parameter in the system to eventually produce a clearly optimized switch that will yield the maximum difference between GFP and CFP when switching from one state to the other.
Results
Fig 1. shows the behaviour of the original system over a set period of time.
Fig 1.
As shown, the system has been integrated over a long enough timespan such that it has reached equilibrium.
Once we had this, we could then do this again but change one parameter and instead insert a range of values that can be put through the system.
Then we found the value for that parameter that produced the largest difference between the two proteins. We did this for each parameter until we had an “ideal” value for each one. Finally, we entered these values into the system and integrated it again.
Fig 2.
Fig 3.
Fig 2. shows our final result of the mRNAs and the two proteins. We can see at first that CFP was the brightest protein initially, then we added more galactose and, at around time = 50, we can clearly see the decline of CFP and the increase of GFP.  Fig"

Emmm
On realizing the problem, we decided that we literally had no handful tools to help us on these concerns. After talks with professors, we decided to carry out face-to-face interviews in four big cities in China and reveal people’s attitudes toward three synthetic biology questions: GM(Genetically modified) food, embryonic editing and diabetes (and insulin).
Ooops
After finishing the street interviews, we analyzed the data and had another discussion with Dr. Yuan to figure out the possible reasons why the interviewee have discrete opinions, and the things we discovered may turn out to be as simple but also hard for anyone to imagine.
Ding
Up till this stage, we have investigated the problem against the public, sorted out the data accordingly and sought through the potential problems. We wanted to start several activities (education, collaboration, open day event and others) that could have impacts on people of different ages and education backgrounds and even our peers who are also studying (synthetic) biology.
Bang
At the final stage of the project, we have decided that what we did so far were all one-direciton moves. The iGEM HP spirit inspired us to do more so that efforts from each member of the society could be applied to shorten the cognitive distances. Therefore, we have made propositions for each aspect of the society to work together, and hopefully we will minimize the cognitive gap in places outside China as well.

Emily worked on the presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools; Ashlee and Emily collaborated on the demonstration for the teachers. Ashlee and Emily digested Plasmid 1 in order to insert the dCas9 system. We first digested the backbone for ~4 hours with ClaI restriction enzyme, heat inactivated the enzyme at 65 degrees C for 20 minutes, cleaned the digestion, then digested for ~4 hours with SalI-HF. We have to do this because of the high fidelity binding of SalI and the fact that the two restriction sites are very close together. HF enzymes could remain bound tightly and block ClaI from binding.
Cleaned up PCR from Sunday. Concentration of DNA was very high (>1000 ng/ul. Sent plasmids that displayed correct band on 7/4 for sequencing with Quintara. Prepared cryo stock of cells harboring these plasmids.

Ashlee and Emily worked on finalizing the presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools. We also ran the digest of plasmid 1 on a gel and PCR Rescued the dCas9 system. Many dCas9 PCRs were not very successful, and we did more troubleshooting. We increased the elongation time to 3 minutes (~30 seconds per kb of DNA plus an extra 30 seconds - dCas9 is 5.5 kb) and we set the annealing temperature to 58 degrees Celsius. We tested changing the annealing temperature previously, and 58 degrees C had the most success. We ran our 8 PCR reactions on a gel and found that 7 of them worked! We have solved the problem of poor dCas9 PCRs! Ashlee also updated the website logo and several other spots around the website.

Combination with pulsed electric fields ( Top )
A combination of bacteriocins and technologies, such as pulsed electric fields, enables us to disrupt the cellular membrane for penetration of the cell and have been suggested to be highly effective Dan, Y., et al. (2012). ""Bacteriocins Produced by Lactic Acid Bacteria a Review Article."" APCBEE Procedia 2: 50-56. . This method could be a way for us to give the hybrid bacteriocin Laterosporulin-ThuricinS access to cross the cell membrane of P. aeruginosa. This technology can also be a way for us to optimize the effectiveness of the bacteriocins generally.
Bacteriocins as probiotics ( Top )
Probiotics are living microorganisms that when consumed in modest amounts, it confer to health benefits for the host. Studies have demonstrated the impact of bacteriocin-producing strains’ ability to compete within complex microbial communities and thereby influence the health of the host. It was shown that bacteriocins are able to directly inhibit the invasion of competing strains or pathogens, or modulate the composition of the microbiota. This can have an influence on the host immune system Dobson, A., et al. (2012). ""Bacteriocins Bacteriocin production: a probiotic trait?"" Appl Environ Microbiol, 78, 1-6. . However, when using bacteriocins as probiotics it is important to make a thorough evaluation of the ethical aspects of it, as well as a risk assessment.
It is suggested that probiotics producing bacteriocins could lead to positive probiotic functionality in a number of ways:
Bacteriocins could function as colonizing peptides, facilitating the introduction and dominance of a producer into an already occupied niche, thereby facilitating the competition of probiotic bacteria with the unfavourable resident bacteria.
Bacteriocins could act as antimicrobial peptides that directly inhibits competing strains or pathogens.
Bacteriocins could function as signalling peptides that either 1) signals other bacteria through quorum sensing and bacterial cross talk within microbial communities, or 2) through signalling cells of the host’s immune system Dobson, A., et al. (2012). ""Bacteriocins Bacteriocin production: a probiotic trait?"" Appl Environ Microbiol, 78, 1-6. .

2. Methanol to biomass
Back to sub-goals
The goal of this final step is to break down methanol to biomass, so E. coli can utilize methanol as an energy source. Methanol is an one carbon structure that is toxic to the cell. There is however a group of microorganisms that utilizes methanol as an energy source. The group of microorganism that has the ability to grow with only a one carbon compounds as the single carbon source are called methylotrophes1. One such methylotrophe is Bacillus methanolicus (B. methanolicus), which was used in this project. In this step three enzymes have to be added in E. coli in order to go from methanol to fructose-6-phosphate; methanol dehydrogenase (Medh2), Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps), and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi).
Methanol to formaldehyde
Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde in all aerobic methylotrophes by the enzyme methanol dehydrogenase (Medh).  However, the oxidation can occur in two different pathways. Methanol metabolism in probacteria occurs by Periplasmic pyrroloquinoline quinone (PPQ) containing methanol dehydrogenase"

WITS-CSIR_SA,2011,Team:WITS-CSIR SA#Project#Concept_-_-_TEXT.html," by Sinha et al (2010). In order to make this riboswitch compatible with biobrick assembly, Pst1 site was removed by creating a G:U wobble base pair in lower stem region (Figure 8).
Figure 8. Atrazine responsive riboswitch. We have referred to this riboswitch as atrazine riboswitch (atRS) (Sinha et al., 2010). (Click to enlarge)
We have identified that several theophylline riboswitches have been previously described by other iGEM teams. (For reference, see Lethbridge 2007, Lethbridge 2009 and NYMU Taipei 2010). One of our initial concerns was whether it was possible to isolate the riboswitch from the associated translational unit (coding region). Being able to do so would allow the riboswitch to be defined independently as a BioBrick, with the useful ability to act in a modular fashion for fusion to any adjacent translational unit. All previous teams have made this assumption. Our aim is to show that the riboswitch and its adjacent coding region should be considered together and should be cloned as one biobrick, or an alternative ""acanonical"" assembly standard should be used.
Team NYMU Taipei 2010 assumed that a created theophylline riboswitch (Gallivan lab clone 8.1) biobrick could be fused to a GFP coding region by standard biobrick assembly techniques. While it is possible to do this, we feel that the resulting 6 nt scar sequence insertion increases the distance between the RBS and the AUG start codon, a result which is likely to cause a decrease in riboswitch efficiency (see riboswitch construction in Figure 9:  inserted biobrick “scar” region highlighted in turquoise; AUG start underlined). In fact, Taipei did show data which showed only a 2.5 fold increase in gene activation at approx. 4 mM theophylline. Compared to the 36-fold activation at 1mM theophylline by Gallivan lab, this seems quite low. We therefore feel that this riboswitch is not behaving efficiently.

Initial Brainstorm Ideas
A biosensor for a world wide disease
Detecting PAMPs in bacterial by a novel cleavage mechanism in simulated serum samples
* Detecting pneumolysin for strep. pneumo by using specific antigens/receptors
IDEA #1
PAMPS are referred to as pathogen associated molecular patterns, they're basically parts of bacteria that are recognized by our immune system as foreign. I've followed up and researched a bit more about this idea and propose that we could possibly:
Introduce a number of genes into a particular cell line, since each of our cells have specific proteins called caspases that are cleaved upon detecting a bacterial product (e.g Flagellin from bacteria); these caspases normally cause a number of processes that leads to cell death but ONLY upon sensing bacterial products, they become active. However, if we could somehow get caspases to recognize a particular protein (e.g green florescent protein - GFP) into our introduced samples and cleave it so that GFP becomes active, then we've developed a cool biological sensor that can detect particular bacterial products. Of course, similarly we'd have to make sure that we prevent cell death from occurring (this could be through the introduction of inhibitors of effector caspases e.g Caspase 3 that are the actual executors of cell death.)
Below I've attached a review on caspases https://yuan.med.harvard.edu/sites/yuan.med.harvard.edu/files/documents/onc2008297a.pdf
An insightful page on GFP (note there's also other different colours e.g YFP, RFP that could also be introduced as well - so that if we introduce other different bacterial products, e.g instead of flagellin something else like LPS than it would florescence a different color)
http://www.conncoll.edu/ccacad/zimmer/GFP-ww/shimomura.html
I've also attached a paper that demonstrates the feasibility of this approach (at least in recognition and cleavage of a fluorescent protein) in this paper they basically were able to engineer a GFP that can be cleaved by caspases and becomes active.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21558267 - probably just read the abstract, bottom lines.
I'm happy too explain to anyone about caspases and how this system works - perhaps when we come to initial ideas and anyone is interested, I can draw a"

I was involved with the planning and execution of the Biobrick Tutorial. Have been helping in contacting schools for the elementary school project and doing the presentations. Mostly, though, I have been involved in the mycolab and the overall work with the fungi: Determining ideal substrates and conditions for the bricks to grow as well as doing protoplastations and transformations of the fungi.
David Lokjær Faurdal
Initially, my involvement has been administrative in nature; planning meetings, brainstorming sessions, collaborations and the BioBrick tutorial. Since then, my main occupation has been the synthetic biology of the project, which entails a lot of (re)designing constructs and lab work (including the Interlab Study). Additionally, as team leader, I’ve interacted a lot with the other arms of the project to discuss all sort of details and trying to keep things coherent.

I have been heavily involved with the creation of the high school iGEM team (CHSS) together with Tenna. In addition to this, I have been in charge of contact with Ecovative Design and helped with presenting in the elementary school project.

Chemisty & Chemical Biology '19
Legend speaks of a wet lab member in the depths of the dungeons of Weill Hall. He emerges victorious with a test tube, tempered by a smokin hot thermal cycler, a PCR for the ages. He then casts a gel with extraordinary precision before running his sample. His secret to perfection? Eating rice and beans for lunch everyday. This man is a brilliant chemistry major. This man is a veritable force of nature. This man is Itai. But what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? Itai places his finished gel on the UV transilluminator. He clicks it on and realizes his mistake. Fiendish ultraviolet photons attack his eyes. He fights them off to the best of his ability, but later this war ravaged veteran falls at the iGEM social, succumbing to his wounds. Cornell iGEM can thank It-EYE for his heroic sacrifice. Without it and his steadfast labor and creativity as part of the wetlab subteam, our project would never come to fruition.

Figure 6. Absorbance measured for different treatments of Nuc using P. aeruginosa as biofilm-producer.
The graph illustrates how the combination of supernatant and resuspended pellet of Nuc cell lysate inhibits the formation of biofilm by P. aeruginosa. As the treatment increases, the absorbance tends to increase as well. There is a significant difference (p=0.02) between the negative control and Nuc S for the 1 µl treatment.
Figure 7. Absorbance measured for different treatments of Nuc using S. aureus as biofilm-producer.
The graph illustrates how the combination of supernatant and resuspended pellet of Nuc cell lysate inhibits the formation of biofilm by S. aureus. The negative control seems inconsistent; it may be that it is dose dependent in S. aureus or that it has been contaminated. This experiment showed a significant difference between 1 µl of negative control and Nuc S, as well as between 20 µl of negative control and Nuc P. However, these results may not be reliable.
Biofilm assay: Second Attempt [❌]
The second attempt of inhibiting biofilm growth was similar to the first. However, this time a combination of pellet and supernatant was used as treatment with the ratio 1:1, e.g. for 5 µl treatment, 2.5 µl of each was used. For this attempt the biofilm was treated with 5 µl, 20 µl and 50 µl of Nuc. The samples were labelled ""Nuc"" and the negative control was labelled ""Neg"". Only one volume of negative control was used.

Common Health Magazine is famous for reporting health-related information. Business Weekly is the second popular magazine in Taiwan.     We search for 63 issues of journals and among them found 50 articles related to gene-tech.

This included distributing lab work (e.g. Asal and Rob focusing on making lux plates while others worked on Cas-Find, and (later on) Rob following up on FLIM work), creating Gantt charts, Asal taking on Human Practices solo, and another delivery delay which evened it all out. In H.P., we hosted our first outreach event, with a stall at a STEM event at our university, allowing us to reach out to prospective students and introduce them to iGEM and international science. Finally, a stroke of luck ended up with Cardiff being invited to EE16, a European meet-up of iGEM teams hosted by iGEM IONIS, so Chris and David got to spend a weekend away in Paris while the rest of the team stayed in sunny exotic Wales to present a stall at a second STEM open day, this time with an interactive display with glow in the dark plates.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer."
Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eukaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html,"NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) is a transcription factor (TF) which regulates many different target genes resulting in the expression of various proteins. In most cell types (with the exception of B cells and Dentritic cells) NF-κB is bound to the Inhibitor of κB (IκB) withholding NF-κB from entering the nucleus. When the cell becomes activated by an extra cellular stimluli, IκB is degraded and NF-κB can enter the nucleus. Within the nucleus NF-κB is able to enhance transcription of genes which are involved in immune response, cell proliferation or cell survival, depending on cell type and extra cellular stimuli [11] . In many cells NF-κB regulates anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. TRAF1/2) and therby preventing cell death. Therefore mutations of NF-κB resulting in a constitutively active form are often associated with unregulated cell proliferation and cancer [12] . In macrophages the NF-κB signalling pathway could be activated by binding of bacterial lipopolysacchride (LPS). There NF-κB activation leads to secretion of cytokines which influence other lymphocytes.

p53
P53 is a transcription factor (TF) which is involved in several physiological processes. One major function of P53 is cell cycle regulation. P53 is often activated through DNA damage or other cellular stresses like cell cycle abnormalities, hypoxia and oxidative stress. In normal cells the P53 level is kept low by the protein HDM2, which attaches ubiqutin to P53 (acts as ubiquitin ligase). The ubiquitylation of P53 leads to its degradation by the proteasome. In response to cellular stress P53 is phosphorylated and changes its conformation in a way preventing HDM2(mdm2 is the analog protein in mouse) binding. Conformational changes also result in the exposion of the DNA binding domain. This activation of P53 leads to farreaching alteration of gene expression. The cell cycle is stopped between G1 and S phase and DNA repair systems are switched on. If the cell damage is intense P53 accumaltion can also lead to apoptosis of the cell. Because of its roles in DNA protection and cell cycle regulation P53 mutation is often correlated with cancer [13] .

The purpose of the Student House is to have a forum where university students can come to study or to  take part in social events. Volunteers are responsible for the café area, where different events  take place frequently. Our team arranged a Microorganism Quiz and Presentation Night at the Student  House where around fifty people participated. Our presentation was about the main concepts of iGEM and  synthetic biology and additionally an overview of our own project. The presentation was followed by our quiz about microorganisms. Every question had a preamble  concerning microorganisms but the question usually was a digression from the subject. Our idea with the  event was that the questions should apply to anyone and it ended up being a great success for this reason.
Article in SUND&HED
SUND&HED is a university newspaper directed to health science and medical students. We wrote an article about iGEM and our project, which will be published in late October.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#team:amsterdam#collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," cattle. We explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies. As iGEM UNL is working on E. Coli and iGEM Amsterdam on the production of  fumarate, we first define a strategy to make a fumarate producing E. Coli mutant. Then we assess the mechanism to reduce methane emissions with fumarate. Finally, we explore different ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system.
How E. Coli can produce fumarate
E. Coli can in theory produce fumarate by an oxidative (aerobic) or a reductive (anaerobic) route. In the latter case, the fumarate molecule itself is used as a final electron donor in this process, which is believed to be coupled with cell growth in anaerobic conditions (Iverson et al. , 1999). It is assumed that for this reason, it is not possible to genetically engineer E. Coli to produce fumarate in anaerobic conditions (Song et al. , 2013). This is problematic,as the cattle rumen is anaerobic.
Now if it would be possible to introduce E. Coli in aerobic conditions in the cow’s digestive system, we would be able to use aerobically producing fumarate E. coli strains. For this, we could imitate a genetic engineering strategy used by the iGEM Amsterdam project.
How team Amsterdam produces fumarate in Cyanobacteria
In the Cyanobacterial model organism Synechocystis PCC 6803 , iGEM team Amsterdam managed to produce fumarate in a genetically stable, growth-coupled way, by knocking out the fumarase encoding fumaric acid hydratase (fumC) gene.
How we can apply the Amsterdam genetic engineering strategy in E. Coli
To apply a similar approach in E. Coli and to end up with a respectable titer, multiple gene knock-outs are required. E. Coli has more fumarase encoding genes, then Synechoscystis,  namely anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumB) and aerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumA), which both need to be knocked out as well (Song et al. , 2013). Knocking out the Fumarase proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from fumarate. This"

Overview
Attaching functional proteins to cellulose can expand the properties of cellulose and allow us to selectivity capture specific contaminants in water. By creating fusion proteins of sfGFP and metal-binding proteins with five different cellulose binding domains, three of which are new to the registry, we were able to characterise the relative affinities of the CBDs and show proof-of-concept removal of contaminants from water.
Key Achievements
Added three new cellulose binding domains to the registry
Performed an assay with sfGFP-fusions to determine the strongest potential binders which could be carried forward for further testing
Identified potential metal binding proteins to bind heavy metals from wastewater, including the addition of a new promising polypeptide phytochelatin EC20
Tested metal ion capture ability of the CBD-phytochelatin fusion constructs when attached to cellulose
Introduction
Figure 1. Pictorial summary showing the two cellulose functionalization approaches considered in our project. Strategy 1: Cellulose binding domains are expressed as fusions with the protein of interest, separated optionally by a linker sequence. The cellulose binding domains attach to the cellulose by hydrophobic interactions. Strategy 2: Curli fibrils are expressed in parallel with cellulose to form a composite material. The curli fibres coding sequence is modified to contain a ‘SpyTag’ peptide (Zakeri et al 2012) which binds specifically via a covalent isopeptide bond to its protein partner, ‘SpyCatcher’."

RNA-processing and transcriptional regulation
Post-transcriptional modification / mRNA processing in eukaryotes
To express a gene and successfully synthesize the appropriate protein the gene must firstly transcript into mRNA. Unlike in bacteria, this mRNA molecule is not directly ready for translation; the primary transcript is therefore called precursor-mRNA (pre-mRNA). One of the first modifications is a process referred to as 5’-capping. By means of several biochemical steps a 7-methylguanosine molecule is bound to the 5’ end of the pre-mRNA, via a 5’ to 5’ triphoshpate linkage.  This 5’ cap has various functions including prevention of 5’ degradation, export from the nucleus and initiation of translation.  Not only the 5’ end but also the 3’ end is modified, this process is called polyadenylation. Therefore a Polyadenylation signal is needed (consensus sequence 5'- AAUAAA-3'), further in the 3’ direction occurs a 5’-CA-3’ element, these both sequences are recognized by the enzymes cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor and cleavage stimulation factor. Together they are attracting many other proteins including Polyadenylate Polymerase (PAP). The protein complex cuts the pre-mRNA at the CA element and the PAP adds about 200 adenine residues to the 3’ end.  The function of the poly-A tail is protection against degradation, marking of the end of the transcript and aid in translation initiation.  The pre-mRNA contains not only these sequences coding for the protein, so called exons, but also many sequences which are non-coding. These introns have to be removed, that occurs in a process known as splicing. A protein complex called spliceosom connects all the exons thereby cutting out the introns. Responsible for the recognition of the exon-intron borders are small nuclear RNA within the spliceosom. Many genes can be spliced in several ways, an incident termed alternative splicing [48] , [49] .

Regulation of transcription in eukaryotic organisms
Cells have to adapt to changes in their environment and must be able to receive and react to extra cellular signals; cells accomplish these requirements by the up and down regulation of certain proteins. The protein expression in eukaryotic cells can be regulated on many different levels, this article concentrate on the regulation of transcriptions.  Only a small"

PcelA and PcomFA promoters are promoter that is regulated by σx. We have proven that in the presence of σx, PcelA and PcomFA could express GFP. However, we did not manage to characterize the GFP expression of PcelA and PcomFA in different concentration of σx. So, a possible future work is to put inducible promoter upstream of RBS (BBa_B0034), σx gene, and terminator (BBa_B0015). An example of inducible promoter is BBa_I0500. Hence, by putting an inducible promoter, we can tune the level of σx expression and characterize Com-Box promoters (PcelA and PcomFA) on different level of σx concentration.
Moreover,ComW is a protein that function to protect σx from degradation. It is necessary to have ComW protein as it could increase the amount of σx to regulate PcelA and PcomFA promoters. However, due to the time constrains, we were unable to finish the construct of ComW generator. Hence, possible future work would be continuing ComW generator construct by ligating BBa_K880005-comW to a double terminator (BBa_B0015), and introduce it to E.coli DH10B strain. Then, characterization of comW could be performed by measuring the amount of σx with and without ComW protein.

Introduction
    The state of Guanajuato is located amongst the 15 entities with more incidence of severe burns in Mexico. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2016) the majority of burns  which are preventable, occur mainly at home. Besides that, it is estimated that every year 265 000 deaths are reported, and non-fatal burns are the main cause of morbidity, which are caused by sepsis produced by pathogenic microorganisms. In the state of Guanajuato, Mexico, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis are of special interest, as they are reported to be the main pathogenic bacteria found in skin burns (Moctezuma-Paz et al., 2015). The traditional health system provides a treatment based on the use of antibiotic, analgesic and antihistamine medications which sometimes results inefficient and expensive. According to Allevato (2007)  “an alternative for this is the use of transdermal patches of prolonged liberation, which could release medicine or metabolites of therapeutic interest at a determined rate“. Recently, it was reported the development of two biosensors using Escherichia coli as chassis, to detect and kill P. aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacteria. The first biosensor was designed to detect AHLs through the LasR protein, and to synthesize pyocin S5  together with an E7 lysis protein mechanism that lyses E. coli in order to release the pyocin S5 molecules that kill P. aeruginosa (Saeidi et al., 2011).
    The second biosensor synthesizes the LasR, CheZ,  DNaseI and microcin S, to sense, move and destroy the biofilms and the bacteria (Hwang et al., 2013). In addition to this, the iGEM Groningen 2014 (https://2014.igem.org/Team:Groningen) developed a biosensor using Lactococcus lactis as chassis, which senses, and produces dispersin and lactonase to destroy"

before 5pm: innoculate yeast cultures of successful transformations from 7/4/08 and later in order to make glycerol stocks and also to run tests tomorrow
--------------------------------------------------
Checked on the plated transformations from the second round- all were successful, and there was no growth of the negative control.
Devised a plan for setting up the plate test:
Make SD-Trp-Ura media with a 2 mM (2000 microM) concentration of methionine.  This will be easily diluted to the various concentrations required (25 uM, 50 uM, 100 uM, 200 uM, 350 uM, 500 uM, and 1000 uM).
M.W. (Met)= 149.2 g/mol
thus, 2 mM solution has .2984 g/L
250 mL Recipe for SD-Trp-Ura with 2mM Met
6.815g SD Dropout media powder
.5g Histidine
1g Leucine
.0746 g Methionine
Test #1:  We have decided to use a 96 well plate reader to measure the fluorescence emitted by our various parts.  For the time being, it appears that this will be sufficient.
The protocol is as follows:
Apparently the doubling time of W303_1a, the strain used for all of the transformations, is 2.8 h.  This was gleaned from the following source: http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1140095.  Other sources appear to range between 95 min and about 3 h, depending upon the media.
We have decided to sweep across different levels of methionine.  For the activators, we will need to invetigate as to whether the presence of raffinose is necessary, especially since this sugar was used in the yeast memory paper by Caroline Ajo-Franklin.

Also Bba_K1976029 was amplified by PCR using Prim-0.72-FW and suffix right. Following that both were ligated into the backbone pSB1C3 which was digested using EcoRI and PstI and dephosphorylated, using our standard protocol for the antarctic phosphatase. Following that using the standard T4 protocol, these fragments were ligated together.
E. coli Top10 were then transformed with the ligated plasmid. Following that a colony PCR was performed to check for the proper band height.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," does not bear all the features of the implementation of Biotic Blue as it was developed due to time requirements before its design reached the current state.
Figure 6. Prototype of Biotic Blue
Comparative analysis
In the following Table 3 the advantages and disadvantages of Biotic Blue are presented, indicating the points of superiority compared to existing solutions and the features that need further development. Table 3 can be used as a valuable guide for future improvement driving through different stages the evolution of Biotic Blue.
Table 3. Advantages and disadvantages of Biotic Blue implementation in WWTPs.
Although Biotic Blue may not be the ultimate solution for treating pharmaceuticals in WWTP, undoubtedly, it bears significant competitive advantages against its two major competitive methods, Ozonation and Activated carbon. Our solution has a higher cost-effectiveness profile, lower operational energy consumption, does not pose any threat to its handlers and the environmental risk of degradation residues is less than Ozonation by-products.
In comparison to Activated Carbon, Biotic Blue has significant cost benefits since the magnetic beads can be retrieved in a more efficient way and they can be regenerated with lower capital demands as well. Furthermore, our solution offers lower installation costs and space requirements, making it particularly attractive for WWTP with limited available space.
However, at this point it is important to highlight that the implied capability of Biotic Blue to immobilize any enzyme on the magnetic beads, allows it to potentially treat wastewater contaminated by any mixture of pharmaceuticals. This unique tailoring capability according to the synthesis of the contaminants in the inflow is what makes Biotic Blue resource-efficient, outperforming the other solutions.
Validation
We have successfully immobilized the fungal laccase on magnetic beads. The following images show that the immobilized enzymes were functional (Figure 7) and that the magnetic beads can be captured and separated from water solution using a magnet (Figure 8).
Figure 7. On the left: Control.
On the right: Immobilized laccases showing activity (color change) when ABTS (a laccase model-substrate) was added.
Figure 8. Recovery of immobilized magnetic beads on a magnetic rack.
Impact on Society
""Our feet may stand on Stockholm, surrounded by the water of the Baltic Sea but our eyes rest on our whole planet.""
With this in mind we considered the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals as the ideal framework to show the impact of Biotic Blue on society.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as Global Goals, are a set of universal goals, targets and indicators that meet the most urgent challenges facing"

- 15 mL centrifuge tube: 5 mL LB + 0.5 mL E coli B liquid culture overnight + 10 uL of phage
- autoclaved test tube: 1 mL of LB + 100 uL E coli B liquid culture overnight + 10 uL of phage
Wild-type and mutant phages were allowed to propagate for approximately 24 hours before purified via centrifugation and choloroform.
Spot tests at -2, -4, -6, and -8 was performed for each sample to estimated phage concentration after propagation.
Each phage sample was then plated at -7 using x4 agar to verify the mutants' phenotypic stability after propagation.
3) TEM (10.16)
Phage Purification Team set up copper grids and arranged for TEM appointments to look at S4, S10 and L8
4) Sequencing (10.17-10.?)
During the week when we were waiting for the new sequencing primers (BI319 and BI320) to arrive, we where able to isolate a new mutant phage S21. Thus, we will sequence S4, S10, S21, L8, and WT T7 phage to map out mutations altering phage capsid sizes.
DNA isolation, PCR, and gel electrophoresis protocol was similar to that of 5.20 T7 Minor Capsid Protein PCR
Note for sequencing we used the primers BI257 and BI258.
V) Results
2) Propagating Mutant Phage
Plaque formed up to -6 for each sample, implying a concentration of at least 10E8 PFU/mL
Propagated phage retained their larger or smaller capsid size as confirmed by their smaller and larger plaque sizes at x4 agar.
VI) Conclusion
We have taken several EM's of the phage, but have yet to get results for their capsid sizes. We hope to accomplish this before we leave for the jamboree.

Collaborations
Collaboration is of great importance in iGEM competition. Through collaborations, iGEM teams help each other to promote a good result for everybody. We have been actively seeking collaborations with other iGEM teams to discuss our projects and learn from their experience.
1. Team Tianjin
iGEM team Tianjin comes from School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University. We helped them to detect the activity of CUP1 promoter. Fluorescence was measured, and the results were presented below:
Besides, Team Tianjin helped us construct a plasmid that can express lyase upon the presence of xylose.
2. Team Jilin_China
iGEM team JLU had problem with the image acquisition of the bacterium, therefore we helped them observe the bacterial morphology under different conditions and took photos. Although it took some time, we are pleased that our work is meaningful to JLU. What’s more, we build up friendship with JLU iGEMers.

iGEM team NEU-China comes from Northeastern University. We have communicated a lot about both our projects and have made many useful suggestions for each other.
We helped NEU-China construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor 1D2 with a Rho tag in the N-terminal.
They helped us verify the function of the lyase gene, suggesting our strategy to destroy the bacterium using lyase was practical. After adding arabinose, the bacterium began to produce lyase, leading to their death.
4. Team HFUT-China
iGEM team HFUT-China comes from Hefei University of Technology. We tested their system and shared our feeling. It is a really practical system, which is also convenient for using.

2017 Synthetic Biology Activities Booklet Updates
Since creating the Synthetic Biology Curriculum in 2015, we have had a lot teams from iGEM contact us to ask us to send it to them. We had not updated it since its creation, but since it is still being used, we decided that this year we would work on updating it and making sure it can be a more effective teaching tool. We had the particular aim of making the activities good resources for other iGEM teams, synthetic biologists, and teachers.
Toward the beginning of our iGEM project, we arranged a meeting with a project specialist from the STEM Education Alliance to learn more about connecting with teachers and how to improve the Synthetic Biology Curriculum for teachers. He suggested splitting it into three separate parts (K-5, 6-8, and 9-12) and making sure it has activities that are similar to the Standards of Learning (SOLs) for Virginia public schools and the AP requirements.
In response to this meeting, we removed and replaced a few activities to better adhere to Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL) and AP standards. We also split up the activities booklet and changed its format from images to a pdf file, which means we can continue to edit it in the future. We wrote up a document that details which activities fulfill specific SOL and AP requirements, which we can now give to teachers when they request the booklet. We also chose to change the name of the project from the 2015 team’s “Synthetic Biology Curriculum” to “Synthetic Biology Teaching Booklet,” as “curriculum” has a very specific connotation for teachers and our activities are meant to be relatively short and only include a small amount of background information.
Because we also want this project to include iGEM teams, we created a survey for teams who request our booklet and submitted it to our IRB (Institutional Review Board). We were approved to conduct research on the efficacy of the activities booklet and plan to do it until next August, which is when our IRB"

METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS
In order to reach our goal of breaking down fats, which are a major component of buildups in wastewater systems, we created a novel biobrick which would allow our bacteria to produce an esterase under control of an inducible-promoter.
Design
First, we researched an esterase-producing gene that could be expressed in E.coli. We decided to use the EstA gene, which is found in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
For our promoter, we decided to use pLAC, which is lactose-inducible and is naturally found in E.coli.and was available in the registry (Part:BBa_R0011).
We chose the B0034 RBS (Part:BBa_B0034).
Finally, we chose the double terminator B0015, which is the most common terminator and is known to be reliable. (Part:BBa_B0015).
After we had chosen all of our biobrick parts, we had them synthesized together, creating our new biobrick: (Part:BBa_K2694000).
Qualitative Testing
Once we received our DNA, we transformed it into DH5α E.coli. We then did a plasmid switch to clone our part into PSB1C3 for submission to the Registry. To test our new part, we grew up cultures of our bacteria overnight. We then subcultured them for three hours before beginning the testing.
We first did a qualitative test. From the literature, we found that we could use 4-nitrophenyl palmitate and 4-nitrophenyl octanoate to test our esterase activity. Both substrates, when cleaved by an esterase, would go from clear to green, allowing us to monitor the cleavage activity visually. We set-up a time-course assay where we mixed 1mM of each nitrophenyl ester with 1% v/v Triton X-100 in 0.1M pH 7 phosphate buffer. We also tested DH5⍺ cells without any plasmid as well as the ester mixture with no cells as"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Model_-_-_TEXT.html," model more accurate, especially for the lower miRNA concentrations we decreased kopen to 105, the lowest possible value in our range.
Another way to improve the lower miRNA concentrations was increasing the decay rate of just the miRNA. We had assumed it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in our system. Increasing just the miRNA decay rate had similar effect to decreasing kopen.
With our initial parameters our model was a poor representation of our system. Once we updated our parameters, it was able to represent our results relatively well.
Stochastic model
The Oxford iGEM team kindly ran stochastic simulations of system for us. They ran both intrinsic and extrinsic simulations and provided us with the final uncertainties.
Intrinsic Simulation
Intrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty caused by the changes in reaction rate due to the fact reactants collide randomly. This is more accurate than mass action kinetics for low reactant concentrations.
For our stochastic simulation, each time step a reaction rate was determined randomly using the Poisson distribution. As this is random, multiple stochastic simulations have to be run for a large enough sample size. A time step of 0.01 seconds was used.
The intrinsic simulations gave an uncertainty of only 0.0096%. This validated our use of mass action kinetics to model our system. As the intrinsic uncertainty is negligible we could assume rate of reaction was proportional to concentration of the reactants, i.e. the law of mass action.
While we later updated the parameters with our experimental data, the concentration of reactants did not decrease to invalidate this result.
Extrinsic Simulation
Extrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty cause by the uncertainty of our parameters. The extrinsic uncertainty is by far the more significant of the two uncertainties in our model.
The extrinsic simulation assumes our parameters were normally distributed and runs multiple simulations randomly choosing parameter values.
The specific conclusions of our extrinsic simulations, such as the test being complete in 37 minutes in 90% of cases, are unfortunately no longer useful after our experimental results showed some of our starting parameters were significantly off. However, the extrinsic simulation demonstrated that biggest weakness with our model was our parameter's uncertainties.
Cost model
There's two parts to our cost modeling; the cost analysis which works out the cost of the test, and the much more impressive screening cost-effectiveness model that works out the value of rolling out a screening programme.
Our screening programme's cost per quality year of life gained would be just be £8300 at the current lowest threshold for lung cancer screening, and taking into account cancer recurrence. Treatments under £20,000 per quality year"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins that are able to be quickly adapted to altered targets like viral hull proteins and              re-establish binding properties in extremely short periods of time             The limiting factors in this process are the rate at which mutations happen in the gene of the Evobody              and screening of different proteins. This is the reason why we wanted to build a mutation inducing system             which is not only able to change basepairs in vivo at a very high frequency,              but is also specific enough to provide stability in culture             and does not interfere too much with growth properties of the individual cell.
The revolutionary part of Evobody generation is the combination of an in vivo mutagenesis             and a selection system which is also capable of screening our mutants during the process of              cell cultivation. Due to our constant interaction of altered binding proteins and the in vivo selection, we were eager to increase the mutation rate while retaining normal growth conditions. That is             why we did not only calculate the mutation rate of our two different mutagenesis approaches,              but also determined the growth rate under             different conditions.
Generation of binding proteins by directed evolution
This year the iGEM Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec aims to create a method for generating synthetic binding proteins,     our so-called Evobodies. This works by creating a library of binding proteins and increasing their affinity     towards a target by directed evolution (Figure 1). As a starting point, we randomize the binding regions of     synthetic antibody-like proteins (Figure 1A). Following we screen this library for affinity towards a target by     using a bacterial two-hybrid system (Figure 1B). To further increase the Evobodies affinity, we combine the selection     via the two-hybrid system with an in vivo mutagenesis system (Figure 1C). Doing this we hope to generate strong     and specific binding proteins by combining the powerful genetics of E. coli with the biological idea of     antibody generation and maturation in vertebrates.
Figure 1: Schematic Evobody generation process. A library of synthetic binding proteins (A) is screened by a bacterial two hybrid(B) for interaction with a traget protein. Existing interaction between both proteins leads to expression of a resistance gene thus granting the individual cell a selection advantage. After screening the library all suviving clones binding proteins are mutagenized in vivo (C) which results in the generation of new binding properties. Continuous selection cycles of selection and mutation increase the Evobodies binding affinity towards high affine binding proteins.
We designed our Evobody approach as an alternative to conventional methods for the generation of binding proteins.     In our vision it"

UPO-Sevilla,2016,Team:UPO-Sevilla#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," a totally educational and academic purpose. Several experts from the molecular microbiology sector participate in these meetings, making presentations on their work to help young researchers.
This time the XI meeting was this time with Francis J.M. Mojica (University of Alicante), who gave the inaugural lecture entitled ""The growth curve CRISPR"".
Molecular Microbiology group is one of eleven specialized groups of the Spanish Society for Microbiology (SEM), founded in 1946. The group began operating with a first meeting held in Pamplona in 1996. Since then, meetings have been held every two years. The tradition was started in 1996 and continued with great success at subsequent meetings of the Group. In these meetings, we combine the high scientific level of the Spanish Microbiology Society with an atmosphere of harmony and cordiality. They also give prominence to our young researchers, which are considered as an important and promising group.
In this congress there were poster sessions in which we had the opportunity to explain our project to people who had already worked with biofilms and had experience in that area. Everyone liked the project and we were really thankful because of the praises we got in spite of being so young. In addition, we informed PhD students and other researchers about the iGEM competition. Until that time it was unknown to them, but now they are interested on our performance in the competition.
As part of our meeting the IV Research Award BIOMEDAL a relevant research work in the field of Molecular Microbiology, as well as prizes for the best communications delivered. During the event presentations from experts they were divided into the following sessions:
Session I: Microbial Biotechnology
Session II: Gene Regulation
Session III: Microbial Differentiation
Session IV: Antimicrobial Agents and Resistance
Session V: Comparative Genomics and Evolution
Session VI: ADN Mobile
Session VII: Pathogenesis
It was a unique experience that allowed us to discuss our project and the way we conducted experiments with people experienced in the field.

Another possible method was explained by Parayre et al. 2009 , which involves the resuspension of the pellet in lysis buffer and the consecutive incubation with proteinase K. This means however, that an extra hour of incubation time needs to be considered and extra pipetting steps.
Developing an inexpensive and user-friendly centrifuge
For the DNA isolation, a centrifuge step is required to spin down the cell debris. We tried to build a centrifuge out of a hard drive, by making it spin on its own. Additionally, we made a hand-powered centrifuge out of a string and around-shaped hard plastic. The hard drive has a default speed which cannot easily be overridden, so we wanted to find out whether the default speed exceeded our ideal speed. For this simple speed test, we broke open the hard drive and marked a certain part of the disk. We filmed the spinning and analysed the video with VLC media player. We subtracted the frame rate (which was 24 Hz) and tried to determine in how many frames the mark would make one round.
Unfortunately the hard drive spun so fast that the mark already made a whole round in one frame. This means that the hard drive would spin with a speed of at least 24 Hz $\times$ 60 = 1440 rpm, exceeding our ideal speed of 1000 rpm. To be able to control the speed of the hard drive, we need a sensor less brushless motor driver (ESC) to drive the special motor of the hard drive and control this speed with an Arduino. We decided to discard this idea and we continued with our hand-driven centrifuge.
We started with a preliminary test, to check whether or not we could spin down our suspension of cells by using our centrifuge. By centrifuging for less than a minute, we already made a cell pellet. This process can be seen in figure 18.
Figure 18: Cell pellet formed using our hand-powered centrifuge
Developing a protocol for the farmer
We aimed to make all our steps as easy as possible, as the end user (a farmer) does not have access to specialized lab facilities and equipment. It is very important that the end-user is provided with all the necessary materials and protocols. To make our kit accessible and user-friendly, we decided to buy all the materials in the local shopping centre instead of buying it from brands specialized in lab facilities. Products in stores are already developed to be"
