Marketing and Presentations for August 7th 2009
Today, I contacted a couple of Syn-bio companies that I had found on the Synbio 4.0 conference brochure. I send them a sponsorship proposal and I will do a follow-up on these companies next week. I also e-mailed out our July Newsletter to our current and future potential sponsors.
We also had our team presentations today: I was part of the human practices presentation. I presented the ethical aspect of the human practices section.
IMAN
Polishing:
As everyone know, we are modeling a signaling system within bacteria. As a result, we have to be able to simulate hundreds of cells in each simulation. To do so, this model should perform very fast and it is not going to happen unless our codes are super efficient. That is why we have spent a week just to clean up the codes, rewrite some functions, and to polish it.
It is interesting to know that with doing that, our simulation is 5 times faster than before.

Presentation Skills and looking ahead in the lab
Purpose: Practice presentation skills and answering questions in preparation for aGEM and iGEM competitions. A large portion of the morning preparing for our team meeting in which each facet of our team had 12 minutes to present all of their work up to date. I helped to present the Lab section of iGEM Calgary's overall project. We also prepared for AI-2 isolation in the coming weeks and the trip to Ft. McMurray on Monday.

Presentation Critiques
We had our meeting today and were given some suggestions regarding our second life presentation:
1. The storyline is very important to a presentation and our presentation was static, using titles, point form notes and pictures. To fully demonstrate second life. To fully demonstrate second life, especially for the iGEM competition, it would be best to take one avatar through the domains of the island as a visual aid
2. Pick one person as our team’s presenter
3. Hold off on releasing our island to the public until we have something that is extremely novel to the Second Life environment

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Project#FluorideRiboswitch_-_-_TEXT.html," non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Binding of TetR to its operator site. A) tetR operator and contact regions. The tetR operator is a palindromic sequence. Horizontal bars show nucleotides contacted by each monomer of the TetR dimer. B) Interaction of TetR residues with specific nucleotides (arrows) and phosphate backbone (blue lines) in the operator region. The amino acids involved in DNA binding extend from residues 27 to 48. Contacts established with the operator were confirmed by footprint assays, by analysis of TetR mutants, and by crystallographic studies (29, 30, 159, 266, 366).

Camp Simcha's NYC Wetware Science Lab Workshop
Camp Simcha is a camp for children with physical challenges. In summer 2010 Yossi Steinberger joined the Camp Simcha staff as the instructor for an Origami Workshop. Based on the campers’ response to an ingenious analogy between origami and protein folding, Yossi realized that many campers would love to do some science at camp. Most of the workshops at camp are geared toward arts-and-crafts, but the campers comprise a rather brainy group, and were excited at the prospect of thinking and learning about the world. Yossi pitched the idea for a new science workshop to the camp directors - the Camp Simcha Science Laboratory. They responded enthusiastically. Over the course of the year, Yossi recruited friends to help think of exciting projects and even to run the new science workshop. Many people joined a collaborative Google doc, that quickly reached dizzying lenghs. The NYC iGEM Wetware team pooled its efforts to plan the final curriculum for the summer; Yossi and David joined the campers at Simcha to run the Laboratory, and they even recruited Yossi’s cousin Shlomo, an outsider who was inspired at the prospect of showing kids in need a great time through science.
The Camp Simcha Lab aimed to provide young scientist campers with interesting projects and activities, and especially with sound scientific explanations. But a major goal of the Lab was to engage the scientific imaginations of all the campers through a series of fun and enlightening experiments. Some of our experiments appealed only to the particularly science-inclined campers, but we made sure there was something for everybody - who doesn’t enjoy Coke-and-Mentos explosions or an egg drop competition (we did both).
As first attempts go, we consider our Simcha Lab a success. See our blog"

Public surveys
During the work we carried out two surveys. The initial survey was carried out randomly among the residents of Kiryat Shmona before entering the laboratory to examine the initial feasibility of the kit, the second survey was intended solely for celiac patients and was conducted through social networking. 
The first survey objectives were:
To check how common sensitivity to food substances are to those of the population who were tested.
To examine the need for a product that helps, like “Alergln” to identify the antigen for sensitive people .
Details of the survey:
The survey was conducted among 150 participants of which 52 were males and 98 were females.
66 participants aged 40-55, 84 participants aged 16-17.
The survey findings showed that 44% of survey respondents have some sensitivity to food (fig 1).
fig 1: breakdown of allergy according to age
According to Figure 1 - the percentage of sensitivity to food in young age groups who checked in the survey:
17% of respondents up to age 19, 18% up to age 49, and 9% of the survey participants were over 50.
The sensitivity to a component of any food, a fact that increases the chances of the sale of a product to older people who develop, with age varied food sensitivities. Participants in the survey ""The Sensitives"" reported that when they come in contact with the antigen it may disrupt their daily routine and even confine them to bed because of pain or unpleasant feelings like an itchy rash and suffocation. Everyone, without exception, are interested in being able to prevent the reaction because this action will save them discomfort, loss of days at school / work and certainly the use of drugs often containing steroids. 
All participants in the survey who have food allergies said they spend more than $ 50 a month during an attack, on drugs and tranquilizers.

Synbio is just a S-Din away!
SYSU-Software 2017
Overview
During our project “S-Din”, we brainstormed many aspects concerning our project and took them into practices to confirm or to overturn our hypothesis. Then we tried to integrate them into our final project in order to improve the project functions and user experience.
At the beginning of our project, in order to get answers to questions about user needs, safety, software regulations and legal issues, we conducted numerous interviews with professionals working in related fields. They gave us useful and significant suggestions ( Silver page ). We have considered all comments from professionals and integrated them into our design of S-Din ( Gold Integrated page ). We conducted further user interviews and user needs analysis, promoted S-Din and synthetic biology to the public ( Public Engagement page ).
Please see our human practices highlights during the entire product development on our Integrated Human Practices page .
Public Engagement
iGEM is not only a competition standing at the front of synthetic biology, but also a good chance and a platform to introduce synthetic biology to the public. Further, we should never “work behind closed doors” — though non-technical individuals may lack knowledge about synbio, they might provide us with many sparkling ideas and inspirations on our projects -- That's also S-Din's goal. More importantly, if our project is hardly understandable to the general public, then it cannot be a successful one. If we can establish a bi-directional communication with the public, we can get more feedback on our project and, based on the feedback, we can make our project more accessible not only to the scientists but also to the public.
Biology Festival: introduction synthetic biology to public
Collaborated with SYSU_CHINA iGEM team, we held a parade in the campus"
Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," them how synthetic biology could be a solution to fight this issue.
The hunt was organized as follows: at each stop, the players had to find a clue to solve a riddle, then they had to take part in an activity or a game around a specific theme, held at a booth. Completing a step allowed the participants to receive a clue to the location of the next stage. The main idea was to create ​​an event accessible to a wide range of participants: adults, children, families and people with reduced mobility, to inform and educate the players in a fun way. At the end of the event, we drew lots among the people who solved the final puzzle. The winner was awarded a grand prize: a bike! (Sponsored by Bike in Paris)
The event was supported by several French institutions: The Ministry of the Environment, the Respire association, the Souffle Foundation, Bike in Paris, the Journal des Grandes Ecoles a University newspapers, the Pasteur Institute and the Paris City Hall. The Ministry of the Environment even highlighted our event on their website
The game was a great success as 108 people registered and nearly 95 participated in the treasure hunt. Like the rest of our project, the security of the players was our top priority. To do so, we filed a request to occupy public space, with the Paris City Hall and the Paris police headquarters. On account of our route passing through famous spots such as Notre Dame de Paris, the Pantheon, the Senate, Boulevard Saint-Michel ... Also at each step of the hunt, there was a safety officer that could immediately inform the police if any accident occurred.
In addition, this event received the congratulations of the Mayor of Paris, who said on Twitter: ""Congratulations to the team of the @ iGEM_Pasteur for this educational and fun action on the #Pollution of the air"" and was featured in several national newspapers: Le Parisien and 20 Minutes.
This innovative event allowed us to establish a dialogue outside the laboratory. Its playful nature made it possible to start a dialogue and debate openly without any barriers, and discuss in an original way around our synthetic biology project. We also sent a questionnaire to all participants after the game. The results of the 43 responses are presented below.
As we can see, 93% of the participants thought the Hunt for particulate matter, allowed them to discover synthetic biology and learn more about air pollution. All the players appreciated the idea of participating in a treasure hunt to discover a scientific topic. We also asked other questions about our device and took into account the answers while designing our product"

We sequenced a colony with the correct phenotype, as well as others with incorrect phenotypes:
Colony ""gby"" [blue, yellow] - expected scar is missing at approx base 680 of the forward chromatogram. Also, the spacer ends with ATG and the part starts with ATG, but only one ATG is seen. In total 9 bases are missing. There is homology of ""tatgg"" at both ends of the deleted fragment. There is a point mutation at approx base 500 of the forward chromatogram.
Colony ""gb"" [blue] - there is a deletion of about 80 bases at approx base 700 of the chromatogram. This has been caused by homology of a ""gggcgagg"" found at both ends of the deleted sequence. The 9 bases mentioned for gby are also missing.
Colony ""gwy"" [yellow] - seems correct except for a point mutation in the reverse chromatogram. The mutation is synonymous (ctg -> ttg). There's no clear reason why the colony wasn't blue.
Lessons learned: bits of homology, even quite small, can cause problems with this method.
BioSandwich with Overlap Extension PCR
Overlap Extension PCR can be performed using spoligos as primers. The extension time should be calculated from the entire product size. The final product will not be circular, so can be run on a gel to test its length. Later, it will need to have its ends ligated.
This method produces many correct colonies, although it also produces many incorrect colonies.
[For our tests, different primers were used and spacer2 was not needed.]
Colony ""bby"" [blue, yellow] - correct sequence.
Colony ""bb"" [blue] - has a massive deletion (several hundred bases) in the EYFP gene after about 60 bases. There is partial homology between the start and end of the deletion: ""tggtcgagctggac"" vs ""tggacgagctgtac"".
Colony ""bw"" [plain] - has spacerT7 joined to spacer1, and the same massive deletion as bb.
Again homology seems to be an issue. Parts joining randomly (in bw) is worrying.
BioSandwich with Ligation Independent Cloning
In our experience, this method has been only weakly successful. We have seen one correct colony in several attempts.
To attempt the LIC method, simply mix the parts and vector ("

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," while they are forming a tissue through light. Typically, sophisticated 3-dimensional scaffolds that mimic the tissue are developed to try to reproduce qualities such as elasticity, volume and organization. After the scaffold has been produced, cells are seeded into and onto the scaffold and they are allowed to grow into the scaffold.
However, the scaffolding and cell-seeding method, often called ‘bioprinting’ or ‘cellular 3D-printing’ has many drawbacks:
Choosing the right scaffold
Cellular Organisation
Controlling differentiation
Scaffold design and construction methods need to be tailored towards the tissue tried to be produced. Scaffolds for heart reconstruction need to fulfil completely different prerequisites to bone scaffolds. With the incredibly diverse microenvironment of cells a myriad of different designs have been tested. Furthermore, the rapid invention of new biomaterials that are usable as scaffold material increase the number of possible scaffolds even further
Why optogenetics can address these challenges
A combination of optogenetic genes and light stimulating these genes has the potential to allow precise spatiotemporal control of tissue generation at the cellular and even molecular level compared to other approaches.
Previously, MIT iGEM 2010 used mechanosensors as triggers for cell differentiation based on the fact that mechanical stimuli play an important role during in vivo tissue formation. But as shown by MIT iGEM 2010 mechanical inputs rely on the physical form of the input and require physical penetration of the cells which is not possible for cells on the interior of a growing tissue.
Typically chemical stimuli are used. Growth factors, morphogens and mitogens are used in iPS cell research to induce differentiation as mentioned above. Chemokines and cytokines are used for the recruitment of cells to certain areas in the body. However, chemical stimuli cannot differentiate between the cells that we want them to act on and others we don’t want them to work on. Off-target activation and differentiation of cells is quite common and therefore unsuitable for tissue generation.
Optical stimuli in comparison to mechanical ones do not require physical stimulation. As shown through multi-photon microscopy, it is possible to activate single molecules on a molecular level through the simultaneous exposure to different light sources. This means optical stimuli have the potential to activate photosensitive proteins in space and time at a subcellular level on the in- and outside of a growing tissue.
In comparison to chemical stimuli, optical stimuli do not diffuse in solution and the risk of off-target cell activation is reduced.
Furthermore, for future standardization, optical stimuli do not require specific scaffolds to build on. However, they do require a one-time"

In addition, we collaborated in showcasing the iGEM Competition and synthetic biology at the 2016 Canadian Society of Microbiology Conference in Toronto.  We held presentations of our projects and initiatives, as well as opened a booth for questions and paraphernalia during the poster session.
We have also been planning an appearance in Genomics in the Park to advocate for investment in youth and synthetic biology through iGEM with politicians.  We will be discussing the impact the organization has had on its participants and reassert our dedication to exploring the human practices of our science.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in"

The Protein
Analysis
Major Tropism Determinant
Our protein of interest, the Major Tropism Determinant (Mtd) protein, is located on the tail-end fibers of the BPP-1 bacteriophage. This protein is important in that it allows the BPP-1 phage to bind and infect its host species of bacteria- Bordetella, the bacterial species that causes whooping cough. Because Bordetella can vary the expression of its surface proteins, the BPP-1 phage in turn has evolved a way to vary the specificity of the Mtd protein. Through targeted mutagenesis from the phages diversity-generating retroelement ( DGR ) system, the Mtd protein has shown to be able to support a massive library of protein variants- theoretically up to 9.22*1012 possible variants.
File:Mtd gif 2.gif
474px
The Mtd gene is a 1146 base pair long sequence that contains two mutagenic islands. There are a total of 22 specific mutagenic nucleotides located in the last ~100 nucleotides on the 3’ end of the sequence, known as the variable repeat (VR). In vivo, there is a nearly identical sequence of nucleotides known as the template repeat (TR) located downstream of the Mtd gene. The DRG system reverse-transcribes a mutant copy of the TR, with mutations confined only to specific adenine residues, which then replaces the VR that encodes the C terminus of the Mtd.
On the quaternary level, the Mtd protein assembles into globular trimeric structure comprised of 380 amino acids in each of its monomers. Out of these 380 amino acids, 12 of them can mutate to a range of different amino acids.
Mtd is a multi-domain protein with a C-lectin type fold at its C terminus. The variable regions of the Mtd form a surface on one face of the pyramid-shaped trimer where binding occurs. The rest of the protein forms a stable scaffold that is constant across different Mtd variants. The Mtd protein binds to the phage tail-fiber at the N-terminus.
Thorough analysis of this protein was conducted through our own 'Pro"

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," fresh medium and inducers each time we diluted instead of filling all the wells with medium at the beginning and then diluting into them.
From this new data, Figure 5 and 6 below,  we can see that our optimizations from the previous protocol increased our editings efficiency. Once again this data matches the expected results, in that we see a linear relationship of editing over time. The data shows an overall editing rate of about 40% editing efficiency after 96 hours. Figure 6 demonstrates the control data, which is uninduced editing, there is about 20% baseline editing because of the leaky transcription of PtetO and PLacO which is backed by promoter characterization in the literature.
We performed 2-way ANOVA tests to demonstrate that this data represents a significant editing difference between each time point.
The purpose of these experiments were 2-fold. First, we needed to demonstrate the functionality of the base editor. Secondly, a fundamental part of our project utilizes the linear editing property of the base editor in order to establish a time scale. The ability of our project to establish a time point readout of a stimulus is what separates our project from previous work that utilizes a base editor as a recording mechanism for cellular stimuli.
Improve Base Editing Efficiency
Based on feedback we got from Dr. Seth Childers during our Human Practices we set out to test a theory that increasing the replication rate of our plasmids would increase our base editing rate. From the literature, we discovered that the limiting factor to editing was not the matter of the Cytidine Deaminase modifying the base but rather the release of the complex from the DNA so that it could edit another plasmid. This base editor utilized dCas9 to localize the complex to the correct location for a base change. dCas9 is the catalytically inactivated version of Cas9; meaning that once it binds to the DNA it does not have any function. dCas9 is commonly used by scientists for the specific purpose that once bound it will stay bound. This is called CRISPR interfering or CRISPRi and is used to disable genes or block binding domains such as those for an RNA polymerase. Moreover, due to the fact that it is staying bound, we are not getting proficient use of the enzyme to edit multiple plasmids. Finally, in our research, we discovered that during replication of a plasmid all bound proteins are released as the polymerase replicates the plasmid.
To take advantage of this discovery, we wanted to test if shortening the time between the dilutions would improve the editing rate"

STEP 3 : DETECTOR AND BACTERIA'S CONSERVATION
SnapLab is designed to be used in countries where weather conditions are a real problem for the conservation of biological materials. Determining the best way for the conservation of the most important parts in the kit, namely the detector (plasmid) and the competent bacteria, was a challenge in the kit’s conditions. In order to transform bacteria with a plasmid, the former needs to be competent. Once the plasmid is inside the microorganism, it will multiply and if stimulated, express its genes. This is the reason why the main goal of all the protocols for competence and drying is to keep the bacteria alive, otherwise the gene expression will be impossible.
1. Conservation of the detector
DNA conservation is very important in different fields of biology. Luckily, this is a relatively stable molecule.
The goal was to find a solution for a long time conservation of the plasmid detector in keeping it functional and with the lowest loss possible. The bacterial strain used was TOP10 E. Coli, and transformations were made with the plasmid BBa_J04450. After DNA amplification and extraction, plasmid was concentrated at 827ng/μL.
Firstly, different concentrations of plasmid (1.5, 3 and 4,5μL) were tested for drying with 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5μL of glycerol 80% in a spectrophotometer cuvette"

Impact on future iGEM Teams
With this part collection we did not only manage to characterize the mechanism of repression and activation of the lldR-operator promoter in response to LldR and L-lactate, but we also provide future iGEM teams with a functionning and well characterized system for lactate detection by E. coli. We engineered an lldR-promoter with a higher ON/OFF ratio (15.26) and KM value (1075 μM) in comparison to the wild type version's ON/OFF ratio of 10.35 and KM value of 955 μM. In the analysis of our synthetic promoter's response to lactate , we realized that for the optimal functionning of the lldR-promoter, the promoter flanked by the two operators has to be weak, to allow activation next to derepression . The introduction of a strong or medium strong Anderson promoter did not allow for activation above levels of derepression, whereas the introduction of a weak promoter lead to the desired Results . Keeping this in mind, we suggest that the ON/OFF ratio and the sensitivity of the lldR-promoter can be further adapted"

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) is a protein consists of eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G. eIF4A is a helicase need ATP to unwind the secondary structure of mRNA untranslated region and make ribosome binds easier. eIF4E can binds to the cap structure of mRNA. eIF4G is like a scaffold of eIF4A and eIF4E helping them coordinate their functions. Without eIF4E and eIF4G the eIF4A alone exist much lower RNA helicase activity than complete eIF4F (Imataka and Sonenberg, 1997).
eIF4A binding aptamer
What is the eIF4A binding aptamer?
The eIF4A aptamer that we used has a high affinity for complete eIF4A protein. Its affinity is strong enough that it will combine the split eIF4A(described above) into a complete eIF4A protein. In the presence of eIF4A aptamer, ATP hydrolysis is inhibited and the RNA substrate which binds onto the eIF4A cannot unwind.
It is proposed that the eIF4A structure is in a equilibrium between dumbbell-shaped structure and compact struction in solution. In the presence of ATP and absence of RNA aptamer, the equilibrium will be shifted into the dumbbell-shaped eIF4A (Fig.2). In the opposite condition, the equilibrium will be shifted into the compact one (Valencia-Burton et al., 2007).

In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Mahir Bozan: Hey iGEM, I am Mahir and studying my bachelor in field of Molecular Biology and Genetics at ITU. Additionally, I have also studied at Roskilde University in Molecular Biology program as an exchange student for last two semesters. It was pleasure for me to be head of Molecular Biology and Genetics Student Club in 2011-2012 academic year. In one of our club meeting, our one of the club member talked about iGEM and my huge interest to iGEM began from that moment. After a long way, finally, we are in iGEM and I am really glad to be part of this competition with such a good team. Molecular Biology is not only my interest, I have also curiosity to architecture, science of physics, film art, painting and also theater. I have lots of interests to say because I believe that knowledge is something endless and I should learn them as much as I can in my entire life.
Mehmet Akdağ: I am Mehmet Akdağ. I’m a second year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in ITU. This year I contributed generally the human practice part of our project and I also worked as lab assistant when I find a chance. Having limited lab experience forced me to become an iGEM member. I learn lots of lab techniques from our advisors and our senior students. I become familiar with synthetic biology which I really like and if I got a chance, I want to work on this field in future. Since it is the first iGEM team found in our university it was hard and stressful year for all of us but I really enjoyed being a member of our ITU iGEM Team.

Generally I shoot photos and videos on human practice events with my mobile. I participated in wetlab whenever possible but generally watched to learn something. We don’t get enough experience on our lab courses and we have to improve it. This train of thought lead me to our university’s first iGEM Team.

CIEI-BJ,2016,Team:CIEI-BJ#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," drug industry would include an increased purity, a reduced production time and a lower cost. With the help of this cheap and purified product of tanshinone, more lives would be saved.
The gene circuit includes a Tac promotor, which is a strong hybrid promotor produced by combination of promotors from the trp and lac operons and is used to control and increase the expression levels of the target gene.
Thrombin protease and TEV are the two type of restriction enzyme cleavage sites which can let SmCPS1 gene insert in between and later help the SmCPS1 enzyme to be easily purified. GFP was used to test the expression of our target gene SmCPS1. The target gene (SmCPS1) was obtained from Institute of Botany, Chinese academy of Science.
In our research, pGEX-KG was used as the vector of our Biobrick device, because of its unique advantages and characteristics that plays a vital role in transition of tanshinone expression system. pGEX-kG encompasses expression of Lacl inducible promoter, Ribosome binding sites (RBS), and Glutathione transferase GST tag. With the exploitation of Lacl inducible promoter, the E. coli are able to generate the target protein in short term without affecting the growth of the bacteria. In order to connect the SmCPS1 into the pGEX-kG vector, acquire the final protein to be without GST or GFP (green fluorescent protein) at same time, and furthermore, to purify the fusion protein and disconnect the upstream GST and downstream GFP, it is necessary that Protease Thrombin was added to the Enzyme cleavage site at front of the target gene as well as TEV protease adding at end of target gene.
Because SmCPS1 contains the same restriction enzyme cutting site as the biobricks provided by iGEM, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to avoid our target gene be digested by the restriction enzyme after we combine it with the plasmid backbone iGEM provided.
Here is the complete process of our work. Firstly, we obtained our target gene from Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Science. Then, we used PCR to amplify our target gene (SmCPS1). After we got enough of our target gene, we did three site-directed mutagenesis. After the mutagenesis was succeeded, the target gene was transformed into PGEX-KG vector for further propagation and production of the enzyme SmCPS1.

NYU,2010,Team:NYU#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," have incorporated a recombination-based architecture into our system that will allow the cells to modify the antibody plasmid in vivo. Using this system transcription of the antibody gene can go straight from screening to protein production in a matter of minutes. This concept has the capability to not only shave weeks off of current antibody discovery protocols, but opens the door to cellular programming for other methods, such as restructuring of antibody genes or performing more complex screenings for different purposes.
The Experiments
In the spectrum of molecular biology, iGEM is a very short time frame. Because of this short time frame, our wet lab team having only two members and our extremely limited research budget, we felt that radical simplification of our experiments would allow us to demonstrate the feasibility of our ideas without requiring resources we simply did not have. Because many of the individual aspects that this project has brought together have been investigated with success, we were able to perform some experiments using proxies for the 'real thing'.

Mycelium Glue
Figure 1: Lap Shear Adhesive Strength. Different bioadhesive candidates where applied to mycelium samples that were pressed together and allowed to set. Using the Instron 5565, the force necessary to separate the mycelium samples was then measured and converted to kPa accounting for the area of overlap between the mycelium samples.
As shown in Figure 1, all of our purified bioadhesive proteins successfully bound to baked mycelium substrate and produced non-negligible adhesive strengths. The CsgA-CBD and CBD4x fusion proteins were the most successful, with both reaching strengths of 28.2 kPa which is comparable to the tested strength of Elmer’s glue on mycelium at 32.1 kPa. Non-fusion CsgA was slightly weaker at 27.1 kPa on, and fp151 gave the poorest adhesive strength on mycelium at 16.8 kPa.
On a cardboard substrate (Figure 2) there are several notable differences from the mycelium substrate testing. Elmer’s Glue was again the strongest and more than doubled its bonding strength from the mycelium substrate test, to 78.1 kPa. CBD4x was surprisingly stronger than on mycelium, improving to 46.5 kPa. The fp151 protein also more than doubled in strength, reaching 40.6 kPa in the cardboard testing. Csga-CBD was weaker in the cardboard testing, at 22.7 kPa. The sample of csgA bound to cardboard was unfortunately dropped and was not salvageable for lap-shear testing.
Figure 2: Relative Mycelium Adhesive Strength. After testing the adhesive strength of each bioadhesive candidate on mycelium, we tested each candidate again on cardboard. We then took the ratio of adhesive strength on mycelium to adhesive strength on cardboard to determine the relative efficiency of the two substrates.
By taking the ratio of adhesive strength on mycelium to the adhesive strength on cardboard, we can find the relative efficiency of the adhesives on the two substrates. Every adhesive except for csgA-CBD bonded stronger on cardboard substrate than the mycelium substrate. This could be due to cardboard having a more uniform surface and thus allowing better molecular bonding and glue function. This makes it very notable that csgA-CBD was a stronger adhesive on mycelium, and provides evidence that by adding the chitin binding domain to csgA we were able to successfully make the protein"

Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are potent carcinogens produced by various activities ranging from grilling meat to coal gasification. Our project aims to degrade high molecular weight PAHs present in industrial waste from district heating plants. There is currently no sustainable way to handle this waste and therefore it is deposited in landfills. We want to solve this problem by  employing a bacterial based system.
Our cells need to be able to detect the PAHs for direct degradation. However the high molecular weight PAHs do not readily pass through the cell membrane. We solved this obstacle by using the low weight PAH, naphthalene, as an indicator for the presence of heavier PAHs. The degradation of this small PAH inside the cell relieves repression of genes under the control of the NahR/Psal promoter system. This causes the expression of a series of enzymes for PAH degradation which are secreted outside the cell where they can oxidize and cleave the ring structures of the carcinogenic compounds. This in turn makes them available for downstream biodegradation. To increase the degradation efficiency, our system also produces rhamnolipids. These are biosurfactants that prevent the PAHs from aggregating, making them easier for the enzymes to access.

Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," is designed to produce sucrose, a useful industrial product.
Our Project
Ducat et al. and Xuefeng et al. both successfully engineered S. elongatus to produce and secrete sucrose in large quantities; however, the process has not been commercialized because of harvesting costs and inefficient photobioreactor design [4].
Our goal was to make cyanobacteria carbon sequestration industrially viable. Our approach was to characterize genes for sucrose production and secretion in S. elongatus under BioBrick standards. Additionally, we aimed to characterize various novel nutrient-dependent and light-dependent promoters in the same strain. Finally, the capstone of this characterization involved controlling the sucrose genes with the novel promoters to improve efficiency and control in industrial settings.
Sucrose BioBricks
S. elongatus naturally produces sucrose in saltwater to balance osmotic pressure [5]. We intended to modify S. elongatus to produce and export sucrose under freshwater conditions in order to reduce harvesting costs associated with salt-removal. We aimed to construct two BioBricks: one which produces sucrose, and one which exports it.
The protein responsible for the rate-determining, or slowest, step in S. elongatus sucrose production is sucrose phosphate synthase (sps), but it requires sodium ions to function [6]. We instead codon optimized the sps gene from another cyanobacteria strain, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which shows sucrose production in the absence of sodium ions [6]. Unfortunately, issues in gene synthesis did not allow us to transform with and characterize sps.
The sucrose permease protein (cscB), derived from E. coli, is a membrane protein that can pump sucrose out of S. elongatus [3]. There is currently a BioBrick for cscB, but it does not meet RFC10 standards due to illegal cut-sites. We aimed to codon optimize cscB for our strain and make it BioBrick compatible. Incorporating cscB into our system eases sucrose harvest from extracellular media without needing to kill the bacteria.
In order to initially characterize the cscB BioBrick, we cloned it into Dr. Susan Golden’s IPTG-inducible vector pAM2991 (Addgene plasmid # 40248). We used a sucrose/d-glucose assay to compare the effects of cscB on extracellular sucrose concentrations against the wild-type when sucrose production is induced by saltwater.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#5 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," world. The Interaction Checker will scan your nearby DNA, proteins, and cofactors, looking for possible binding interactions between them. Basically, if it could happen, it should. This is a tool to prevent users from 'forgetting' the way a system actually would work in the current state, and may be used to determine whether you've understood the system enough to progress to the next level! The checker will be intelligent enough to detect whether a gene is on or off, and hopefully work intelligently with multiple copies of a single coding sequence in different activation states. Of course, the Interaction Checker won't be able to help as much with systems that have no steady state such as the Repressilator... there's always another valid interaction.
Last of all, I want to implement DNA binding proteins that can accept multiple cofactors, mostly so that I can have LacI behave approximately like the real thing with regards to Glucose, Lactose, and IPTG (but also TetR with Tetracycline, AtC). The implementation I have in mind is reprogrammable though, and has no upper bound on the number of cofactors per protein. So if you want to invent a monster with three allosteric inhibitors and five inducers, you'll be able to do it!

Bake Sale Trinity
I emailed a few companies to discuss meeting times. Then i helped to organize the bake sale and sold home baked treats until 2:30pm. We also went out to different parts of the building to sell the left over goods. The team raised a net of $494.18 profit!!!  Next, I worked on the powerpoint presentation slides for marketing and discussed lab with my peers and supervisors. I am doing a construction of aiiA tp the response circuit.  Tomorrow, i'll follow up with some of the older companies regarding sponsorship.

Our HP story
What has been most interesting and enjoyable for us about Human Practices?
We think Human Practice itself is an interesting thing for us which we enjoy so much. We know a lot about the society. Throughout this summer, we visit the best cancer hospital in China----The National Cancer Center and communicate with the experts who have a deep understandings of Esophagus Cancer in order to ensure that our project is addressing a genuine need as defined by those who know best.
We learn how doctors work, how they take care of patients, how they do experiments and overcome difficulties. Doctors in China have really hard work to do every day. We have a better understanding of the disease which we deal with. Over 90% esophagus cancer happens in China and the survival rate is lower than 20%. We also visit labs and give questionnaires to the public. What we do makes us acquire the current situation of esophagus cancer and the life of doctors in China. These things really attracts us.
What challenges has your team faced in developing and running our Human Practices activities?
At the beginning, the challenge for us is how we can visit the hospital. We don’t know any doctors and we are not sure whether the doctors want to communicate with us. So we contact with some medical students in The National Cancer Center at first. Thankfully, they’d like to help us and make an appointment with the doctors.
During our visiting, it comes the biggest difficulty------the way we communicate to the patient. We want to know how they feel and we want to comfort them, but none of us know how to start to talk. We are afraid that we might not be polite to them or disturb them. At first we were a bit embarrassed when facing them. However, they were friendly and we had a good conversation.
What support or resources can iGEM offer to help us improve our Human Practice work?
We hope that the iGEM foundation can propagandize more about iGEM competition and make more people know about it. It’ll help us easier to get access to the resources. Meanwhile, we hope that iGEM can help us propagandize our ideas. We’ll be really thankful!

Finally, some artwork was created to help explain our STEP system to the public, saturated in the two-way constructing process of humanity and technology.
1. An image of sci-researchers in China
In our wildest dream of childhood, there always existed a profession named ‘scientist’. But only a few of us hold on to it ultimately. Researchers are always a mystery to the public. In public mind they are a group of people burying themselves in labs and isolated from normal society. Nevertheless, the truth is far from that while the public has started to think differently. Rooted in China, we focus on the topic Society, Research, Researchers to reveal the true living condition of sci-researchers in China today.

In the meeting with Shi, a typical doctoral student of pharmacy, we discover the change of public attitude towards the field of research. What’s their working pattern? How do they step into this field? What do their future look like? Her one-step-at-a-time experience gave the answer.
2. Future scientists — from kindergarten to college
To propagate synthetic biology and share the fun of iGEM with future synthetic biologists, we organized a series of activities and lectures to students of all ages. Kindergarten: A mini-lab For kids in kindergarten, we host a mini-biolab to introduce some basic concepts regarding microorganisms in an interesting way. Moreover, we helped the lovely children cultivate their interest in synthetic biology as well as  inform them of the significance of keeping personal hygiene.  PS: Safety is guaranteed during this activity.
Canton primary school: Volunteer teaching When our team is working as volunteer teacher in rural areas of Canton, we also always bear the responsibility of sharing the idea of iGEM to more people. In Canton, to broaden their horizon to a grander world, our deliver introduced our project and some basic situations of iGEM to hundreds of seated students from primary school and junior high school. Though due to the limit of equipment and knowledge, they could not be iGEMers now, we have planted seeds of synthetic biology in their naïve heart which might grow up to a glorious tree one day in the future.

Possible issues
        The UNAM team appeared to not have nearly as much success with LovTAP as the EPF-Lausanne team. Whether this was due to the mutation that was introduced or some other factor is unclear. We hoped to study UNAM’s LovTAP and possibly introduce other mutations to improve LovTAP’s function. For example, Strickland et al. identified mutations that increased LovTAP’s dynamic range (i.e. the difference in repression in the dark state vs. the light state) from 5 to 70.
        Another issue is that the conformational change of LovTAP in the presence of light is relatively unstable. Upon removal of the light source, LovTAP quickly returns to a conformation in which the Jα-helix binds to the AsLOV2 domain, inactivating the trpR DNA-binding activity.  Thus, long exposure times might be necessary for the circuit to react to the light, which would be undesirable for drawing with a laser pointer. We may have to search for mutations that stabilize the light state, and thus allow LovTAP to remain in the light state for a longer time after being activated.
Peking Bi-stable Switch
Overview
        The Peking 2007 iGEM team designed a genetic switch that can be flipped between two stable states (on and off), a so-called bi-stable switch. Such a switch would be desirable in the Etch-a-Sketch circuit because it would allow the bacteria to “remember” if it had been exposed to light, so that only a short exposure to light would be necessary to draw on our bacteria (rather than keeping the light on the bacteria until color appeared). However, the switch design was not ideal because one state was not completely stable; once the switch was flipped on, it slowly decayed back to the off state. We would like our drawings to be permanent (to some degree), so we would need the activated state to be stable. We therefore redesigned the Peking bi-stable switch for this purpose.
Original Design
        The Peking 2007 switch uses the pR and pRM promoters and the cI and cI434 transcriptional regulatory proteins. The cI protein activates pRM and represses pR; cI434 represses pRM; pR has high basal transcription; and pRM has low basal transcription.

Newcastle 2010: Upregulated Urea production Inside the Cell as an Effort to Increase Urease Function/
Those familiar with the iGEM competition might remember a previous predecessor who also focused on the microbial carbonate precipitation - Bacilla Filla, Team Newcastle 2010’s project investigated the potential of Bacillus subtilis to remediate fractures in concrete architecture. However, due to the finicky nature of urease, they decided to focus on upregulating urea production inside the cell for their project.
“Previous experiments involving up-regulating ureA, ureB and ureC in B. subtilis have not lead to an increase in urease production. This could be due to yet unidentified genes that are involved in the process. Therefore, we looked for another strategy.” – Newcastle 2010
Since the last Jamboree, the study of microbial precipitation has risen in prominence beyond just remediation. As we suggest in our project, it is instead being championed as a new way to aggregate building materials entirely. This expansion is related to the robust urease function present in the new organism of study: S. pasteurii.
Motivation
Though B. subitilis has more documentation of successful transformations, we decided to embark on a path less traveled by, to attempt to transform S. pasteurii. Character"

Figure 1: The yeast toolkit starter set comprises of 96 parts and vectors. The eight primary part types can be further divided into subtypes. (Dueber)
The cloning steps regarding the plasmid levels are implemented in E.coli in order to reduce the required time to generate the final plasmids. The different levels are therefore defined by their part content and their antibiotic resistances.
To generate a level 0 plasmid, the gene of interest is ligated into the provided level 0 backbone via Golden Gate assembly using the enzyme BsmBI. The backbone contains a resistance to Chloramphenicol, as well as an origin of replication, creating a very basic yet functional plasmid.
The level 1 plasmid contains a promoter and terminator suited for S. cerevisiae. There is the possibility of including  a polyhistidine-tag if there is a need for Western blot analysis. The antibiotic resistance contained in the level 1 plasmid changes from chloramphenicol to ampicillin which enables filtering out residual level 0 plasmids contained in the Golden Gate product. Furthermore, the Dueber toolbox includes the possibility of designing GFP-Dropout cassettes. These are custom-built level 1 backbones whose inserts are sfGFP as well as promoter and terminator suited for E. coli.  Upon a successful cloning step the GFP is replaced by the part(s) of interest, and correct colony shows a white colour. In case of a wrong ligation event colonies show a green fluorescence. This provides a very useful tool to detect unsuccessful cloned colonies. The enzyme used for level 1 changes from BsmBI to BsaI to avoid any interference between different steps.
The level 2 plasmid combines two or more genes of interest with their respective promoters, terminators and tags. The resistance changes from ampicillin to kanamycin. The enzyme of this step is BsmBI again. This level is useful, if the construct you are designing requires multiple genes to be transformed into one yeast strain.
Yeast nomenclature
To make it fast and easy to differentiate between endogenous and heterologous genes and gene products we decided to use S. cerevisiae nomenclature according to yeastgenome.org .

Characterizing the T7 Promoter Variants
Skip straight to:
Characterization of Designed Variants : Characterization Results for the Designed T7 Promoters
Characterization of Randomer Variants : Characterization Results for the Randomer T7 Promoters
Characterization by IPTG Induction : How an IPTG Induction Experiment Works
Characterization Using Fluorescence
For each family, we tested the randomers and the designed variants separately. To characterize the promoter strengths, we used RFP as the reporter gene and used a platereader to test for fluorescence during and after induction with IPTG.
The six designed T7 promoter variants are named as a function of their predicted promoter efficiency, relative to the wildtype. For example, T7 14 has a predicted efficiency of 14% compared to the consensus T7 promoter, whereas T7 111 is predicted to be 111% more efficient than the wildtype. In the chart above, you find each of the designed promoter variants for both the T7 with and without the lac operator, arranged in increasing predicted efficiency. Contrary to our expectation, some variants that were designed to have a lesser efficiency than the wildtype (e.g. T7 54) seem to have a much higher strength (as measured by fluorescence at saturation, normalized by the optical density). Already in the designed variants, we see a substantial difference in the behaviour of the promoters that have a lac operator as opposed to those that do not. The data for this graph was produced in triplicate, so the error bar represents the standard error across those three measurements.
In addition to fluorescence at saturation, another way to characterize promoter strength is to look at its induction ratio, which is the ratio, at saturation, of fluorescence produced by induction with IPTG versus fluorescence produced without induction. In layman's terms, it indicates how strongly the promoter reacts to induction. Here again, our results indicate that some promoter variants (T7 "

On the other hand, some of the teaching mediums (textbooks, Powepoint slides) are in English. The exception to this was Peking. In their university material is taught in both Chinese and English, while the students participate in classes of English for academic writing. Finally, the team composition (for this year, at least) is not entirely of home students, as an exchange student from an American university has joint. In addition to language differences, other contrasting attitudes towards the competition emerged which may also be factors affecting team performance. European teams may start brainstorming throughout their Spring term, but official work in their project is conducted mainly during an intense summer term. On the other hand, for the Asian teams iGEM is a more spread out, year-long endeavor, with the project starting even before registration for some (SYSU China).
The Judges
Another aspect we have considered this year is the nationality and languages of judges recruited for the competition. As an international competition, it is expected and desired for the judges to reflect this. The majority come from participating universities and of course have a background in Synthetic Biology as scientists, engineers or social scientists in the field. From 2009 to 2013, approximately 40% of the judges are able to speak one or more languages in addition to English. Although this is generally good, specific languages are often under represented amongst the judges. A good example is the representation of Mandarin, in 2013 less than 5% of the judges were speakers, whereas 20% of the teams (over 40 from China and Taiwan) spoke the language, however the percentage is more balanced in other years .
Over the years, the percentage of multilingual judges has remained relatively constant. The dominant second languages are Mandarin or French with German and Japanese also being well represented. All these languages are spoken in countries with a consistent presence in the competition.
A case could be made that the lingual abilities of judges should not be playing a role in the competition. This is partially true, as all of the teams are expected to present their projects in English, up to the standards of the international scientific community. On the other hand we can argue that it is easier for scientists with a foreign background to understand and appreciate the additional challenges for teams where English is not their"

Achievement
Combine wet and dry labs
We have built the Turing Pattern experiment system that “wet lab” methods made sure the “dry lab” results. Creating oscillation is one of the popular themes in iGEM. This time we considered of reaction-diffusion equations and constructed a simulation program which contributed to building more feasible experiment system of Turing Pattern. In addition, we also have applied simulation to RNA Oscillator and have built a construction of gene circuits by RNA and thus we succeeded in characterizing it partially.
Consideration
Our project have implications for the safety and ethics and ownership and sharing. Now we would like to describe them in order.
safety
We have considered and organized the safety, such as the chassis organisms, their risk group and derivation can be checked from this Safety page.
ethics
We have to kill transformed E. coli in order to attain the target plasmid because many BioBrick parts are derived from organisms. However, the BioBrick parts iGEM Kyoto submitted this year are all artifically synthesized. Therefore, the problems of ethics are completely solved. Certainly, treating artificial life has some ethical problems, but this is a considerable and long-term issue closely related to the development of synthetic biology. In our Human Practice project, we carried out an survey on attitude towards bioethics which is closely connected with our iGEM activities.  We discussed the results with a professor, who belongs to the Graduate School of Letters, Kyoto University as well. This discussion led us to revise our attitude towards the subsequent approaches of Human Practice project.
ownership and sharing
When we want to share parts coding proteins, we have to construct, amplify and extract target plasmid and send them in a lot of cases. Frankly speaking, this is troublesome. However, BioBrick parts iGEM Kyoto submitted this year are only about a few hundred base pair, and are all synthesized. Just by sharing the information of the sequences, you can get these parts in the same conditions Therefore, we can easily share"

1. Design and Synthesis of hyaluronan synthase gene has2
The initial step of our project was the artificial synthesis of the has2 gene sequence coding for the hyaluronan synthase of the naked mole rat. The sequence was taken from the freely accessible genome database UCSC Genome Browser , whereby the sequence data was gained by shot-gun-sequencing (Kim et al., 2011). The gene sequence was adapted to the altered codon usage in Bacillus megaterium with JCat (Grote et al., 2005). Additionally the open reading frame (ORF) of the has2 gene was modified so that prokaryotic ribosomal binding site (RBS), rho-independent transcription termination as well as restriction enzymes that are also part of the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the target plasmid pSMF2.1 were excluded. For the upcoming cloning process of the has2 gene the nucleotide sequence was terminally modified with the restriction sites MluⅠ (5`end) und SacⅠ(3`end). Moreover a B. megaterium specific RBS was added downstream the MluⅠrestriction site for efficient protein expression. We paid attention to the fact that the amino acid sequence did not change. Subsequently the 1693 bp long modified gene sequence has2 (fig. 1) was handed over to Eurofins who performed the gene synthesis and the cloning into the standard delivery plasmid pexK4 plasmid.
Figure 1: Modified gene sequence of the naked mole rat`s hyaluronan synthase has2 (1693 bp). The start codon and stop codon of the has2 sequence are marked (blue). At the 5`end the restriction site MluⅠ(light blue) and the RBS (grey) is annexed. At the 3`end the recognition site of the"

Catechol Degradation
The focus of our project is to decrease the toxicity of tailings pond water through bioremediation. We are specifically interested in the degradation of the toxic molecule catechol into 2-hydroxymuconate semialdyhyde (2-HMS); a bright yellow substrate that can be metabolized by the cell. This conversion is accomplished by a protein called catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (xylE).

To test the system and also to know the dangerousness of genetic pollution, we have induced the land desertification, the green house effects and the water eutrophication, together with the genetic pollution, to compare the relative performance of the four environmental problems in different aspects.
How to use the system
A questionnaire survey should be conducted to collect data of public attitude towards the four problems. The evaluation system is also very easy to use, we only need to rank the four problems waiting for evaluation through the different perspectives at the leaf note (the points which do not have child note) of the evaluation tree. After collecting of the data, we only need to do some basic calculation to obtain the final result of the evaluation of these problems on different layer of evaluation index. All these calculation results will be very helpful to help us to understand all these teams' performance in all possible level and perspectives.
The inner operating principles: AHP
All the data are obtained from that of questionnaire. And the relative values are transformed through comparison matrix. All the other calculation procedures are flow the previous procedure of AHP method.

Eliot started concentrating on the tyrosine assay. Since ligating TyrR into ARM would take too long and be subject to setbacks, he used only the ARM backbone with endogenous, wild-type TyrR in DH5a. Eliot transformed TyrR into DH5A cells today, growth in LB with TyrR to come on Tuesday.
Tuesday
Ryan continued the Mutation Rate Assay protocol, checking ODs and making according overnight cultures. Also checked the nonselective plates from Monday. Eliot delayed transformation of the ARM backbone delayed since either he goofed and added DNA to the negative control or contamination or plates were bad or something. Ergo, Eliot decided to redo the transformation, making sure to grab a plate from a different batch this time.
Wednesday
Ryan checked ODs and plated cultures for the Mutation Rate Assay and made 40 more rif plates. Eliot’s transformation went much better this time. Negative control looked weird: there might be some growth but the agar in this plate was weird, so it could have been the agar looking like that. ARM plate actually showed good growth, however, compared to the other plate. Eliot made the tyrosine cultures and added samples of 3 colonies to each. Needed to match the tyrosine concentrations, though. Eugene suggested starting from a controlled concentration and diluting it down, so trying that. Planning to pick 3 colonies, add them to different concentrations of tyrosine. Concentrations: 0-500mg/L, in 50mg/L intervals (50, 100, 150…) 3 colonies picked, suspended in 35uL H2O each. 2uL suspended colonies put in 5uL LB/Tyr
Thursday
Eliot took cultures at 12:05 PM, total incubation period is 16 hours. Successful growth occurred in most cultures, with the exception of 2 vials: should not affect results too much if data is consistent across all 3 colonies, as the vials correspond to different colonies and are not in the range of 200-300mg/L tyrosine, which appears to be the point at which AroF is repressed judging from the previous assay. He loaded approx. 200 µL culture into wells of 96-well plate. Rows A, B, and C corresponded to colonies 1, 2"
ITU_MOBGAM_Turkey,2013,Team:ITU MOBGAM Turkey#project_-_-_TEXT.html," does it work?
The first part is just to keep alive in the presence of glucose. MazE would be produced by the sense of glucose and a weak constitutive promoter (BBa_J23102) is used for MazF production. Thus, MazF would be found in equilibrium with MazE. In the absence of glucose, amount of MazF would be more than MazE so cell would go to death.
Toxin-Antitoxin Module: MazE-MazF
Figure 1: The multiple levels of autoregulation of the MazF–MazE toxin–antitoxin system.
a | MazE and MazF are synthesized from the same promoter. MazE forms a complex with MazF under normal growth conditions. b | Under stress conditions, MazE is subjected to cleavage by an ATP-dependent protease. As released MazF cleaves its own mRNA, the expression of MazF is autoregulated. MazF activity leads to the arrest of bacterial cell growth and to eventual cell death. It has been shown that a few mRNAs are resistant to MazF in E. Coli.
The second part is to prevent the overproduction of cells. A promoter that sense auto inducible 2 molecules is used to control MazF production. If cells reproduce more, AI-2 is produced by cells and this promoter would sense AI-2, so MazF production would be increased. (Engelberg-Kulka, Hazan et al. 2005) Hence, MazE and MazF equilibrium would be broken and cell would go to death.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html,"-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together with other similar components created by users. Compartment contains cells and other microscopic organisms that can multiply. compound contains small molecules like IPTG and other compounds. PlasmidBackbone contains plasmid backbones come from PartsRegistry or defined by users. Substituent contains substitutes for template modeling.
:: Species: This container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored. It is suggested that the constructor of a database stores template species instead of real species in this container. Only in this way can he make use of the power feature of template modeling of MoDeL.
:: Reactions: This container contains definitions of various reactions. Each component has its own compartments, reactants, modifiers, products, substituent transfers, and kinetic law. This forms a detailed description of reactions. Again, constructor of a database is suggested to store template reactions instead of real reactions.
The organizational structure of components in MoDeL is shown in the following figure.
Figure 6: Structrue of MoDeL components
As mentioned above, reference relationships are stored in most components. The following figure shows the relationship between different components, the pointer pointing to a component indicates referencing to that component.
Figure 7: Reference relationship of MoDeL components
It is worth noting that MoDeL does not attempt to include all information about each component. In PartsRegistry, a long list of data in XML format is provided including part author, status, sequence, and even group access information. Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between"

Modeling background
Regulatory mechanism of compatible solutes.
The accumulation of osmotic active compound in cells is highly harmonious with cells’ function. This phenomenon is called compatible solute.
While the surrounding osmotic pressure bumps up, K+ in cells is accumulated a lot, with the increase of Glu synthesis. Then K+ and Glu become the secondary messengers, leading the compatible solute’s accumulation. The compatible solute opens the channels which K+ out flows through, in order to balance the osmotic pressure.
The osmotic pressure out of cells rises, cells expel compatible solute like K+ from intracellular environment to adjust and control the osmotic pressure be balanced. The emission of K+ leads the change of membrane potential.
Modeling assumption
1.We presume the Kcsa protein we bring in is not co-regulated by compatible solute.
2.We presume the osmotic pressure doesn’t change after adjustment.
3.We presume the environment out of cells is large enough that any matter or physicochemical property won’t change.
Modeling building
1.The osmotic pressure doesn’t change, being kept in a normal level. The figure of osmotic pressure is 709.12kPa in reference.
2.We set the osmotic pressure out of cells P
3.We set the concentration of K+ in cells c_1, and the concentration of K+ out of cells c_2.
4.We build the connection between ionic concentration osmotic pressure and potential by introduce Nernst equation.
In a certain limit, the quantity of osmotic pressure increase and K+ production is proportional"

Postcard Campaign
Virtual Conference
Surveys
We participated in Düsseldorf Cologne postcard campaign in which we designed a postcard combining the Abu Dhabi skyline and the LAMP reaction that is integral to our project. We wrote a small description of our project on the back, and the postcards were distributed to all participating teams from around the world.         Therefore, STEC-illnesses are still a major problem in countries that revolve around street food.
Groningen
Groningen iGEM team participated in our virtual conference, and both the initial call and the follow-up calls were successful. Their project was to build a phage detection for Lactococcus lactis, but were having trouble with the BioBrick 3A assembly and building their device. We suggested that they try using the pJET vector for transformation and implementing a valving system in their device. For the GFP amplification issues they were facing, team Vilnius-Lithuania suggested that they express transcription factors that can bind to multiple sequences at a time to amplify their signal.
Vilnius-Lithuania
Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team participated in our virtual conference, and both the initial call and the follow-up calls were successful. Their project was to have a synthetic replicant to effectively keep different plasmids in one cell with the ability to control the copy number of each plasmid group separately. We looked into the issue of calculating copy number, while they helped us look at our microfluidic chambers.
We participated in the following surveys:
The microfluidics survey for Boston University Hardware.
The cholera survey for INSA-UPS Toulouse.
The cattle survey for University Nebraska-Lincoln.
The air pollution survey for Pasteur Paris.
The GM medicine survey for Cardiff University.
The insulin accessibility survey for University of Sydney.
The psicose survey for Evry Paris-Saclay.
The diagnosis device survey for Munich.
The perspectives on treatments for illness survey for Columbia NY.

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#BioPlastic Recycling: PHB_-_-_TEXT.html," steps are carried out by phaB and phaA enzymes, as described in Module1.  This pathway contains both new enzymes that we are introducing to E.coli and also endogenous enzymes, such as AtoA/D. Because of this, the pathway is in connection with the cells normal metabolism and our models were of great use for predicting the flux through the pathway and informing the design.
Plastic synthesis from 3HB monomers. 3HB is taken up into the cell by the putative permease. The 3HB is then converted to P(3HB) by the pathways shown. The genes in green are those we have expressed within MG1655. Our system takes advantage of the endogenous ato operon.
Synthesis of P(3HB) from 3HB: Biobrick design▼
3HB Permease:
For 3HB import, we designed a biobrick for the expression of a Putative permease, found in the literature [1] . We optimised the sequence for E.coli and planned experiments with the construct.
Construct for bdh2 dehydrogenase expression
BBa_K1149050 : Intracellular expression of bdh2, 3HB dehydrogenase enzyme. We have used a strong arabinose inducible promoter BBa_K206000 in front of the operon for controlled expression of the enzyme; this enzyme is only required by the cell if 3HB is present.  We have included superfolder GFP BBa_K515005 in the operon with phaZ1 so that we can monitor gene expression from the promoter via fluorescence measurements. (see our corresponding data under results)
PLA degradation: pathway and biobrick design▼
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) depolymerases are categorized into protease-type and lipase-type (7). We examined the literature and found sequences for one enzyme from each type.
Protease-type
Proteinase K sequence from Tritirachium album, hydrolyzes poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) only.
Lipase-type
Cutinase-like enzyme (CLE) sequence from Cryptococcus sp. strain S-2 preferentially hydrolyzes poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA), but can also cleave poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA).
We considered the safety aspects of using these two enzymes, since their sequences were originally from Risk Group 2 (RG2) organisms. We submitted our safety information to iGEM for review. Safety forms were approved"

Both our kill switch and Cre-Lox systems were designed to be modular and effective against any basidiomycete, no matter the application or species.  The analysis of our project with the CEA revealed potential ethical and safety issues, which allowed us to effectively address potential concerns with the genetic engineering of fungi.

Introduction
Inter-team communication is beneficial for each participant to catch up with valuable information and further improve the iGEM project according to advice from other teams. It is popular to use social websites or forums as a platform of inter-team communication. This year, XMU-China team (From Xiamen University) started a project named Newsletter, which aims to provide a series of online pamphlets that is regularly updated with communication letters from teams around the world. SYSU-China also participates in the Newsletter (see Fig-1).

<p1> Left: the Front page of Newsletter electronic pamphlet, designed and issued by XMU-CHINA, the iGEM team from Xiamen University, China. Right: the front page of SYSU-China team in Newsletter issue-3. </p1>
The Newsletter mainly contains two sections: an introduction to the team’s current project and new things of fun about the team. Thus, all teams have a chance to get close to one another, and then create more opportunity for iGEM work. As participants of Newsletter, we introduced our team and project, shared our fun in daily life, and keep refreshing experiment progress.
SYSU-China in Newsletter – Special contribution
We are lucky and glad to have a chance to provide further help for XMU-China, which includes: iGEM judging form assistance and the interview for special issue, as one of the most active teams participating in Newsletter.
1. iGEM judging form assistance
We are glad to assist XMU-China team in releasing the survey questionnaire about individual evaluation on official iGEM judging questions. After we received their request for official judging form information, we shared with them our previous feedback form which includes the questions they need, and we sincerely hope that our material can help them conduct the survey among all teams.
As the result shown in their special issue-1, the survey was successfully conducted and reliable data was obtained. It seems that the question list did help them in better understanding the current official judging form, and we believe this work is useful to improve the scoring system of iGEM competition.

My colleagues and I in the Research and Development Centre of Oil and Gas Technology  division also hope that ITB team could promote this kind of competition and research more in the future. Right now,  the prospect of this research seems promising since a research such as RhamCOLIpid has never been done before in Indonesia. Therefore, we wish that the produced biosurfactant could be applied in the oil and gas fields and provide better production of oil in the future. We are looking forward to developing this research through collaboration with ITB.”

“Nowadays, many biological scientists work in research and development of Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) that produce surfactant. As you may know, surfactant is commonly used as a media for EOR which has specialized criteria. In general, the chemical should decrease the interfacial tension (IFT) so that a lot of microemulsions could be produced. Unfortunately, utilizing surfactant in EOR is not as simple as that. One of the drawbacks is its water solubility characteristic, hence it would not be soluble in oil and could not be used in EOR. If ITB_INDONESIA iGEM team could produce a biosurfactant which has a good IFT, it will be a nice shot. I wish you the best of luck with your project” Dr. Ir. Leksono Mucharam, M.Sc.

Section 3: Weighing the Consequences
Now that we have established the demographics whose use is likely to be affected by the implementation of our biosensor, we can return to the original question: is the implementation of the biosensor morally wrong because it will cause more drug use? This is somewhat difficult to answer definitively without empirical evidence, but we can at least draw some general conclusions based on the three groups that would be affected by our biosensor. Recall that problematic drug users would plausibly be positively impacted by our biosensor because, if they are using it in the first place, then they are probably trying to minimise the associated risks. This would count in favour of the implementation of the device being morally good.
In the case of recreational drug users, the biosensor could increase the frequency of use, which would count in favour of it being morally wrong. However, knowing that recreational drug users already engage in drug use without the biosensor, it is necessary to also consider the positive effects it may have; namely, reducing the chances of overdose. So, on the one hand, the biosensor has negative consequences for this group because it increases the frequency of use. On the other hand, it has positive effects because it makes this use safer. It is difficult to determine which way the balance tips, and the matter appears ambiguous at best.
Moving onto the third and final group, the implementation of the biosensor could very well have a negative effect. This group contains individuals who do not use drugs at all, though they do not harbour some higher order objection to their use. Arguably, they are better off remaining abstinent from drug use, and so, if the biosensor is enough to push them to engage in this activity, then it has negative consequences for these individuals.
Let us now turn to a final evaluation of, and tentative answer to, the question at hand. Recall that the utility principle states that an action is morally wrong if it promotes more suffering than well-being. So, in the final moral reckoning, we are essentially asking if the implementation of the biosensor will have more positive or negative consequences for society. We reasoned that only three groups would be affected directly by our biosensor. For recreational drug users, the biosensor will have both negative and positive consequences. Without empirical facts to accurately determine the respective quantities of these consequences, it is best to treat the biosensor’s effect on this group as neutral. Thus, we are left with weighing the positive effects the biosensor has for problematic drug"

Public Perception
Desert Island... Science?
‘Desert Island… Science?’ is an interview series hosted on our YouTube channel and wiki, in which we spoke to a variety of academics and leading figures in science, and often more specifically, in synthetic biology. It is inspired by the similarly named ‘Desert Island Discs’ on BBC channel 4, and mixes fun, light questions with more interesting, complicated enquiries into their work, their opinions on topics like equality in science and need for education, etc.
The intention of ‘Desert Island… Science?’ is to humanise academics and experts to the public in light of the current anti-expert sentiment, and make the work of scientist more accessible and engaging to people not involved in the field. Whilst we recognise the perception of synthetic biology has improved greatly since several years ago, there is often still negativity and confusion associated with the general perception of the field, which is something we hope to negate by showing the positive impacts and implications of synthetic through our interviews.

Public Outreach
The Big Bang South West science fair was the first science fair we attended, falling on 29th June 2016. It was aimed towards students of all ages, teachers and parents, and allowed to get a range of feedback on our board game, BioMech, which first premiered there. We also engaged students present with activities from William and Mary’s 2015 activities booklet, using the gene bracelet and sweetie DNA activities to grab attention and open dialogue, both of which worked effectively. We believed that the activities booklet supplemented our intentions of presenting synthetic biology in a friendly manner perfectly.
The Britain Needs Scientists fair was a much smaller fair we attended on 6th July 2016, aimed primarily at A Level students looking at doing a degree in a science. Our primary focus here was highlighting synthetic biology as a multi-disciplinary subject, and engage in more challenging conversations with interested students. Due to the name; synthetic biology an assumption is quickly made that it is heavily biology based, when in fact is contains aspect of all STEM subjects.

Synbio is very preliminary in Japan, have not been really applied. We couldn’t apply it because the technology is not allowed. Ordinary recombinant technology is allowed, but real application to human isn’t allowed.
Do you think Synbio itself is dangerous?
I don’t personally think it is dangerous––in some cases it is, though. We have to estimate the safety of the technology. There should be appropriate estimation on the risk, but until now there isn’t any critical risks examination until now.
Companies around the world have been using product of DNA recombinant or Synbio, such as Sample6 (check out: sample6.com). What do you think?
This is my first time hearing this, very interesting. Some people may worry about the virus in the veggies, which is a recombinant. Maybe most of Japanese will be okay, but some people won’t accept it. They say loudly against them, so mass communication is nervous about it. Mass communication in Japan is restricted and people can’t have opinion because they follow the people of the small numbers. But I think, majority should make it. People are biased by the mass communication, which depends on only some numbers of people. It’s a big problem. Those people don’t know about science but mass communication follows them. Majority should make the mass communication, yet still involving the minority. They don’t have any desire to develop new things to do.
But if it keeps going like this, Asia will be left a step behind compared to Europe or US countries in this technology. What do you think?
It’s a serious problem for all of us. Asia has been far left behind in Synbio. But it’s hard for us. Without application, science and technology couldn’t be developed. Application in Japan and other Asian countries are mostly the same: high costs.
Should government change regulations?
Yes, but still you couldn’t change what they think that instant. It depends on the ministry.
What do you think? It should be really allowed & developed in real application?
Yes of course, because I’m a scientist! I think we have to do it, because there are so many problems around us and with Science & Technology we can solve it. Maybe we could stay without innovation but it won’t work soon because global problems keep surrounding us.
Major findings from the Wilson Center on “Tracking the Growth of Synthetic Biology” in 2013 shows that the number of entities conducting research in Synthetic Biology in Europe and US is very high, but Asia has been left behind. Do you have any opinion?

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," lysostaphin and nutrients present at the line where the hydrogel ends and wound begins for different designs of patches. In order to effectively eradicate the Staphylococcus aureus culture that is present in the wound, it is important that the amount of lysostaphin exceeds a certain concentration at the wound. Furthermore, nutrients should not diffuse to the wound since not only our engineered E. coli likes nutrients, but also harmful bacteria in the wound will thrive well on them.
For convenience’s sake, we decided it to be the easiest if we feed the E. coli by adding a nutrient rich layer on top of the hydrogel patch. This way the nutrient rich layer can be easily replaced once depleted. Because replacement requires the help of a specialist like a nurse, we aim to maximize the time a patch can stay on the skin without anyone touching it. We will try to find an optimal composition of the hydrogel patch, so no nutrients diffuse entirely through the hydrogel to reach the malignant bacteria. However, this should not inhibit the delivery of lysostaphin to the infected wound.
Model
COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a was used to simulate the transport of lysostaphin and nutrient particles within a porous medium. COMSOL uses the finite element method (FEM) to calculate the value of variables within an element for a given timestep. COMSOL allows the user to easily select physical processes, such as diffusion. Also, one can simply construct a grid, set boundary conditions and select simulation times. Its simplicity made the choice for us to use this program very easy.
The physical properties included in the simulation are diffusion following Ficks law (equation 1), and an equation describing the effective diffusivity of particles within a porous medium (equation 2). In this equation the diffusivity (De/Do) scales with the inverse of the porosity, while we used a quadratic inverse relation with the porosity in the first model, as was argued to be correct in (1). In order to avoid confusion between the tortuosity used in COMSOL and the tortuosity determined in the first model, the tortuosity in COMSOL will be referred to as τc where equation 3 holds.
In the first model, where we experimented with the diffusivity of GFP, we got a tortuosity (τ) value between 1 and √1.5. For this model we will use the average of these values, which leads to τ = √1.237 and τc = 1.237.

Modeling wise, a compound can only be accumulated if it can be exchanged within the boundaries of the defined system. In modeling terminology, this means that a metabolite must be a boundary species for which a so-called sink reaction is present. The metabolites in the preliminary list of candidates do not necessarily have a sink reaction, which would not allow them to ever be predicted to accumulate. This is resolved by creating a model version for each compound of the list in which, if necessary, a single new “artificial” sink reaction is added for the respective target compound. These multiple models are then further analyzed individually. Obviously, in reality it is very important to know the exact localization of where a product will accumulate. In this project particular attention has been devoted to transport as experts alerted us to the great impact that it has on the economic feasibility of a biotechnological process as well.
The topology of the metabolic network of each of these models is then evaluated to assess the possibility to make each respective candidate compound in a strict growth-coupled way. Basically we want to find whether the re-utilization of a target compound can be completely disrupted through gene deletions; and if so, which one(s). This is done using an in-house Python implementation extended for gene deletions [5] of Optknock [6]. We then limit the maximum number of deletions permitted according to our experimental capacity. While Optknock identifies the deletions necessary to maximize a specific objective flux, it does not guarantee that the product is uniquely coupled to an anabolic pathway. The strict stoichiometric coupling of the rates of biomass and product formation are therefore tested via Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) on the constrained model with the proposed gene deletions, while using the maximization of biomass formation as the objective function. If the exchange reaction for the target compound has a minimum flux greater than zero, then the viability of making it growth-coupled is confirmed ( in silico of course!). The output of this FRUITS will report a list containing the identified target compounds along with the associated gene knockouts necessary and the maximal biomass and minimum target product formation rates.
During this iGEM project, our supervisors have validated this approach, showcasing it experimentally on the growth-coupled production of acetate. A manuscript describing the algorithm and its experimental validation was submitted at the end of the Summer"

However, we did learn from the                 talk; Prof. Xu, along with her colleagues, told us about how intestine actually functions as the biggest                 immune organ in human body, and how important is our intestinal flora system (which is a hot topic because                 of their close relationship with brain function and aging). After listening to our project details, they                 suggested us firstly, keep in mind that the intestinal flora system is sensitive and requires balance, so                 be careful to make any changes to it, i.e., try not to harm beneficial bacteria when you are trying to kill                 the pathogen. Secondly, they suggested that if we want this probiotic therapy to be widely applied, we need                 to ask for the permission of China Food and Drug Administration （CFDA）, as it’s introducing a genetically                 engineered organism to human body, which has the potential to harm our health in some way. In terms of our                 designed drug delivery method, they confirmed with us that the enteric coated tablets do work, and the application                 of this method does have a bright future. However, we may consult with a pharmaceutical company or factory                 to make everything work.
After the consultation, they took us to the inpatient department and allowed us to visit the patients suffering for gastrointestinal             problems. The wards were fully occupied, which suggested the amount of people having related diseases are really             not low. “To be responsible for providing a better life for everyone”, that’s what each one of us was thinking             about at that time, and will always keep that in mind.

Sheep blood treated with citrate (as an anticoagulant) was ordered and will arrive next week for further testing of isothermal PCR kit in the presence of blood.
Week 15: Sept 1 - 5
We restarted efforts to ligate a reporter or repressor to our synthesized construct. We also transformed E. coli with the synthesized parts, this time done properly with IPTG and X-gal on the agar plates - only few blue colonies were shown indicating that transformation was highly successful. Colonies were selected, used to make overnight cultures, from which plasmid DNA was isolated via the plasmid miniprep protocol. The C2-P22 repressor was ligated with  the Pveg_C1-lambda_consensusRBS construct, using both single-operator and triple-operator variants. Likewise the RFP reporter was ligated with the Pveg_C2-P22_consensusRBS construct with both single- and triple-operator variants. The RFP-ligation allows for straightforward visual screening as successful ligations are indicated by red colonies. The repressor-ligations are being screened via colony-PCR.
We used the isothermal PCR kit for the first time and discovered a new problem - the PCR product contains protein-bound DNA which prevents visualization on agarose gels, and may pose a problem for transformation if DNA is not free. DNA purification is required, however, fortunately dissociation of protein-bound DNA may be induced via 1/10 dilution of the PCR product. This is promising as we would expect a similar dilution in our final prototype, we expect that the strong association between DNA and protein will not pose a problem.
The TwistDx RPA isothermal PCR kit was originally designed for rapidly amplifying short (<400bp) amplicons, unfortunately for our purposes we require amplification products to be closer to 1kbp in size.  According to literature (Piepenburg et al. 2006) it is possible to amplify sequences of up to 1.5kbp using RPA. We are attempting to optimize conditions so that we obtain longer amplicons. We may adjust parameters such as the concentration of primers, magnesium-acetate, dNTP, and ATP, as well as incubation temperature - with the aim of increasing the elongation time while providing enough resources (i.e. ATP) to allow for a longer reaction time.

DoubleOptimizer ● CompositionSearch
Flux Balance Analysis
While working on our synthetic biology projects for this year's iGEM competition, we found ourselves in need of some computational tools for synthetic biology that did not yet exist. Therefore, we developed our own software packages to meet these needs. In particular, we have developed two pieces of software, specifically designed for the needs of synthetic biologists:
● DoubleOptimizer: a tool that facilitates synthesis of repetitive genes by optimizing codon usage to both match a codon usage distribution for a desired organism, and to reduce and avoid repetitive nucleotide sequences, allowing for easier synthesis.
● CompositionSearch: a tool that quickly ranks all proteins in a proteome by their similarity to a given amino acid distribution.
DoubleOptimizer
A utility for simultaneous codon and
gene synthesis optimization
Background
Gene synthesis as a tool for biological engineering presents both opportunities and challenges. One opportunity presented is the ability to optimize codon usage in a gene to match that of a host organism. Compared to traditional cloning methods, this can increase protein yields in the host organism by several fold.[1] However, while there exist a large number of freely-usable programs that perform codon optimization, there is no guarantee that the sequences these programs provide will be able to be synthesized. Specifically, in the case of genes with repetitive amino acid sequences, these programs will often generate outputs that contain too many repeated short DNA sequences to be synthesized commercially.
As an example, the hypothetical protein X777_06170 from the ant species Cerapachys biroi has an amino acid sequence that appears to be somewhat repetitive:

2.We obtained this part directly from iGEM HQ
We added new information to the BioBrick Part (pSB6A1) shown below that was originally developed by the 09’Tokyo-Tech group. This BioBrick Part having the backbone of pSB6, a low copy plasmid was designed to express GFP in E. coli. Generally low copy plasmid is more efficient in protein expression in compared with high copy plasmid such as pSB1. However no quantitative data on the efficiency of GFP expression with this plasmid was described in any site of iGEM. We therefore measured intensities of fluorescence of GFP protein produced in E. coli carrying the pSB6A1 and compared with that carrying"
