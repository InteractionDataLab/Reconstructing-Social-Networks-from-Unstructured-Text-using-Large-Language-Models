Tokyo_Tech,2010,Team:Tokyo Tech#Project#wolf coli#lacIM1_-_-_TEXT.html,"  However, the sequence data of BBa_K082026 is incorrect and it was not well characterized in the BioBrick registry. Therefore, we registered this part as BBa_K395400 and confirmed that LacIM1 shows weaker repression to lac promoter than LacIWT. In order to measure the function of LacI proteins, we constructed following two plasmids, BBa_K395401 (LacIM1) and BBa_K395402 (LacIWT), which have an arabinose inducible promoter. We measured GFP expression dependent on the input of arabinose and IPTG (Fig. 4-2-1).

Introduction
What is LacIM1?
As I wrote before, LacIM1 shows weaker repression compared to LacIWT because of its lower affinity to lac promoter [1].
Requirement for band-detect network
The band-detect network exhibits transient gene expression in response to concentration of chemical signals (Fig. 4-2-3). In the band-detect network, LacIM1 is a crucial component due to its low repression efficiency [1].

GFP expression is dependent on the input of arabinose and IPTG.  After 4 hours of arabinose and IPTG induction, fluorescence intensities of the cultures were measured by fluorometer (FLA5000,FUJI). As positive control, we used BBa_I20260, which is the measurement kit of the BioBricks.

To test for the proper expression of our integron gene in the BioBrick we wanted to have an AttI site and integrase protein present in E. coli. This was so that upon transformation with a cassette (which has an AttC site) a co-integrate would quickly form with the AttI site and before the cassettes  could be lost out of the cell. Upon integration of the cassette the Gentomycin resistance (GmR) present on the cassette is expressed allowing us to select for the correct cells on Gentomycin plates. The negative control had no arabinose induction and so the cassette should not integrate and the cells should not be Gm resistant.
The initial experiments did not yield positive results and due to time constraints we have not been able to troubleshoot the experiment.

An alternative process, in which a diverse array of phototrophic bacteria and archaea harvest energy from light, is through a retinal-containing protein called proteorhodopsin, which catalyses the light-activated proton efflux across the cell membrane and thereby drive ATP synthesis. Opposed to the photosystems, the proteorhodopsin is anoxygenic and generates no NADPH, which is crucial for the Calvin cycle to proceed Walter JM, Greenfield D, Bustamante C, Liphardt J.

Through this meetup, we made connections with other teams and began our collaboration with the Michigan State team.
Trading Cards:
Every iGEM project is changing the world. We want to recognize the SUPER abilities of all the iGEM teams by creating a league of superheroes made up of superheroes designed by each team based on their project.  We gathered information on the name of the team, name of the superhero, the team’s contact info, the “home base” for the superhero, the superhero’s mission, and that Superhero's special powers. All superheroes were placed on a trading card, and each team will receive trading cards from all the teams that participated. Click to see the full card collection!
Postcard:
Our team participated in a creative collaboration opportunity with the Düsseldorf iGEM team at Heinrich-Heine University in Germany. The goal was to bring synthetic biology closer to the public by designing a postcard showing an image related to synthetic biology on the front and a small informational text on the back.  We will get to exchange our postcard with other participating teams so we can collect postcards from all over the world. We can also share the postcards with people in our community to raise awareness and understanding of synthetic biology.
Surveys:
Our team participated in a survey through the UNebraska-Lincoln team, located in Nebraska in the United States of America. Their survey tested our knowledge on different invasive species and native species, as their team is working on creating an effective bait for the Emerald Ash Borer Beetle, an invasive species to North America.
Our team also participated in a survey through the TecCEM iGEM team, located at Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education in the Campus Mexico State (Mexico City). They were organizing a survey to gather information about different treatments of burns around the world. They are looking to develop a new treatment for burned people that will reduce the time of hospitalization and help skin regeneration."

Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analog capable of lowering blood glucose levels; it differs from native insulin in that it has an inversion between proline al position B28 and lysine al position B29. This part has a constitutive promoter and an excretion signal from TAT system at its N-terminus
BioBricks.
BBa_K1731001
Insulin lispro is a human insulin analog that dissociates more rapidly than human regular insulin after subcutaneous injection, resulting in higher insulin levels at an earlier point in time and a shorter duration of action[1]. We designed a sequence of constitutive expression for insulin lispro. Our aim is to express lispro as proinsulin containing peptide C and with a TAT sequence in its N terminus. This construct is expected to be expressed in Rossetagami and Shuffle strains, were eukaryotic protein expression and correct folding are enhanced.
In a future we would replace the promoter of this construct for an OmpC promoter so that its expression can be modulated by EnvZ activation.

Results:
Insulin Expression in Rossetagami (R) and  SHuffle strains. A western blot was performed with transformed strains with Lispro construct and controls from both strains not transformed. Our biobrick is expressed in the two strains, this result only confirms the protein is expressed but further analysis needs to be done in order to confirm fully formed insulin with disulfide bonds.

Two component systems (TCS) are the major signal transduction mechanisms in bacteria; several receptors can sense some compounds in the media to respond with chemotaxis and metabolic changes. There are several periplasmic binding proteins that are the first sensors to a broad range of molecules; the one of our interest is Glucose Galactose Binding Protein (GGBP)(Dwyer and Hellinga 2004). Glucose is sensed by bacteria through the GGBP which has been proposed as a glucose sensor (Hsieh et al. 2004). Trg-EnvZ was initially created in 1994, in order to measure the carbohydrates concentration and using the EnvZ intracellular domain with  a reporter gene, Trg chemoreceptor triggers the chemotaxis of the bacteria while the EnvZ is an osmoregulator"

What more, she pointed out that we could try the “Complementary Trand”, which uses 9nt or even more basic groups, to realize the mutual complement. This suggestion also benefited our experiment and modeling to some extent. Another case worth mentioning is that, when we were encountered with difficulties when using flow cytometry to verify the combination of SYL3C and EpCAM, it was professor Zhu who helped us out of the woods. She suggested us to use another method, fluorescence polarization, to verify the combination of those two molecules [2]. Her advice turned out to be wise and feasible. Finally, we used that method and successfully verified the combination. (See more details in our Results page ).
During the experimental stage:
After Fang's sketch completed
In order to seek confirmation about the prospect of our project and Fang on cancer detection, we consulted this on Prof. Xue. We exchanged and discussed with Prof. Xue about the design of aptamer-based cell free detection system (ABCD System) and the design of microfluidic chip drives by centrifugal force. On the one hand, Prof. Xue fully affirmed the innovation and feasibility of this project. On the other hand, Prof. Xue though it that if we could find a more specific biomarker from one cancer like liver cancer, which would strengthen the academic persuasion of our project. We communicated with Prof. Xue about the next clinical trial plan of the detection hardware, and reached a preliminary cooperation agreement. If possible, we could take the instrument to the lab in hospital, and use the patient's blood sample to verify the performance of the instrument, such as stability and sensitivity.
After the first generation product of Fang completed
In order to prove the feasibility of our project, we consulted the Chief Physician Weiwei Tang. During the talk, Dr. Tang appreciated it that our ideas are of social significance. What's more, Dr. Tang also told us most of those frequently-used and classical clinical detection methods, like ELISA, CLIA and so on are time-consuming, expensive and complex, compared with Fang.
As for Fang, Dr. Tang agreed with our proposals that we are going to make Fang widely used among basic medical institutions, especially in remote and poverty-stricken areas because of its convenient and practicability. But it's worth noting that today there is an authoritative method for disease-diagnose, that is pathological diagnosis. So our detection method would just serve as a kind of screening tool rather than diagnosis method, according to Tang's suggestion. We also should pay attention to the testing sensitivity of"

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the medal criterion or award listed below .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

Although no labeled cytosolic metabolites could be detected we proved qualitatively the functionality of the Mdh. This leads to the assumption that the activity of the Mdh is too low to incorporate enough formaldehyde. Another possible explanation is that subsequent enzymes of the pathway do not function properly. The measured metabolites give no hint which of the implemented steps of the MCC does not work because the measured carbohydrates are only labeled if the assimilated molecule has passed the whole MCC.
The Xpk should have no influence on the assimilation of formaldehyde because without this enzyme the pathway equals the Ribulose-Monophosphate-Pathway (RuMP) which was already  shown as a functional pathway if it is implemented in E. coli [6] .

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

We did again a yeast genomic extraction (C. tropicalis), but this time we changed the protocol:
Pick 8 colonies of C. tropicalis growth in YPD media and resuspend them with 100 μL of solution (200 mM LiOAc and SDS 1%).
Incubate 15 min at 70°C.
Add 300 μL of ethanol 96%. Then, vortex the solution.
Centrifuge 3 min at 15000 xg.
Discard the superatant and resuspend the pellet (precipitated DNA) with 100 μL TE.
Centrifuge 1 min at 15000 xg.
Recover 1 μL of supernatant.
Using this genomic DNA as a template, we run a PCR (using Taq polimerase) with our primers and another one as a control.

MODELING
We attempt to describe, in a precise way, an understanding of the elements of a system of interest, their states, and their interactions with other elements.
Overview
We perform deterministic and stochastic mathematical modeling alongside wet lab experiments, and the calculated channel capacity values from models and experimental data fit well with each other. The ability to precisely transmit information is crucial for biological process, which is quantitatively evaluated by channel capacity, a novel concept in information theory. Structure differences of gene regulatory circuits give rise to different capacities and, in turn, different levels of information certainty and reliability. Specifically, although splitting the expressed protein into two halves that can assembly to form dimer provides more flexible functions and other regulatory benefits, it curtails the information capacity compared to expressing the undivided protein. Adding intein sequence to the two parts, however, compensated for the loss of capacity by making the association process irreversible. Simulation results tie in with data measured from synthetic gene regulatory circuits, showing the same conclusions. Furthermore, our models predict several conclusions under conditions we not yet have time to carry out, or even hard to achieve experimentally, and illuminates the way for future research and design.

Note that the transformation protocol from the Silver Lab indicates a minimum DNA concentration of 250 ng/uL, requiring 4 uL of this.  This means that we may very well have to purify the DNA even further before linearizing it.  We shall commence with the linearization and then purify it afterwards.

Experimental approach
In the framework of recombinant phage gene design we decided to fuse the adenovirus 5 penton base to the D protein of the Lambda phage. The protein D extraction from Lambda phage genome has been lead by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with several couple of primers. The same  strategy has been applied for the adenovirus 5 penton base extraction which has been extracted from a plasmid coding for the virus offered by Dr. Karim Benihoud (UMR8121, CNRS/IGR, Villejuif, France).
After the fusion protein formation, this one is introduced in a BioBrick plasmid. This plasmid contains a resistance against an antibiotic to confirm the transfection of the recombined phage into bacteria and a reporter gene, like GFP, with eukaryotic promoter, the CMV of the Simian virus 40 (SV40), to confirm the transfection in eukaryotic cells. This strategy permits us to prove that the bacteriophage is able to infect eukaryotic cells.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to build the fusion protein in time. However, scientific literature show that the cell vector , a Lambda phage type, confection is possible by fusion of the penton base with the D protein (Stefania Piersanti et al. 2004). The central sequence of the penton base , amino -acids 1 to 571, fused with the bacteriophage offers a transfection in eukaryotic cells, like the use of the RGD fragment responsible for the entry of the virus and the exit of the endosome, fragment 286 to 393.

Design of the fusion protein
For the fusion protein design, we decided to extract separately the adenovirus 5 penton base and the D protein of the Lambda phage thanks to primers containing a BalI restriction site on the protein D reverse primer and the penton base forward primer. Moreover the finale fusion protein contains specific BioBricks fragments to its prefix and suffix.
For these 2 genes extraction we used the following primers:
First and second pair for genes extraction:

Forward : 5' ATG-ACG-AGC-AAA-GAA-ACC-TT 3';
Reverse : 5' AAA-AAA-ATC-CCG-TAA-AAA-AAG-C 3'.

- Complexity of venom: Our device is measuring the proteolytic activity of the venom. This could be either phospholipase 2A, metalloprotease or other proteases in the venom.  This means that the linkers used should encompass multiple activities of the venom. This effectively means that the device should enable for multiple oligopeptide variants that are known to be targets for the enzymatic activity in the venom. In order to take this point into account, we have developed an application for discriminating between snakes species using logic gates.
Angela A. Amadeu, Instituto Butantan, Brazil: This institute is well known for it’s large collection of venomous snakes. We got in contact with the research group under Wilmar Dias da Silva professor of the immunological lab in Sao Paulo, who works with snakes native to Sub-Saharan Africa. From the group. Angela A. Amadeu, who is studying the venom of Bitis arietans, was able to give us information on the venomics of Bitis venom. Furthermore, she provided inputs to how our team could test our proposed biosensor and imitating blood samples by adding serum and blood thinners such as Heparine to our venom when testing our device.
Gernot, J. Abel Novozymes Novozymes is a big player in biotechnology, working with enzyme products. Their feedback reflects their opinion on the requirement for a viable solution for the market. We discussed the importance of certification, robustness and specificity of our prototype in addition to the user experience . We had time to incorporate the feedback on:
- User experience Simplify the user platform
- For the lowest common denominator by applying simple visuals
- Give option to access snakes envenoming relevant resources.
This is especially relevant if the rural clinics lack expertise, both professionally (lacking doctors) or knowledge on the subject. We have a simple and intuitive color-scheme on the smartphone interface. In addition, we have incorporated the option to get more information on the snake, when and which antidote is needed and the geographic area, where the snake is found. This information is facilitated by WHO snake database, which also has pictures of the snakes and maps of where they are found. In addition, it provides a list of antivenom suppliers. This would enable the treatment facility to offer a better course of treatment.

The most satisfying part of our effort was when students from A.C.Tech ,after our presentation expressed their desire to start an iGEM team in their college next year and asked us to keep them updated about iGEM
Inference
From the above graph, we can infer that there is drastic increase in the knowledge of students about our anti microbial peptides and delivery design. The students were supportive and greatly accepted our delivery design. From the chart, it was found that the negative response from students was also seemingly reduced. Thus this explains the minds of younger generation towards acceptance of GMO’s, ensuring its safety to human beings.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a bright or a rich scientist? Do you interested in lab trials or in reflexion?  Do you want to work alone or in a team? Try to apply a strategy to have patents on our projects and win many biobricks to complete your research project in order to win the game!
Only suggested as an idea by the old teams during the previous years of iGEM Bordeaux, our team decided to realize a funny board game on sciences and laboratory life. We want that everyone can play the game without a great scientific background, so we worked hard on the questions and the mini-games relative to sciences.
That is why, all of the team helps on the elaboration of the questions, inspired of scientific facts which are misunderstandings or simple notions learned in our studies. They also gave their opinion on the mini-games proposed in the challenge part. These mini-games are linked to science in order to familiarize people to genetic concepts (as transcription or translation). Testing these challenges on members of our team; considerated as expert players; allows optimizing the time of playing for novice players.
The board game is composed of six types of squares: Meeting, Lab’ Life, Experiments, Sponsoring, Patent and Redaction. Each square represents a step in the researcher work.
For the conception, Jordan and Charlie are the two members that worked hard on the principles of the game, helped by Caroline and Gilles. Caroline, Gilles and Kellian helped on the objects design (biobricks, cards, money, player pieces and board). Thanks to their hard work, we have realized our first board game, and we hope that it will be useful for many people who wants to know sciences and laboratory life!
We tested the game with many people. In case of Imagine Life, the board game was tested by people having a non-scientific background and we also tested it two high school. The reviews made during these tests helps to improve the game to have an operational board game.
Feel free to come try it out at the Jamboree!!!
Working with high school students
Popularization for high school students is very important. Indeed, during this period, few teenagers know what they want to do after their high school diploma. Many of them want to go in medecine studies or economic studies but few of them are interested in sciences whereas it is a field with a lot of job opportunities.
Awaring about that because we also were at high school, it seems interesting for us to explain what are the applications of biotechnologiesfo promoting sciences studies. We focused on biotechnologies because explaining synthetic biology to teenagers is"

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KimberlyChang_-_-_TEXT.html,"id cube play. I created images for the different colored drips, but we haven’t yet implemented the code for changing the drip images when the color changes.
July 6: Nicole was able to get the color cube and plasmid cube drip images to change color to match the color on the color selection cube. I worked on rough animation mockups of the dripping animation and the E. coli animation. I was concerned about using a pre-existing image that had been made by other people for the E. coli image, so I decided to draw my own version. Orit looked over our progress so far and seemed to like what we had. She liked the E. coli animation that I’d come up with and suggested that I make the E. coli resemble the iGEM logo. She also said that ideally we should have a working demo of the app by late next week, so our next task is to incorporate the E. coli cube and its interactions with the other cubes. My goal is to finish the animations for the dripping and the E. coli by Monday.
Week of July 9
July 9: Over the weekend, I had finished the rough frames of the animation, and today I worked on roughs of the different colors for the E. coli and the drip images. Nicole and I were having problems getting the images to display on the cubes, however. I decided to at least have the final images complete, so I worked on the final E. coli images in the evening.
July 10: Nicole was able to get the images to display, and I finished up the E. coli images. We ran into a problem with the drip images because they were being drawn over each other instead of refreshing the screen each time. Therefore, I made new drip images that also included the color and plasmid images so that the whole screen would essentially be redrawn every time the drip images were called. We ran into problems with the frame rate and the E. coli animation moving too quickly on the cubes. In an attempt to solve that, I duplicated each frame of the E. coli animations 5 times. However, the images are still displaying a little too quickly and we’re not sure how to completely resolve that problem. Another issue we’re having is that for some reason, the E. coli images are called out of order, so the animation frames are out of order as well. We’re not sure why that’s happening. We met with Orit and explained these issues to her. She didn’t have any major problems with what we have right now, though she did tell Nicole that because she wants to"

In addition we found that initial growth in MgM7 before the growth in MgM5 improve the production of GFP fusion protein in E. coli (data not shown). So, 10 hrs before exposure we transferred E. coli [SPI-2+GFP-T3signal+RFP] overnight culture from LB + arabinose to MgM7 + arabinose and grow for 4 hrs to charge sufficient amount of GFP fusion protein. 5.5 hrs before exposure, bacteria were transferred to MgM5 + arabinose and grow for 4 hrs to assemble T3 secretion apparatus. 1 hr before exposure, bacteria were washed with RPMI5 three times to remove toxin secreted from E. coli. Then it was resuspended diluted with RPMI5 + arabinmose (final ΔOD = 0.06 at 600 nm). On the other hand RK13 cells were seeded on 6-well plate (2x 10<sup5</sup> cells/well) in antibiotics free RPMI7 at 20 hrs before exposure to the E. coli. When the preparation is completed cell culture medium was replaced with 1 mL of the E. coli suspension (ΔOD = 0.06 at 600 nm) and incubate at 37C in 5.0% CO2 to mimic the environment inside of the phagosome. At the same time samples of  arabinose(-) E. coli[SPI-2+GFP-T3signal+RFP] and E. coli[SPI-2 only] were prepared for the control condition.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator.

In this conference, we were enlightened about the design of our experiment. This opportunity also gave us new ideas about synthetic biology.
Collaboration with Fellow Researchers
At initial stage, we faced lots of problems on microinjection, such as low success rate and low male worms rate after mating. So we contacted Prof. Zhongying’s laboratory at Hong Kong Baptist University, one of the best in genetic manipulation of C. elegans area. We communicated with Doctor Ding on microinjection issues in Prof. Zhao’s lab. With their kind and patient instructions on our microinjection methods, we successfully inserted our parts into C. elegans.

Exeter,2012,Team:Exeter#Results#GvsB_-_-_TEXT.html,"), the remaining two (the promoter and the first gene of the operon) had three      weeks, three different polymerases and multiple changes to reaction conditions expended on them and still failed to appear. The primers had ribosome binding site sequences      included, which should have been an advantage but may have made the primers long and difficult to use. Since we were never able to test Gibson assembly itself it is hard to know     whether a few bases added to the end of the RBS overlaps would have been sufficiently specific for construct assembly.
The primers were designed with the help of Gibthon, an online tool developed by The University of Cambridge. While it was helpful, I personally thought it didn’t fully assist     with designing the primer pairs we wanted. The primer tool designs primers based on the left and right sequences which will overlap but would be more use specifically designing      primers for a given fragment and the sequences to either side of it. Having said this, I don’t think this is a failing of Gibthon (it’s a really useful tool that does a lot      more, such as calculating the required volume of fragments in the assembly mix) I think it’s a failing of Gibson assembly in general, because a lot more fore-thought is required     and mistakes are very possible. There is potential for this to be improved if it becomes more widely used.
If we had had the money we could have ordered genes with overlap regions already present. This, however, would have presented more problems for our project: constructing      operons was only a quarter of our labwork aim. For three of the four lab miniprojects we had the same genes with different uses. Our original hope was to have the genes      synthesised with the overlap, but as we aimed for more things with the project this would have limited the use of each gene and thus was ruled out completely. I thought      designing primers took too long, especially with the rapid changes we made to the project at the start. My personal verdict is that the whole process was inflexible and, given      that we never made an operon, never showed itself to be better than BioBrick assembly.
In a Nutshell
Pros
Good for large constructs
Rapid (when you have the right fragments and ratios)
Simple procedure with easy mastermixes available
DNA can be synthesised/from PCR
Cons
PCR fragments might be difficult and time-consuming to obtain
Requires some foreknowledge and planning to design primers
Yield decreases with complexity of construct
Less flexibility for multiple varied constructs
Antibiotic selection is still required after transformation

4.    Observe GFP signal under confocal microscope
Cell Culture and Transfection
We cultured HEK293FT cells following American Type Culture Collection’s standard procedure, except that we used DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in our culture medium. For transfection, we followed the manufacturer’s protocol of LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) and used serum-free and antibiotics-free DMEM to form the DNA-lipofectamine complex.
Result
Figure 1. CMV promoter drives expression of GFP. HEK293FT cells transfected with Pcmv-GFP gave GFP signals. HEK293FT cells transfected with the commercial pEGFP-N1 showed similar results, while the same construct without any promoter did not give any GFP signals. Scale bar = 10µm.
Conclusion
CMV promoter was observed to drive expression of GFP in HEK293FT cells and green fluorescence signal was obtained under confocal microscope.

Dry Lab Overview
fishPHARM’s mechanical engineering work centers around two main principles: 1) the real-world implementation of a peptide treatment for bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), and 2) the prevention of bacterial coldwater disease outbreaks on fish farms. To address these goals, fishPHARM has developed engineering solutions for the individualized delivery of flavocide, our bioengineered peptide treatment for BCWD, as well as a fish farm tank monitoring system for the constant monitoring of aquaculture conditions.
fishPHARM presents fishBIT, a novel means of delivering time-released flavocide gel to each fish individually. Inspired by fish tags, devices used to track fish in the wild, fishBIT allows fish farmers to target specific fish for flavocide treatment. Farmers can choose to apply the fishBIT system to a few affected fish, or to their whole farms. Each delivery device can store enough flavocide to treat one fish for the prescribed dosing period, as well as be easily re-dosed, making it an effective means of treating multiple and recurring infections. The device operates through passive diffusion of flavocide suspended in a medical hydrogel. FishBIT is safe for the fish, and is constructed using materials which are all approved by the FDA. Testing of the fishBIT system in a hydraulic flow channel has shown that fishBIT can resist normal fish motion and speeds.
FishPHARM presents the Heimdall Monitoring System (HMS) . Named after the Norse god of surveillance, the HMS consists of sensor hardware to be installed within aquaculture tanks, as well as a mobile app for the continuous monitoring and collection of temperature, flow rate, dissolved oxygen concentration, and nitrate concentration. These factors are important in the health of a fish hatchery, and if improperly maintained, will lead to infections and higher mortality rates. Current methods of monitoring these factors are inefficient and not as reactive to changes in conditions. The HMS is still in its development phase. A first prototype of the hardware is in the process of being built, and the mobile app is ready for testing.

The Hill coefficient describes cooperativity of the binding. Positive cooperativity (n>1) means that a bound enzyme has higher affinity for other ligands; negative cooperativity (n<1) means the converse is true; and non-cooperative binding (n=0) means that whether or not the enzyme is bound has no bearing on further binding (Weiss, 1997).
The Hill equation is shown below:
, where [L] is concentration of the ligand (in our case, the inhibitor), Kd is the dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient.
Mouse Inhibitor Serpina3n vs GzmB Activity
Our first dataset (Table 1), which measures Serpina3n concentration vs relative GzmB activity, came from research by Ang et al. at the University of British Columbia (2011). Serpina3n is a known mouse GzmB inhibitor, and the paper documented the effects of Serpina3n on GzmB activity. Given its specificity in mice, this inhibitor was not chosen as part of the final construct, but data from this paper was used because the relevant constants can be analyzed and compared to other inhibitor substitutes.

Several adjustments were made to the equation and dataset so that we could have a meaningful model.  First, GzmB activity was shown as percentages ranging from 10% to 120% in the paper. This is likely because the control for the experiment was set at some point where the Serpina3n expression is not 0. Thus, we scaled down the data points by a factor of 1/120. This scaling is necessary since the Hill equation returns a fraction; the output is limited to between 0 and 1.
More importantly, since the data was presented as the concentration of enzymes that remain free after binding, we needed to modify the Hill equation in order to model the fraction of unbound GzmB. Since bound + unbound = 100%, and the Hill"

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"ussels into Canada, the Alberta government has been exploring many secondary preventative measures including the use of potash (potassium chloride) at high and lethal concentrations. Consequently, it is expected to have negative effects on other freshwater mussel species in the environment, making it a less than ideal option in open water environments and on the crops that would be exposed via irrigation pipelines in Alberta.
Beyond Alberta, there are many other invasive species that affect the environment and economies of Canada. Well known examples include the lampreys of the great lakes, Varroa destructor mites in bees, and even goldfish that had been inappropriately released into Alberta storm drains. Safely preventing the spread of these destructive organisms is a priority that needs to be explored beyond prevention of exposure to the environment.
We would like to propose the use of protein nanocompartments produced cell free in an optimized, mechanistic pipetting strategy, partnered with extensive research in specific toxins for individual pests and invasive species in order to initiate rapid and efficable response [13]. Protein nanocompartments are useful for introducing specific toxins to organisms and would prevent off target effects as well as environmental exposure of the cargo. This would work only in strategy of consistent production and research to prevent imminent threats from becoming realistic hazards. The strategy of which, could be employed by our previous project Next Vivo , which exercised the simplification and improvement of cell free protein synthesis [14]. Using cell free protein synthesis simplifies purification, and if produced efficiently, would allow for more cost effective production.
If the implementation of secondary preventative measures is utilized, an infestation could be stopped before it gets out of control. This is essential to the ideal of preventing negative impact induced by human activity.
Liability in iGEM
Like with all scientific technologies, protein nanocompartments have the potential for misuse such as the delivery of neurotoxins to humans, or the improper release of biological controls. If we are enabling these risks with our toolkit, we also want to address them. This has led us to explore liabilities in biotechnology, concerning the burden of responsibility; Is the liability dependent of the designer or the user? As well, what are the strategies that can be employed by scientists to limit the potential for liabilities.
It is typically assumed that people in science use technologies with the intention of good, but often is the case that the user makes an error and a technology is misused with unintended consequences. The 2002 gene therapy treatment of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) in eleven children is an example of accidental misuse [15]. Fortunately, nine out of eleven patients were"

The objective of this module was to regulate the expression of bacteriophages in a living system, which would be achieved through the use of the quorum sensing system from Vibrio fisheri. The production of the phage is regulated using the pLux promoter and the insertions of LuxI and LuxR in the E. coli genome from <a href=""module1.html"">Module I</a>.
</section>
Background
<section id=""column"">
Quorum sensing is a cell-density dependent gene regulation system. This sensing mechanism is based on the production, secretion and detection of small signaling molecules called autoinducers. The concentration of the autoinducers correlates to the abundance of the microorganisms in the vicinity. When this concentration reaches a threshold, the microorganisms undertake a coordinated change in their gene-expression profiles [1].
The first quorum sensing system to be described was that of the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri, and it is considered a model organism of quorum sensing in gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria colonize the light organ of the Hawaiian squid Euprymna scolopes; when the colonies reach a sufficiently high cell density, the expression of the bioluminescent genes in the luciferase operon (luxICDABE) is activated [2].
There are two proteins that control the expression of the luciferase operon, Lux I and Lux R. The former is an autoinducer synthase, which produces the diffusible signal N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine-lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL), an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL). On the other hand, LuxR is the cytoplasmic autoinducer receptor and DNA binding transcriptional activator. Both are necessary for the correct expression of the bioluminescent genes [4]
The system operates in the following way:
<p> First, the bacteria begin to grow while producing the autoinducer (3-oxo-C6-HSL).
</p>
<p> Then, when the autoinducer reaches a critical threshold concentration, the complex LuxR-AHL is formed. </"

Meeting with a Philosophy Student
After our meeting with Jean-François Sénéchal, several questions remained unanswered about the safety of our project and the repercussions on society. Therefore, we decided to meet a philosophy student, François Champagne-Tremblay, to get the point of view of an uninitiated person. After an hour and a half trying to explain our project in the simplest possible way, we came to the conclusion that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to get answers from someone who does not even know what yeast is. Towards the end of the interview, we had raised more questions than we got answers.
For François, synthetic biology is a technical progress and, as for other technical progresses, the following questions should be asked: Is there a danger to health or the environment? Are waste produced and how will they be managed? What are the impacts of technology on the economy and society? All of these questions led us to a bigger question: Is the sum of the negative impacts greater than the sum of the positive impacts? In other words, is it really worth it?
Potential Environmental Impacts
Currently, the behavior of synthetic biological systems remains unpredictable19. It is also unknown how synthetic biological systems will evolve. In most cases, biological systems engineered by scientists quickly recover their initial phenotype (i.e., they lose their engineered function instead of acquiring a new one)20. Although this notion may seem reassuring, it does not exclude the possibility that those systems might evolve in unpredictable and harmful ways, particularly if spread outside the laboratory.
Hormones can have a significant impact on the aquatic life and can even end up in drinkable water after treatment21. To prevent the risk of spreading hazardous biological entities into the environment our yeast must contain a “kill switch” or any other mechanism to control its proliferation22.
From a sustainable developmental perspective, we hope to develop a more ecological process than the one offered by the chemical synthesis of adrenaline. For example, the biosynthesis of adrenaline would likely necessitate less water as well as no solvent or other toxic chemicals. However, the ecological footprint of each method must be calculated to determine which method is the most environmentally friendly. The extent of the infrastructure needed for each method should also be determined.
Waste Management

Attached to these genes in their respective chassis is a signaling sequence which dictates the expression of these gene products extracellularly. With the expression of these genes outside the cells there should be a significant decrease in the amount of biofilm buildup by these biofilm-creating bacteria and bacteria such as N. multiformis will be less restricted in breaking down the interested components of ASPs.

Cam Zenger, Jared McOmber, and Jordan Berg
The focus of the biofilm team was to insert the genes for Alpha Amylase, DispersinB, and AiiA with a signaling sequence for extracellular expression into the pSB1C3 chassis and to assay the efficacy of these genes in biofilm reduction in ASPs. Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on Alpha Amylase to remove the PstI restriction site found within the gene.

Washington,2016,Team:Washington#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM team plans to take with them.
Setting the Space & Admin Up: October 20 – November 14
We will take inventory of the lab at Tesla STEM and calculate the funding necessary to acquire lab equipment and fundamental supplies it is lacking. We will also set up an address box for out-of-lab orders for the iGEM team. Lastly, we will set up a meeting with the faculty at Tesla STEM high school and teachers from other schools who’ve shown interest to confirm the three required authority figures to fill the positions of Primary and Secondary Principal Investigators for the team and instructor. We will also set up a slack group for the team to stay connected with the administration and eventually the entire team.
Planning, Funding, Recruitment: November 15 – December 31
We plan to meet with the administration team we helped set up to answer questions about iGEM, devise a schedule for the season, discuss funding, and start reviewing the lab training syllabus.  Leaders of the high-school team will also meet  with an expert on the UW iGEM team to learn which companies to ask for funding and how to connect with them. The high-school team leaders plan to hold a 1 to 1.5-hour long interest meeting open to all high schoolers in Washington to introduce them to iGEM and the opportunities available to them. Surveys will be taken of attendees to include in funding letters and to gain contact.  Our team will offer feedback and evaluation for funding letters.  We hope the high-school team will have at least $6,000 by this period.
Season Kickoff & Project Idea Generation: January 1 – February 14
The high-school team leaders have planned leadership meetings to alternate with team meetings which will happen after school, two times a week at Tesla STEM. The first team meeting will encompass dividing the team up into groups of interest such as Outreach & Education, PR, Wet lab, Dry lab, and Fundraising.  Members of the UW iGEM team have agreed to be present at certain meetings to help determine the feasibility of project ideas along with the PIs and instructors. Ideas will also be for synthetic biology education outreach. By the end of January, the team hopes to have agreed on a project. However, project ideas are never really static, and will probably change throughout the year.
Team Outreach: January 14 – February 29
The high-school team plans to implement its outreach ideas during this time at various public events throughout Seattle.  The high-school outreach team will be involved in hosting booths and transportation to these events.
Dry & Wet lab Training: February"

John, Matteo:
We  redid the experiment from the previous weeks, one caveat, we reduced the FDG concentration by a factor of 2, to decrease signal intensity. Since there was still signal in the control without the trigger, so we decided to use PURE instead of our own lysate.
Elia, Lena:
We spent the week doing various Gibson assemblies and subsequently transforming cells with the resulting plasmids (iGEM backbone with LacZ-α, 27B or toehold B) to ensure success. Often that was not the case.
Lisa:
Continuing attempts at amplifying the aptamer extended with T7 and complementary trigger that were ultimately unsuccessful was the main focus of the week.
Malek:
This week, the aim was to help out with amplification as well as colony PCRs.
Tim:
Testing out the hypothesis for the pulldown assay with trigger extended aptamer followed by the addition of lysate with toehold proved to be inconclusive to the naked eye. However, a nanodrop testing of the final solutions showed extreme expression quantities in the assay containing trigger. The team scratched their heads as to what they should conclude from such results.
Finally, the entire delved even deeper into the depths of wiki elaboration, now the main priority.

Overview
Several months of brainstorming, discussions and literature search as well as meetings with different faculty members from the Technical University of Denmark resulted in a joint decision on working on the Spinach project. The initial idea about measuring promoter activities in absolute terms originates from one of our team members, Kristian Jensen, and Chris Workman hinted us about the Spinach concept. The obvious applicability of the project and huge potential has been a main driving force for all of us during the project.
The formation of our team was facilitated by Chris Workman, but the project management, planning, fundraising as well as the designs, work described on this wiki, our results and the submitted BioBricks were done by ourselves. Nevertheless, we owe  thanks to several people for constructive feedback, advice, guidance and for encouraging our work as well as for providing us space in their laboratories.
Students
Initially we divided the team into different subgroups created with regard to our competences at the time of our competence session and personal intentions for gaining new skills. Due to this subdivision, the contributions of each member is greatly reflected by the subgroups each of us has participated in during the project. The members of the different subgroups are as follows:

Overview
Although the science is an integral part of our project, we put some emphasis on human practices as well. Every team member contributed so that we could have a diverse and engaging set of human practices. We reached out many individuals, including one of our MLAs, who is also the Minister of Environment to get her support of our project; rural beekeepers in Southern Alberta to ask about the viability of our project; we also talked to our city council, and an urban planner to see how we could make our city more “bee-friendly”. We interacted with the public by handing out seed packets in parks, and informing them about the decline of bees and the city by-law that makes urban bee-keeping illegal; many signed a petition that we created to remove this by-law. To promote iGEM, we went to two middle schools to tell the students a little bit about our project and what iGEM is.
Government
Meeting with MLA—Shannon Phillips
City Council By-Law
Prior to 1983, residents of the City of Lethbridge were able to beekeep within city limits. However, an amendment to Bylaw 3383 that pertains to bees now prevents residents from being able to do so. In Southern Alberta, bee populations are currently decreasing with reports saying that North American beekeepers are losing approximately one third of their bees each year. As a way to help the bee population, our team made it a goal to try and have this bylaw amended to allow urban beekeeping within city limits.
Community
Seed bombs
We made seed bombs to help spread awareness about the decline of bees, while simultaneously promoting bee population growth. A seed bomb is basically a ball of soil, clay, water, and seeds. The idea is that people plant them in empty lots, undeveloped fields, or even their backyards so that flowers can grow, giving the bees more access to food. We used Smooth Blue Aster, Purple Prairie Clover, and Prairie Coneflower to make our seed bombs because they are native to Southern Alberta, and they would not be considered an invasive species.
We distributed seed bombs to members of the public and informed them"

Background
Abstract
In addition to the more well known silks from spiders and silkworms, we decided to also explore silk from the honeybee Apis mellifera. We cloned the honeybee silk gene as well as several variants of it and submitted them as the first honeybee silk biobricks. To investigate its potential as a biomaterial, we expressed the silk protein and confirmed its presence using SDS PAGE.
Introduction
Silk from Apis Mellifera presents an intriguing alternative to silks from spiders or silkworms. Although it is not quite as strong as these other types of silks, working with honeybee silk has certain advantages over spider and silkworm silk. The size of the honeybee silk protein gene is considerably smaller than the silk genes of spiders or silkworms. More importantly, the gene sequence is non-repetitive, which allows us to synthesize and make modifications to the gene, without the complications that are inherent to repetitive DNA sequences. Honeybee silk also has a very different secondary and tertiary structure than spider and silkworm silks. It forms primary alpha helices, and four silk proteins come together to form a coiled coil structure.
Fig 1:Honeybee Silk Coiled Coil Structure
In wild type honeybee silk these coiled coils are formed from four similar, yet unique proteins, Amelf 1-4. However, a study has shown that using one of these proteins, (Amelf3) is sufficient to reproduce the physical properties of the wild type fibers. A major goal of our project is to give biological fibers entirely new functionalities. Therefore, in addition to expressing wild type honeybee silk, we have also created constructs in which honeybee silk protein is fused to other proteins. Our first fusion construct is honeybee silk fused to super folder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), which will act as our proof of principle that silk can be functionalized while still maintaining exceptional physical properties. Our second fusion"

Lincoln's Challenge Academy
In accordance to our ""hands on"" approach in getting directly involved with our community and involving the philosophies of science with local educational facilities, we visited and presented at the Lincoln's ChalleNGe Academy in Rantoul, Illinois (which was only about a half hour drive outside of campus).
As a part of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program, the students were of a high school age demographic. However, the demographic and educational backgrounds has its differences from the standard educational system. Members of our team who had participated in educational scientific demonstrations had never been exposed to environment of a military academy. The scientific demonstrations involved:
Fluorescent hand lotion to demonstrate the spread of pathogens through common contact with objects and people
Colouring silly putty and exploring the physical properties of the putty we made
Demonstrating and explaining what happens when dry ice interacts with soap, how temperature affects physical properites of substances
Flash freezing everyday items like candy bars and even the silly putty to show how heat energy is transfered
""My visit to those fellow students at the academy will not soon be forgotten. I heard stories, saw faces, and  hopefully made an impression on them. My goal when I went in that building was to shatter any perceptions of  science students and science as “stuffy” and “uptight”. After talking to them between demonstrations, I think I did  that. I wanted to share my belief with them that science and education in general are the most beautiful privileges  we have. In return I feel inspired by them to be a role model and use my talents to help others, wherever I find  myself in the future.”
- Cara Schornak
""The faces seemed familiar, but the atmosphere felt so foreign. It was eye opening to say the least; I feel like the schools most of us on the iGEM team went to pampered us with scientific education focuses. I'm glad we were able to open some eyes too, especially with the demonstrations we did with the liquid nitrogen and dry ice.""

The first module has a promoter responsible to different stresses (UspA), which induces the production of limonene synthase. The stresses create conditions that are likely to produce molecular chaperones, improving the efficiency in the process of protein folding (PURVIS et al., 2005; SHIMIZU et al., 2013). Combining this condition to the problem of storage of our product we chose to use osmotic stress, created by an ethylene glycol polymer (PEG). It showed to be efficient due to its flexible and hydrophilic features, which creates high osmotic pressures, and its chemical arrangement makes it unlikely to interact with other biological molecules present in the genetically modified microorganism (MONEY et al., 1989). The second module is composed by three proteic chaperones, natural from Escherichia coli, overexpressed to obtain a better protein folding. The last module consists in a killswitch. It is a biosafety mechanism responsible for programmed cell death of the bacteria used in this project, after the required time to produce limonene. The killswitch’s function is associated to the action of znuABC operon, and to protein Zur. With this it is possible to control bacterial lifespan, depending on the concentration of zinc present at the final product.

We also received new sequences of construct 9, construct 10, and construct 11 from GenScript and did a transformation with them. The plates had colonies, now the next step is to plasmid switch them to pSB1C3 , because they came in PUC57 backbone. We did a colony PCR and mini-prepped the colonies that worked.
Regarding our protein work, we have transformed BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B into E. coli ER2566 and into E. coli BL21, strains commonly used for protein expression. We also tried a different lysis protocol, with glass beads, which had good yields for protein concentration as determined by the Bradford assay. We did a Western Blot and verified that we have expressed the proteins (Figure 28).

One of the colonies for construct 11 showed the correct band size, so it was sent for sequencing, however it was missing 100bp of the βlac gene. We transformed construct 9 ( pSBIC3 + BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE B +Link+K coil), construct 10, and construct 11 from GenScript in pSB1C3 again. Colony PCR showed some positive results for construct 9 and construct 11.
In addition, we also did plasmid switches of construct 2, construct 20, construct 21, and construct 22 from PUC57 backbone into a PS1C3 backbone. Both the constructs and vector were cut with EcoRI and PstI, and the RFP generator vector also had antarctic phosphatase treatment.

Meanwhile, there supposed to be a “switch” referred as MerR and pMerT. Only the presence of Hg(II) do drive the expression of structural genes and fluorescence related gene. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity should theoretically link a certain correlation to the concentration of Hg(II) in internal condition. For the purpose of continuous detection, what should not be ignored is that we desire enough MerR homodimer to bind to pMerT then interdict the transcription pathway. This clarifies the second aspect of recombinant E.coli quorum sensing system. Concluded, we designed this innovative system intending to get a fasten detection method towards specific metal ions in vivo.

Luminescent Bacteria Method：
Adoption of luminescent bacteria for air pollution monitoring, antibiotics screening and rapid detection of water attracts wide attention in recent years. Luminescent bacteria is a kind of bacteria that can produce visible fluorescence in normal conditions, while its bioluminescence is produced by molecular oxygen and catalyzed by luciferase inside the cell. Luciferase oxidates flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) and long chain fatty aldehyde in the reduction state to FMN and long chain fatty acid, at the same time emits blue-green light in 450 ~ 490 nm.

We also invited them to our school and talked about our projects. We learned about that their project is about a kind of compound named notoginseng saponin. They told us about the process and purpose of their experiment in detail and we noticed that there are some cases they ignored. And also, we help them optimize the process of their experiment and gave them a hand on the analyzing of their result. At the same time, we invited them to our laboratory, showed them how our experiment goes on and also, gave them some advice on the operations they should take care of when they did their experiment. And they also gave us a lot of useful suggestions and all of us had a great and meaningful day!

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic"
Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html," city of Hiroshima had been completely destroyed by a new type of bomb; we didn't know what kind. Three days later, shortly before 11 AM, a siren sounded at the Isahaya factory, notifying us of an air raid. As usual, rather than going into a bunker, I went to the top of a nearby hill with a couple of friends and looked at the sky. We saw a single B-29 going from north to south towards Nagasaki, about 15 km away. I thought that its course was unusual. The B-29 dropped two or three parachutes and I heard sporadic gunshots. Watching carefully, I saw no people attached to the parachutes. Within a few minutes, another B-29 followed the first one, and a siren sounded the ""all clear"" signal. We returned to our factory building.
At the moment I sat down on my work stool, a powerful flash of light came through the small windows. We were blinded for about 30 seconds. Then, about 40 seconds after the flash, a loud sound and sudden change of air pressure followed. We were sure there was a huge explosion somewhere, but we didn't know where. The sky was rapidly filling with dark clouds, and when I left the factory to walk home, about three miles away, a drizzling rain started. It was black rain. By the time I arrived home, my white shirt had turned gray. My grandmother quickly readied a bath for me. That bath might have saved me from the ill effects of the strong radiation that presumably existed in the black rain. The next morning, a technical officer told us that the parachutes we had seen the day before contained measurement instruments and a transmitter. He also mentioned that there was serious damage in Nagasaki, but the details were unknown. The chief of the factory organized a rescue party. We tried to enter Nagasaki, but could not because the roads and the railroad were impassable. Later that afternoon, the railroad was opened to Michinoo, near Nagasaki station, and rescuers began to transport injured people to Isahaya and other cities.
On August 15, in a radio broadcast, Emperor Hirohito declared unconditional surrender. This was the first time that most Japanese citizens had heard the emperor's voice. I think there was a widespread feeling of relief, and also fear for an uncertain future. Many years passed before we had detailed information about the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Nagasaki bomb was a different type and far more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. Even if the use of the"

By separating each element into different plasmid and allowing bacteria to pass on signal by the Quorum Sensing system, it not only allows us to acquire the infinite extendibility of gene circuits (at least in theory), but also helps makers to visualize the gene designing process and assist them designing bio-products without doing experiments.
The software was downloaded by each participant, with the assistance of 5 iGEMers. The participants were trained to use it by written guidance. By running one example, we showed participants how software and hardware were integrated.

Design Thinking Class with genetic circuits
Design thinking is a method for practical, creative resolution of problems. It is a form of solution-based thinking with the intent of producing a constructive future result.
[ Dorst, Kees; Cross, Nigel (2001).""Creativity in the design process: Co-evolution of problem-solution"". Design Studies. 22 (5): 425–437.]
Here we introduced the complete process of design thinking, including proposing ‘How might we’ (HMW) questions, researching, revising HMW questions, and producing solutions.
We told participants that they needed to tell others a story, whether it was a social issue or BioArt. Since time was limited, we encouraged telling bold hypothesis rather than detailed research.
For the solution part, each group were required to design a synbio-product based on the HMW question they’ve raised. To visualize their design, we brought a set of stickers with us.
Fig11. Red stickers represent inputs, including example sensors like heavy metal sensor and light sensor; yellow stickers represent logic gates, enabled participant to structure gene logic; blue stickers, likewise, represent outputs. Some blank input and output are made for the purpose of inspiring participants’ imagination.

BiFC method.
We plan to implement bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to our system. In order to do this we will create a fusion protein composed of α and β hemoglobin subunits with complementary parts of split sfGFP (an improved superfolder green fluorescent protein derivative, which is often used as a marker in molecular biology). When there is no acrylamide in the environment both chains of hemoglobin form a stabile complex allowing to reconstruct a functional, fluorescent protein.
On the other hand, formation of acrylamide adducts at the C-end of hemoglobin chains reduce their mutual affinity, so they are unable to bring the split parts of sfGFP within proximity and fluorescence complementation cannot occur. This should lead to an observable decrease in fluorescence intensity in cells exposed to acrylamide.
We aim to create and test a variety of constructs that will allow an implementation of different BiFC variations. We are planning to use some already applied fluorescent proteins (but unavailable in the BioBrick format): eGFP, sfGFP and mCherry. Additionally, we intend to create constructs based on proteins that have not been applied yet such as: sfCFP, sfBFP, sfYFP, sfVenus i sfCerulean (improved GFP derivatives for BiFC, with additional superfolder mutations). We also intend to compare the above-mentioned combinations to the already available Venus- and Cerulean-based systems.
Such standardized 'BiFC toolbox' (with measured sensitivity and specificity for each individual combination of fragments) will be an important contribution to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
In parallel, our second goal is to develop an alternative acrylamide sensor based on redox state reporter – the roGFP protein.The roGFP protein fused with human gluteredoxin is a highly-specific sensor of the cellular glutathione redox potential (glutathione is a simple tripeptide which takes part e.g. in the cell detoxication process).
HeLa cells
It should be emphasized that in this method the redox state change does not lead to a decrease in the level of fluorescence, but actually causes a shift in the excitation maximum, thus making the outcomes more noticeable. The typical way of acrylamide detoxication in a cell involves conjugating acrylamide to glutathione by S-glutathione transpherase (Cui. S et al.).  Thus, the influence of acrylamide on cellular glutathione pool can be easily"

1. Validated Part
We have validated that our new standard BioBrick Composite Parts BBa_K2411005 and BBa_K2411008 work as expected. BBa_K2411005 is a gene cassette containing a OR2-OR1 promoter, the first forward engineered toehold switch from Green et al., the reporter gene deGFP which a truncated version of GFP that is transcribed and translated faster than GFP, and a T500 terminator. BBa_K2411008 is the same gene cassette as BBa_K2411005 except it contains the second forward engineered toehold switch from Green et al. These parts were tested in our cell free transcription translation system and showed significant expression above our negative control cell free reaction containing no DNA, as well as a reaction containing just toehold plasmid.
2. Collaboration
We collaborated with the BostonU_Hardware team towards a future application of our project: microfluidics. We first provided feedback on the protocols that they developed for assembling and using a microfluidic chip. They built a preliminary microfluidic chip that we could eventually be used to house our cell free tests. We tested this preliminary design by running colored dye through it. We then provided feedback on the chip’s design and how it could be improved.
We also collaborated with MIT to test the potential for their RNA,binding protein MS2 to sterically protect our RNA trigger from,exonuclease degradation. They added hairpin loop structure at one end of,our trigger sequence for MS2 protein to bind.

Multi-signal system
Design of the system
Of course, recording one changing signal in only two time periods is not enough for us to solve real-world problems. As a result, we have further designed multi-signal system based on two-signal system, which records one changing signal in more than two time periods.
Overview of the whole circuit
Like two-signal system, multi-signal system is composed of three parts, logic gates, sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules(Fig.1). The main difference between two systems is the sequential memory structures. Due to the diversity and orthogonality of serine integrases, much more orthogonal integrases used in sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules can be involved in this extending system.
Figure 1 | The overview of the Multi-signal system circuit design. Each integrase and its related attB/P sites are shown in the same color. TF, Transcriptional facters; Int, Integrases; C, Clock; T, Target.
Sequential memory structures
Fig.2 shows the sequential memory structures of multi-signal system(three-signal system). Not mentioned before, attB/P sites of integrases have core sequences. By mutating these sequences, orthogonal sites of one integrase can be made, which means that one integrase may control inversion of two sites, and that there can be little cross-talk. It helps to design this part, which has shown in the same color but in different shape. Other features of this circuit is similar to the two-signal system. It can be extended just by copying and pasting the design, involving more orthogonal integrases.

Summary
''Counting'' is the action of finding the number of elements in a set.  Past attempts at developing counters in cells have mostly attempted to mimic the binary methods that computers use to count. Our first counter takes a new approach to counting in cells, essentially using a mechanical rotary counter implemented on a micro scale.  Each time the counter detects an input, it performs an excision and an integration directly down-stream of the active site, turning on a reporter and rotating over one ""notch"" on the counter.
Our second counter operates on the wholly different principle that the statistical occurrence of a rare event in a large population can be modeled and experimentally verified.  Each cell in our population harbors a construct that when stimulated has a small chance of excising a terminator and expressing a reporter gene which creates cells with a distinctive phenotype.  The number of these cells is thus an accurate count of the number of input stimuli.
As part of the joy of the iGEM competition is actually winning, we have worked out an algorithm based on semantic analysis of past years' wikis that selects and visualises automatically keywords unique to each team. This can be extended in the future to aid in automated analysis of past winners, as well as many other metrics about a given team.
Last but not least... We made major contributions to the nascent SynBioWorld collaborative web platform that aims at building a universal site for  the synthetic biology community as a place to meet, talk, share data and resources, and stay abreast of new developments in the ﬁeld.
Major achievements
These are our major achievements
We designed two different types of counter and timer.
We managed to go beyond the concept and genetically constructed systems that let us test these devices and make a proof of concept.
Specifically:
Our bacteria count to 2! Nothing stops them from counting more.
We have shown that the IntI1 integrase can perform specific excision of a site flanked by two attC sites in response to an arabinose pulse down to 120 minutes.
We have shown that our mutated designed IntLambda/IntHK022 system is able to integrate DNA fragments into the chromosome in a sequential way with high efficiency (74%-100%).
We designed, cloned and proved the efficiency of the Tn916 transposase.

The yellow                                                 line represents the result of equation (2.11) and the blue line is the                                                 result of numerically solving the equations (2.14-2.17). It’s obvious to                                                 find out that the traditional function means the product will linearly                                                 increase without limit. In real situation, it is absolutely not. The                                                 concentration of product won’t be larger than the initial concentration                                                 of substrate and the velocity will decrease as time pass by. Therefore,                                                 in our project, we use the reversible M-M equations. The parameters are                                                 chosen as CS0=5, CE0=1, k1,                                                 k-1, k2 and k-2 all equals to 0.1 for                                                 simplicity.
2.4   Reversible M-M Theory in Complex                                     Enzyme System
      The chapter 2.3 analyzed                                     the dynamical character of 2 kinds of                                     equations, but that only applies on single-enzyme situation. The reaction in cell A contains 3 enzymes. How do we model this complex enzyme reaction system? In fact,                                     our idea is to firstly write down the system as Fig.3. With Fig.3, we know how to                                     list our equations.
Fig.3. This is the whole reaction system in cell A. E1,                                         E2 and E3 are the TDC, T5H and SNAT. S is the substrate Tryptophan.                                         P1, P2 and P3 are the Tryptamine, Serotonin and N-acetyl Serotonin. ESi with                                         i=1,2,3                                         represents the enzyme complex. We assume that there is no other inhibition                                         between Pi with Ej (i≠j). Therefore, we totally have 12                                         parameters to be                                         measured. Note that the main difference with single-enzyme equations is that                                         P1 is involved in the reaction with E2 and P2 is involved in                                         the reaction with                                         E3
      Following chapter 2.3, we can easily derive the                                     equations as
      To solve the equations above, we need to get                                     the                                     kinetic constant k in every step of reaction. But how to determine the different                                     parameters? Lineweaver-Burk plot can only yields 2 equations, whereas we have 4                                     parameters in a single reaction step. Given this situation, we figured out a                                     unique                                     way to measure it. The key to the problem is to"

The project as it is presented on this Wiki has evolved from our initial ideas. In the past half-year a lot has happened. To get the best out of our project, we actively engaged with stakeholders and experts and combined creativity with expertise. This has shaped our project into the way it is now. Below, a timeline can be found of how our project was shaped by the input we received. This starts out with the initial idea we had, looking at previous iGEM projects, and many hours of reading literature. Within iGEM, and definitely within our team, we find it very important to take the opinions of experts and stakeholders into account. Hearing the personal stories has had a great impact on us, giving us even more motivation to succeed in our project.
Below we will consider: Is there even a need for a new diagnostic device? Which requirements have to be fulfilled, where are the current bottlenecks? Are there other situations that we did not think of beforehand, where our device might be needed? How should this device look?
By talking to many people these questions and much more have been answered. This shaped our project to be the way it is now. Below an overview of the most important conversations can be found, including the main findings and pieces of advice.
Our idea
We are making a diagnostic device to test for tropical diseases in remote areas. However, it is not clear how we can best implement our diagnostic. We have multiple diseases for which we can screen; both viral diseases, like Zika and chik"

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Biobrick Design_-_-_TEXT.html," luciferase is an ideal reporter gene because of its stability at high temperature thanks to disulfide bonds and because it has extremely high activity in light production for very sensitive assays. When compared to Firefly and Renilla luciferase, GLuc generates over 1000-fold higher bioluminescent signal intensity[1][2]. The NanoLuc has an activity a little higher but this luciferase is very recent and thus less characterized.
Advantages of luminescence, over fluorescence, include the absence of background noise, the amplification of signal and a high dynamic range that spans many orders of magnitude. Indeed, since light emission depends strictly on the chemical reaction between the substrate and the luciferase, there is no background noise originating from the sample [3]. Furthermore, the turnover of the light reaction significantly amplifies the reporter signal. Even though bioluminescence is currently used mainly for transcription study and cell imaging, this method become increasingly popular for quantitative analysis.

５．How would your project be used in the real world?
Only in the lab. We aim to make biosensor that find Hiochi bacteria.
６．What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use?
We will not bring our biosensor forward outside a laboratory.
７．What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
We have to obey the law（Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms）.
８．Any further comments about your project: Comments about this form: Is it easy or difficult to use? Are the questions confusing?
It was easy to use.
Our safety activity
iGEM Gifu aim to the top-class of guarantee safety in the experiment. We often have a meeting with our   teacher. We check and improve our safety in laboratory by the meeting.  Graduate students（one-time our team member）take part in the meeting as adviser.  So, we can receive advice by them. We discuss various things from a basic thing to a special thing in a meeting. For example, Wear a white robe, protector and gloves as needed, how to handle recombination, learn about Cartagena law（""Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity"
