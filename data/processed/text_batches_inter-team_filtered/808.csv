SUIS_Shanghai,2018,Team:SUIS Shanghai#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," outstanding person to talk to about both the positive effect of teaching engineering and design in biology, and the potential barriers facing educators to its implementation.
As bioengineering and synthetic biology play an ever increasing role in our present and future lives, our team believes education within this field is essential for students like ourselves if we are to be able to comprehend, make decisions about, and even contribute to synthetic biology which will no doubt shape the forthcoming world. During the meeting Dr. Kuldell provided us a basic view of the status quo of bioengineering education in the U.S. We learned that currently not many schools are having related biodesign courses, but she believes that more and more schools will begin to adopt STEM based biology courses/classes by 2020. Additionally, she mentioned that her vision is for the education of synthetic biology to follow a principle of inquiry-based teaching rather than memorization-based. She also described some of her experiences and feedback from teachers who have taken part in BioBuilder training over the years and how she found that most teachers also “love to learn” and “appreciate and feel that there is a new approach to teaching life science”. We agreed with her summation that many people may leave biology because “there are so many things to memorize... that it can become overwhelming” but that if you can teach concepts like genes and operon through engineering and if you can use them as tools, it maybe “helps organize the information in a way that is personally engaging”.
Therefore, following Dr. Kuldell’s valuable suggestions, our team continued in our quest to design a survey to learn about Engineering & Design in International Secondary School classroom instruction. It also gave us motivation to begin thinking about an educational outreach program designed to help more educators access the material and eventually improve the prevalence and quality of utilizing engineering and design skills in biology curriculum. Thus we embarked on a mission aimed to help one of the iGEM foundation’s main dedications - “the advancement of synthetic biology education” right where we believe it matters the most, in High Schools, with teachers and students just like us.

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Waste Degradation: SRF_-_-_TEXT.html,"In Module 1: Resourceful Plastic, glucose from the degradation is used as the input for the system that produces P(3HB). The P(3HB) synthetic pathway hence needs to be adapted for this purpose.  To do so, 3HB monomer would no longer be the source input to the engineered system.  So, BDH2 should be removed from the pathway. Acetyl-coA would then become the key resource to produce P(3HB). Also, a metabolic model was needed to show the production of Acetyl-coA from glucose. Furthermore, our synthetic pathway involves several key metabolites from the pathway such as NADPH, NADP+, NADH and NAD+. The initial concentration of those metabolites can be determined from the metabolic model by assuming they are in their steady states. More features and results of the metabolic model can be found in Module 2.
Initial concentrations of metabolites
The model presented in Section 2.0 contains a synthesis pathway that interact metabolic species involved in so many other metabolic reactions elsewhere in the cell.  It was, therefore, difficult to determine how much of these metabolites would be left available for our plastic synthesis pathway to utilise.  So, a simple metabolic model of the cell (more detail in next paragraph) was needed to simulate and show insight into this problem.  We decided to use the steady state levels of these metabolites (without the engineered pathway) and plug the values into the P(3HB) synthesis model in Section 2.0 as the initial concentrations.
The metabolic model involves two pathways - glycolysis pathway and the TCA cycle, where glucose is used as the sole carbon source. The reason is that glucose is directly taken by the glycolysis pathway and there are interactions between Acetyl-coA and TCA cycle. This Simbiology model is based on the one built by Angela Dixon in Predictive Mathematical Model for Polyhydroxybutyrate Synthesis in Escherichia coli. [75] . All reactions and pathways are based on ODEs and kinetics data presented in the original model. It can dynamically predict the concentration of all metabolites involved over a defined simulation time course.
The metabolic model for determining steady state concentrations is shown as below:
Keys:
The initial concentrations of all metabolites and kinetic data are referenced in the paper. [76] The simulation of the metabolites is:

When it comes to human practice in synthetic biology there are many issues and precautions that must be considered. At the end of the day you are creating a novel organism in a lab and how it reacts outside of a lab can be very different from what you would expect given the immense number of variables to consider. Our team has created the means to produce theoretical organisms given a desired input and output. While no organism is actually created, we give the information needed to design a novel organism of choice along with the stoichiometry of the reactions going on within it. In this regard we are doing the same thing as the wet lab teams are doing, which is creating new cells; therefore, the same safety measures must be taken.
Certain safety precautions must be taken in order to ensure that an organism does not continue to grow rapidly and multiply exponentially out of control and upset the order of balance in an environment. A safeguard to prevent this scenario could be to analyze the balance of ATP produced in order to see if the energy production is too high, in which the organism would grow out of control, or low enough that the organism would be present for a small while before dying off.
ATP is the energy within a cell and a majority of what it relies on to flourish. By limiting ATP produced we lessen the chances of a cell growing vigorously and being a potential danger to the environment.  The actual means to prevent this is by creating a script that will analyze ATP consumption and production. With this information, you are able to adjust the ATP metabolism in whatever way you want.  You will be able to keep the production low enough so cell processes can still occur and allow the cell to grow to an extent but not high enough that it can potentially grow out of control.
This ATP balance is not hard to do. If you have a stoichiometric matrix of the cell or are able to analyze the ATP processes going on then you have the necessary information to control the cells' growth. By analyzing the ATP you can create a positive-negative balance. If the ATP produced is in a positive range then the cell will potentially have too much energy and will grow wildly. If negative you can assume that your cell will eventually die out.
There are many variables to consider when creating a novel organism and even more when you are talking about integrating a cell into an environment. It is almost impossible to be certain how"

Ring Cleavage
Since we could not obtain any positive colonies from last weeks colony PCRs we began the transformation of each part again.  The transformations were successful and when the colony PCR products were run on a gel there were two positive colonies for each part.  Overnight cultures of the positive colonies were made.   Minipreps were done on the overnight cultures and a restriction digest was performed on the products of the minipreps.  The restriction digest products were run on a gel and  there was one that looked like it had been successful but due to a poor quality ladder on this gel we could not make any final conclusions on the success of the restriction digest.

Week 12 (July  16 -July 20)
Decarboxylation
It was decided that the decarboxylation team would be split up into three individual components, a) to strictly work with the petrobrick, b) transformation and isolation of the aldehyde decarbonylate (ADC) and c) culturing the Nocardia strain NRRL 5646. With regards to the petrobrick, the sequencing results were once again unsuccessful and yielded a low complementarity rate. As such, it was decided that we would contact the University of Washington, and ask them to send us the petrobrick they composed and were working with in 2011. In addition, we also decided to produce our own biobrick identical to the petrobrick by using the acyl-acp reductase (which we had successfully transformed and isolated previously) with aldehyde decarbonylase (ADC). The ADC was transformed into the E.coli, and colony PCR was done in order to determine whether successful this was successful. This was followed by mini-preparation and restriction digest before gene sequencing occurred.
Ring Cleavage
We began the week by rerunning the restriction digest products on a gel with a good ladder and obtained one positive result with two bands. One band was around 1000 bp for the part and the other was at about 2000 bp for the plasmid backbone. We made a streak plate of the colony that had worked for the restriction digest and sent the miniprep product for sequencing. The colony that worked was from the transformation plate of part K118021. We also repeated a colony"

Dry Work
Having looked at the sample data sheet for part F2620 in the registry, a re-think of our data gathering and analysis method for the amplifiers is suggested. As a guide to what needs to be done, suggested that the information with F2620 is read on the parts registry.
Modelling
The next step with the basic phage activator system is to fit a Hill function to the data once it has been gathered so that effective constants can be found. We aim to characterise the activator systems with the three key parameters; K, Vmax and n. K gives the 'Switch Point' (point at which 50% of maximum output rate is reached), n is the hill coefficient and Vmax is the maximum rate of output production.

Inspired by the workshop, we decided that we should integrate Bloom’s Taxonomy into the work that we did with students. Bloom’s Taxonomy has a series of levels, seen in the diagram below.
As teachers, we aimed for our participants to start at the bottom of the pyramid and work their way up. Based on the focus of every level, we developed learning objectives detailing what we would want the participants to learn and be able to do as a result. Through this we ensured the results of our programs would be measurable and significant.
Reflecting on Past Work
Outreach has been a major activity of our team for the past several seasons. We always try to provide the best workshops and lessons to students who attend our programs. We thoroughly evaluated our past programs to see what we needed to improve upon for new work that we did. Not only did we reflect on how the programs ourselves, but we read over all of the feedback forms that we had participants fill out at the end of every program. The major points we decided to focus on were:
Creating more hands-on demonstrations and activities to teach
Breaking our presentations up with more activities and/or discussion
Getting to know about the audience’s knowledge level in biology beforehand for the delivery of more relevant workshop materials
Providing chances within programs for participants to practice what they had learned
Throughout the rest of our outreach we critically reflected on the reactions of participants, participants’ engagement level, and participants’ grasp of new concepts. We continued to collect feedback forms. Creating the best programs requires development, and we decided to strive for continuous improvement.
CAREERS EXPLORATION CONFERENCE
Every year, 4-H, a global network of organizations dedicated to youth development, sponsors a Career Explorations Conference at Cornell. The conference exposes youth to various academic fields and careers, develops their leadership skills, and gives them experience in a university setting. The theme this year was entrepreneurship. As forefronts of entrepreneurship in a synthetic biology landscape, we created a workshop bridging the gap between synthetic biology and business.
Our students were 6th to 8th graders without biology experience. We taught them the basics of DNA, and delved further into plasmids and the extraction of DNA from wheat germ with a hand-on demonstration. After our lesson, we gave the students a chance to brainstorm ideas for their own plasmid - much like an entrepreneur. We asked them “what do you want your bacteria to do?” Here’s what they dreamt up.

BBa_K1459017 - pmrC-GFP
This is pmrC promoter from Salmonella enterica, with subsequent GFP. This part is one part of PmrA-PmrB detecting system. Upon phosphorylation by PmrB, PmrA binds to pmrC and induces expression of GFP. This part is extraordinary long for a pmrC-GFP. It is designed this way because of the ca. 400 bp spacer at 5' end of the part - promoter is only 46 bp long, which would prove almost impossible to amplify through PCR or direct synthesis and ligation with pSB1C3. To counter this, we amplified pmrC with this spacer. This part contains also RBS from Salmonella enterica, just before the start of translation.

Introduction
Base pairing offers a powerful way for one RNA to control the activity of another. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have many cases which a single-stranded RNA base pairs with a complementary region of an mRNA. As a result, it prevents expression of the mRNA.
RNA interference (RNAi), also called post transcriptional gene silencing, is a process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression by destroying specific mRNA molecules. In 2006, Andrew Fire and Craig C.Mello shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine because of their study on RNA interference11. This powerful gene silencing tool in eukaryotes has been used in many research. As their counterparts in bacteria, small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are important regulatory roles.
Small RNAs (sRNAs) have become increasingly significant in playing the role of bacterial gene regulation. Most sRNAs interact with the targeted mRNAs by imperfect base pairing, reducing the translation efficiency and recruiting chaperones such as Hfq for translation termination. The sRNAs would bind to the target with its hairpin-like structure which wound by some of it's own sequences, and the chaperons would stuck between the hairpins in order to protect the sRNA-mRNA combination from degrading. In the end, the sRNAs regulate gene expression by forestalling translation. Since this regulated-system has already been employed in vivo, it is"

        People  show hesitation towards sewage treatment using bacteria. 32.26% of the Chinese  respondents can fully accept the recycled water using bacteria. For 64.52% of  them, recycled water using bacteria is not drinkable but it is acceptable for  toilet flushing. When gene modified bacteria involved, this number is decreased  to 59.68%. Obviously, 12.91% of the Chinese people refuse to using this kind of  water and even 3.23% of them fight against gene modified gem using for sewage  treatment. This situation is similar in U.K.  Things have changed in Microbial Fuel Cells, Thermo power are the main  power supply for China and UK (although most of the Englishmen do not know  that.  These two countries, although  located in different continent, share different incomes and outcomes,  demonstrates a similar trend about MFC. Over 85.49% of Chinese think that the  electric bill is not expensive and 78.94% of Britain respondents hold the same  view. 76.78% of the respondents in china believe that it is necessary for their  own country to develop the use of MFCs, in U.K., this number is 63.16%.
        Overall, many people doubt it is safe to drink the water purified by bacteria,  but they are still optimistic to the future of MFCs.

NOTEBOOK
We gathered the highlights of our project to the notebook below so you can effortlessly skim through the story of UESTC-Software! Now our project is coming to an end. However, we will continue to enhance our software and reach a new stage.
March 24
The University tryouts which has lasted for nearly a month ended, and the name list of the selected members of the school team determined. Then we formed our team—UESTC Software. There are 11 members in our team, majoring in different kinds of departments: Biomedical Engineering, Biotechnology, Micro-electric Science and Engineering and Information and Software Engineering. Our leaders and instructors conveyed their great attention and expectations to us.
April 11
At our first meeting, we introduced ourselves to others. We discussed the schedule and the main tasks at this stage, and confirmed the project what we would design as well. Refer to the project, we determined our project titles as MCCAP—Minimal    Cell Construct and Analysis Panel. The team leader emphasized the discipline required during the iGEM competition. Then we divided 11 people into 3 groups and assigned jobs to them separately.
April 18
We plan to do massive reading of academic papers on minimal gene set and each member is required to share and analyze the ideas that he or she got from reading these papers. In addition, members are separated into 2 groups to learn from the previous iGEM teams and conclude what we could obtain from them, both advantages and disadvantages. To sum up, innovation, functionality and visual effects play important roles in our initial work.
May 2
We had a video conference this time. After a week’s efforts, to a certain degree, we determined several pars, including the following aspects: design of wiki—divided by modules; design of webpage—the whole style is partly referenced to the formal best-wiki, and it should be shown in big and dynamic pictures, which are in high definition; art design—freehand sketching and pictures; software—divided into iOS and PC, there would be an interesting game referring to the iOS part.

Washington,2013,Team:Washington#LightSensing_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our System
Figure 1: Generalized Light-Induced Expression System.
The light induced expression systems we used both require multiple protein components. In general, a small molecule chromophore is synthesized in the cell, and acts as a substrate for a transmembrane light sensing protein. When the protein sensor bound-chromophore-bound is exposed to light of the correct wavelength, a conformational change is induced in the sensor protein which in turn causes the phosphorylation of a transcription factor. The active form of the transcription factor then modulates the expression of any gene downstream of its cognate promoter.  We worked with a red and green light inducible gene expression system this year.  Both systems utilize the same chromophore, phycocyanobilin, but differ in the transmembrane light sensing proteins that bind the chromophore, and the downstream regulator proteins. The systems are described graphically in Figure 1.
Table 1: Description of source plasmids and components.
The genes required to construct a functional light induced protein expression system were generously provided by Jeff Tabor at Rice University. Table 1.1 lists the genes required for each system and their respective functions. In order to construct a functional light responsive system, a multiple genes are transformed into E. coli.  Regardless of the system in question, the minimal components required are: 1) genes utilized in the synthesis of the chromophore, 2) a transmembrane light sensing protein, and 3) response regulators which are activated by the light sensitive proteins, and ultimately function as transcription factors.
Our red and green light sensitive systems were constructed through transformation of a subset of the plasmids listed in Table 1 into BL21 E. coli cells. Our green light responsive system was constructed by transforming pPLPCB and pJT119b simultaneously. A red light responsive system was created by transforming pPLPCB, pCPH8, and pEO100c into E.coli. GFP was used as the output of both systems.
[Top]
Methods
Cloning
Each light-responsive biosensor is composed of two or three plasmids, which requires three vectors with compatible origins of replication and orthogonal antibiotics. To subclone the light responsive operons into BioBricks, we selected equivalent copy number and antibiotic iGEM vectors. Because tetracycline is more common in iGEM vectors than spectinomycin, we cloned the chromophore operon into pSB3T5.

SCU-China,2018,Team:SCU-China#project#indigo_-_-_TEXT.html," b)The indoxyl production and dyeing stage.
By achieving the indi.coli system, the feasibility of combining the regulator parts (sgRNA logic circuits) with the metabolism pathway is tentatively proved. Building customized sgRNA regulatory logic circuits as input, then we could obtain customized outputs under specific signals, our CRISProgrammer is demonstrated to have great potential to be a powerful platform to design tunable, complex logic circuits.
CRISProgrammer in Indigo
In fermentation engineering, the most optimal and pragmatic strategy always contains the least times to adding additional raw materials into the fermentation cylinder. It requires that artificial manipulation should be as less as possible (Dr. Fei Huang mentioned the point). However, the time-space specific expression of genes during fermentation process tangle the transfer of intermediate products into different system. In this year project, SCU-China iGEM team put CRISProgrammer into practice by focusing on the spatio-temporality production of indigo.
According to the strategy, SCU_China iGEM team designed a genetic circuit to mimic the regulation process, in order to get rid of the complicated operation to transfer intermediate products into another fermentation system.
According to the design of regulation, our team deliberately substitute the key enzymes with reporter genes. It looks like a ‘bistable switch’, having two kinds of output with correspondent input. Our bistable switch consists of two main modules, the regulatory module and the reporter module (Figure 1).
In bistable switch system, the sgRNA (J23) and the reporter gene, mRFP1, are both controlled by T7 promoter. The sgRNA (T7) is under the control of pTet inducible promoter, while GFP is controlled by a constitutive promoter, J23100. The whole system is designed to function in BL21 E. coli strain, which can synthesis T7 RNA polymerase.
Since J23100 is a constitutive promoter (Figure 2), the start point of the whole module is supposed to have certain GFP expressed. When the plasmid is transformed into BL21 strain, the T7 promoter is activated. Then the expression level of mRFP1 is raised. Meanwhile, the expression of the sgRNA(J23) ‘closes’ the activating-form of J23100 promoter and the expression of GFP is inhibited. In the normal stage, the system exhibits high mRFP1 level and low GFP level.
When inducer (tetracycline) is added, pTet promoter is activated. The sgRNA (T7) is highly expressed, inhibiting the"

We thank Dr. Emre Aksoy, for his presentation on soil, plants and crops. At the stage where we were trying to find a concept to follow, his presentation                  encouraged us to follow the way of crops.
We thank Minister Advisor Oğuz Can for supporting us politically in our attempts to increase blend bioethanol percentage from %3 to %10 through laws.                  He welcomed us in the Ministry of Energy and Natural sources and shared his insights.
We would like to utter our gratitude to Prof. Dr. Saffettin Ferda Mutlu for providing us with the furfural that he uses for his research. He showed us a                  great help when we had problems with our orders.
Also we would like to thank Çukurova Kimya for providing us with the furfural we needed for our experiments.
We would like to thank SEBİT for helping us arrange our first workshop in which we reached out to children and introduced them the field of life sciences.
We also very much like to thank Kuntay Aktas for printing our prototype in 3D format for free and delivering it in only a few days.
Wiki and Logo Support
We, as a whole team decided the concept on our wiki and our team member Gamze handled the figuration on paper. In actualising those paper sketches and providing                  ideas for differing concepts, graphic designer Nedim Eskinazi helped us immensely. He helped us with the design of our wiki and transferred our ideas into the                  digital world. Also, he helped us with shooting the videos on our YouTube channel and suggested the best fit possible for every single time.
Computer Support
We give special thanks to Hasan Karaaslan for sparing some time to teach us programming and coding by using Python. He showed the basics for computing and taught                  the steps over and over again whenever we made mistakes. We owe him for the patience he has shown and making our coding lessons enjoyable.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.

This week also was full of literature research. We wanted to have a final answer and solutions in our localization questions. Finally, we decided to use parts of Denmark 2010 iGEM team, where transmembrane proteins were used (large clusters at the cell poles). The end of the week was mainly for study of the activation of mfp-5. Questions for the existence of tyrosinase in the periplasm and its degradation but also about the normal way of tyrosinase secretion from mussels were my priority.
Week 21
This week started with a long presentation of our ideas and questions in front of the professors of the Biotechnology Department. It was a very good opportunity for their scientific input in our project. From that moment we focused in literature study about the genes that we are planning to use for our more advanced biobricks, the constructs that have to do with the localization of our protein in the membrane. The question was: Flagella machinery or chemoreceptors???

Education and Outreach
We decided that our team wanted to reach out to the younger students in our community and educate them on synthetic biology at the most basic level. By putting on several workshops, both at local elementary schools and our own school, we were able to promote scientific thinking at an early age and introduce students to the world of synthetic biology.
7th Grade School Visit
Four team members (Amanda, Katie, Asia, and Brianna) visited a local middle school and taught 60 seventh graders the basics of DNA and synthetic biology. They were able to extract DNA from strawberries using common household products. After this activity, the iGEM team members explained the results and answered the students’ questions. From this discussion period, the group was able to observe the students’ understanding of the project and their varying opinions. The four members asked the students what their thoughts were on the ethics and morals involved in synthetic biology. For a short period, contemporary advances of synthetic biology were discussed, comprising the future growth and possibilities of the rapidly proliferating field of study.
4th Grade School Visit
Team members Asia and Hanaa, visited St. Ignatius of Loyola, an elementary school located in Los Angeles, and worked with their fourth grade class. We provided a free STEM program consisting of various experiments and corresponding lesson plans. Through experimentation the children were able to learn the fundamentals of science. They were excited to share with us their hypotheses, observations, and silly commentary. From this experience, we learned the importance of outreach, and the importance of exposing children to science at a young age.
Synthetic Biology Workshop at Alverno
6-8th Grade students visited our school and team members Asia, Marisa, Hanaa, and Alicia hosted a pipetting and synthetic biology workshop. We did this in order to inform the prospective students about our science department and our iGEM project and lab practices. Each middle school student was equipped with a P20 micropipette, lab coats, gloves, and mock-gels. After a demonstration by one of our teammates, and a brief explanation of  how micropipettes are used in the lab, the students then practiced pipetting various volumes of red dye into the practice gels.

And the functions are:
Where description and initial value of variables are:
Fig.5 Name, initial value and description of variables.
As the result, alkali resistance device could decrease intracellular pH (Fig.6.1, 6.2).
Figure.6.1 Intracellular pH change regulated by alkali resistance circuit led by NhaB.  NhaB is not effected by pH, and can assist NhaA to regulate alkaline environment. Here we assumed that initial pH was 9.0 and NhaB had already been activated.
Figure.6.2 Intracellular pH change regulated by alkali resistance circuit led by NhaA.  NhaA will be induced at pH 7.0 ~ 9.0, while NhaB will function when NhaA cannot function normally. Here we assumed that initial pH was 8.0 and NhaA had already been activated.
Basic Regulation Subsystem Model
In basic regulation circuit containing acid regulation and alkali regulation device, pH-responsive promoters lead the expression of functional genes. As the products of two functional genes are both enzymes, main processes considered in this model are their translation, degradation and catalysis. We assumed that the H+ or OH- was straightly contacted with the promoters and induced the transcription process.
Acid regulation device consists of acid-responsive promoter P-asr and gene GadA producing enzyme which catalyzes the proton-consuming conversion of glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA can be transported to the environment to regulate acidic micro-environment (Fig.1).
Fig.1 Acid regulation device.
The reaction processes of acid regulation device are described as below:
As for alkali regulation device, gene circuit contains alkali-responsive promoter P-atp2 and functional gene LdhA (Fig.2). LdhA encodes a lactate dehydrogenase which converts pyruvate to lactic acid. Lactic acid will be secreted outside the cell and neutralize the OH-.
Fig.2 Alkali regulation device.
The reaction processes of alkali regulation device are described as below:
To simulate the processes above, we constructed cyclic processes which had four groups of differential equations. pH ranges which were determined by promoters were applied as end conditions to switch among equations. To examine the function of regulation subsystem, we set up the initial pH to alkaline range.

Will has been working on explaining all the maths and physics of the model in a very comprehensive LaTex guide. It's just doing the justification for modelling: concentration profile distributon with the flux and all the full derivations. Luis discussed with Pascal but we did not get much from it. Luis also glued some electrodes.  (REDACTED) arrived at 18 in the Phillip lab. I am afraid I cannot specify here who I am referring to. Yutong bought a Winney the Pooh peluche as a rebellion against the CCP. Also, today we started to move out from the Phillips Lab. Alberto and Josh got kicked out from the lab as they stayed past midnight.
Thursday
Despite loading the 96-well plate after a couple of beers and at midnight, the results are ""tantalising"". GFP/OD600 values for C1A at different [Pyocyanin] are as expected.  Yutong prepared cell cultures for the plate reader experiment and for the promoter library.  Lidia worked on the promoter library. Alberto went to Bessemer to pick up the new plate from the CLARIOstar and performed the second day of the C1A_1 plate reader experiment. Siwat worked on Human Practices (nothing of value was done this day). Other stuff in the Lab: We did not get the iLOV and RFP for the library characterization unfortunately.  Luis discussed with Paschal about an important change in the power of the PCB (too technical to be mentioned here).  We had lunch in Queen's Lawn, as it was a relatively sunny day.  Luis was modeling alone today, as Will was not here unfortunately. Josh outlined the Abstract for the wiki.  We moved out stuff from RCS to Bessemer.  We had some beef with the lab technician, as she demanded to pay back the nanograms of reagents we used. But wasn't the department of Life Sciences supposed to sponsor us ? It is sad how vile money interferes with the science. Yutong, Lidia, Thomas and Alberto went out surveying at the Science Musuem and Natural History.  Rodrigo arrived in the lab at 5 pm. Meeting of the day as usual.  Apparently, Yutong has a phobia of walking on things where you can see through.

As we then set up the imaginary situation that there’s a method that can detect and cure gut inflammation at the same time, the majority of people said that they would consider it; thus, if we can further improve and perfect our bacteria and put them into commercial use, our treatment method would really resonate with the consumers. Then, as we asked about the price, about half the people said that their acceptable price would be under CNY 100 (around 15 US dollars). Therefore, in order to make our treatment practical, we must be able to produce it in a pretty cheap price range.

Tuebingen Erythrocyte Converter to O
Welcome to the Wiki of Team Tuebingen!
Erythrocytes (big red balls) have blood group antigens (colourful hexagons) on the surface of their membranes. These antigens consist of glycosilated proteins whereby there are different glycosilations for each blood group. The T-ECO system consists of three bacterial enzymes (blue Pac-Mans) that are able to cut off certain parts of the blood group glycosilations in order to create a blood group O antigen. The enzymes are covalently fused to a matrix (big yellow balls) via SNAP-Tag, SpyTag or inteins in order to prevent a mixing of blood and bacterial proteins.
This year, our project - Tuebingen Erythrocyte Converter to O (T-ECO) - was all about blood and blood transfusions. You might not have known but donor blood is a really rare resource - not only in hospitals in countries with weak medical infrastructure or in crisis regions after natural disasters but also in ordinary Central European hospitals. Due to the fact that humans have at least four different blood groups and two different Rhesus factors - all antigens on erythrocytes - you cannot simply transfuse any blood you want to any random patient. Thus, hospitals do need to always keep an eye on their stocks lest they they are hit by shortages.
Therefore, we decided to create a practical and easy to use system for the enzymatic conversion of blood types - from blood types A, B and AB to O. Blood type O consists of erythrocytes that do not show any blood type antigens thus can be transfered to"

Macquarie_Australia,2014,Team:Macquarie Australia#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"3, 4]. Biofuels are cheaper, requiring less capital and energy to produce. They are self-replicating and require uncomplicated maintenance. The drawbacks are in efficiency: high efficiency biofuels produce fuels capturing a peak of 6% of solar energy, whereas the thermodynamic limit of photovoltaics is around 14% [5].
The salient difference is how the energy is used; biofuels provide an efficient mechanism for storing energy, sealing it within energetic organic compounds such as ethanol or hydrogen gas, enabling relatively easy transportation and storage of energy in comparison to batteries, that are often heavy and lose energy over time. The place for biofuels in the 21st century is producing a convenient storage mechanism for energy, particularly for vehicles, where there is a need to carry fuel for long distances without opportunity to refuel on electrical power. Biofuel research and development in the 21st century has focused around high efficiency bioethanol production for these purposes [6].
Our Response
The Macquarie iGEM team aims to develop artificial photosynthesis in a biological system harvest the unlimited supply of solar energy. By engineering the biosynthetic pathway for chlorophyll-a, we are taking the first step towards developing the entire photosystem II in the hope of generating hydrogen gas. The industrial potential lies in the ability of channelling this hydrogen gas to develop a renewable energy source. The project aims to engineer the essential genes for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll a into E. coli.
It is hoped that by successfully engineering and demonstrating the capacity for this organism to express the relevant enzymes, and produce chlorophyll-a, that the hydrogen gas produced by the photosystem can be used to produce biofuel substrates. The success in the synthesis of chlorophyll in E. coli provides the groundwork for future teams to complete the synthesis of photosystem II. This provides a significant leap into the development of a hydrogen-generating system and a renewable biological energy source.

HIV and TB
People who are infected with HIV have a disoriented immune system. This will give the opportunity for other infections to easily enter the human body. TB bacteria become active if the immune system cannot stop this from growing. So the combination of those two diseases is in many cases deadly if not diagnosed and treated.
Fact: From the 8.8 million people who got TB in 2010, there were 1.1 million also HIV-positive.82% of those people live in the Sub-Saharan Africa. From all the aids patients who die, half of them die from TB. Source: Medecins sans Frontieres
Diagnosing TB by patients with saliva-test or even by x-ray photos who are seropositive is not always giving the correct diagnosis. So in order to treat these patients a better and faster diagnose of TB is necessary. So by being able to detect compounds of TB, no matter the patient’s own condition, a proper diagnose can be made and more people would be treated in much earlier state.
To conclude, our research has many possibilities within the medical field. So hopefully in the near future this wills safe many people. And we would like to thank Dr. Rene Lutter for his input in our project!

Our 2017-2018 team started out with minimal to no experience in synthetic biology, but through this process gained appreciation and excitement for the capabilities of this field. We began brainstorming our project in January, and started our lab work and project work in mid-June.
Although every team member holds unique strengths, we were all able to meaningfully contribute to each aspect of our project, from collaborations to human practices, and lab work to website coding - making this a wholly collaborative and cooperative effort!
A special thank you to Dr. Qi Zhang
from UNC-Chapel Hill, for serving as our instructor and mentor this year, helping us to understand the fluoride riboswitch, and graciously allowing to use his lab space this summer.
Thank you to Dr. Joseph Harrison
for his continued help and guidance in our project. Dr. Harrison also served as a mentor for the 2016-2017 East Chapel Hill team, and despite his relocation to California, continued to give our team invaluable advice.
A warm thank you to Jessica Hobson, Rhese David, and Shu Zhang for always pushing our team to aim for the best. We are extremely grateful for their patience, time, and support put into this project. They taught as valuable lab skills and techniques, to be patient and precise, and to accept and learn from every mistake.
Thank you to Hong Niu and Siyu Wang from the Donald Lab

did previously. Dr. Joseph Harrison, who served as the primary instructor for the previous team"
HUST-Innovators,2014,Team:HUST-Innovators_-_-_TEXT.html," initiation of our Project, we found our target part was not sequenced yet. As a result, the Project got swamped. So we chose to cooperate with Nextomics. In the first place, we introduced Synthetic Biology to the staff of Nextomics. Consequently, we added some certain part of bioinformatics to our modules, expanding the definition of Synthetic Biology. In conclusion, not only did we achieved our Project, but also gave Synthetic Biology a privilege to expand its biobricks collection from species directly, not just from the databases.
Cooperation with Nextomics
While doing our project, we had an cooperation with Nextomics. The company is a good at dealing with the SMRT Data, which helped us construct the biobricks.
“What are the benefits using SMRT Data while the construction of biobricks?”
“Faster, cheaper and able to be used by individuals.”

Spider Silk
Well known as a remarkable natural material, spider silk exhibits an incredible range of strength and elasticity. Silk-weaving spiders can actually choose from a wide array of silks (such as dragline, capture-spiral, and egg cocoon silk), each having its own unique physical profile and genetic origin. However, one thing that’s common to all silk is that their genes are comprised of highly-repetitive modules. By comparing the contribution of each type of module to the silk fiber’s physical properties, we can begin to understand how to create a collection of silk modules to build our own gene!
By genetically engineering the repetitive modules, and stringing them together in defined orders and ratios, we can customize the physical properties of the resulting silk fibers. Given the diversity that naturally exists across different types of silk, we can potentially assemble a massive library of silk proteins with an impressive range of strength and elasticity for a variety of applications. We plan on optimizing the compatibility of the iterative capped assembly (ICA) technique for the iGEM competition, creating a standardized method of assembling any highly-repetitive gene fragment in an efficient, user-definable manner. Having a library of silk gene blocks to choose from, and an optimized protocol for assembling them, we can optimize the selection and production of programmable silk with custom properties.
Honeybee Silk
Although lesser known than silkworm or spider silk, honey bee silk has emerged as an exciting candidate for a wide range of materials applications.  The elasticity of honeybee silk in fact exceeds that of spider and silkworm silk, while still maintaining a high level of strength.  A huge advantage of honeybee silk is that it is much more amenable to being produced through by recombinant E. coli due to the fact that the honeybee silk protein is much smaller and less repetitive than its spider and silkworm counterparts.  We aim to modify honeybee silk at the genetic level to add novel functionality to our silk materials.  For example, fusing fluorescent markers to silk would allow us to create honeybee materials"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Risk_-_-_TEXT.html," a genetically modified organism. Although we have taken every step possible to ensure that our final product will be safe to use and will not pose any environmental concerns, there is always the possibility that a negative public perception of genetically modified organisms will result in lower adoption of our technology. As such, we have begun to explore additional designs for our product that would make use of an in-vitro system, allowing us to remove the bacterial component of our final product all together.
Technological and Operational Risks
Another very serious category of risks for FREDsense technologies is technological risks. Although alternative target markets could be entered should unforeseen regulatory or market hurdles be encountered, serious shortcomings in the technology could pose significant risk to the company’s viability. There are key research and development milestones, as described previously, that need to be completed in order to reach a prototype stage. Should some of these key steps prove difficult or unfeasible, we will need to re-evaluate our technology. In order to mitigate this risk, we have developed a comprehensive technological implementation plan that focuses on completing high-risk activities first. This will enable us to make any major changes in the design of our product early on, allowing us to avoid significant increases in time and costs which would occur if changes were made later on.  In addition, we are exploring alternative methods of designing our sensor should one of these challenges prove to be insurmountable. As well, it is important to consider changes in the cost of the components of the technology. We have designed our cartridge system to be as economically viable as possible as discussed in the operations section . Should the cost of any one component drastically increase however, we may need to re-design our system. This would likely involve changing electroactive substrates in order to reduce cost. Although this would slightly increase the time needed for research and development, if it would enable us to meet our financial goals, it may be necessary.
Financial Risks
As a technology-based company, financial hurdles are likely to be significant for us, particularly for early research and development activities as well as for production. As such, there is always risk that we will not be able to secure the required funding for each stage. In order to mitigate these risks, we have developed a comprehensive budget for the next three years and a cash flow analysis for the next 5 years. This budget will be updated as cost projections change and will allow us to carefully plan our spending. In addition, should we find ourselves in a position where we require extra finances that we cannot acquire, we will suspend all research and development activities not focused on reaching the market for our first generation product.

Colombia,2014,Team:Colombia#Deterministic_-_-_TEXT.html," CAI bound with the CqsS protein) increases. After half an hour, the concentration of CqsS starts to decrease because it is consumed by LuxU, just the way it’s supposed to.
The next step is to check what happens with LuxU and its phosphorylated version. Now that we know that CqsS is modeled properly, we want to check the phosphorylation/phosphatase cascade. As with CqsS, this molecule has already been modeled by Lelu et al (2012).
Just as expected, whenever CAI is present (50h-100h and 250h) LuxU is greater than LuxU* due to the phosphatase function of CqsS*. At the beginning, we can see a peak in LuxU concentration. Because of Le Chatelier's principle, the reaction tends to go forward. After 3 hours, LuxU stabilizes itself thanks to the phosphorylation reaction.
Now, let’s check LuxO and its phosphorylated version. Even though this part of the cascade was modeled by Lelu et al, we did no take into account some of the regulation routes they did such as miRNA, because our system does not have them. We wanted to check the response of the most important molecule from the cascade
The first time we modeled the system, LuxO response was slower than we wanted. Because of this, we changed the Hill constant coefficient proposed by Lelu et al. in order to make the response time faster and longer. This change compensates the lack of negative feedback caused by miRNA that is present in V. cholera but not in our Sherlock coli.
With this modification we can see that the systems takes 20 hours to react. Furthermore, after 30h, the production of LuxO is completely activated and LuxO* is almost zero, which is desirable because we do not want any phosphorylated LuxO to turn on promoter Pqrr4.
So far, the model is working great, and all this section corresponds to the parts registered by Peking 2011 Team . What we are really interested in, though, is the response signal, and we want to see if S. coli would be able to shows us when V. cholerae is in the medium. Given that when CAI is in the medium, promoter Pqrr4 turns off, we need a NOT logical gate to invert the transduction, so we used a pTet-TetR system.
When CAI is present in the medium, TetR production turns off, which can be seen as a small change in TetR concentration."

Guid. C-IV, 4.7 : The exclusion does not apply to microbiological processes or the products of such processes. In general, biotechnological inventions are also patentable if they concern biological material that is isolated from its natural environment or produced by means of a technical process, even if it previously occurred in nature.1
Our experience during the competition has been one of open-source: many researcher have kindly shared their strains and their technical knowledge when applicable, most notably the authors of the article we are basing our study on. To be added is the offer of the “push-on push-off” system put together by the PKU team. “Why can't it always be this way?”, we asked ourselves naively. The immediate answer that was given by some non-biologists was that we were working at the fundamental level, with no real big money in play. In effect, bearing in mind Berkeley 2007 's example, the questions of patents poses itself, at our level at least, if a clear application is the outcome of an iGEM project. That lead us to think about this issue, although we did not hit a dead end by confronting patented material. And the first step we took was to analyse was being said both in the Obama Report on SB and what had previous iGEM teams had said
Analyzing the debate
Analysis of Obama's report point of view
The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues in their « analysis and recommendations » section identify that indeed intellectual property and sharing of scientific knowledge are crucial issues in synthetic biology. They are however, may be due to divergent point of views in the people involved in the debate, stating that they are unable to solve the issue and they cannot even offer insight into what needs to be changed to achieve synthetic biology's promises. This is understandable in some ways since in America free enterprise, one of the pillars of society, cannot be touched upon even if it profits only to the fewest (i.e. the largest industries) and they predict a lot of revenues could be made through synthetic biology if 1 trillion dollars had been generated just in the pharmaceutical industry for “lifestyle” product. Like most ethics debate, they just recognize that they are questions raised but refuse to solve them but encourage transparency and hope matters will evolve by themselves. Just like Virginia 2011 pointed out, the presidential commission still believes that it is up to governments and public"

Brochures
To circulate synthetic biology knowledge and inspiration, we demonstrated key ideas in the discipline in a booklet and handed out the booklets to more high school students. Two students e-mailed us to express their interest in synthetic biology and consulted to us about how to be admitted by Tsinghua University.
What deserves to be mentioned is that most participants of our human practice is from College of Information Technology and we had a wonderful communication through the human practice. They asked us many questions and we also got some inspirations from them. What impressed us most is that a student from department of computer told us that the circuit switching and packet switching in computer network when transmitting information. We got a great inspiration from his words after we asked him for details about the two terms. Then we thought that circuit switching is that transmitting all information through a certain line but the packet switching is that dividing the information into pieces and transmitting different pieces through different lines. Both of the two methods have merits and demerits. Then we thought that why we could not combine both of them and then we designed our experiments that transmitting all information through two certain lines respectively in order to reduce the noises and uncertainty. And the experiments confirmed our views in some degree.
So you can see that we had a very successful human practice and we applied what we got from human practice into our experiments successfully. It helped with our project greatly and met the requirement of gold medal undoubtedly."

Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," from plants is expensive and requires time-consuming process. As a result, “KOZOKO” is under the state of conceptual idea.
Here, we create a new version of “KOZOKO” utilizing syntheticbiology. And we want to solve Food problem all of the world! We named it “Flavorator”. Recombinant E. coli produces antimicrobial and insecticidal volatile gaseous substances that suppress bacterial unwanted growth in the “Flavorator” and prevent the insects from entering the “Flavorator”. Our choice was geraniol and farnesol. The reason for our choice is that they are terpenes and can be produced in E. coli easily after engineering its metabolic pathways. And they have high antimicrobial activity. Geraniol and farnesol are the major constituents of rose fragrance. These fragrances not only harmlessly emit fragrant odor to humans but also kill/or suppress microbes as well as insects like fruit flies.  We designed our strategy following three sequential steps in order to realize “Flavorator”.
Step 1: increase in the amount of terpene's precursors.
Step 2: Production of geraniol and/or farnesol.
Step 3: Efficient export of geraniol and/or farnesol to the media.
Following these three steps, we are sure that we will achieve realization of concept of “Flavorator” that can avoid food decay and solve one of the food problems in the future.

Analysis showed that pdt#3c part is not working, and our pdts have somewhat different basal fluorescences. Aside from experiments, we did cloning for WM17_415-421.
Week 18 (September 25 - October 1)
Wetlab Summary
We did another experiment for  WM17_409 (K2333428) under more IPTG conditions. Unfortunately, we didn't see a speed change. Going to try using pdt#3c, since it seems to be weaker than the rest. Ethan designed primers for team UMaryland 2017 and sent out our plasmids to them.
Week 19 (October 2 - October 8)
Wetlab Summary
We ran several more experiments this week. The first were for WM17_412 (K2333431) and WM17_410 (K2333429) with either no IPTG or .1mM IPTG. We also did a time course for WM17_411-414 (K2333430-K2333433) under similar conditions. The pdt#3d part worked, and #3a looked quite similar to #3. For the collaboration, we transformed UMD copper plasmids into 10-Beta cells (named the constructs WM17_MD01-WM17_MD06 or K2333437-K2333442) and ran an induction experiment with IPTG and different concentrations of CuSO4.
Outreach Summary
We hosted our big outreach event on Saturday. We gave a basic synthetic biology presentation in the auditorium and then broke the Girl Scouts off into different age groups to run activities.
Week 20 (October 9 - October 15)
Wetlab Summary
Did more inductions for UMaryland parts (K2333437-K2333442). Also ran a 5 hour time course for WM17_409 (K2333428) with and without IPTG. Data for this looked IFFL-like, but we got some incorrect samples at 120 minutes. We decided to do a readjustment attempt with WM17_408 (K2333427). We ended up running experiments for WM17_410, 11, 13, and 14 as well (K2333429-K2333433).

From our initial idea, the design of our toehold switches and our model to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work.
Here, we have broken our project down into its different parts. For each, we explain the role feedback played in improving the aspect of the project, and why we changed what we did.

Dr Kirsten Jensen
Our initial constructs used a constitutive promoter. After cloning our construct in pSB1C3 plasmid, we attempted to amplify them in E. coli. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find.
We asked Dr Kirsten Jensen, an expert in synthetic biology at Imperial College London for advice. She inspected our sequences and suggested that the transcripts from our constructs were toxic to E. coli. She therefore suggested that we switch our promoter to an inducible promoter to avoid synthesis of the transcript during amplification in E. coli.
Following her advice, we used an arabinose inducible promoter, which resolved the issue for the 15b-5p switches and allowed us to continue with our experiments. However, the 27b-3p switches were still toxic.
See the results page for more details.

Bouma (formerly Wageningen University, The Netherlands) answered it with “No, not alone, but start with existing technology and go from there” whereas R. Ardakanian (United Nations University, Dresden) just said “yes” after his speech. But not only the answers to the topic question were different also the point of view concerning to the worldwide water problem, scarcity or the definition of water differed by the speakers. Water in connection with waste was the main focus of the speech of R. Ardakanian, who said that waste is a resource for production of food and energy and must contribute as recycled waste in technology. According to E. Adar the goal for the next generation was  (Ben Gurion University, Negev, Israel) the challenge to minimization of water costs and use. To him it was evident that water is a synonym for food and a commodity, not a resource like gold.
Figure 3: speech about ""historic and future variations in global water"" from J. Sheffield
Furthermore M. Lange (The Cyprus Institute, Nicosia) presented his speech titled ""Ways about Climate Change and Energy-Water Nexus in the Mediterranean"". Eventually A. Porporato (Duke University, NC, USA) gave a lecture on the role of ecohydrologic variability on the productivity and sustainability of ecosystems.
The following general speeches about the water scarcity and climate change informed the audience about different present projects to reduce the water scarcity. G. Teutsch (UFZ Leipzig) who opened the conference talked about a “quick start” concerning to reduce the water scarcity which sticks together with the rise of climate change. The main statement of the speech from the second speaker P. Krebs (TU Dresden) was that not visions, only excellent concepts, developed new topic projects and community action yield viable results. That the water topic has also an important role in politic was approached from F. Holzwarth (BMU Bonn) who also had the goal of forming a “water alliance with new individual faces”. He stated that, in contrast to the climate change, the water scarcity isn’t a major topic in politic based on the fact that “disasters drive politics”.  In his speech U. Weber (DFG Bonn) picked out science (project, implementation and ideas) and society (public, politic) in relation to water scarcity and climate change  as central themes. In turn, J. Sheffield (Princeton University, USA; see Figure 3) broached the issues of the transition between drought and floods.

Characterisation
Successful Pigment Production
In order to produce pigment, bacteria transformed with pTRCmelA must be plated on media supplemented with copper and tyrosine.  Supplementation with copper is necessary as copper is a cofactor for the tyrosinase, and tyrosine is a precursor to melanin biosynthesis.  (Cabrera-Valladares et al, (2006).
We transformed Top10 E. coli with pTRCmelA and plated them, using LA supplemented with 15ug/ml copper, 0.2ug/ul tyrosine.  Below is a plate that  was incubated at 37 degrees for 24 hours and then left on the bench at room temperature over the weekend. Pigment was clearly produced, and it appears to have diffused out of the colonies.
Left: Top10 transformed with plasmid containing the MelA gene.  Right: untransformed Top10.
Control Experiments
To show that the brown colour was a result of the MelA gene and not natural oxidation of the LA supplements, a control plate without any bacteria was incubated for the same amount of time and showed no change in colour (data not shown).
Optimization
On pTRCmelA, the MelA gene is under the control of the lac repressor.  The photo above shows leaky expression of the promoter, as no IPTG was not added.  We then experimented with the addition of IPTG and varying tyrosine concentrations to see the effect on pigment production.  As the photo below shows, the greatest pigment production was achieved with IPTG induction and the highest concentration of tyrosine.

Overhang PCR, Digestion and Ligation, First Attempt [❓]
PCR was performed with standard set-up and with the two primers EB_trunc and EB_reverse. This should result in a truncated EB that also has the BamHI site required for adding LT. The PCR appeared successful in the first attempt, with a strong band that approximately corresponds to the expected 673 bp. (See Figure 12a)
Subsequently, the PCR product was digested and ligated to perform a 3A assembly with the LT sequence and the pSB1C3 backbone. The success of the digestion can not be assessed on the gel since only a few bases are removed. The ligation was performed with a 3:1 inserts:vector ratio and appeared partly successful with bands that could correspond to a circular plasmid visible (see arrows). After transformation, unfortunately no colonies could be observed for TOP10 or BL21(DE3) cells.
Figure 13. PCR product and subsequent digestion and ligation product for trEB.  a) (2) trEB, (3) EB, (4) negative control of a PCR performed with trEB primers on Nuc template.  b) (2) digestion product (3) ligation product. Arrows indicate bands in third well that might be correctly assembled plasmid.
Since the ligation appeared to be somewhat successful and all ligation product had been used for the transformation, we decided to simply re-do the ligation with the already digested fragments.
Digestion and Ligation, Second Attempt [❓]
In this second attempt, the inserts:vector ratio was set to 10:1  in the hopes of achieving a more efficient ligation. Additionally, the ligation product was not heat-killed, which could inhibit transformation efficacy.
Figure 14. Weak bands corresponding to possible correctly assembled plasmid are visible, indicated by arrows. A stronger band around 600bp likely represents unligated PCR product.
As can be seen on the gel, the ligation appeared partly successful but after transformation, no colonies were visible. Even after retransformation of the remaining ligation product, no colonies were visible and the project was abandoned due to time constraints.
Overall, the attempt to assemble a truncated version of EB was unsuccessful since it suffered from the same pitfalls as many other parts of the project. If there had been more time to focus on this part of our project, another"

Aim of the experiment:
Cell lysis of yeast cell- samples taken 20 min after expression. The idea is to compare the gene expression 20min after induction and 20h after induction. The signals on the western blott should show, that the two bands of our expressed enzymes are only visible after 20h.
Operational sequence:
an adequate amount of breaking buffer (containing PMSF) was given to the frozen cell pellet, as well as an equal amount of glass beads. Note: because the supernatant could not be taken after 10 min centrifugation, another 30µl of breaking buffer were added.
cell- walls were disrupted by vortexing for 30 sec, followed by 30 sek on ice. This procedure was repeated 4 times.

Model
There're two outstanding models supporting our project:
Natural language processing (NLP)
Object-relational mapping (ORM)
WebSocket
Natural language processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence that is                 concerned with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language.
The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand language as well as we do.
For example, we can use these keywords to search:
molecular biology
But NLP give us the power to get closer to what we actually want to search:
molecular biology by Someone this year with #immunity
NLP can extract all the information and construct a query action:
keyword: molecular biology                 author: Someone                 time: this year                 label: #immunity
In our project, we use an open-source software named Stanford CoreNLP (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) to parse the search string.
CoreNLP provides many underlying models so that we can get analysis information to construct more                 expressive and more human-friendly query.
Object-relational mapping (ORM)
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) allows us to work with objects and have them saved to the database                 automatically. It can greatly simplify create-read-update-delete (CRUD) operations and make our code                 more comprehensive.
ORM makes our user,report,notice and more models easy to query, to                 list and to link to each other.
In our project, we use Django ORM with MySQL backend as the underlying models to provide                 fast and flexible queries.
WebSocket
WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a                 single TCP connection. The HTML5 WebSockets specification defines an API that enables web pages to use                 the WebSockets protocol for two-way communication with a remote host. It introduces the WebSocket                 interface and defines a full-duplex communication channel that operates through a single socket over the                 Web. HTML5 WebSockets provide an enormous reduction in unnecessary network traffic and latency compared                 to the unscalable polling and long-polling solutions that"

3 .                                 The signal pathway of Cyanobacteria provides design space for other inducible promoters in the gene circuit, which will not interfere with other signal pathways such as the group induction system.
Application
In the literature, we see that other scholars' expectations of the Kai protein system were initially applied to the relief of jet lag. On this basis, we put forward more ideas about the application direction of this system.
Regular secretion of proteins can be used for periodic administration as a treatment combined with a related diagnostic system.
A biorhythm oscillator can be widely used in signal regulation of gene circuits. (timing signal transmitter)                                      Conditional expression can be achieved by changing the type of promoter (for example, specific expression of hTERT in tumor).
Result
The strain we studied was incubated in M9 medium and observed in microplate reader (TECAN INFINITE® M200 PRO). More details can be found by click here . Here are the curves we made, which are based on the intensity of bioluminsscence recorded by microplate reader (TECAN INFINITE® M200 PRO).
Figure 1. The bioluminescence at different times in Group A. The negative value is cause by the value of the control group.
Figure 2. The bioluminescence at different times in Group B. The negative value is cause by the value of the control group.
To some extent, the rhythm of the oscillator can be seen from the curve. We did mathematic analysis data by TableCurve 2D®.
Figure 3. The bioluminescence at different times in Group B. The negative value is cause by the value of the control group.
Figure 4. The fitting curve of the oscillator in Group B.
The stability of the oscillator is not good enough, which may be caused by the low robustness of the system we build. The expression quantity and proportion about such six proteins are different in E.coli and cyanobacteria. The expression efficiency of sfYFP we used can also infect the oscillator. Meanwhile, the limited sample size is non-ignorable factor.
Based on what we got, we can draw the conclusion that we used three"

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#HP Demo_-_-_TEXT.html," South China Regional Conference. To take the essence from other teams, we also attended 5th CCIC and IGEM EURASIAN MEETUP.
How would the project be
We gained a lot from the meeting, we found our weak point, the safety problem and we made lots of collaboration through three meetings which made our project comprehensive.
Trouble we meet in project
We had already designed our experiment, and designed an initial cockroach box. But we didn’t know whether it could work well in the environment.
What we did for project
Therefore, we first went to our canteen to make an inspection about the environment cockroaches stay most. We also went to CDC to get to know living habit of cockroach. Then we asked Dr. Wang from Chongqing University for more suggestions on our box design.
How would the project be
Considering three investigations and comments from the applet, we finally designed the  second version of our cockroaches box which seemed more reasonable than the first one.
Trouble we meet in project
Since we designed new box, and changed a new prescription, we were eager to know how it worked. Additionally, we heard that some methods of killing cockroaches may affect the neighbor. We also required some data for our modeling.
What we did for project
To achieve our goal, we made a simulation about consequent of killing cockroaches with different ways like cockroach chalks, and our box with wild spores. We calculated and compared the migration rate and mortality of each product.
How would the project be
Our modeling can ran smoothly with our simulation which provided lots of data for it. Analyzing the data, we can give a guidance to the public to choose a better way to kill cockroach.
Trouble we meet in project
Now our box has been tested and we had detailed data about different ways to kill cockroach. We wanted to make an attribution to the society and test our boxes at the same time.
What we did for project
Therefore, we use our applet to make lots of communication of the public. We post our simulation result and told them a better way to kill cockroach. A teacher invited us to give a popularization after watching our project. Moreover, we gave a post showing that we hoped to distribute our boxes and finally went to Hunan to help them kill the local cockroaches.
How would the project be
With this HP, we had a closer communication with the public online and offline. Besides, we found some disadvantages of our boxes used in reality, and we redesigned it again after villagers’ feedback.

Fig.3. Interview Assistant Prof.Zhang Mengjie about biosafety in wet lab. What’s more, we learned basic knowledge of biosafety in synthetic biology during these visits. It is important to use biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies to ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created. Also, conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow is indispensable. Interview with Prof.LI Ping in Tongji University We had an interview with Prof. Li Ping and a discussion with doctoral students in Prof.Li’s  laboratory in May at the beginning development of our project.Prof. LI now conducts scientific research in School of Life Science and Technology of Tongji University. Her research group mainly engaged in the fields of microbial fermentation and synthesis of natural active substances which are very relative to pathway engineering. She told us that there are many challenges when conducting a pathway engineering project. One major challenge is in the design of the pathway, which may require sorting through thousands of possible enzymes and reactions wherein all the parameters have different substrate preferences and kinetic features. It is not easy for researchers to search information efficiently due to a considerable amount of data available on the Internet. “It will save much time for us if you could provide a computational tool for designing and constructing pathway.” She said. Moreover, we had a discussion with doctoral students about the optimization of the heterologous metabolic pathway. They told us that the most important factor should be considered is the metabolic burden in the pursuit to identify an optimal metabolic pathway. “Minimizing the number of heterologous reactions that need to be added would help reduce the metabolic burden.” They said. After an in-depth discussion with Prof.Li and her doctoral students, we learned that researchers engaged in metabolic engineering have a great demand for a computational tool that help them design and construct pathways. Moreover, they inspire us to consider more about metabolic burden when ranking pathways. iGEM Eurasian meet-up It’s a great pleasure to participate in iGEM Eurasian meetup 2018 in July this summer. Through engagement in the interactive presentation and excellent workshops, we learnt much about biosafety and bridging bioethics standards between continents. Besides these, we communicated a lot with other iGEM teams during the poster exhibition, which made us aware that there are a lot to be improved in our project to meet synthetic biology researcher's needs.

To make people have a better understanding of both the game and our project, we designed six comic pictures to represent the six game levels separately. The picture will be shown before the game starts to help players understand situations clearly. The comic pictures not only help in driving the storyline but also enhance the enjoyment of the game. They are so cute and straightaway that can be really helpful in engaging the audience.
There are the pictures and the story in six game levels:

We received from Dr. Shimada beta-pinene, d-limonene and γ-terpinene synthase genes of Citrus unshiu and submitted the γ-terpinene synthase gene to iGEM. Monoterpene is extracted mainly from plants and used for cosmetics and as flavors. It has many useful properties with high potential for other applications.
Three monoterpenes are on iGEM registry. An addition of our new γ-terpinene to iGEM registry broaden the repertoire. By growing the repertoire, we hope that someday iGEM can reproduce every scent that exists in the nature.

Forth meeting - Metaphors
Because the synthetic biology approaches biological systems as technological systems by means of analogy, we examined the general concept of metaphors ([12],[13],[14]) and the epistemic value of inference out of analogies. Through this examination two problems became clear: First, because conceptual metaphors constitute of way to see, think and act towards things [14], it is necessary to inquiry how our position towards life might change in the light of it as a machine [3]. Second, if the synthetic biology do base upon conceptual metaphors, which are not identified as such, then serious epistemological problems exist. All inference out of the inductive argument of analogy is to be considered invalid. If we try to understand living beings as machines, it does not means, that living beings indeed behave as them.

Firth meeting - Necessary properties of a ‘living machine’
In our firth meeting, we discussed about the necessary properties that a living beings needs to have in order to be considered a ‘living machine’ ([10],[11],[15],[16]). For the following meetings we decided to analyse in detail the properties of artificiality and technical functionality, as machines are usually understood as physical objects, which were intentionally produced by human beings to achieve certain goals. Only if we can justify why products of synthetic biology are artificial and why do they have a technical function, we can use the expression ‘living machine’ as a proper term.

Duke,2018,Team:Duke#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"In a future collaborative forum run by Duke iGEM, the East Chapel Hill iGEM team, and the Museum of Life and Science there are several key components: members of the public and trained scientists, collaborative discussion, and a topic closely related to genomic editing. The Museum of Life and Science has, over the many years it has been open, built a substantial network with the community and local scientists and thus can be an important asset in attracting a diversity of opinion to the forum. Duke, likewise, has a network with many biotechnology firms which can not only bring a unique business perspective of genomic editing, but also draw new community members (especially Duke students) more interested in hearing about the latest developments on the technologies. Combining our resources, we should be able to attract a diverse crowd and create a successful discussion.
Visiting the Marbles Kids Museum!
As part of our overall Human Practices strategy, we wanted to engage with our local community. One way we do that on an annual basis is by visiting our local children's museum where we teach young kids about synthetic biology.
Our team were Guest Star Scientists at the Marbles Kids Museum in Raleigh, NC. There, team members worked with youth volunteers to teach kids about synthetic biology. Candy DNA,  and homemade DNA extractions were all the rage with the young demographics. Kids enjoyed learning about the shape of a double helix while they built their own double helices with Twizzlers and marshmallows. The kids then went on to make DNA necklaces out of tubes filled with DNA they extracted from wheat germ. Both our team and the kids we met had a great time and we gained some good insight into how to connect with younger demographics. Below are details about each of the activities as well as pictures from our fun filled day.
Candy DNA
One of the kids favorite activities was making candy DNA! We originally came up with the idea from a Guardian article . We used this basis but through some image searches of Google, we found a good alternative to jellys would be marshmallows (a little easier for the kids to manipulate). We then made up a set of instructions for volunteers that is attached below. The kids had a really good time playing with their food and learning about their DNA too! We took this opportunity to explain the base pairing through different colored marshmallows. Overall, we all had a great time playing with our candy DNA!
Extracting Wheat DNA
The final activity of our Marbles trip was from the Building with Biology Kit. The See DNA activity was held for all of the kids. The kids found the activity really engaging and loved being"

INSA-Lyon,2014,Team:INSA-Lyon#Molecular_-_-_TEXT.html," this we cannot really discriminate between one conformation or the other from our experimental data, though these results seem to lead towards the folded conformation, where the second motif would be floating for His2-tag. Moreover, as we are still unable to accurately quantify curli and CsgA, we unfortunately cannot provide any information regarding the difference between the theoretical chelating power of CsgA and the experimentally determined quantity of captured nickel.
Conclusion
Overall sum up
Through our molecular study of a CsgA protein engineered with either His1-tag or His2-tag, we came to the conclusion that since it has a longer reach and its mobility makes it more available for chelation, using a tag positioned by the C-terminus of the protein is more relevant than placing it in the middle of the sequence, although doing so may provide a little more chelation power as long as the tag isn't too long. We also showed that there are two possible conformations : one is folded on the side of CsgA and a priori does not increase the already-existing chelating power of CsgA; the other is a ""floating"" conformation where the tag is not attracted to the protein and is able to improve its chelating power by up to 25%! Unfortunately, the wetlab results are not sufficient to discriminate which conformation is more present in vivo.
What we couldn't achieve
Unfortunately, having very little time and people, there are a few things we couldn't investigate as extensively as we wanted. Here are a few of those things:
more simulations with His2-tag. Since they took an awful lot of time, we only ran a handful of them;
modelisation of the docking between two CsgA proteins, and the influence of the His-tags, that our lack of experience prevented us from  conducting;
find out just how many tags can be added without altering the protein properties of adherence and polymerization;

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

Washington,2016,Team:Washington#Project1_-_-_TEXT.html," University of Washington's iGEM team have been codon optimized for yeast in hopes to improve the efficiency of its translation. The CDS contained in this BioBrick was designed by running the VioC gene sent to the University of Washington by the Dueber Laboratory at University of California-Berkley through IDT's Codon Optimization Tool for S. cerevisiae.
BBa_K2165001 : VioD (Codon Optimized for S. cerevisiae)
Figure 3. The proposed structure for VioD (Forouhar n.d.). Rendered in PyMOL.
VioD is the fourth (and final if VioC is not also present) enzyme in the violacein pathway when expressed. VioD, alongside VioA, VioB, and VioE, processes its substrate protodeoxyviolaceinic acid into protoviolaceinic acid. When VioC is unavailable, this degrades into proviolacein, a teal-colored pigment. When VioC is present this precursor is processed into an intermediate which subsequently degrades into a dark, purple pigment called volacein.
VioD was previously available as a standalone part as BBa_K539413 , produced by NCTU Formosa's 2011 iGEM team; however, BBa_K539513 is not codon optimized for yeast. The part developed by the University of Washington's iGEM team have been codon optimized for yeast in hopes to improve the efficiency of its translation. The CDS contained in this BioBrick was designed by running the VioD gene sent to the University of Washington by the Dueber Laboratory at University of California-Berkley through IDT's Codon Optimization Tool for S. cerevisiae.
BBa_K2165004 : pCup1 (Biobrick Standard Assembly Compatible)
The Cup1 promoter enables binding of RNA Polymerase II and the subsequent transcription of downstream DNA to mRNA. It is activated by ACE1, a transcription factor which binds to copper ions. It was previously available as a standalone part as BBa_K945002 , produced by Tec-Monterrery’s 2012 iGEM team; however, the original part contained numerous illegal restriction sites preventing its usability in standard biobrick assembly. Hard information of the Greenfield 2011 team’s BBa_K586000 claims the part is the Cup1 regulatory region, but based on the sequence and its twin we believe it to be mislabeled and that it is instead the CupI CDS.

Integrated Human Practices
From the beginning, the Human Practices took a central role in shaping our project. When we started our brainstorm sessions in March, we had no clue which topic we wanted to explore. Yet, we wanted it to be relevant to society. During these first months, we got the opportunity to interact with experts and the public to discuss our ideas. These encounters were of great help in our topic selection. During a visit to the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Instituut (Dutch organization for technology assessment), we realized that the lack of a safe platform for working with GMOs outside of controlled environments is a problem on itself that deserves a solution. We were excited to tackle this issue with Gelcatraz, but also wanted to work towards a more concrete application. In the time that followed, we consulted several experts and interacted with the public to get feedback on our proposals. Once we had settled on the wound healing application, we interacted with more stakeholders and experts to shape the design of the wound healing patch. We also performed a stakeholder-value analysis  and an ethical analysis  of our design, and we considered safety during all stages of the project for safe-by-design. We realize that our project would not have been the same without the Human Practices.
In the following section, we share the insights we gained from interactions with stakeholders and experts during the three main stages of the project: finding a project , finding an application and shaping the design . Here you can explore our journey of integrated human practices.
I. Finding a project
Thanks to the TU/e Contest and various brainstorm sessions, we had settled on the living material project. Although we decided to focus on the adhesin system, we wanted to demonstrate the potential of our platform by applying it to a social problem. To find the ‘perfect’ application, we consulted various experts, interacted with the public and attended a biotech conference. We also reflected on the ethical consequences of our potential applications"
