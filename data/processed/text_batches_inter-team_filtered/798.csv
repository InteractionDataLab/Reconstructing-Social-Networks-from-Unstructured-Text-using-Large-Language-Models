Это явно говорит о том, что необходима срочная разработка альтернативных стратегий для борьбы с панрезистентными видами! В ходе первичного изучения литературы мы выяснили, что проблема имеет еще более серьезный масштаб, чем мы изначально предполагали, что убедило нас проводить исследование именно в этом направлении. Мы предлагаем использовать механизм, препятствующий накоплению бактериями железа, необходимого им для размножения, путем замещения его галлием. Замещающий железо галлий не только ограничивает усвоение железа, снижая таким образом скорость размножения, но и оказывает известное цитотоксическое воздействие на патогенные бактерии. Предлагаемая стратегия напоминает древний миф о троянском коне, так как бактерии не способны отличить усваиваемый ими галлий от железа. Мы убеждены, что, избрав в качестве своей мишени высококонсервативный метаболический путь, мы нашли успешную стратегию борьбы с мультирезистентными бактериями.
В этом году команда iGEM из Гамбурга разрабатывает подход троянского коня для борьбы с мультирезистентными бактерия"

Questions
There are 4 questions in Safety .
Answers
Q. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
A. No issues of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety  raised up during our KIT-Kyoto iGEM 2010 project. All our work was performed fallowing the guidelines of the safety standards required by biosafety level 1. Rules of best microbiological practices were applied. Our project ‘‘E.coli Pen’’ enables an appreciator to take a pen, draw and color. Since ‘‘E.coli Pen’’ has H2O2 as bacterial killing means, it prevents transgenic E.coli from spreading.
>>Go to the article of E.coli survival curve by H2O2 density.""""
Q. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
A. No. We developed some parts of producing fluorescence protein used by H2O2 responsive promoter. These parts are completely harmless.
Q. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
A. Yes. We have bio safety group at KIT, and our project has been monitored by them. The leader of this biological safety group was Prof. Yamaguchi. Furthermore, there is an upper level committee of transgenic experiences at Kyoto Institute of Technology. Our project has also received accreditation from this committee. All material handled or distributed are non-hazardous and non-infectious. It agrees with all safety standards requested by biosafety level 1. Therefore, Prof. Yamaguchi and other  education stuff and instructors fully support the work done by this iGEM team.
Q. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future i"

MODELLING
Modeling plays a huge role in the whole project, as we fill in the gap between the experimental results and the existing data.
We characterized PE degradation rate based on previous iGEM data and predict how much adding OmpA to the sequence is going to affect the result of the laccase secretion. Kinetic parameters of fumarate addition mechanism were attempted to observe the activity of ASS genes and monitor the rate of conversion from alkane to succinate. This is very crucial since we do not have any laboratory experiment result to compare with. At the same time, we adopt Flux Balance Analysis to characterize how different factors from culturing media can affect direct electron transfers. For the MFC module, we have successfully established data to find the optimum culturing medium concentration for Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 growth, which aids the design of MFC experiment. Voltage and power density that can be produced from alkane were also estimated.
The innovative part of our modeling is using the existing model to further explore the effect of fumarate on the integrated alkane metabolism system, which guided our experimental design and will hopefully inspire future work on similar systems.

HUMAN PRACTICES
Public education is presented in the form of exhibition during our university's information day (open day) with the following goals:
1. Promote synthetic biology as a tool to solve current problems and explain how the synthetic biology field tries to involve safety, ethics, policies, and the environment into our research and product designs.
2. Promote renewable energies as a part of our project theme of environmental sustainability.
3. Integrate stakeholders to our product design by demonstrating our project and conducting surveys from our potential users to discover public’s concerns and area of focus for product improvements.
The survey data from our public engagement exhibition, collaborations, and interviews with Prof. Davis Bookhart (department head of the HKUST sustainability office), had been integrated into the systematic design of our Microbial Fuel Cell.

Safety
""I object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary. The evil is does is permanent.""
Safety was one of our top priorities during our project design and accomplishment. So we took it seriously and strictly followed the safety rules.
Safe-project Design
Chassis
In our project, we chose non-pathogenic strains of E.coli—DH5α, BL21 to perform our molecular cloning and protein expression separately and they were worked inside a class 1 laboratory.
We also use mammalian cells—293T and HeLa to test our system. And all cell experiments were operated in the biosafety cabinet which we would use UV light to sterilize both before and after usage.
Parts
The parts contained in our project are mostly commonly used expression control units and that are used widely by worldwide researchers, so they will not raise any safety issue. At the same time, E.coli and cells transfected with our project were strictly controlled. Once they are no longer needed, they will be autoclaving and abandoned immediately, so that there won’t be any contamination to the environment.
Safe Lab Work
Safety training
The whole team attended a serious of safety lectures and passed the laboratory safety knowledge test , where we learnt how to use experimental apparatus properly and how to deal with potential dangers as well as sudden accidents in labs. We also took tests to qualify our ability before getting into the lab.
Lab arrangement
Our lab is divided into two areas—wet lab and the bench. So we can keep our computers or other stuff there avoiding being contaminated.
Clothing
We’re required to wear lab coats, gloves whenever in the lab. There’re also two kinds of gloves in the contaminated and uncontaminated areas which could not be mixed."

Education and Public Engagement
From interviews with cataracts patients, ophthalmologists, veterinarians, polls from residents in Taipei and our school community, we learned that cataracts are prevalent and have a huge impact on everyday life. Now we wanted to raise awareness through education. We started by informing teachers and students of various grade levels about the severity and causes of cataracts, and how our project could tackle these problems.
Then, in our community, we handed out pamphlets, taught people how cataracts form, and simulated a cataract experience by wearing goggles of varying cloudiness.  Finally, we wanted to make a global impact.  We joined the international BioBuilder Club community and connected with 23 other synthetic biology high school clubs to discuss our project and ideas.  We held fundraising events to benefit people who have cataracts in underdeveloped nations.  Below are a list of activities and programs that we did in outreach.

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Bacillus BioBricks#vector use_-_-_TEXT.html," essential reaction for the production of the amino acid threonine. Disruption of that gene leads to threonine auxotrophy which can be tested for with minimal medium.Totest the transformants, streak the obtained colonies (and the WT as control) on a replica plate (with antibiotic) and on minimal medium without threonine and minimal medium with threonine (use the MNGE media, recipe see transformation protocol). Correct colonies should grow only on LB and minimal medium with threonine (see Figure 2).
Figure 2: Agar-plates with MNGE-medium; left plate with threonine added, right plate without threonine. All colonies grow well on the left plate but not at all on the right plate. Those colonies all have the insertion in the correct locus. The colony in the lower right corner (4) is an exception. Is grows on both plates, indicating that the plasmid is not in the correct locus.
sacA-locus and lacA-locus: for those two loci, a colony PCR should be performed. The protocol can be found on our website. As shown below with an examplary locus, one of the primers of each pair is located on the genome, facing inwards, and the other one is located in between the recombination sites, facing outwards.
For sacA: you can use the following primers: up: TM2505: CTGATTGGCATGGCGATTGC together with TM2506: ACAGCTCCAGATCCTCTACG as well as down: TM2507: GTCGCTACCATTACCAGTTG together with TM2508: TCCAAACATTCCGGTGTTATC.
Figure 3: Colony PCR of pSBBs3C-luxABCDE-PlepA integrated into the sacA-locus. The expected bands are: up: 946 bp, down: 930 bp, none in WT and none with water as negative control. So all of the checked colonies have the insertion in the right locus.
for lacA, you can use the primers: TM2624: GAACGAAGGGCTAAGAGAAC
and TM2625:AAGCAGAAGGCCATCCTGAC (result: 650 bp)as well as TM2624 and TM2627: AAGAATCCGCCCATATCGAG (result: 3000 bp+ length of construct)
With colony PCR you can check any other locus.

Our genetic circuit is designed to initially be in an anoxic state. However, the cells may be grown aerobically and then switched off using a Tet analog such ATC and/or doxycycline. The goal here was to create a circuit with a very strong ""OFF"" during anaerobic conditions, and a very strong ""ON"" during aerobic conditions.

Overview
Our Device • Our Safety project
During the past thirty years the world has been at peace but tomorrow will be different.  Since the invention of antibiotics, mankind has been over-using and misusing them to cure diseases.  And we are on the edge of paying the bill back.  Since the discovery of antibiotics and their use in medecin, we have seen the emergence of resistance in bacteria. Recent years have witnessed the propagation of these resistant strain; making the treatment using antibiotics less and less efficient. Today, certain strains of bacteria are resistant to several antibiotics;  making the treatment process difficult and threatening patients' life expectancy; especially in the case of severe infections. In the case of severe infections,  physicians have to set up a treatment as quickly as possible. In a first place they use broad spectra antibiotics (less efficient but they act on several strains). When the identification of the bacterium is done (and if the patient is still alive) they use an antibiotic specific to the identified strain [1] [2] .
Several governments are taking measurements against the spreading of these Multi-resistant Bacteria (MRB);  by limiting cross contamination in hospitals or by reducing the selection pressure on microorganisms (limiting antibiotic treatments).  These measurements are often expensive to set up and are not 100% efficient.
A way to limit the contamination would be to systematically screen each patient.   However, this would be very expensive ( check out our cost assessment ) and   the public health system can simply not afford this kind of expense .
This year iGEM 2012 Grenoble team brings Synthetic Biology to a whole new level.
Our Device:
We developed a synthetic biology project to use engineered bacteria as low-cost, reliable, sensors possibly adaptable to many different pathogens.     We worked on three modules to create our device: detection , amplification and communication between bacteria.
Detection:
The team built the membrane receptor to perform the detection.  It consists of the assembly of two protein domains:  the external part comes from the Tap protein, a receptor involved in chemotaxis,  and the internal part comes from the EnvZ protein, which is the sensory histidine kinase of the EnvZ/OmpR two-component  system. The receptor is not directly activated by the pathogen; but by"

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#P&P communication_-_-_TEXT.html," slide with the animated DCMation logo, and another slide with a team picture. We had four team members attend the meeting, and all of us spoke for about a minute in the presentation. The first minute of the presentation was spent on outlining the uses of DCM, current disposal techniques, and how it is harmful to the environment. The second minute was devoted to describing our user-friendly disposal kit in a very simple manner. We then spent the last three minutes on the three parts of the project we had at that point (A, B, and C), as well as the engineering aspects of our system. These were only one- or two-sentence summaries due to the time limit. We used general scientific jargon in the presentation, since our audience was almost exclusively other iGEMers doing wet-lab work in the project. We could therefore use terms such as E. coli, enzymes, biosensor, regulatory network, etc. without having to explain their meaning.""
Oxford University Biochemistry Department
We gave a presentation to researchers in the Oxford University Biochemistry Department. It was a good practice at presenting and a springboard for developing the final presentation. However, this presentation obviously contained more biochemistry than engineering due to the audience.
The questions that we faced after the presentation were very useful and allowed us to channel our project development.
Public Focus Group
The presentation delivered to our second public focus group was intended to give a very general overview of synthetic biology, its potential, its challenges, and its application in our project. To ensure the presentation was accessible to the layman we avoided use of jargon where possible - where technical language was unavoidable, we included plain-English explanations of these terms in a 'Definitions' slide. We were also careful to give a neutral, unbiased view of synthetic biology as the aim was to inform, not to have our own views sway those of the focus group.
UNIQ Summer School
UNIQ courses are an Oxford University-based series of free academic residential summer camps for Year 12s. We were able to speak to 40 students with a specific interest in studying biochemistry about iGEM and synthetic biology. These 17 year olds were therefore students that were likely to have a high standard AS-level knowledge of biology and chemistry. As such we included a short introduction to synthetic biology, but felt we did not have to define terms such as ‘gene’ and ‘enzyme’. We described to them the applications of some of the most imaginative projects from past iGEM competitions, but did not include the genetic circuits that require an undergraduate understanding of gene structure.

In addition to the experimental work in the laboratory, an important part of the work involves computational modeling of both the sensing and killing module. The model simulations allow the prediction of system behavior under various conditions and help to better design the experimental work.
The Heidelberg team is in the middle of its project work. The students are working day and night for three months on this ambitious project. Initial results have been achieved for both the experimental and the modeling parts.

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," human health and the environment, farmers around the world depend on the herbicide glyphosate, which is the active ingredient of of Roundup that is produced by the giant Monsanto . In June 2016, the European Union member states delayed a final decision on renewal for the weed killer, instead extending the license for 18 months. In October and November 2017, the European Commission (EC) again pushed back a vote on the issue. However, the EC must make a decision, as the current license is due to expire on December 15. Although the EC on Food Safety had been pushing for a 10-year renewal of the license for glyphosate, this has been pedaled back to a five-year renewal. While many EU member countries support continued use of glyphosate, countries like France have announced plans to oppose the license renewal. In previous meetings, other large member states like Germany have been undecided. The debate over weed killer glyphosate has been raging for years. In 2015, the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified the herbicide as ""probably carcinogenic."" Yet in 2016, the European Food Safety Authority described that glyphosate is ""unlikely"" to cause cancer. Glyphosate is the world's most widely-used herbicide (see above). In Germany alone, farmers treat about 40 percent of arable land with it! Glyphosate undeniably increases the efficiency of farming - and traces of glyphosate have been detected in many foods, from ice cream to beer :-( (Figure 5). However, critics argue that risks are too high. A Danish farmer in Europe alleged that glyphosate caused his piglets to be born with deformities; in countries like Argentina, experts have blamed cancer, miscarriage and deformation in humans on glyphosate. Environmentalists also point out potential harmful effects of glyphosate on biodiversity and ecosystems. Some people compare the powerful agrochemical lobby behind glyphosate with that of tobacco. In the same vein, they argue that Monsanto has manipulated scientific studies upon which regulatory bodies base their decisions (Figure 5). In any case, the glyphosate controversy is far from over. Indeed, Dewayne Johnson , a 46-year old groundskeeper from the united states sued Monsanto to be responsible for his cancer (August - 10 - 2018). Mr. Johnson might receive 289 Million US Dollar as compensation money for this case. However, Monsanto still argues about the outcome.
Figure 5. Monsanto has supported studies to evaluate the genotoxic potential of glyphosate (16). Glyphosate has been detected in german beer .

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," The overuse of pesticides as a prevention to protect our crops is an example of a harmful practice. In an ideal world, pesticides would only be present where pathogens are present. See how our device can be a first step towards this ideal world.
Countering pesticide overuse
Recent agricultural developments have enabled human civilization to expand to the industrial society as we know it today. As we are dealing with a growing population, the use of products to enlarge agricultural production is crucial. Root diseases such as rot lead to great crop losses and have been responsible for great famine in the past [1] [2] . Plants do not fully grow and the fruit production significantly diminishes [1] . It is estimated that about 30-50% of food is lost, due to inadequate agriculture. Root diseases, mostly caused by fungal growth, can sometimes lead to 100% loss of crops. Fungi, such as Fusarium, and fungal-like eukaryotic microorganisms called oomocytes, such as Pythium and Phytophthora, modulate plant physiology and defense mechanisms via the secretion of virulence factors and effectors [2] . [3] .. One of the main invasive approaches is the secretion of Cell Wall Degrading Enzymes (CWDE). These proteins disrupt the cell wall structure of plant cells, thereby leaving the cells vulnerable for infiltration by pathogenic organisms [4] .     Several different methods for pathogen detection have been developed. Some of them make use of specific fungal antigens as diagnostic markers. Next to that, the production of mycotoxins and allergens by these pathogens could possibly also be used for detection [3] .
However, developments to increase agricultural yield are not always harmless.  A particular example of a dangerous agricultural development is the overuse of pesticides.
Pesticides is a broad term to describe any agent (chemical or biological) that is capable of disturbing pathogens in their normal functioning. These pathogens can be microorganisms, herbs, insects or fungi, each of them forming a threat to the growth of crops.  Since fungi form the most prominent threat to roots, we will take a closer look at the functionality of pesticides specific for fungi: fungicides. Chemical fungicides make use of chemical molecules to intervene in pathways crucial for fungal growth or preservation. Chemical fungicides have several different modes of action. They can act on pathways involved in chitin and sterol biosynthesis, microtubule assembly and mitochondrial respiration [2] [9] . Also research is done towards a new method making use of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides disrupt membrane structure by binding to"

Preparation of Competent E. coli Cells
A sample of E. coli DH5ɑ stored at -80℃ was defrosted and inoculated in 5mL of LB in a 125mL conical flask (volume of LB 10% of flask volume so as to achieve sufficient aeration). The culture was left to grow overnight at 37℃.
Re-PCR of DNA Sequences
Two sets of sequences A,B,F,G, I, J, K, and M were PCRed using the same protocol as 22/06, with one set using a 55℃ annealing temperature and another using 50℃ annealing temperature.

Re-PCR of DNA Sequences
Refer to protocol from 1.0
PCR Results
The amplified sequences A, B, F, G, I, K, J, and M were loaded with blue dye and run on agarose gel as per standard protocol
Sequences G and J showed bands corresponding to the expected sizes at both 50℃ and 55℃ annealing temperatures.
The bands were excised and extracted according to standard protocol (E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction).
Plasmid recovery
The concentration of pSB1C3 plasmid recovered on 23/06 according to the NanoDrop was low (1.6ng/µl). To obtain more plasmids, we restriction digested a construct made by last year’s, pSB1C3 + abijk, to recover the pSB-1C3 content from the construct.

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," but an hard job was waiting for us. We had a long meeting at the beginning of the week to sum up all the things we still had to do, and returned home a bit shocked after realizing the amount of work that was still waiting for us! But on Monday we had already completed a long and debated discussion: we had the name of the project, CRUST AWAY! And now we only missed the logo, but Nadia was working hard to realize it for us.
This was another important week for me, except for the name of the project: I completed my construct K731600! After screening the 6 new colonies I inoculated before holidays the PCR revealed the presence of my insert in the g colony
!
Actually even the i colony seemed to have my insert, so I sent for sequencing both the colonies for sure. On Friday morning I was at the post office to send the samples with a great great great hope in my pocket.
Meantime I repeated the methylene blue test for three or four times to test new samples and collected good data to show. I definitively verify that this test does not work with the lysates of the co-coltures CysE+CysDes; one of the hypothesis is that the cysteine production by CysE is too low to be used by CysDes to produce detectable quantities of H2S. Anyway I repeated the test only with my coltures of CysDes and empty cells with different concentrations of cysteine, I obtained very good results.
This week we took another repeat of the Ptac measurements (in reality they were two but I’ve lost the data of the second one).
Moreover, we did the first in vitro reaction, using the Ptac just-linker-construct. The reaction was done with PURExpress kit and a spectrophotometer different from the one always used. We took the fluorescence data for 6h, then the day after we took another measurement at the usual instrument. We were helped by Fabio Chizzolini and Silvia, from the Mansy lab, doing this in vitro reaction.
Week 15 (08/27 – 09/02)
I made the last tests on cysteine production, now I can focus on the website. Cristina and the rest of the team help me in choosing the layouts, and give me all the pages ready to be uploaded.
I finally ended with the tests on CysDes, it is time to collect and organize the results. So I passed most of the time at the PC, because the Registry pages of my parts had to be ready as"

Module:Pathway finder
Our Path finder combines metabolic network databases, cell signaling pathway databases and gene interaction databases, to find a path between components which is usually genes or their associated proteins.[1] A click on the 'PATHFINDER' button will lead a way from one node to another through components registered in the databases that you want to make further investigation.
We took trp operon in E.coli for example, as the operon concept is considered one of the landmark events. The operon is regulated so that when tryptophan is present in the environment, the genes for tryptophan synthesis are not expressed.
Choose trpR and trpE genes as start node and end node. Path Finder gives 4 paths as Fig.1.
Fig.1 - A list of paths found by the 'Pathway finder' represented on the webpage.
The first route is considered as best-matching path, as it reveals mediate interactions between two genes. TrpR, the repressor for the trp operon is produced upstream by the trpR gene, which is constitutively expressed at a low level. When tryptophan is present, these tryptophan repressor dimers bind to tryptophan, allowing the repressor to bind to the operator, and leads to the transcription of trpLEDCBA. You can choose either one or all of these routes, which will be presented on the Pano. The latter circumstance is shown as Fig.2.

Analytical digestion and gelelectrophoresis of miniprep P293, P294
Investigator: Jeff, Dennis
Aim of the experiment: Analytical digestion and gelelectrophoresis of miniprep P2P93, P294 to see whether the enzymes EcoRI and BamHI are working. Because the size of the insert is too short, the backbone is additionally cut with Eco91I (cuts only 1x in the backbone). So digestion were done with EcoRI+Eco91I and BamHI+Eco91I.

Social
While we interacted with beekeepers and researchers, it was not difficult to realize the importance of considering social aspects within the activities and plans for our project.
Rider University explains “sociological imagination” as the ability to see the connection between the larger events affecting the whole society and the individual consequences for each of us in our own lives. Personal troubles may be our fault; but in others, they may be a result of social forces beyond our control as individuals; society shape us as we shape our society.1
Analyzing and acting upon social implications lies in living together in an organized and beneficial way.
In the first approach we had with a beekeeper, Mr. Guillermo Rodríguez, it was explained how beekeeping varies around the world and how many times the needs are different for each region. In our effort to consider all these needs in our project, we managed to have interviews with professionals related to the topic in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Italy, Valencia, and Canadá, taking into account from beekeepers who manage few hives to complete associations, investigators, governmental institutions and international agencies. We considered specific needs to obtain a universal solution.
In the IV State’s Beekeeping Forum and the CIAD visit, we were able to experience what beekeepers’ work involves. Working with few beehives lessen the job, however in the case of beekeepers like the Chilean Bryaan Saaverdra, that works with more than 1000 hives the work notably intensifies, as you must attend beehive by beehive whatever the weather condition is. Through the application method of our product, which was transformed over the months basing on the concerns and needs of the beekeepers, we foster the welfare of this community taking in consideration for their working days not to become intensified when experiencing the diseases and applying the product.
In the meeting with Mr. Manuel Ramírez Salcido, he commented on how there are almost no young people who are interested in beekeeping and that there is a significant concern for the future of this sector. While developing our project, we saw the enthusiasm of beekeepers for seeing young people interested in the area."

Finally we took the opportunity of being in Belgium to organize a quick meetup with the KU Leuven iGEM team.
Overall this experience in Brussels was quite intense, we met many people interested in science and it was refreshing to be able to get out of the lab and interact with people about our project. We hope to feel the same degree of engagement this September in Boston!
Exciting perspectives!
During the summer vacations and particularly August, we had trouble organizing any education event. But iGEM does not stop on the 28th of September, and we have everything planned to keep our education project alive after the competition:
Student's week: between the 9th and the 18th of October in Toulouse.
The ""Student's week"" occuring in several towns in the Midi-Pyrénées region facilitates the integration of new students in Toulouse by allowing them to participate in free events organized by diverse associations. We will be one of the first ever to present a scientific stand!
Scientilivre: on the 17th and 18th of October.
Taking place in Toulouse, Scientilivre (""Science book"") is very rightly named and is there to present both books and science to the public. We plan to introduce our project Apicoli through posters and some playful experimentations for families.
Junior high school: In november
The biology teachers from Leonard de Vinci junior high school asked us to come again after the jamboree for a follow up on our experience, this time we will explain more about the competition and present others projects from different iGEM teams.

Winnie-the-Pooh
Winnie-the-Pooh, also called Pooh Bear, is a fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear created by English author A. A. Milne . The first collection of stories about the character was the book Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), and this was followed by The House at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children's verse book When We Were Very Young (1924) and many more in Now We Are Six (1927). All four volumes were illustrated by E. H. Shepard .
The Pooh stories have been translated into many languages, including Alexander Lenard 's Latin translation, Winnie ille Pu, which was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the only Latin book ever to have been featured on The New York Times Best Seller list . [1]
Hyphens in the character's name were dropped by Disney when the company adapted the Pooh stories into a series of features that became one of its most successful franchises. In popular film adaptations, Pooh Bear has been voiced by actors Sterling Holloway , Hal Smith , and Jim Cummings in English and Yevgeny Leonov in Russian.
A live action adaptation of the film is currently in development with screenwriter Alex Ross Perry on board to write the screenplay. The story will focus on an adult Christopher Robin returning to the Hundred Acre Wood. [2]
Christopher Milne had named his toy bear after Winnie , a Canadian black bear he often saw at London Zoo , and ""Pooh"", a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario , Canada, while en route to England during the First World War. He named the bear ""Winnie"" after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg , Manitoba. ""Winnie"" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept3_-_-_TEXT.html," sites CosN and I2 (a sequence located between CosN and CosB).
It has also been demonstrated that the initiation of the cut at CosN is assisted by the IHF, Integration Host Factor during the process of encapsidation. This process causes a bend of the DNA by binding I1 (a sub-sequence of CosB) allowing gpNu1 (subunit of the terminase, which does not display the activity of endonuclease) to set the sites R (1,2,3) of CosB. This binding triggers the endonuclease activity of the terminase subunit GpA releasing a genomic monomer ready to be encapsidated.
To summarize, the terminase binds to a Cos sequence of concatemeric DNA and causes a cut that releases the left end of genome to encapsidate. It is the binding of the complex enzyme-DNA to an empty procapsid that initiates the encapsidation process.
By removing the Cos sequence of the phage genome, it is never encapsidated. Only the therapeutic plasmid, which possesses them, is encapsidated.

The nuclear targeting [7]
The cell vector releases after an endocytosis step, the therapeutic plasmid into the cytoplasm of the target cells. However, the plasmid must absolutely penetrate the nucleus to ensure its stability and expression. Any plasmid will rarely reach the nucleus if we do not provide to it, the necessary element to trigger a mechanism of nuclear incorporation. Studies were conducted on the use of specific sequences for nuclear import of genetic sequences: DTS sequences (DNA Nuclear Targeting Sequence). The SV40 sequence of the simian virus is known to play this role.
5’ GCATGCTTTG CATACTTCTG CCTGCTGGGG AGCCTGGGGA CTTTCCACAC CCTAACTGAC ACACATTCCA CAGCTGGTTC TTTCCGCCTC AGAAGGTACC T 3’
This sequence, known for having the ability to bind to 10 different transcription factors, provides the transportation of DNA to the nucleus. Added to the therapeutic plasmid, this sequence ensures the entry and the expression of therapeutic plasmid into the nucleus of the target cell.

Therapeutic genes
The plasmid possesses the therapeutic gene or genes to bring to the pathogenic cell to respond to a targeted disease. Regarding genes naturally present in the genome, we chose to place them under the control of their natural promoter. Thus, the"

The substrate bound nucleotides are inaccessible to phi29 polymerase meaning that the reaction mix is missing 1 type of nucleotide triphosphates. For this reason the polymerase is unable to amplify DNA, therefore there no DNA product is detected (13 Fig., 3 well). However, the addition of purified catalytic biomolecule to the reaction mix and separate droplets catalyse the conversion of phi29 inaccessible substrate nucleotides to accessible ones and in turn enables the amplification reaction to occur (13 Fig., 4 well).  These results conclude, that MDA reaction compartmentalization in microliter droplets works as intended - substrate nucleotides are inaccessible to phi29 polymerase and catalytically converted one are accessible and thus can be incorporated into the DNA molecule.
Figure 14. Microscopic images of 10 pL, 40 pL and 50 pL emulsion.
After assessing the conditions for activity recording amplification, the next step was to optimise the droplet electrocoalescence step and prove that it enables the addition of amplification reagents to the biomolecule synthesis droplets without disrupting the compartmentalization of single DNA molecules and information, stored as concentration of catalytically converted substrate nucleotides in it.
Movie 2. Reinfusion of previously generated 10 pL into the microfluidic droplet electrocoalescence device. The rejected closely packed emulsion is spaced by continuous flow of fluorinated carrier oil flowing from the sides and meets newly generated MDA amplification droplets in the main device channel.
Droplet merging technique involves a delicate step: reinfusion of previously generated biomolecules synthesis droplets. We have successfully optimized the reinfusion methodology by trying out different ways to collect and reinfuse the emulsion. By collecting the 10pL droplets generated during previous library encapsulation steps into a piece of tubing and using it as a vessel to incubate droplets at 37oC we have successfully avoided any disruption of reinjected droplet integrity as shown by a video above ( Video 2). The reinjected emulsion is closely packed, is stable and contains no air bubbles in between leading to perfect droplet reinfusion.
The most important factors of droplet coalescence are voltage applied to the device electrodes, the flow rates of droplets and the volume ratio of droplets merged together. Any of these parameters could decrease the efficiency of droplet merging and thus affect the overall performance of whole method. Videos shown below display the consequences of bad droplet merging parameters"

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Public_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM project aims at the application of self-screening advantageous mutant selection, which can provide a growth dominance to the strains with beneficial mutation.                     As a result, we conducted an biosafety-investigation about the medical application of antibiotics in FuXing Hospital, Capital University. Besides, we participated in a series of academic conferences, during which we exchanged our ideas                     with other participants and sought out for chances of collaboration.
Voluntary
Frankly speaking, popular science about biology is quite inadequate, causing many students in rural areas unable to scratch the surface of biology until senior high. As a result, during the summer vacation, our team members went to three country schools in Jiangxi and Ningxia Province for volunteer work and brought biology to younger students.
BNU-China organized a seminar class and shared anecdotes about biotechnology with children from several villages. In the active class, team members held a heated discussion involving transgenosis and environmental protection that people concerned and we got established a long-term friendly relation of cooperation with OUC-China, who helped us with the comic book about synthetic biology. The book exhibited the complex biology model and principle with funny comics, making it more easier for students initial contact. Besides daily activities, we also conducted an interview about their fancy ways of education. Most students responded that they were looking forward to participating in scientific experiments, but had laboured under the disadvantage of not having enough equipment. Their words went directly to the heart, finding their support in the understanding. Grown up in cities, we had no idea of strong thirst for knowledge of rural children. From then on, we were deeply determined to create a revolutionary new way of science popularization, ameliorating the poor condition and offering these lovely students opportunities to a better future.
Having been back to our laboratory, we held a series of conferences, coming up with ideas on how to popularize synthetic biology intended for demonstrations at low cost.At the beginning, we planned to help students to get a deeper understanding of synthetic biology in the means of lecture, but soon changed our mind for the teaching practice with local high school students who reported that this form would be boring for the public. Then we thought of, a mimic electrocircuitt relying on the gene pathway would offer a great advantage of viewable and intuitive understanding of the core idea of synthetic biology. And it can inspire people to participate in gene-designing process.
As a result, we used e-SAM© system, an ideal analog model to expound the definition of synthetic biology, applying engineering structures to build artificial biological systems for research, engineering and medical applications. We also drafted a detailed description"

Keeping People Safe
Each team member on the Queen's iGEM 2013 team has received extensive lab safety and Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) training as several hazardous compounds were encountered. These include ethidium bromide, a potential carcinogen and mutagen, and sodium azide, a potentially deadly chemical. Ethidium bromide was used to run gel electrophoresis while sodium azide was used in several mini chemotaxis assays to paralyze Caenorhabditis elegans. Proper protocols were followed in handling both chemicals, including the use of appropriate safety equipment and proper disposal techniques. As the research conducted this year is considered Level 1 work, all iGEM students worked in an officially approved Level 1 Biohazard Lab. All Canadian national biosafety standards and guidelines were followed. Furthermore, the project idea, methods and safety considerations were reviewed by two faculty advisors, Dr. Kenton Ko and Dr. Ian Chin-Sang, who are both members of the Biohazard Committee at Queen's University.
The bacterial strains used in the research are non-pathogenic E. coli strains, including K-12, XL1-Blue, and BL-21. These are rated as Biosafety Level 1 and do not pose a threat to laboratory workers, the general public or the environment. All measures outlined in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and the biosafety regulations present at Queen's University were followed. These measures prevent our genetically modified E. coli strains from being introduced into the environment, and from posing any risk to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries.

When changing foot odor into a compound that smells like bananas, it could have unpredictable effects such as luring insects or triggering allergic reactions. In order for this to become a commercial product, extensive testing with actual mosquitoes in regular outdoors environments as well as testing its effects on humans would be required. Since the product would require placing bacteria relatively close to human skin, such as the feet, precautions would need to be taken to ensure that the bacteria does not escape the"

The growth curve was shown in Figure.6.
Opposing to our expectation, the growth has a negative dependence on tryptophan. It may be caused by the little demand to malQ of the cell and thus the high expression level of malQ can become a burden to the growth of the cell. This problem might be more disturbing for tac promoter in original plasmid pTrc99A was not strict so the leakage effect was serious.

Figure.7  malQ enzyme activity in vivo against the concentration of tryptophan 12 hours after IPTG induction
To confirm our hypothesis about the tryptophan dependent malQ expression system, we tested the enzyme activity of malQ present in the cell 12 hours after adding IPTG. The enzyme activity is defined as the moles of maltose to glucose convertion per minute per OD600 at 37℃. And the glucose assay was conducted using the EnzyChromTM Glucose Assay Kit (produced by BioAssay Systems). We plotted the enzyme activity against the concentration of tryptophan and the result was shown as figure.7.
Figure.8 tetA cloned from pCM110
It was shown that when the concentration of tryptophan was below 10mM, the maltase activity increased with the level of tryptophan, which was the same as our expectation. However, when the concentration of tryptophan continued to increase, the enzyme activity started to decrease, showing the upper limit of tryptophan to be more or less 10mM.
In parallel, we constructed tryptophan sensor coupling tetA circuits which can provide selection pressure to tryptophan provider microorganisms by antibiotics resistance. Similar to mutD, three different RBS sequences (B0030,"

Device validation - Using our co-culture to produce plastic
 
Due to issues with the genetic construct, which is further commented in the tap on “biosynthetic make-up” (LINK), we could not assemble our biobrick construct in due time. This also prevented us from using our co-culture to produce plastic. However, if we had had the time to do so, the following experiment would have been undertaken:

Conclusion
We propose to use co-cultures as a mean of bio-processing in space, because of its potential to reduce the required cargo-load compared to monoculturing. Furthermore, it enables the design of a sustainable and modular system of bioprocessing consisting of a producer (synechococcus) and a manufacturer (bacillus) that can be extended to produce multiple end-products in parallel with each other. We tested the ability of these specific bacteria, due to their photosynthetic capabilities and endospore formation of synechococcus and bacillus respectively. Bacillus could be grown in supplemented ATCC:BG-11 mixed medium, but at lower growth rates than supplemented ATCC media, and was very resistant to osmotic stress. Synechococcus could also be grown in mixed medium, however, did not tolerate high osmotic stresses and cscB-sucrose export as well as bacillus showing loss of growth rate in presence of IPTG and 150 nM NaCl. To validate our co-culture model, we used spend media of cscB-transformed and induced synechococcus to simulate the environment of the co-culture. From validation, we conclude that bacillus grow with higher rates in spend media - which should allow for a more productive bacillus culture compared to a monoculture in the same media without additional supplements.

As previously stated as a safety measure the Taq polymerase part has been mutated in such a way that it will no longer bind to DNA. Through these mutations we eliminate its function and will just be a harmless globular protein in the cell. According to the MSDS, Taq polymerase does not produce any toxic compounds but may do so in the presence of strong oxidising agents/bases, degrade to form CO and CO2. In such an event, this side effect can be combated simply by ventilating the area.
If a biopart, for example the modified Taq polymerase, mutated back to bind to E. coli DNA it might kill the cell. This however is unlikely.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes. Our supervisor, Dr. Leonard Pattenden is on the biosafety committee. There was an internal requirement to complete a project risk assessment to cover all areas of the project. Our project has been deemed low risk. Additionally, our project required registration and was granted an “exempt dealing” by the Biosafety Commitee due to it's low risk, acting under Australian regulations from the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR).
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Ideally, risk assessments should be conducted for each individual depending on their experience and expertise in handling the chemicals/organisms and carrying out the protocols. In addition, each student should write a risk assessment of the protocols employed to complete the project. This way all students will know and understand the risks of each experiment being done.
Knowledge is power: the more information known about a newly created part/device/system, the easier it is to identify and combat the associated risks. Greater recording of details and greater characterisation of parts in the registry would improve safety.
5. Could there be an unplanned event or series of events involving your project, resulting in either death, injury, occupational illness, death, damage to equipment or property, or damage to the environment?
Any time a person steps into a laboratory there is a risk of a serious emergency occurring. The likelihood of such an occurrence has been reduced due to the risk management techniques employed in the laboratory plus the oversight and training of students to comply with OHS best practice standards. Students are personally supervised at all times during iGEM work by an"

To our surprise, Professor asserted that our product could only work in the lab because we did not consider the more complicated affecting factors in the lake ecosystem. He further suggested that there's already a well- developed method to collect most of the Cyanobacterium in one area, and then salvage them on the shore. However, there's not a mature way to deal with these muddy Cyanobacteria. To bury them or to burn them create secondary pollution to the environment because if the accumulated nitrogen and phosphorus in the salvaged cyanobacteria flow back into the lake, cyanobacteria bloom would come back.
The discussion with Prof. Wang did not frustrate us, but it provides a great inspiration to our new focus: why don't we design a model that could lyse the cyanobacteria and convert it into its different components so that we could convert the ""waste"" into ""wealth"". And our design could add up to the already existed methods to fully complete a health ""cyanobacteria elimination system"".
Offline research
We designed the offline research as the preliminary investigation of a more detailed online research. Therefore, this research aims to provide us with a general idea about public's view on cyanobacteria pollution in China. We went to central Wuxi, where the citizens have been suffering from cyanobacteria in the Taihu Lake, to conduct our offline research. We have received response from 91 questionnaires covering different genders and age groups. Based on analysis of these questionnaires, we were able to learn the public understanding of the cyanobacteria problem, such problem's influence on people's daily life, and public willingness to support our program.
The results and analysis are stated below :
1.    About the age group
The effective number is 91 in total. Among all the interviewees, 28.5 percent of them are high school or primary school students; 31.9 percent of them study in college; and the rest 29.7 percent of them are already working.
2.      To what degree are people aware of the cyanobacteria problem
The effective number is 91 in total. Among all these interviewees, 9 percent of them are well informed of the cyanobacteria problem; 68 percent of them are partially informed; 14 percent of them are not quite informed,; and the rest are not informed at all.

First fictional scenario
What if in the far future we start to run out of space to    accommodate the growing world population? Would we be able to find    suitable places to inhabit without damaging natural areas? What if we    use existent spaces to accommodate the growing population without the    necessity of building new human settlements protecting the green areas?    Have we thought about it?
According to the UN DESA report; “World Population Prospects: The      2015 Revision”, by 2050 the world population is expected to reach to      9.7 billion; the available living space could not be sustainable to      accommodate the rapidly-growing amount of people. Such raising in the      population, probably, will see humanity looking for more      space to make sustainable the living of new generations, without using      the green areas.
Within this fictional scenario, CryptoGErM could offer a potential      solution.
CryptoGErM is a system for the storing and safe-sending of      information. By making use of the first purpose, we could store the      whole current information contained in books, newspapers, articles and      other physical paper-based within bacteria to reduce the      space needed for the storing of such information. Bacteria, such Bacillus subtilis is able to store up to 1.5 GB of      information; furthermore, 1 mm3 of DNA can store up to      109 GB of information. [1]
Just to put an example of this fictional application; it is      estimated that the the information contained by the U.S. Library of      Congress is equivalent to 200 TB, currently it is stored in a physical      space of 186,000 square meter. If this information is stored into DNA,      it would only occupy 0.0002 mm3.
Furthermore, storing int DNA is more eco-friendly, because it does      not require any specific medium to keep it functional, in contrast with      current magnetic and optical storage medium that requires energetic      supply to continue working. Just in 2015, 416.2 terawatt hours of      electricity were used by world’s data centres. This consumption was      “significantly higher than the UK’s total consumption of about 300      terawatt hours.” [2]
Storing information in the DNA of bacteria, will replace the current storing medium (Fictional scenario)

Modelling on peptide synthesis and cell lysis
Our design uses the tandem repeat strategy to express three copies of each peptide gene, LL-37, GF-17 and Grammistin-Pp1, aiming to produce peptides with a higher rate. To release the peptides to kill Staphylococcus aureus in the intestine, we choose lysis of the cells instead of secretion. A lysis gene is used to open up the cells, then all the peptides will surely be released into the guts. In addition, we plan to use a toggle switch to provide more time for peptide synthesis before lysis. When the cells are lysed, it will result in the release of intracellular proteins and stop all life activities. Therefore, we use modeling to identify:
How much time can the toggle switch provide for the accumulation of AMPs？
Results: Inspired by the team TU-Delft (2013), we simplified the promoters P2 to serve as a binary switch between the active and inactive promoter states instead of continuous activities from fully on to fully off. We used the parameter--s, a binary state descriptor, to refer to the situation when a promoter produces one of the two levels of activity: on or off. In addition, the original amount of TetR  was assumed to be 200 μmol. Due to the unknown concentration of AcmA to lyse the cells, this value was assumed to be 50 μmol.

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Design
The device was designed to be active upon ingestion at a pH of approximately 6 or below in order to release our synthetic colicins. The promoter is not constitutive and activates transcription of genes at a low pH. The pH range of the promoter was investigated in this project.
In 2013 the Northwestern iGEM team submitted two pH sensitive promoter Pasr ( BBa_K1231000 ) and PgadA ( BBa_K1231001 ). In order to further characterise both of these promoters we cloned gfp ( BBa_E0840 ) downstream of both promoters (Fig 1). We then used this construct to measure and compare the GFP expression levels in response to different pH conditions.
Figure 1:  Schematic representation of pH sensitive promoters-gfp constructs in pSB1C3 plasmid.
We wanted to test both our pH sensitive promoters, Pasr and PgadA by monitoring for the production of GFP by western blotting. The western blots showed levels of GFP protein production by the cells at a range of pH values. In Fig 2A the expression of GFP at pH 5 is much higher than the other pH readings. This would indicate that at this pH the largest amount of GFP was being produced under the induction of the gadA promoter. The promoter is slightly leaky as there is also expression of protein within cells at other pH values. In Fig 2B the GFP protein expression under the regulation of Pasr can be seen, the range of activity for this promoter is much wider indicating that this promoter is leakier than PgadA. The level of expression of GFP under the regulation of Pasr appears to be uniform with only a slight increase in GFP at pH5.
Figure 2: GFP production under the control of pH sensitive promoters PgadA and Pasr. Promoters with gfp cloned downstream of them were transformed into MG1655 E. coli cells, 5 ml of these cells were incubated for 16h at 37oC. After 16h, 200 uL of the overnight cultures were introduced into 1.8 ml of MOPS pH adjusted LB for the respective pH values indicated above. After 20 min at ambient conditions a 1ml aliquot was pelleted. The pellets were re-suspended in 100 ul=L Laemmli buffer and 15uL samples were then separated by SDS PAGE (12% acrylamide) and transferred to PVDF membrane followed by probing with anti-GFP antibody.

Safety Proposals
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
Any kind of research evolves risks, but in our project we tried to assure biosafety with the following actions:
All the students were trained by the advisors (PhD students with experience in molecular biology and microbiology).
Every lab practice should be performed with gloves, labcoat and other safety equipment if required.
We are using non-pathogenic lab strains of E. coli that do not confer any additional fitness advantages on bacteria, apart from the most common antibiotic resistance genes used as selection markers. We are focused on containment of this microorganism by discarding all the genetic or microbiological material after sterilization.
All the genes from pathogenic bacteria were synthesized to avoid safety problems with environment, public and  researches health.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
did you document these issues in the Registry?
how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
How could other teams learn from your experience?
There's no directly evidence that the biobricks developed by our team should raise any safety issue, besides in the manipulation of GMO and lab practices. But if we encounter any reason for this kind of concern, we will report and document it.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
The wetlab work of team UNICAMP-EMSE  was conducted at the Systems Biology Laboratory , located at Center for Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering (CBMEG) in University of Campinas - UNICAMP . Systems Biology Laboratory is a research laboratory fully equipped for dealing with Risk 1 microorganisms and GMOs. The following laboratory equipments are available: autoclave for sterilization; laminar flux hood with UV lamp for working with microorganisms under sterile conditions; shakers and incubators for microorganism growth; freezers and refrigerators exclusively used for maintaining culture media and bacterial cultures; specifically designated sharps collection bin; easily accessible"

A table is provided for all the parameters in the model at the end of this section for your reference.
The dynamical model of microtubule growth can be summarized into the following steps.
\[   N=mt_t+mt_d   \]   \[   m_0=m_1+m_2+m_d+N   \]
The meanings of the variables are given in the table below.
Table 1 Variables in the microtubule model.
Variable
Description
$N$
The number of dimers on the microtubule
$mt_t$
The number of Tu-GTP on the microtubule
$mt_d$
The number of Tu-GDP on the microtubule
$m_0$
The total number of tubulin dimers
$m_1$
The number of Tu-GTP in the solution that have not been assembled to microtubules
$m_2$
The number of Tu—GTP on the yeast surface that have not been assembled to microtubules
$m_d$
The number of Tu-GDP that have depolymerized from microtubules
The main reactions in microtubule growth are as follows. For nucleation, we have
\[   TuGTP+TuGTP\xrightarrow{k_n}(TuGTP)_2   \]
where $k_n$ is the rate constant of the nucleation reaction. The growth of a nucleus can be seen as a reversible reaction:
\[   (TuGTP)_n+TuGTP\xrightarrow{k_s}(TuGTP)_{n+1}   \]   \[   (TuGTP)_n+TuGTP\xleftarrow{k_p}(TuGTP)_{n+1}   \]
where $k_s$ and $k_p$ are the corresponding rate constants.
A nucleus has to grow to include up to 13 tubulin dimers before it can become a relatively stable microtubule. If we denote a microtubule of length $n$ as $M_n$, we have
\[   13 \ TuGTP\xrightarrow{}M_{13}   \]
Next, we shall look at the growth of microtubules after the above process. As stated at the beginning of this section, only Tu-GTP molecules can assemble onto the end of a microtubule. For the “+” end, there are two different cases.

Preparing the DNA samples
Image 8: Jane pipetting DNA sample
Image 9: Jane applying the dye
Prepare some fresh Eppendorf tubes and to each of them add 9 microlitres of the sample DNA and 1 microlitre of dye.
It may be an idea to lightly centrifuge them so that all of the dye and DNA congregates to the bottom to the Eppendorf tube – to do this, place tubes in centrifuge (set for 1 minute) and start the spinning process. Once it reaches maximum speed (13,000 rpm for our centrifuge), stop spinning process.
Remove tubes from centrifuge and place in rack in the same order that they are to appear in the lanes of the gel.
Make sure that the standard DNA ladder is placed into an Eppendorf tube and placed into the rack before the others. This will be inserted first.
Image 8 shows the application of plasmid DNA to the ""DNA preparation"" Eppendorf tube. Notice that it is a clear liquid, with no precipitate (may need to zoom in to see clearly!). The DNA preparation should be free from protein.
Image 9 shows the application of the dye to the ""DNA preparation"" Eppendorf tube. It appears as a black liquid. Remember, it is a good idea to keep a stock of the dye (the dye in this Eppendorf tube is stock taken from the original conatiner of dye)
Loading the samples into the gel
Image 10 - Loading the wells in the gel with DNA + dye preparations
Using a P20 pipette, take up 10 microlitres from the first Eppendorf tube (containing the DNA + dye).
Make sure that you can see the row of wells through the water-like solution before doing anything else.
With the row of wells in sight, place the pipette end just above the well of choice (for the first entry, try and leave a one well margin). Make sure the pipette is pointed vertically above the well and make sure that the pipette end is not touching the gel or poking into the well.
Empty the contents of the pipette (DNA + dye) into the well slowly so that the solution fills the well without dispersing into the solution around the well.
Repeat the process for all of the tubes.
Once completed, close the lid on the tray and place the electrodes in the appropriate positions. The positive electrode should be located at the end opposite to the comb as DNA is negatively charged and will move towards it.
Switch on the power,"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," IPA imine dimer (white color) should be produced in those with functional import.
Plasmid preparation of those with white color and subsequent sequencing leads to the identification of functional PTS1 variants. Afterwards, we repeat the cloning steps described before to obtain a mTurquoise−PTS1* construct and co-transform it with the corresponding Pex5 variant. Eventually, the correct localization of mTurquoise tagged with these PTS1 variants provides proof for its function.
Mutagenesis of PTS2
Imagine you need different protein concentrations in your artificial compartment. What to do? Take our modified PTS2 sequences with varying import efficiencies.
To characterize the import efficiency for the site-directed PTS2 firefly luciferase was used. Luciferase is a luminescent protein which can be split in a C- and a N-terminal part. Only when combined, luminescence can be detected. To measure the import efficiency the two parts will be expressed and imported into the peroxisome in a separated way. The smaller part (Split2) of the split luciferase will be brought into the peroxisome first via the PTS1 dependent pathway. The other part is imported via the respective modified PTS2 sequence. The better this sequence is recognized by Pex7, the stronger the luminescence of the assembled luciferase can be detected in the peroxisome. There is a chance of split parts of the luciferase assembling in the cytosol if the import is too slow. To avoid wrong conclusions of the luciferase localisation, we designed a negative control experiment. It includes a split luciferase similar to the one used in the initial experiment, but without the peroxisomal targeting sequence. Consequently there will be no import into the peroxisome. If we subtract the luminescence of the negative control experiment from the luminescence of the main experiment we can define the degree of import.
In addition to a directed approach according to Kunze and colleagues we also want to perform a random  mutagenesis experiment to alter the five variable amino acids of the core region of the PTS2 sequence in an unbiased manner. The aim is to generate a library of different peroxisomal PTS2. The 15 nucleotides are assembled by chance. In the DNA synthesis this sequence will either be described as [NNN]5 or [DNK]5. N stands for all four nucleotides mixed, K for either G or T and D for A,G or T. The “DNK” composition prohibits two out of three termination codons. Additionally with this library the"

Completion-Antibiofilm
The circuit produces enzymes to degrade biofilms of Streptococcus mutans.
The circuit will be turned on when the environment is suitable for development of oral biofilms, which is under pH 4.0~5.0.
The signal protein yebF can help to transport the product enzyme from E.coli to its extracellular environment.

Purpose
Streptococcus Mutans will form biofilms, a polymeric conglomeration generally consists of extracellular DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides. Biofilm is known for causing dental plaque, tooth decay and gum infection. Also, biofilm make it hard for our engineered probiotics to capture and kill the streptococcus mutans inside our mouths. Nowadays, the most basic way of removing biofilm is by physical methods such as brushing one's teeth regularly. However, there are many people who are not able to do so themselves, so we wanted to innovate and create a biological method to get rid of biofilms with our engineered probiotics. Therefore, we are going to design a circuit that produce several enzymes to destroy biofilm structure.
Background
Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) is important in the formation of biofilm. The EPS matrix consists of polysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids. The dense extracellular matrix of the biofilms and the outer layer of cells protect the interior of the community, and in some cases, even increase antibiotic resistance. Even though the biofilm seem to be robust, we found that enzymatic degradation is able to weaken the biofilm structure.
As mentioned before, we are going to use antibiofilm enzyme as our tool. According to 2012 INSA-Lyon and HIT-Harbin iGEM teams, we decided to use lysostaphin as our ideal enzyme. Lysost"

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," trial within university. We let the project step out from our discipline. We held a cross-discipline seminar delivering lectures on cutting-edge scientific discovery related to synthetic biology and introduced our project, through which we harvest massive creative ideas and comments. Click to see in detail.
Figure 2: Seminar on campus
    Then we made our way to the public. Before it, under the guidance of biotechnological company’s planning staff, we got fully prepared by making related resources including exhibition boards, leaflets, souvenir stickers and postcards ready. What’s more, to make the activity more interactive and engaging, we took fully advantage of our visualization tool, the two games derived from project idea and modeling results. We optimized their function under the guidance of professional game designers from ‘Perfect World’. Click to see in detail.
Figure 3: A visit to Perfect World
    Finally, we made a hit at China Science and Technology Museum by holding a workshop named “Deciphering Life” that targets both adults and children. We propagated synthetic biology to adults by displaying exhibition and delivering explanation. For children, we had playful workshop activities including engaging art design, DNA model building and web game section with the hope to inspire their affection towards science and research. We got precious feedback from different groups. Staffs from the museum reminded us about the rigorous nature of science and we should balance between rigorousness and joyfulness when we choose the methodology in our activity. We were also inspired by children for more possibility in considering the influence of spatial factors on population interactions that may be helpful for our future work. Click to see in detail.
Figure 4: Exhibition at CSTM
    On campus, we also discussed our project with professors in the field of microbial biology. We finally confirmed three characters (farmer, warrior and beggar) for our project together. We especially want to express our appreciation for Professor Xie and Wang who provided us lots of advice in introducing and completing the character beggar whose prototype in nature is “cheater”.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

In the procedure of modern industrial fermentation, the tiny fluctuation of pH will tremendously influence the physiological function of bacteria. For example, it will affect the growth activity of cells and subsequently decrease the yield of desired production. People usually solve this problem by adding alkali or acid straightly into the bacteria solution and keep an immobilized pH in a narrow range. Our project will show you a completely new idea about how to create a suitable environment and keep the intracellular pH homeostasis for the engineered bacteria by themselves.
The main application field of our project will be the industrial fermentation. The products from industrial fermentation are widely used in our daily life. A large proportion of food and medicine come from this field. So, the safety of our project is of vital importance and it’s our duty to explain any questions concerning safety.
If you ask us whether our project is safe or not, we will say yes and it won’t do any harm to humans and the environment. The main reason is that we don’t use anything dangerous in our whole project, from the sequences of our genes to the chassis we used. For the acid and alkali producing genes, we have built a simple library to avoid producing something harmful. In the future, we are willing to expand the range of the chassis, like the Pichia pastoris which is a recognized safe chassis."

UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the exhibition was a series of talks, the Leonardo Art Science Evening Rendezvous (LASER). This talk featured a number of artists who explore the relationship between science and art. Among them was filmmaker Mary Tsang, who recently released DIYSECT, a documentary on DIY Biology and the influence that it had on the scientific and artistic community. In her talk, she mentioned that a number of community Biology laboratories had been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding their responsibility to remain vigilant of the possibility of individuals misusing synthetic biology to cause harm and damage.
This was a stark reminder that while all of us participating in iGEM seek to use synthetic biology to create beneficial technologies, it does have the potential to raise threats and cause serious harm. As a team, we discussed this in depth over the next few weeks and came to an agreement that as synthetic biologists, we do have a responsibility to be aware of what happens in our field. We felt that there is no need to treat our fellow synthetic biologists with suspicion, as the tone of the FBI appeared to recommend. However, we agreed with the fact that we have an obligation to not only conduct our own projects and experiments ethically, but to ensure that others in our field do so as well.

These will need to be sequence to confirm they are the parts we believe them to be.
Thursday
Today Team Justin determined if the assembly of R0010 (placI-rbs) and IC346007 (Agn43) was successful. Note: Boris did this assembly 07/20/11, see team 1 book for details. Plates that were transformed with parts do have white colonies :). These white colonies were selected and colony PCR was performed using the Prefix and Suffix primers.
Friday
Samples from colony PCR (yesterday) were ran on a 1% agarose gel. Amplification was successful! However, no inserts of right size are present.
Week 13 (July 25-31)
Monday
Assemble K331035-K331033 and R0010-luma-dT
First what happened is the BioBricks were restricted out of the plasmids. Then to determine the concentration of DNA after the restrictions a 1% agarose gel was ran.
The team has made so much progress, we are all very excited for Indianapolis! We had such a successful team meeting:) GO TEAM!
Tuesday
Determine DNA concentration of J04500, K331033, K331035, and lumazine synthase dt. Team JV (Justin and Mr. Vigar) concluded that DNA concentration was too low for the spectrophotometer to read. However, the DNA was still assembled and transformed (by Ben).
Then K331033 was ligated with K331035, and J04500 with lumazine-dt. Constructs were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells
Wednesday
Colonies were counted from yesterdays transformation. Both constructs resulted in white colonies --> We'll perform colony PCR on these samples see July 27, 2011
Week 14 (August 1-7)
Tuesday
First day in a three day experiment to isolate enhanced lumazine synthase from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Set up overnight culture, checked plasmids, made buffers.
Wednesday
Second day, lumazine synthase is overexpressed. Open cells and run SDS-PAGE gel. Purification of lumazine synthase.
Saturday
Concentrated lumazine synthase. SDS-PAGE done to confirm this.

1.Initiated the first iGEM meet up in Shaanxi Province.
At present, there are three official iGEM teams in Shaanxi Province: NPU-China (our team), XJTU-China, NWU-China.     Having been communicating with XJTU-China and NWU-China on WeChat in the past few months, we felt prodigiously more     and more eager to get together and hold a meetup as time went by. After a month of discussion, at the beginning of     the summer vacation, we three teams jointly held the first iGEM meet up in Shaanxi Province. During the meeting,     the three teams took turns to showcase their projects this year and had further exchange and discussion on team     building. We shared the problems encountered during the project and collectively strived to solve them. The results     of this meetup are as follows:
label We have encountered difficulties in implementing DNA time capsule activities.     XJTU-China expressed their willingness to help us contact Mawu Primary School in Xi’an to enable our DNA time     capsule activity to be carried out smoothly.

Integration
To integrate a construct into the genome it is necessary to find suitable integration sites. Here for there are big differences and several factors to consider. The most basic aspect is that a non-coding sequence is necessary, so no possibly essential genes are disrupted. Secondly it is imported to consider that integration sites vary in their transcription levels for multiple reasons (Bryant et al., 2014) .
Choosing an Integration site
We searched manually for integration sites with low gene expression, which usually are between two terminators, because it was shown that there appears less readthrough. Another criterion was that there is more than 1000 bp non-coding space. Because we only could detect two places on the chromosome. To bypass screening through the genome manually, which is time consuming and less flexible if the search is repeated with different parameters, we created a Mathlab program script. With this we tried to find regions in the chromosomes of <i>V. natriegens</i> with opposing transcription units and at least 500 bp between adjacent CDS. In order for the Mathlab program to work we imported <i>V. natriegens’</i> two chromosomes, both as .gb and. fasta. The .gb file is used to get information about the location and orientation of all CDS in the genome. Using if-statements, we are able to identify regions that fulfill both required conditions: opposing CDS and an intergenic region larger than 500 bp. This resulted in 24 integration sites, of which 7 were not suitable because they had essential tRNA coding regions which were not detected by the Mathlab program.

We then sought values for pCI. Measurements 2009 iGEM NYMU-Taipei measured the pLux promoter relative to pCI, which allows us to calculate the PoPS for pCI: $\frac{1}{0.43} {\cdot} 0.00169=0.0394$ PoPS. Their resulst of pPen were not consistent and the team mentioned they lacked experience in the beginning. Results of the earlier used pCI and pLux were consistent though. This is why we only used their last results and  took the mean of pPen compared to pTet: $(0.801 {\cdot} 0.537 + 0,191) {\cdot} {\frac{1}{2}}=0.3106$. Using this mean value we were able to calculate the PoPS: $0.3106 {\cdot} 0.0394=0.01224$.
These values all depend on measuring activities and since the strains, media and antibiotic markers won’t be completely the same, the real values will diverge from the values found with these simple calculations. These values can give us an idea about the relative strength of the different promoters. We could gather the real values of mRNA concentration in our cells by executing a qPCR but for now we will use the found values for our model.
The last important parameter for transcription is the copy number in which the genes are present in the cell. The plasmid that incorporates the used genes, has an ORI with a copy number between 100 and 300. In our model we will use a copy number of 200.
3.2 Translation
The next step in gene expression is the translation of the synthesized mRNA to a protein. This involves the binding of a ribosome complex to the RBS site of the mRNA, elongation and termination. The initiation step is the rate-limiting step of the three. The translation rate is thus tied to the thermodynamics of RBS-ribosome interaction but other sequences (5’-UTR, Shine-Delgarno,repeats, internal startcodons) and possible secondary structures (hairpins) also play a role (Chiam Yu Ng, Salis). (Fong) Salis et al have developed an algorithm to predict the translation initiation rate based upon thermodynamic calculations. This algorithm is used in the Ribosome Binding Site Calculator (https://salislab.net/software/ , Boruj"
Imperial_College_London,2009,Team:Imperial College London#M2_-_-_TEXT.html," endogenous acid resistance pathways, colonisation of the gut is based on a ""numbers approach"". In essence, the majority of E.coli cells in a population do not survive passage through the stomach but the few that do are able to regenerate the population once in the intestine.
This point is illustrated one of our experiments shown by the image on the left. In this experiment, constitutive GFP producing E.coli cells were exposed to differing concentrations of acid for 30 minutes. The reduction in fluoresence is indicative of cell lysis and the subsequent acid-induced denaturing of GFP.
This experiment indicates that if we are to deliver a significant dose of a given polypeptide therapeutic past the stomach, it will be necessary to boost the natural acid resistance of E.coli.
Phase 2: Boosting Acid Resistance
By 'hacking' E.coli’s endogenous acid resistance pathways in three places we induced the formation of a safe colanic acid microcapsule that protects against the harsh acidic conditions of the stomach [1]. Without encapsulation, our polypeptides would be denatured and degraded by stomach acid and digestive proteases respectively.
Module 2: The Triple Hack
Acid Resistant Polymer – Colanic acid:
E.coli naturally produces a harmless acid–resistant polymer known as colanic acid. Colanic acid is a polymer of glucose, galactose and glucuronic acid [2]. By tapping into the pathway that initiates colanic acid biosynthesis, we can turn on its production via the modulation of a transcription factor encoded by a gene called RcsB [3] ( BBa_K200000 ).
 About RcsB
Safety  – Biofilm prevention:
In nature, colanic acid acts as a binding agent between individual cells over which a biofilm can be formed. While colanic acid itself is harmless, biofilm formation is associated with a number of virulence factors. To prevent biofilm formation from occurring, we have tapped into a second pathway such that our cells become locked into colanic acid production. The gene responsible for preventing biofilm formation is a transcription factor encoded by a gene called YgiV [4] ( BBa_K200002 ).
  About YgiV
Microencapsulation – Colanic acid tethering:
In nature, colanic acid is associated with but not attached to the cell surface. To facilitate whole cell encapsulation, we have modified a third pathway to fix the colanic acid to the surface of the cell. This involves the over–production of an enzyme called Rfal [5] ( BBa_K200003 ).

This AHL-LuxR quorum sensing mechanism is one of the most well known gram-negative quorum sensing pathways, and it can be engineered to affect almost any coding sequence we like.
For the project, we have developed a reporter cell that expresses GFP in the presence of the QS signaling molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHL).  Our test cells (which act as a simulation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) express lactonase, which breaks down AHL.  In our experimental system, test cells should signify their presence by breaking down AHL and preventing GFP expression in reporter cells.
Experiment: Process and Results
There are many ways of utilizing quorum sensing for medicinal use, and one of the most intuitive and most well-known methods is quorum quenching.
Quorum quenching takes advantage of the fact that quorum sensing also plays a role in  expressing virulence, and interferes with the quorum sensing that produces virulence. There are many ways of utilizing quorum sensing for medicinal use, and one of the most intuitive and most well-known methods is quorum quenching. Quorum quenching takes advantage of the fact that quorum sensing also plays a role in expressing virulence, and interferes with the quorum sensing that produces virulence. However, for our project this year, we decided to focus on engineering a detection method for antibiotic resistance. For the project, we created a test plasmid and a reporter plasmid.  We then transformed competent E. coli with the plasmids to produce a test cell and a reporter cell.  As shown in the picture below, the test cell produces lactonase, which breaks down AHL, a common auto-inducer in gram-negative bacteria.  And the reporter cell produces GFP (or luciferase) which creates a visible difference that we can detect. Both plasmids were engineered using the BioBrick DNA recombination process.  With such a set up, it will be possible to detect the presence of the test cell, or lactonase.
For the confirmation of our hypothesis, we conducted some experiments. Ideally, mixing AHL with the test cell will break down the AHL. And, adding the solution to reporter after that will not result in any fluorescence. But, if we do the same process with the control bacteria instead of the test cell, there will be fluorescence. As theorized, the control experiments produced fluorescence, but the experiments with the test cell produced no  fluorescence. which means  (no breakdown of signaling molecule should occur).

Next time we can try a higher 3-AT concentration, but since we expect Zif268 to bind strongly this might just be what you get.
NM+his+IPTG: IPTG more or less killed the pSR01 cells but not the selection strain. This may be caused by too many zinc fingers being expressed, so we may want to try less IPTG.

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots,"
