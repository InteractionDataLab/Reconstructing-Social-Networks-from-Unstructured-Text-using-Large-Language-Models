Since the PyeaR promoter is presence in wild type E. coli. strain, it should be functioning in our engineered probiotic E. coli strain. Moreover, this engineered probiotic might detect the inflammatory signal, NO, in the host intestinal tract.

2 Transport and Production
At the beginning of the experiment, we directly constructed the plasmids of YebF-IL10 and YebF-myrosinase, but the effect of extracellular detection was not good. During the participation in CCiC, iGEMer suggested that we should first try to test the performance of the secretory tag YebF, so we constructed the plasmid YebF-GFP shown in Figure 5A. To express IL10 and myrosinase, we constructed plasmids IL10-Flag and myrosinase-His as shown in Figure 5B and Figure 5C.
Figure 5. Production module construction. A, the construction of our YebF-GFP using strong promoter. J23110, a strong constitutive promoter. YebF-GFP, GFP with secretion tag. B, the construction of IL10 production module. IL10-Flag, human interleukin 10 with Flag tag. C, the construction of myrosinase production module. Myrosinase-his, our transferase with His tag.
According to previous works, the secretory tag YebF has been demonstrated as the functioning part in E.coli [2]，thus, we chose this tag for further experiment.
When testing the validity of the secretory tag YebF, we transformed the constructed YebF-GFP plasmid into DH5α and cultured overnight at 37 ℃. The bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m for 5 min and the supernatant was taken for fluorescence detection. The result is shown in Figure 6.  From our data, the YebF based secretory part worked efficiently.

Next, we transformed the human IL10-Flag plasmid (Fig 5B) into BL21, incubated at 37 ℃ overnight and then diluted to OD600 = 0.2. After 2 h of growth at 37 ℃, IPTG was added to induce IL10 expression at"

Zünftiger Jubel in Boston: Beim Finale des studentischen Bioingenieur-Wettbewerbs iGEM hat das Team München den Gesamtsieg in der Kategorie „Overgraduate“ abgeräumt. Das Doppelteam von TU München und Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) konnte mit einem 3D-Zelldrucker und passender Bio-Tinte die Fachjury am deutlichsten überzeugen. Mehr als 300 Hochschulteams aus aller Welt hatten beim „Giant Jamboree“ ihre Projekte zur Synthetischen Biologie präsentiert. Die deutschen Teams kehren mit reichlich Medaillen und Titeln von dem Megaevent an der US-Ostküste zurück: Für die 13 hiesigen Teams gab es fünfmal Gold, sechsmal Silber und zweimal Bronze. Das Team Hamburg sahnte zudem den begehrten „iGEMers Prize“ ab, der von den Teilnehmern vergeben wird.
Damit geht die begehrte iGEM-Trophäe, der silberne Riesen-Legostein, wieder einmal nach Deutschland. In den vergangenen Jahren war insbesondere Team Heidelberg mit dem Double 2013 und 2014 bei der Bio-Konstrukteurs-WM in Boston das Maß der Dinge gewesen, in diesem Jahr waren die Badener jedoch nicht angetreten. Team München überzeugte in der Ü23-Kategorie diesmal auf ganzer Linie. Die Studierenden, traditionell mit Dirndl und Lederhosen auf der Bühne, hatten für einen 3D-Drucker eine neuartige Biotech-Tinte (biotINK) aus Zellen kreiert. Dank einer raffinierten molekularen Klebetechnik gelingt es damit, einfache Gewebestrukturen auf Oberflächen zu drucken.
Mit ihrem Projekt verwiesen die Münchener die enorme Konkurrenz auf die Plätze. Auf Rang zwei in der Gesamtwertung von iGEM landete das Team der Uni Wageningen mit einem Bienenschutzmittel gegen die Varroa-Milbe. Neben einer Goldmedaille heimste das TUM-LMU-Team auch noch Extra-Titel für „Best Hardware“, „Best Software“ und das „Best"

As a pioneer company, they differ from competitors by offering cost-efficient wastewater solutions. They showed interest in Biotic Blue since we pursue the same objective: to remove harmful organic compounds from the aquatic environment. They were unsure about our enzyme choice considering the target antibiotic. However, they would be interested in our approach if the long-term results show enough evidence.

Results
We used standard restriction digest cloning to clone our five biobrick constructs. We sequence verified all our parts and submitted them to the registry.  Here is a diagram of all of our sequence verified parts.
Fig 2:Schematic of our honeybee silk constructs
From top to bottom they are the honeybee silk coding region, the coding region under control of lac promoter, the silk protein fused to Spycatcher, the coding region under control of a T7 promoter, and silk protein fused to sfGFP.  We also successfully made competent BL21 (DE3) cells using the Zymo mix and go chemical competency kit. We performed a competency test and we determined that the competency of our cells was 3e7 colony forming units / microgram of DNA. ( Parts )   Finally, we were able to express our honeybee silk proteins and confirm its presence through SDS PAGE.
Fig 3:SDS PAGE optimization image
We also obtained some rough estimate of protein yield by doing a BCA protein assay. This estimate may not be entirely reliable because we observed some contaminating bands on our SDS PAGE gels, indicating that there are proteins other than honeybee silk in the solution. From our BCA assay, we determined that we got around 12 mg of protein from a 300ml overnight cell culture.

Unfortunately, the copy of this part that is maintained by the registry does not pass the quality control standards.  The sequencing of the part does not align properly to the presumed sequence submitted and the gel-cut results using the RFC[10] sites are not as expected.  While unfavorable to our iGEM team, this information was much appreciated as it allowed us to move forward without trying to figure out why cloning with Cph8 wasn’t working.
We then contacted Dr. Chris Voight at UCSF, whose lab had originally constructed Cph8, to request the DNA coding sequence in non-biobrick form.   Adding Cph8 to our construct required working around the PstI cutsite in the coding region, adding a biobrick prefix and suffix via PCR, and cloning Cph8 into a vector without using PstI.  Essentially, we used ad-hoc genetic engineering to continue building our construct, which in retrospect was a poor decision that held back our progress significantly.
As a team we decided that we would not want anyone else to have the same experience working with Cph8 as we had and realized that it was our responsibility to correct Cph8 and replace it in the registry.  While we had not succeeded on this front as of the deadline for iGEM 2009 DNA submission to the registry, we plan to carry out site-directed mutagenesis and resubmit the part in the near-future.
Current Design
The Registry of Standard Biological Parts currently has a barebones means of user-review for biobricks in the registry.  However, its presence is easy to miss, as the only evidence of it appears at the very bottom of the biobrick main page and consists solely of a “sample” review box.
Though the sample review box appears to be useful upon initial inspection, clicking on the image brings the user to the “Experience” page, wherein there resides nothing that even remotely resembles the “sample” image that leads the user there to begin with.  Furthermore, neither the main biobrick page nor the “Experience” page provides any type of interactive user-interface that would even slightly entice the user to submit a review.  In fact, if the user does want to submit any sort of review on the biobrick, they must enter their review in the same wiki text box that is used to edit content pages and the user must also include all appropriate code for formatting, for which there is no immediately apparent and available template.

Professor Dimitrios Kekos, at the School of Chemical Engineering of NTUA, was our secondary PI and assisted us in the brainstorming phase. He also supported us in the fundraising process.
Brainstorming & Initial Ideas Support
During the first months, right after the creation of the team, we struggled long for finding an inspiring subject for our project, one that would be feasible, novel and impactful. Through this period we met and discussed with Professor Gerasimos Lyberatos of the School of Chemical Engineering in NTUA, Assistant Professor Leonidas Alexopoulos of the School of Mechanical Engineering in NTUA and Professor Emeritus Fragkiskos Kolisis of the School of Chemical Engineering in NTUA. Each one helped us in finding our path, by assessing our ideas and suggesting alternatives.
Many thanks to our friends and former members of this team, Theodore Bechlivanis and Antigoni                         Koukouvaou , for their productive thoughts, their help in finding the weak points in our initial ideas and for making the first fundraising contacts.

In this way we hope to evoke their passion to biological science, passing on knowledge and enthusiasm to them, which might encourage them to work hard and try to make innonations in this field in the future.
It seemed that they were very interested in our project and synthetic biology. Some of them asked questions about our project about the details and others communicated a lot with our team members after the lecture. We were glad to share our ideas and experiences with them. We wish they could improve their knowledge and ability during their courses and maybe next year, they will take part in the iGEM competition for themselves.

European Meetup at TU Delft
On the 7th and 8th of July, our team participated to the European iGEM Meetup in Delft.  The early presentations opened our mind to a lot of issues mainly about integrated human practices and the possibilities offered by bioinformatics to support the synthetic biology work.  We also had the opportunity to practice the poster session by introducing our project to the other teams. We shared a lot of feedbacks about projects, poster tips, suggestions about experiments, encouragements for the wet lab work and best luck for the clonings.  We truly had the feeling to establish beneficial dialogues with the other teams in order to do our best for the giant competition.
It was also a way to meet our interlocutors for collaborations and to build ephemera collaborations or longer collaborations to challenge other iGEMers for a Volley Ball play.  Indeed, this meetup was also a multicultural and socializing event. Teams coming from all corners of Europe were there. We shared our experience of the 2017 competition: the ""goods"" and the ""bads"" and learned to know each other through diversity.  The meetup ended with a tour in Delft. We discovered a city, between lands and canals and its historical attractions. This moment shared with our iGEM fellows had its own importance making us practice observation, curiosity and sensitivity which are the best allies for young scientists.
As final teaching from our expedition to Delft: gnothi seauton or know thyself. As the team just started lab adventure, this event allows to improve the cohesion and the complicity between three members of our team during a 22 hours bus trip to Netherlands and a 22 hours trip back to Toulouse. What an experience!
3rd Parisian Meetup
On the 21th of July, the Pasteur Team organized an event to meet other French teams. We had the opportunity for the first time to introduce our project in front of a judging panel and to discover other teams’ projects. It was a rewarding experience to have the point of view of other iGEMers and interesting reviews from scientists. At the Parisian Meetup, judges were here to point out problems in our mock-up Jamboree presentations, but it revealed itself useful to improve our general communication. Here are some examples of the feedback we received and the conclusions we made:

Result for characterization:
The new plasmid pcrRNA.bbsI-7-ccdb was assembled and tested by colony PCR and sequencing.
The split T7 RNA polymerase was characterized under blue light according to Protocol 13
The result showed that the split T7 RNA polymerase did not work, we held a troubleshooting for that with our advisors and instructors, wanting to figure out the problems and solutions.

After finishing assembling pSR43.6-ccaS# series, they were transformed into E. coli TOP10 along with pHZ, and the ccaS-ccaR two-component system was characterized again according to Protocol 11 .
Finally pSR43.6-ccaS#-crRNA series were born through Gibson assembly.
we wondered if there was something wrong with PT7 and split RNA polymerase, so pET28a(DE3) was applied to test whether pT7 could work properly, and we did SDS-PAGE to detect the expression of proteins. But pT7 worked properly.
Week 18 (August 29th to September 7th) ▲ back
pHZJ23ccdAB series were assembled by PCR and Gibson assembly. pSR43.6-ccaS#-crRNA and pHZphbc were characterized by measuring the production of PHB according to Protocol 14 .
Blue light components were inserted into a high-copy plasmid backbone with high GFP expression, and this system was tested again under blue light according to Protocol 13 .
We couldn’t figure out the problem of this system and we decided to stop experiment on blue light component due to the limitation of time.

They explained their strategy: the techno-economic analysis team sets a price point (or carbon emission) goal for an overall process, and then they develop a computational model to establish the thresholds that individual project teams must meet to achieve that goal.  They encouraged us to set goals based on maximum lab yields and standard industrial operations costs and adjust from there.
Taking Dr. Konda and Dr. Neupane’s advice, we decided to develop a vision of our end goal: if we were going to compete with natural latex, priced at less than $1 per gallon, then we would surely need to operate on a massive industrial scale.  We set up a meeting with Jeff Davis, Head of Operations and Engineering for US Biologics Process Development at Genentech. I (Amy) asked him if he could help me predict, based on gross assumptions about the scale-up process, what we would need to run an industrial-scale latex bio-manufacturing facility and what price we might expect to set for our latex.  He told me that a facility supporting 2,000L fermenters would likely cost around $200 million, while a facility supporting 25,000L fermenters would cost around $1 billion.  He helped me develop a back-of-the-envelope estimate: a 25,000L bioreactor facility operating at full capacity could probably produce our polymer at close to $2-5 per gram.  This would be far outside our goal price of $1 per gallon.  (This estimate was, of course, based on experience with pharmaceutical production, which involves a more complicated series of testing and purification steps.  Even so, we took this into account to produce a more generous estimate.)
Even at this massive scale, it is unclear that our latex production would be environmentally friendly as compared to traditional farming.  Genentech uses a huge amount of water: judging by their 2015 corporate sustainability letter, their water usage is equivalent to that for roughly 10% of households in San Francisco County.23 Of course, Genentech has a massive facility that produces large amounts of pharmaceuticals, and based on my conversation with Mr. Davis, the same processes that ensure the purity (and safety) of pharmaceuticals seem to be some of the most water-intensive.  (One can tell, too, from the corporate sustainability letter, that Genentech takes water usage goals seriously.)  However, in the case of materials manufacturing, for which environmental sustainability would be an intended selling point, this level of water consumption might not be justifiable.
Finally, we met with"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Interviews#Policy Ethics Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM Human  Practices. Dr. Kuiken also works closely with community biolabs to ensure safety  protocols are followed within these labs, which aligns with our own work with the local  community biolab, Charlottesville Open Bio Labs, to create safety guidelines for them to  follow.
We first asked Dr. Kuiken about New Directions: the Ethics of Synthetic Biology  and Emerging Technologies and his opinion on the recommendations made in the  report. Dr. Kuiken said the recommendations were good, but there was no real authority  to ensure the recommendations were followed so many, if not all of them, were never  implemented. Therefore, it left open the question of who would claim responsibility in a  synthetic biology accident. Dr. Kuiken believes the more foresight you have in the  matter, the better. This led us to consider how we, as an iGEM team, could influence  policy and patch the gap in safety, so we decided to try our hand composing a policy  proposal to address regulatory agency authority on biocontainment. Dr. Kuiken  recommended we start by talking to the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
We then talked to Dr. Kuiken about his work with community biolabs. Dr. Kuiken  told us how community biolabs on DIYbio.org have an agreed upon set of safety  principles and how he works to ensure people in these labs are properly trained in safety  protocols. Additionally, DIYbio.org has a biosafety portal where a panel of biosafety  professionals review and respond to any safety quesitons you may have. We explained  how we were working with Charlottesville Open Bio Labs to rewrite their lab safety  guidelines and asked for advice on what areas of safety to emphasize more heavily  when it comes to community biolabs. Dr. Kuiken said community biolabs are often  limited by the safety equipment they have. For instance, fume hoods are costly, both in  terms of money and space, so labs often go without one. This exposes researchers to  noxious chemicals and poses health risks to everyone in the lab. Thus, we added a  section to our safety guidelines that explains alternative methods for achieving  comparable results with cheaper equipment.
In summary, Dr. Kuiken gave us great insight to both the New Directions: the  Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies report and community biolabs.  He helped shape our Human Practices by pointing out areas that needed policy change,  resulting in the development of a biocontainment policy"

        She said,” The sensibility is relatively high but the specificity is also important because there may be a variety of metal ions in the actual water samples. If the sensor responds in the presence of other metal ions, it will bring deviation to the experimental results. So it is necessary to repeat the specificity experiment of sensors to verify the correctness of the data from papers.”

        Our questionnaire also included part of the public acceptance of engineering bacteria.
The Public Acceptance of Engineering Bacteria
        Laying stress on the drinking water safety, 94% of respondents said they were willing to use convenient testing tools to detect heavy metals concentration in nearby water source.
        In “how do you think of genetically modified bacteria (non pathogenicity) used to detect contaminants”, 92% of respondents accepted and supported these applications.
        But there were still a few respondents who were not able to accept biological methods, mainly because of the existence of biological safety problems. Therefor we invited Professor Zhaozheng Guo from BGI to come to school and set up a lecture on biological safety ethics, hoping to improve public acceptance of bioassay.
        The problems above showed that cheap, fast and portable biological methods for detecting heavy metals in water or soil were of great interest to the public and small and medium-sized factories.

Sensing h.p.
In this section, we aim to use our gene parts for making E. Coli, sensing H. Pylori’s existence and activating a pathogen-killer system, after it gets into the mucus layer. Targeting this pathogen will be provided by sensing Auto-inducer 2 (AI-2) and ammonia (NH3), both secreted from H. Pylori. AI-2 will be sensed by Lsr operon system and NH3 will be sensed by TnrA-pAlsT regulation system. Getting only one result of these two systems when they are sensed seperatley, is provided by Toehold-Triger RNA system. The output of this system, which works in the existence of these two molecules, is an endonuclease called TEV protease. Produced TEV protease will activate the antimicrobial peptide Pexiganan after this molecule synthesized in an inactive form and accumulated in cell. Activated Pexiganan molecules are expected to leave the cell, become free and kill H. Pylori.
Background
Helicobacter Pylori Sensing:
Helicobacter pylori lives in stomach, by connecting to epithelium cells under the mucus layer.This bacteria releases some molecules around which comes from its metabolic waste. Two of these molecules are Auto-inducer 2 and ammonia.
Ammonia (NH3)
H. pylori  synthesizes urease to buffer the pH of its microenvironment within the stomach. H. pylori dedicates several genes to the biosynthesis of its cytosolic urease, a Ni2+-containing enzyme which hydrolyses urea into NH3 and CO2. Bacteria has urea channel which is regulated positively by protons, opening at acidic pH values to allow more"

Overview of Human practice
 
Investigate current detection methods
On Sept. 30, students in charge of the human practice section of the BFSUICC-China team followed the instructor to visit a professor of water pollution research at China Forestry University. We came to Forestry University for several reasons:
1. Because our project is to detect copper pollution and there will be some copper in the water, so we also pay attention to who this aspect, so we also came to visit professors in the university.
2. We still have problems in the application of our project, so we came to the school to consult professors.
 
Professor just started telling us about some copper standards in water and helped us collect some international and domestic standards. The professor also talked about standards for different waters, different sources of water, and different regions, such as Northwest China, which requires higher rainfall than southern China, and South China, which requires much more rainfall than northwest China, because copper concentration is higher after the water evaporates, so northwest China. The requirement is higher than that of the south. The professor also talked about the standard of water application in different aspects, as well as some processing processes. For example, the discharge of industrial wastewater, as well as the preparation before discharge, such as reducing the amount of copper in the water to what standard, in the sewage treatment plant into the next stage of treatment, and finally discharged. China still has high demands on this aspect.
 
 
In addition, the professor showed us their instrument for measuring copper content, which was very expensive and very large, and the residues were discharged from a pipe into the air. The professor suggested that we could apply our project in this direction, such as a kit or test paper because the test paper and test kit would be cheaper and more portable, and he gave us an example, such as measuring the copper content in the water when the tester could drop water into it. On the kit or test paper and then observe the colour changes of the test paper and test kit because this is also the way our project measures the copper content in water. This greatly reduces unnecessary trouble.

Separation of linear DNA from circular DNA:
Figure 1 shows the image of the gel where the linearized DNA was separated from the circular DNA. The linearized DNA is approximately 2 kb. The linearized DNA fragment was then cut out from the gel and stored in eppendorf tube.
Note! Due to UV-light exposure, the DNA may mutate. In this case, this may affect the later steps of our project. The worse scenario, mutation of anti-luxS. Hence our CSRPRi system may not recognize luxS in the bacteria. Biofilm production will not be inhibited…
Determine the DNA concentration and purity:
Table 1 shows the results of the linear pgRNA (2) from PCR (probably with anti-luxS gene).

From the 260/230 ratio, the sample has a relatively a small amount of nucleic acids. Probably, it is contaminated by the agarose from the gel electrophoresis. On the other hand, the 260/280 ratio is ok, indicating that the sample contains a relatively larger amount of RNA than DNA. InterLab – transformation of plasmids to competent cells:

Project Description
Our project aims to produce a group of BioBricks organised into three modules; one each for Red, Green and Blue ( RGB ) light. To demonstrate the system we will control the production of Cyan, Magenta and Yellow pigments, but we will also be inputting a system where future teams could have any gene as their ""output"" gene. We are using the CMY pigments, but you could potentially use the RGB light to control the transcription of anything.
The ultimate aim of our project is to use ( CMY ) pigments to produce the world's first colour bio-photograph or coliroid .
We will be building upon the work done by previous iGEM teams, most notably Texas/Austin 2004, Edinburgh 2010 and Uppsala 2011.
If you would like to see any of our initial brainstorming - please feel free to follow this link ( Brainstorming )
The Camera
Bio-Photography is the application of genetically engineered bacteria to act as the light sensor of a camera, replacing digital sensors ( CCD/CMOS ) or photographic film. The surface area of bacteria is on the order of microns, much smaller than a digital sensor, giving bio-cameras the potential to produce images with far greater resolution than current digital photography offers.
We aim to produce the world's first colour bio-photograph by producing Cyan, Magenta and Yellow pigments in response to Red, Green and Blue light. We plan to combine this system with a lens to focus the image onto plated bacteria to form the world's first colour bio-camera.
Colour system
To produce the full colour spectrum requires all three primary colours . This is because any colour can be produced by mixing the primary colours but primary colours cannot be produced by mixing any colours.
In our system we are using two sets of primary colours. Red, Green and Blue for light and Cyan, Magenta and Yellow for pigments. This is because light and pigment mix differently; light is additive and pigment is subtractive:
Light and pigment produce colour"

Add 5.7549 g of CsCl to 6 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.7 g/ml density gradient.
Layer the gradient into two centrifuge tubes, using half of the total volume created for each tube.  For example, add 2 mL of 1.3 density to one tube and the other 2 mL to another tube.
Add 4 mL of mutant phage to the top of the gradient in both tubes
Fill the remaining space in the tube with phage suspension buffer to the top.
Centrifuge at 26500 rpms (100,000 g) for 2.5 hours.
Extract using a needle and puncturing the side of the tube, placing the needle at the bottom of the tube.
Extract about 2 mL of phage at a time. Add about 1.5 to one eppendorf.
When the needle is removed place another eppendorf under the hole to catch any leaking phage and fill it with the remainder of the phage in the needle.
V) Results
The mutant phage had the strongest band that we have ever seen at the wild type location between 1.5019 and 1.5025 There was also a smaller band at 1.5003. These results are very exciting and infer that there should be a large amount of mutant phage.

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," C3 concentration in sample 2, possibly a different concentration than seen in sample 1 as the microglia are not grown in medium specific to them.
Results:
The calibration curve is close to linearity with an R2 value >0.99, meaning that the extrapolated results, such as the unknown protein concentration, are statistically reliable.
The results show a high concentration of C3 in samples 1 and 2. There is no significant difference in C3 concentration between these two samples.
Conversely, a low C3 concentration were found in negative control 1 and 2.  There is a small increase in C3 in sample 2 over sample 1.
Figure 5: MCM from BV2 cells induces secretion of TNF-α, C1q , and IL1-α that cause to upregulation of C3 in reactive astrocytes. To confirm this, C3 protein levels were quantified in supernatants using ELISA.
Discussion:
This is the first attempt at activating astrocytes and was performed with LPS added to microglia medium. The purpose of this experiment was initial examination of the reactivity level of C8D30 astrocyte cell line.
The results agree with our expectations. The C3 concentration is lower in the negative controls as opposed to the astrocytes which were activated. These results indicate that the astrocytes were indeed activated and that we can create two experimental groups – resting and reactive astrocytes.
We must note that the negative controls contained a low concentration of C3, possibly because astrocytes secrete a certain amount of C3 when in a resting state. The difference in C3 concentration displayed in the negative controls does not concur with our expectations. We expected there to be no difference LPS (rather than cytokines) is not supposed to activate astrocytes, and therefore the C3 concentrations should be low and similar in both negative controls. However, this can be explained by the lack of biological repetitions. As only one biological repetition was performed for the negative controls, we can not be sure there was indeed a significant difference in concentration between them.
Experiment Weaknesses:
We are missing a negative control of astrocytes grown in their medium with no treatment. Without this sample we can not make a reliable comparison of C3 between activated and resting astrocytes.
Not enough and unequal biological repetitions for all samples.
Missing additional comparative parameters such as astrocytes activated using commercial cytokines, incubation for different periods of time, etc…
The ELISA kit is very expensive; therefore, we were limited"

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," patches, no growth has previous been observed in Km/Sm liquid cultures.
Amp plates were tested by using two plates – one Amp and the other Blank. On them were plated MT616 and DS plasmid. DS plasmid is Amp resistant, MT616 is not. Results to be seen tomorrow.
Monday, August 16
Missed the exponential phase for the comp cell prep, deferred till tomorrow.
LPS: There was no growth in the Km/Sm liquid cultures but there was growth in the blank cultures.
LPS: Two plates of pFB9010 have been recovered. In order to solve ambiguity, liquid cultures of Km and Sm were inoculated from plate 1 (most used). Also, plates of Km, Sm, Km/Sm were streaked with each of the 5 patches from each of plates 1 and 2 (where plate 2 is Sm only for some reason…although it should be both). This should solve which of the resistances is not functional. Results tomorrow.
Tuesday, August 17
Assembly: Nonodropping of both J23107 and I13507 stocks was performed. Digestion of J23107 with PstI and SpeI was unsuccessful. The 0.8% Agarose gel showed that the plasmid was not cut, since the uncut control beside it yielded the same bands.
Assembly: Digestion of I13507 with PstI and XbaI was successful, although the bands were slightly off as related to the ladder. Suggestion was made that Gene Ladder Plus should be ran as 2uL of solution + 8ul of water. Also, it has ran fast before, so beware. Bands expected are 883 and 2057 (from I13507 in pSB1A2 plasmid). 883 was taken (appeared at around 1000, however), since it is an insert. The bands were gel purified and stored at -20 C.

Results from yesterday were as follow:
Growth from both pFB9010 plates on Km and Sm, but not on Km/Sm.
Liquid cultures showed growth in Km, but not in Sm.
Not sure what this means at the moment, so further tests need to be done.

Our Human Practice managed to change the educational platform for 200 high schools in Denmark!
Our Human Practice pushes Danish high school students a major step towards making their first BioBrick! The project design circumvent controversial rules issued by the Danish Ministry of Education, limiting high school students not to modify plasmids. In collaboration with an elite student organization Biotech Academy, our solution allows ordinary high schools to perform restriction based cloning. The project is already funded for the early development, and the plan is to ship complete experimental kits to 200 high schools in Denmark in early 2016.
Our Human Practice consists of many activities, all with a purpose in relation to the Human Practice Strategy. The “Biosensor” is our main achievement as a strong education tool, and the other activities complemented its maturation. Other aspects of our Human Practice concern also communication, safety and ethics. All of our activities are presented beneath, and we invite to explore our practices.

This is our first regular meeting since we formed our iGEM team.  During this meeting, we introduced ourselves to each other, and learned more about our goal.  Our team consists of sophomore and junior students from different departments.
The first section was given by Jingwei about the general background of iGEM and the specific requirements of the competition.  The techniques that could be used in our experiments were also introduced, and it's lucky to know that we have already learned the fundamental knowledge of these techniques.  After our team leader gave a briefing about the early studies of the research, we had an analysis about the Salmonella we will use in our experiments that have been knocked out of two genes.
Given that we are the first team of our university to take part in the competition, it's essential that we should learn from other teams and use their experience for reference.  Therefore in our second section, we used the teams of Imperial College of London, Shanghai Jiaotong University, University of Washington, and Slovenia University as examples.  All these teams gave us some great ideas.  Firstly, we could innovate from the common phenomenon in daily life, like the team of Imperial College which had their research based on the water absorbency of root hair.  In addition, our ideas could be realized using up-to-date techniques and methods, like the team of Slovenia University which applied many advanced techniques like SRP, EMSA, and FRET to accomplish their goal.  Last but not least, creating a website that is unique and can reflect the process of our thinking and exploring is significant.
In the last section, tasks of literature related reading were assigned to every member.  Although it might be a tough way to go, we are all looking forward to our work ahead.

This is our second regular meeting, one week after the first one.  In the last week, we read some documents concerning the latest researches on cancer therapies using Salmonella, which helped us know better about the characteristics of the bacteria we want to research on.

UCLA,2013,Team:UCLA#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," you know what their decision must have been.  I was eight, too old for any of the rich young couples to want me, so my parents made me take pills reversing the effects of HGH to make me look younger (we could barely afford it but it was my only chance to survive).  Then one day, with my parents crying, people came to our house and whisked me away in their fancy air-conditioned car.  They spoke a strange language that I didn’t understand and dressed me in clothes entirely devoid of color.  When I got there I was given a very simple shot to take care of the malaria.  That shot, in those five seconds, saved my life.  My parents gave me up for that shot, and now I was stuck with the rich.  I was instructed to learn from people who didn’t understand me or know my story.  I lived the rest of my life in a cold, dark, very sterilized world, and now I want to go back.  I want to go back to the lively vibrant culture and familiar people of my childhood.  I want to go back home.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," general knowledge of the students of our university about synthetic biology while “baiting” them with delicious self-made food. We organized a quiz with general questions about microorganisms, genetic engineering and molecular biology where everybody was able to participate.
It was interesting to see that biology seems to be very complicated and incomprehensible to many. Many students who were not familiar with biology at all, often failed at the quiz but then were cheered up with a delicious waffle and every information they asked for. Some terms like amino acids and DNA were not familiar to a bunch of participants, but few were able to put the terms into the right context. However, there were some students who had solid knowledge in synthetic biology - despite studying something else - and were also interested in the iGEM competition itself. We were happy to share our knowledge with them and to draw them under the spell of biology while handing out more waffles. A few other students were already familiar with the iGEM competition itself and visited our booth to find out what this year's topic is about. We were delighted to present our project and were also able to inspire some non-biologists with our idea. All in all, we were able to arouse interest in synthetic biology with our information booth and were able to enjoy a bunch of waffles.
Hopefully we were able to contribute to bringing the wonderful world of synthetic biology to many new people and to take away their fear of this often unknown science.
Radio Interview
The [97.1] Hochschulradio Düsseldorf is a universitarian radio station hosted voluntarily by students of different study fields. Even though there is a lot going on at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences the station only has seldomly the chance to welcome guests with a scientific background which is why they were very happy to invite us. Our team members Salima and Carina were interviewed by Cigdem Ünlü on June 18 at their radio station.
Our goal was to change their problem, introduce iGEM to a bunch of folks who listen to the station and advertise the upcoming talks of our lecture series.
When we entered the station we were quite surprised: It’s located in a normal apartment in a big residential block for students. After we were greeted we began right away with asking a lot of questions since we were pretty nervous: Are we prepared enough, what language style should we use, how should we deal with bloopers and who was going to say the important stuff. But it turned out that they were actually quite easy going so we had nothing to worry about. Cigdem began asking us many questions as soon as we"

We can get numerical solutions easily by Matlab as soon as initial \(T_1\)and \(T_2\) are given. Obviously, initial \(T_1\) is related to the initial Taxol concentration. Accordingly, initial \(T_2\) is related to the initial GTP-dimer quantity. All these promoters are initial conditions in the experiment.
We consider a kind of initial conditions of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\). Actually, any initial \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) in the experiment can be modeled and we can predict the numerical trends. The solutions of one of our example are given in the following charts.  (initial \(T_1\)=50000, initial \(T_2\)=3000, initial \(G_{11}\)=3000, Initial \(G_{21}\)=1000)

What we can get from our ODE model is \(G_1\) and \(G_2\), which indicate the quantity of filaments with GTP-cap and Taxol-cap, which is equal to the number of GTP-dimers at endpoint and the number of Taxol-dimers at endpoint. Sum of them is equal to the whole filaments units number in this dilution system. Since it should be proportionate to quantities of microtubules only by a"

Overall project
The Penn State Team combined quorum sensing and oxygen sensing promoters to construct a bacterial fireworks genetic circuit. We characterized the transcriptional regulation of the FNR oxygen sensing protein, which derepresses protein expression in the presence of oxygen. We then combined this oxygen sensing promoter with AHL sensing promoters in a positive and negative feedback loop system. While in the ""ON"" state, the circuit expresses an anaerobic fluorescent protein (AFP), which can emit blue light even when oxygen is not present. When a single cell senses oxygen, it produces the quorum sensing molecule AHL, which then diffuses to activate the circuit in nearby non-oxygenated cells, amplifying the output of the system. The fireworks genetic circuit has memory; once exposed to oxygen it will stay on even in the absence of oxygen.
Here is a simple example of a problem that our research with oxygen promoters and quorum sensing could solve:
Imagine a sealed glass vessel. Using our engineered microorganism as an oxygen sensor and light emitting reporter, we want to detect the presence of oxygen, which indicates the potential for spoilage of food, wine, or medicine. Jacketing the preserved contents of the vessel is a thin layer of porous media enmeshed with E. coli. The microorganism contains our plasmid which includes an oxygen-sensing promoter and quorum sensing genes.
In the event that oxygen leaks into the jar, the top layer of bacteria react by expressing AFP. However, this is a weak indicator.

Light Sensing System
Approach
Balancing Bacterial Dormancy Requires Accurate Regulation of the System
The genes needed for inducing dormancy when the bacteria are not exposed to light, are found in the photocontrol device part, BBa_K519030 . This part is composed of three genes named ho1, pcyA, and cph8, all of which are essential to ensure the cells ability to respond to red light. When the photocontrol device is exposed to light, a phosphorylation cascade activates the transcription factor OmpR, which in turn induces transcription through the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_R0082 . This system is combined with the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system in the endeavour to mediate light-dependent dormancy in bacteria. In the first considered design of the light-dependent dormancy system, the aim was to clone the photocontrol device, BBa_K519030 , under control of a constitutive promoter, RelE under control of the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_R0082 , and RelB under control of a constitutive promoter, all into one high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid pSB1C3, as seen on Figure 1.
Figure 1. All three components of the light-dependent dormancy system cloned into one high copy plasmid.
The Photocontrol Device was Placed under Control of a Constitutive Promoter
From the constitutive promoter family the weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , the two medium promoters, BBa_J23106 , and BBa_J23110 , and the strong promoter, BBa_J23102 , were tested by fluorescence microscopy to determine which one to use for expression of the photocontrol device and RelB. Overnight cultures of the submitted parts expressed in E. coli TOP10 illustrated a clear gradient of increasing red fluorescent protein (RFP) expression correlated with the strength of the promoter, as seen on Figure 2.

Week 6: July 4 - July 10
CRISPR Team
This week, we made plasmids expressing sgRNAs that target TolA and DegS in the E. coli genome. To do so, we performed a SLiM PCR on the pKD-sgRNA-ack plasmid. We digested with DpnI the products of these PCRs to remove reaction template, and ran a 3-hour long PCR reaction that hybridised the reactants together.
These were then transformed into the cloning and two expression strains. Unfortunately, the TolA product failed to work, so we retried the process; a gel then revealed that no DNA was present, so we ordered new primers for the SLiM reaction. For DegS, we miniprepped and submitted the product for sequencing at the Ramaciotti Centre
Overexpression Team
We used PCR to amplify the parts received from IDT: expression constructs for g3p, tolR, and alMGS. For the latter, we tried several overlapping PCRs to fuse the parts together, but gels revealed bands running at incorrect sizes. The other two were successfully ligated into pSB1C3 (both), pSB1T3 (tolR only), and pSB1K3 (g3p only)
Week 7: July 11 - July 17
CRISPR Team
We retried the degS-ack miniprep, and got a yield good enough to resubmit for sequencing. We also rehybridised the SLiM PCR products for tolA and retransformed them into our cloning strain, but no colonies grew; we believed that there was something wrong with the primers, so we designed new ones and put them on order. At the same time, we ordered primers for making a pKD-sgRNA-degP plasmid, to knockout a related protein to degS called degP.
Overexpression Team
For alMGS, we reattempted fusion of its two fragments via overlapping PCR. However, running the product on a gel revealed that the reaction didn't complete and still contained more reactants than products. We retried this procedure twice, tweaking parameters such as molar ratios and the number of cycles, but neither helped. We then tried a PCR on the overlapping PCR's product, hoping to amplify the full product specifically from the mix; this only marginally improved the outcome, so we"

BioSynthAge: Do not go gentle into that good night
Why ageing?
How do you envision yourself as an elderly member of society? Frail, with a stooped posture and with greater risk of some cancers? Or healthy, active and living a high quality of life? This year the UCL iGEM team are working to build new systems that increase the healthy human lifespan and solve some of the issues of the ageing population. We are achieving this by focusing on the root cause as opposed to traditional medicine which focuses on treating the symptoms of disease. For instance, we are developing gene therapies that target cellular aging and encourage cellular and tissue regeneration.
Ageing is a process that is caused by the cellular degeneration that leads to reduced maximum functional capacity of many organs, reduced capacity of cells to divide and increased risk of age-related diseases such as cancer. Simply put as cells age they become increasingly poor at functioning and repairing damage [3] .
Even though we are living longer than ever before, this does not equate to a higher quality of life in our older years. About 2/3 of the global population (100,000 per day) die as a result of age related causes. In industrialised nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90% [1] . We believe that by targeting the causes of ageing, we are able in turn to cure the symptoms of ageing such as age related diseases like Alzheimer's and lung disease (COPD).
We are living longer, and maintaining a high quality of life depends on healthy ageing. We all aspire to a long and healthy lives in old age, but we know that older people are at"

By all these work we do, we can control the structure of polyketide in three aspect: by choosing or engineering the appropriate host, the supplement of building blocks will be enough[13][14]; then, by choosing the suitable loading module and KS-AT domain, the PKS can select the building blocks of polyketide synthesis. Finally, according to the structure of polyketide, we can insert different modified domains into specific module, so that the building blocks can be modified correctly.
We will try to establish a database that can provide the information about the utilization of  standardized domain. According to the structure of polyketide that user need, the database can provide the information about the assemble of standardization domains and host needed for synthsis.

Yale,2016,Team:Yale#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," genome is fully sequenced (NCBI Taxonomy ID: 698761). S. meliloti is similarly able to nodulate a wide range of host plants, primarily those from the Medicago, Melilotus, and Trigonella genera (Roumiantseva et al. 2002). It is particularly unique in its denitrification abilities. These rhizobia are able to reduce nitrate and nitrite into N2 as well as fix atmospheric nitrogen because they have all four nitrogen oxide reductases (House 2003). Similar to R. tropici, S. meliloti is a fast growing species whose genome is fully sequenced (NCBI Taxonomy ID: 266834).
Constructing recombinases for Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE)
MAGE was selected for our purposes because it efficiently generates increased genetic diversity at targeted genomic loci through the introduction of synthetic oligonucleotides, and allows for directed evolution of cell populations (Wang, et al. 2009). MAGE has a variety of applications in genome modification, including optimization of a protein or small molecule production pathway, tuning of gene expression, modification of ribosomal binding sites, and knocking out of undesired genes.
It relies on the introduction of degenerate oligonucleotides with 30-45 bp homology arms that are complimentary to the target sequence. The Lambda-Red recombineering cassette is used to induce mutations along the genome of an organism, including insertions, deletions, and point mutations. However, the efficiency of MAGE is decreased by the cell’s natural mismatch repair (MMR) system, which corrects any mismatches caused by MAGE. To reduce this problem in E. coli, researchers knock out the mutS gene, a key component of the MMR system. By knocking out mutS, the efficiency of MAGE increases, but this process has not been shown to be easily done in non-model microorganisms such as rhizobia.
Currently, the most effective recombination protein is Beta recombinase from Lambda, a phage that infects E. coli. This means that it is not optimized for our rhizobia species. Thus, in order to increase the efficiency of MAGE in rhizobia, we looked for homologues in the rhizobia genome and in phages that infect rhizobia. To facilitate this process, we developed a software tool that employs the hidden Markov model-based search algorithm hmmer to search for homologues on the Viral Genome Database and on the ENSEMBL Bacterial Genomes"
MichiganState,2018,Team:MichiganState#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the abstraction of the alpha-proton from D-amino acids, a precursor to the subsequent deamination reaction. These structural data provide evidence favoring a mechanism in which the ring cleavage is begun by a nucleophilic attack at the pro-S â-methylene carbon of ACC, with Tyr294 as the nucleophile. However, these observations are also consistent with an alternative possibility in which the ring opening is acid-catalyzed and may be facilitated by charge relay through PLP, where Tyr294 functions as a general acid. For most PLP-dependent enzymes, the reaction starts with the conversion of an internal aldimine between PLP and an active site lysine residue to an external aldimine between PLP and the amino group of the substrate which then followed by the removal of the R-proton of the substrate, which triggers subsequent transformations such as transamination and racemization.
Figure 7: The structure of the gem-diamine intermediate in Pseudomonas ACC deaminase complexed with ACC. The bonds are indicated with dotted lines. The interaction between the Tyr294 hydroxyl group and the pro-S carbon of ACC is indicated by a thin red line.
Figure 7 shows that the bound PLP cofactor in the Pseudomonas enzyme forms an internal aldimine with Lys51 through its side chain N_ amino group. The N atom of the PLP pyridinium ring forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Glu295 (2.6 Å), whereas the O2 oxygen interacts with the side chain amino group of Asn79 (3.0 Å) and a water molecule (2.6 Å). The phosphate of PLP is anchored near the N-terminus of an alpha-helix formed by residues 202- 213, and interacts with the main chain amide groups of Val198, Thr199, Gly200, and Thr202, and with the side chains of Lys54, Thr199, and Thr202. Several protein residues also contact PLP through van der Waals interactions. These include Leu322, Asn50, and notably, Tyr294, the latter of which stacks against the plane of the pyridinium ring. These interactions firmly position the cofactor in the enzyme active site. As above there exists a bound sulfate molecule in the active site of the native enzyme which interacts with the main chain amides of Asn79 and Gln80 and with the side chains of Ser78 and Tyr294.
The fact that Tyr294 is located near the cyclopropane ring in the active site of ACC de"

From Dr. Simon Ittig of T3 Pharma how to bring bacterial cancer therapy to patients and what pitfalls we have to be aware of.
From Prof. Dr. Markus Rudin and Dr. Aileen Schröter what possibilities there are to apply biomedical imaging to improve cancer treatment procedures and how to harvest their potential for our project.
From Dr. Christian Britschgi about the role of innovative cancer therapies in the clinical setting and how our system would fit into this larger framework.
From Dr. Sacha Rothschild how immunotherapy is changing the landscape of cancer treatment, the future role of the classical approaches and how to critically assess our own idea.
From Prof. Dr. Darko Polšek about  ethical issues and controversies we might face as we develop our project.
The experts' opinions were very helpful in orienting the focus of our efforts, in particular, increasing our emphasis on safety (avoiding side-effects). For a few of us CATE was the first time that we embarked on a medical project; we welcomed the opportunity to read and think about the established bioethical practises of the field. Still, despite the numerous potential causes of concern, all the experts we consulted were encouraging in their remarks. We have gathered their insights in our Integrated Practices page, so that opinions from experts of different backgrounds can be compared and contrasted easily.

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Since many of the residents did not have access to transportation, they would have to pay for the costly trip.
Megan Hong, Lambert iGEM member describes her experience: When we traveled to the village by Hato Mayor, we were instantly surprised by the amount of trash filling the streets, homes, and water sources. Without direct access to clean drinking water, the residents of the village had to travel about 20 miles out of their way to the city in order to obtain bottled water. We installed 12 water filters throughout the area, which would help to serve over 50 people. While we implemented these systems and taught the locals how to use and clean the filter, the residents talked about how much the clean water would impact their lives in a positive way.
Doll Kit | April 14, 2018
Summary Points
Exposure of young girls to science as a fun and accessible field
Improvement of communication skills through the explanation of complex concepts to younger children
Lambert iGEM recognizes the significance of disproportionate demographics in the biotechnology and the scientific community as a whole, especially with women. This problem is largely due to lack of exposure to STEM as young girls. Lambert iGEM discovered that most lab kits or chemistry sets for children were marketed towards boys rather than girls. As a result, the team created a doll kit specifically designed for elementary-aged girls to increase exposure and interest in biotechnology. These kits include basic laboratory materials such as pipettes and beakers as well as Lambert iGEM’s very own 3DFuge. This kit allows girls to explore biotechnology as fun and accessible rather than something strictly for boys, significantly increasing interest in the science field. Placing the possibility of a successful career as a scientist in the minds of young girls has immeasurable value to the confidence of the girls themselves as well as the scientific community as a whole.

American sign language camp
American sign language for synthetic biology teams
A few members of the Lambert iGEM team participated in a summer camp hosted by GSU for deaf students in the Atlanta area. This camp walked students through labs such as DNA barcoding and gel electrophoresis, which were meant to give students with disabilities the opportunity to gain experience in the field of synthetic biology. This camp was a continuation of GSU’s previous project, in which they created new signs in ASL in order to create a larger science-based vocabulary for deaf students.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are known for their ability to kill bacteria that are harmful to its host and are part of the innate immune system of all multicellular organisms (Andreu & Rivas, 1998). AMPs from various organisms have shown the ability to inhibit many types of gram-positive/gram-negative bacteria, protists, fungi, and other organisms. The outstanding diversity of AMPs found in all organisms on the planet contribute to a constantly growing list of peptides with varying properties. The size, amino acid sequence, charge, conformation, hydrophobicity, and amphipathicity all contribute to the activity of an AMP. Most AMPs contain fewer than 100 amino acids and are positively charged (Giuliani et al., 2007).
Organisms across our planet produce antimicrobial peptides that allow them to thrive in their distinct environments. For example, crocodiles by nature are extremely territorial and engage in vicious battles with other competing members of their community, sustaining open wounds in the process. The AMPs that are naturally produced in their blood protect them from infections due to the innumerable bacteria and organisms that could otherwise cause them great harm. King penguins produce unique AMPs in their stomach to allow for extended storage of food to later regurgitate and feed to their young. Marsupials have shown to be unique hosts of AMPs. The tammar wallaby relies on the production of AMPs in their pouches to protect their young who do not have a developed immune system for the first few months of their lives (Wang et al., 2011).
The diversity of AMPs is likely another example of adaptations occurring in organisms due to environmental pressures. It has been determined that most AMPs are derived from precursor sequences that are quite similar. Conserved regions on AMPs even between different species of organisms has led to this belief (Zasloff, 2002). The changes present in the current AMP sequence are probably due to the thriving of organisms containing mutations in the AMP sequence that allowed them to gain an advantage over other individuals lacking the mutation (Zasloff, 2002). These AMPs have been tested over many generations in their host organisms and makes them fascinating for studies in which their activity is tested against a variety of organisms.
With so many AMPs, it is no wonder that a variety of mechanisms are possible for bacterial cell killing (Epand et al., 1999). Most AMPs"

Introduction
Mutant library activity
Regulatory part activity
Conclusions
Introducton
To demonstrate the CAT-Seq is working as intended, we chose an Esterase enzyme (CAT-Seq Esterase) capable of hydrolyzing N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate to 2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate. We have then designed a library of the esterase mutants with the help of in-silico modelling and also acquired libraries of different ribosome binding sites and toehold switches. We have successfully shown that we can assess the derived esterase mutant and regulatory sequence activities and sequences by recording those activities into their DNA sequences in a high-throughput manner using N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate as a Substrate Nucleotide and 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidines as reference nucleotides. The activity recording is based on the ratio of catalytically converted and reference nucleotide incorporated into the  DNA during the amplification reaction and can be extracted during the analysis of Nanopore sequencing data.
Mutant library activity and sequence assessment
First of all, the constructed in silico designed mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. By applying the data preparation and analysis pipeline, the mean methylation scores arising from different ratios of catalytically converted and reference nucleotides for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted from the DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio). The collected data was normalized over Wild Type Esterase and  K227R mutant (lowest activity).

Thessaloniki,2018,Team:Thessaloniki#Model#dCas9_-_-_TEXT.html," applied                     sensitivity analysis for the association and dissociation constants.                     Interestingly, the results showed that the repressor’s kdson and kdsoff                     does not affect the system output. After changing some values of these                     parameters we found that this is true and the system appeared to be very                     robust regarding the repressor concentration. Due to the strong repression                     that it does, combined with its very small degradation rate, the repressor                     is binding to DNA and almost never dissociates, thus making small                     repression concentrations sufficient for the system to work. Specifically,                     using different values we were able to get exactly the same output error                     with many combinations of kdson and kdsoff.
Figure 7: First and Total order Sensitivity indices for Main system’s                         association and dissociation constants
Figure 8: Heatmap Representation of Second order Sensitivity indices.                         The bar in the right showcases the color-value match.
The second thing we noticed that reinforces the previous statement is that                     the second order indices have a peak for the interaction of kon3 with                     kdsoff. That makes sense, because in the case of decreasing the repression                     strength, the system needs more repressor to operate the same.
Knowing from fact that the dcas9-sgRNA repression is very strong [1][2][3],                     we fixed the parameters accordingly (see Bibliography based parameter                     estimation) and finished model characterization. However, the final model                     produced an Error of approximately 22, which we will discuss in the next                     section.
dcas9-sgRNA Repressor analysis
In the previous section, we draw the conclusion from the results of                     sensitivity analysis, that the system is not sensitive regarding the                     formation of repressor, thus we can tell as an extension of this that the                     system is robust concerning the concentration of dcas and sgRNA.
On the other hand, we found out that the system appears to be generally                     unusable with an error of 22, that was hard to change. Scanning the most                     influential parameter, kon3, as evidenced by Figure 7, we were able to                     change the repressive power of the repressor complex and produce sfGFP                     concentration of different magnitudes, though the system Error (as                     described on the system evaluation section of TALE) did not show to be                     affected.
This could potentially mean, that the system would fail, even if we didn’t                     have set the binding affinities of the system to their right values with                     our characterization. That is, because even when trying to change the error                     by scanning different"

What type of work does it take to get to the Jamboree? What do you need to know? We reached out to teams across the world to get their perspective on their iGEM journey and compiled the information so that future teams can draw from our collective experiences and learn!
Introduction
""Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong"" – Murphy’s Law
We often find that even though we try to account for every potential problem, there is always one that   should have been obvious. This scenario is inevitable and more often than not, will happen at the worst   time possible. How we handle these unforeseen problems can result in either a successful mission or a   critical mission failure. As a team competing for the first time, there was no shortage of these scenarios   and as a good team should, we came together and quickly found solutions for the problems. As the   summer passed, our knowledge and experience grew and we decided to reach out to the teams in our   track to compile all of our collective experiences and perspectives on the iGEM experience and put it   together to create a tool for future team’s use.
In this guide you will find multiple team’s perspective on topics such as design, laboratory work, funding,   team building and the suggested approach to potential problems that can emerge. However,  our vision   for this guide is to not only provide insight and solutions to some of these unforeseen problems but to   also challenge the way in which we perform established practices used in the preparation for the iGEM   competition. In future we hope to evolve this guide into a forum where all iGEM teams can contribute to   each other’s knowledge, because we believe the main goal of the iGEM competition, at its core, is to   provide students with an opportunity to learn and grow the scientific community.

UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Level is an integer value that refers to the current state of  the network entities that are being model [ ref ]. In our Petri-Boolean model, network entities, chemical species and operons, have a basal level of 0 with a maximum capacity of 1. Qualitative Species refer to entities that are compartmentalized and characterized by the qualitative influence of their components; compartments allow one to pool entities of similar composition [ ref ]. In our Petri-Boolean model, chemical species and operons are referred to as qualitative species with species and plasmid as their respective compartments. Transitions alter the level of entities in a network at given conditions by a fixed amount such conditions involve the fluctuation between levels falling below or above an established threshold [ ref ]. Transitions in our network govern the binary state of its entities thus a network entity can assume a level of 0 or 1 depending on current state conditions.  By converting every network entity, qualitative species or transition, in our database to its corresponding SBML description we not only make our qualitative model accessible to the public but also our entire database.
Network Analysis
Gene circuit design often involves the laborious extension of existing circuitry through the development of new devices.  Device development is a taxing biological endeavor to which SBiDer offers an alternative.  SBIDer facilitates circuit design by integrating knowledge across existing genetic modules.  We provide evidence for an increase in functional motifs relative to the circuitry input into our database by examining common network attributes and executing more sophisticated network analysis.
In analyzing our database, we demonstrated and quantified the increased number of genetic circuits relative to the input circuits. Connectivity served as a preliminary indicator of the increase in potential circuits. We compared the connectivity, measured by “in-degree” and “out-degree,” of the input circuitry to the degree measure of the integrated database.  The increase in degree indicates a combinatorial increase in potential circuits.
This increase is observed as the rightward shift of the In-Degree(v) and Out-Degree(v) distributions.  The degree comparison between the input circuitry and the database demonstrated an increase in modulators and modulations in the database.  Theoretically, every in-degree increase represents a novel modulation of that node, every out-degree increase represents a novel opportunity for that node to modulate another.  The increase in modulators and modulations is important because every combination of these novel inputs and outputs constitutes a new circuit. Further, each ancestor and descendant of a node increase the count of novel circuits exponentially, as a function of the degree.  In addition to analyzing the connectivity of our network"

Research Of Bacteria targeting cancer therapy
Bacteria targeting cancer therapy: Salmonella typhimurium-VNP20009 with its unique characteristic of accumulating in nutrient-rich or hypoxic tissues can be adapted to tumor targeted therapy. However, recent researches revealed that S. typhimurium can survive in other normal tissues, resulting in damage or inflammatory response. Our project aims to improve the therapeutic property of S. typhimurium by modifying its amino acids-synthesizing genes and screen highly tumor-targeted strains. Then we standardize them to construct a general element used specifically in hypoxic tissues. The hypoxic feature in the core areas of tumors made it possible for S. typhimurium to target tumors specifically.  Our goal is to screen the anaerobic promoter that can express efficiently in S. typhimurium and ligate it with genes of anti-cancer drugs. The double properties of the strains and promoters enable anti-cancer drugs to express specifically in tumors, fulfilling our goal of decreasing toxic and side effects of the drugs.

Nexavar is an anti-cancer drug developed by Bayer International.  As of early 2014, the price of the drug was $65,000.00 USD PER YEAR, per patient (Reference).  On December 3rd, 2013, Bayer CEO Marijn Dekkers was quoted at an event saying the following as a response to disputes between Bayer and Indian Government over drug patents and the implementation of the India compulsory license.
""We did not develop this medicine for Indians. We developed it for western patients who can afford it.""
- Bayer CEO Marijin Dekkers
We find this attitude from Marijin Dekkers to be absolutely appalling.  But we are not naïve enough to think that there aren't more pharmaceutical companies that feel the exact same way.  We believe that pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals should be affordable and accessible to anyone who needs treatment.  We want to develop an inexpensive, yet viable (from a business perspective) method for the distribution of our treatment.  We started to research how pharmaceutical companies spend their money.  We discovered that the vast majority of pharmaceutical companies spend more in marketing and advertising than they do in research and development.
Excess spending on marketing and advertising reduces the amount of money that is spent on R&D.  This also decreases the availability of new drugs to people who need them.  Therefore, our goal is to facilitate biopharmaceutical companies to redistribute money to R&D for life altering diseases instead of overspending on marketing and advertising.  Currently the United States has tax incentives for research and development (R&D) for pharmaceutical companies in the U"

Team Heidelberg 2013 (PHILOSOPHER’S STONE) developed a system to synthesize non ribosomal peptides. One of the simplest mechanisms was the synthesis of indigoidine ( TH13 wiki ) :
For this synthesis, we need: 1) acquisition of Glu (assuming that the bacteria acquires from the external medium with a specific transporter), 2) transform Glu in cGlu and 3) transform cGlu in Ind (assuming that there ir one lower step). We get: $$ \begin{equation} \frac{A_{c}}{A^0_{c}}  = {(\frac{r_P}{r^0_P} )^3}{(\frac{r_P}{r^0_P})^3}{({\frac{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_F}{RT } } }}{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_F}{RT^0 } } }}}{\frac{e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT } }}{e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT^0 } }}})^2}{\frac{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_T}{RT } } }}{\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{\Delta G_T}{RT^0 } } }}}{\frac{e^{-\frac{E_aT}{RT } }}{e^{-\frac{E_aT}{RT^0 } }}} \end{equation} $$ where E$_a$ is the activation energy of every chemical reaction, E$_{aT}$ is the activation energy of the transport process, $\Delta$G$_F$ is the folding energy of any enzyme required for the pathway and $\Delta$G$_T$ is the folding energy"

Hey guys I’m Leo from Shenzhen College of International Education. Being keen on Molecular Biology I participated in iGEM and found the lab work so disastrous that I would surely knee in front of the cultivator and beg the E.coli to accept our plasmid and survive if this will help. Obviously, it doesn’t. I love tarot a lot and predicts on our PCR results often and the only truth I foresee is that science contradicts the unreliable belief.
Participating iGEM, to me, is a body and mental building tour that involves an endless number of deadlines and lab nights. It is also an exhilarating adventure with the accompany with my friends. Hooray to the all-night-PCR and long live our bioparts!!!

In the absence of Autoinducer-2, LsrR repress the LsrR promoter to bind LsrR-Binding Site. In the presence of AI-2 extracellular AI-2 is imported into the cell (cytoplasmic AI-2) via LsrACDB transporter, where it is phosphorylated by LsrK. LsrK is a kinase responsible for converting AI-2 to phospho-AI-2, which is required for relieving LsrR repression. Phospho-AI-2 has been reported to bind to LsrR and relieve its repression effect on the lsrR promoter.
3. Toehold System
Toehold switches provide a high level of orthogonality and can be forward engineered to provide average dynamic range above 400. Toehold switches, with their wide dynamic range, orthogonality, and programmability, represent a versatile and powerful platform for regulation of translation, offering diverse applications in molecular biology, synthetic biology, and biotechnology.New classes of regulatory components that offer wide dynamic range, low system crosstalk, and design flexibility represent a much-needed, enabling step toward fully realizing the potential of synthetic biology in areas such as biotechnology and medicine. (Khalil and Collins, 2010).
Engineered riboregulators consist of cognate pairs of RNAs: a transducer strand that regulates translation or transcription and a trans-acting RNA that binds to the transducer to modulate its biological activity. Riboregulator designs can be classified according to the initial RNA-RNA interaction that drives hybridization between the transducer and trans-acting RNAs. Reactions initiated between loop sequences in both RNAs are termed loop-loop interactions, whereas those that occur between a loop sequence and an unstructured RNA are termed loop-linear(Takahashi and Lucks, 2013).
A common limitation for riboregulators has been their dynamic range (Liu et al., 2012). Previous prokaryotic translational riboregulators have typically modulated biological signals by up to a maximum of 55-fold for activators (Callura et al., 2012) and up to 10-fold for repressors (Mutalik et al., 2012). In contrast, protein-based transcriptional regulators have demonstrated dynamic ranges over an order of magnitude higher, with widely-used inducible promoters regulating protein expression over 350-fold"

PQQ was diluted in a copper (II) solution and mixed with the purified protein. Since the purified protein exists in a phosphate buffer (extract was purified from the Ni-NTA resin columns), we maintained the pH of the reaction solution and kept it close to pH 7 while adding excess copper because the precipitation of copper(II) phosphate causes an increase in acidity of the buffer. When the solution became basic, we found that the solution was mostly clear and the precipitate was a light green-blue color, likely copper hydroxide. When the solution was nearly pH 7 and borderline acidic, the solution turned a clear blue and produced a fine blue copper(II) phosphate precipitate, but copper remained in solution. We incubated the two different sample solutions at room temperature for 24 hours. After 24 hours, we found that the solutions separated into two layers. We weren't sure if the cross-linked protein would exist in the precipitate-like layer or the supernatant so we ran both against the original untreated CN in a gel.
Figure 9: Tubes containing the cross-linking reaction solution. Left tube is pH 8 and right tube is pH is 6.8.
Figure 10: SDS-PAGE with Lumio stain of non-cross-linked and cross-linked CN protein. Lane 2 is the untreated CN protein. Lanes 3 and 4 are the pH 6.8 tube's precipitate and supernatant, respectively. Lanes 5 and 6 are the pH 8 tube's precipitate and supernatant, respectively.
The SDS-PAGE gel results showed that cross-linking did not occur. It is difficult to read the gel because the protein may have run off early on. In this experiment, we used a different gel percentage, 8%, because we ran out of our usual gel type. This is the third iteration of running our SDS-PAGE gel, because we had trouble figuring out the optimal run conditions. Even though the gel was run at 200 V for 10 minutes, the samples were mostly at the bottom. This may have contributed to the production of a messy gel. Due to time constraints and material limitations, we could not rerun more gels to further optimize our protocol. Despite the difficulty in gauging the exact results of the gel, we estimated our results of failure based on the location of the untreated CN band. The bands in the other lanes were approximately around the same location, suggesting that the treated proteins did not change in size. We"

Long Range Co-ordination - To further improve efficiency, we might consider involving bacteria from a wider area by producing a chemoattractant in addition to the short-range co-ordination signal, from the bound cell. This could be used, for example, to recruit more bacteria to perform the desired tasks or to co-ordinate the construction of more elaborate patterns requiring long range communication among bacteria.
Methodology
The methods will be both experimental and computational. In particular, we aim to develop a stochastic simulation environment to reproduce the interaction between the bacteria and particles. All computations will be developed in Matlab or Java and will be used to assess the viability of different strategies to successfully achieve the different stages of the project. At the same time, lab experiments will be performed to test all different aspects of the project. The integration between experiments and computations will be at the core of our project. In particular, computations will be used to improve the design while experiments will be aimed at testing the feasibility of different design options.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Recombination_-_-_TEXT.html," our knock out switch         is of paramount importance in our project. We have designed several measures to increase the efficiency of our knock         out switch. First is the implementation of two recombination deletion systems: Cre-lox and Dre-rox systems. Due to         the property of non-crossover recombination between Cre-rox or Dre-loxP, if one of our recombination systems fails,         other recombination system can still induce the deletion of the origin of replication, thus termination of the expression         of gene of interest and making our knockout switch doubly safe. Second is the use of mutant loxP sites, lox 66 and         lox 71. After the recombination between lox 71 and lox 66 sites, the characteristic property of these target site         prevents recombination back to the original state, increasing the efficiency of deletion.
Mechanism of Cre/lox system induced deletion
In the case of Cre protein, it recognizes 34 base pair sequences known as loxP sites. There are also mutants of the         recognition site, for example lox 66 and lox 71 which have distinctive activities from loxP site. The lox sequence         consists of asymmetric 8 bp sequences of spacer region (also called linker), which is flanked by 13 bp palindromic         repeats. Because of the asymmetrical properties of linkers, it provides a control of directionality of recombination         by Cre protein. When two lox sites have compatible linkers with identical orientations, Cre-mediated recombination         causes a deletion of the sequence in between the two lox sites.
Mechanism of Dre/rox system induced deletion
Dre protein is a Cre-like site-specific recombinase (SSR) which had diverged sufficiently to recognize its own recombination         site that is distinct from lox site named rox. The base pair of rox site is 32 (lox site has 34 bp). The rox site         is structurally similar to lox site. It also has two palindromic repeats but are 14 bp (lox site has 13 bp repeats)         and are separated by only 4bp linker sequence. Multiple research papers mention that there is no crossover recombination         between Cre-rox or Dre-loxP. (Brian L, 2004)

K2020004
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (S221X) This part is a variation of the BioBrick K2020003 . In opposition to the exchange of serine221 against tyrosine, the named serine was exchanged against an amber codon, the least used stop codon in Escherichia coli. The codon AGC of serine221 was substituted with TAG, which codes for DMNB-serine, if the corresponding aminoacyl tRNA/synthetase pair is added. So serine will be exchanged against DMNBS in the catalytic triade of the enzyme in the presence of the needed DMNBS tRNA/synthetase pair. By irradiation with light, this non-canonical amino acid can be converted to natural serine in the active site of the enzyme and the cleaved off photo-labile group. Thereby, the protease will reach its activity just by shining light on it and will be reversibly inactivated successfully. Unfortunately, we were not able to execute all of the experiments that we planned due to a lack of time. But as our proof of principle of exchanging serine against a larger amino acid namely tyrosine worked, it can be assumed, that this part will also operate correctly. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
K2020005
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (Y77W) The BioBrick named K2020002 for the expression of subtilisin E in E. coli is the basic component of this new part. Therefore, it consists of the promoter BBa_R0010 , the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 , the leader sequence pelB BBa_J32015 , the newly created BioBrick K2020000 and the terminator BBa_B0010 like the expression system itself. The whole expression is based on the usage in E. coli, so the sequence of the subtilisin E gene from a wild type Bacillus subtilis was optimized for E. coli codon usage. The sequence was partly ordered from IDT ( BBa_K2020001 + BBa_B0010 ) and then cloned into BBa_J04500 , a protein expression backbone which already carries the LacI promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 . Afterwards, a mutation between the pro-peptide and the subtilisin E gene was introduced by performing site-directed mut"
