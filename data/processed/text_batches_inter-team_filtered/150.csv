In this week, we began to evolve our E.coli Bl21. Mutation part and Bitter defender part (rbs30) were transferred into E.coli Bl21. Colonies were picked up from agar plate to culture in LB. Seed culture was added to 1.5mL M9YE media(initial OD was 0.02) in 24-well plate with 50mg/L ampicillin, 24mg/L chloromycetin, 24mg/L IPTG and 80mg/L tetracycline as the first round mutation. After 270 minutes, the first round products were as seed culture added to another new 1.5mL M9YE media like above, but with higher tetracycline concentration as the second round mutation. After the third round mutation, the culture were coated on LB agar plate, picked up 24 single colonies to culture in 24-well plate for 48h and detected tryptophon production by HPLC. Result was shown in figure 15. With the help of mutation part, we got mutation mixture with different tryptophon yield range from 0-1.508mg/L.

In this week, we continue to evolve the original Bl21 with mutation part and bitter defender part(rbs30) in order to test the universality of our mutation strategy. Colonies were picked up from agar plate to culture in LB. Seed culture was added to 1.5mL M9YE media(initial OD was 0.02) in 24-well plate with 50mg/L ampicillin, 24mg/L chloromycetin, 24mg/L IPTG and 80mg/L tetracycline as the first round mutation. After 610 minutes, the first round products were as seed culture added to another new 1.5mL M9YE media like above, but with higher tetracycline concentration as the second round mutation. After the third round mutation, the culture were coated on LB agar plate, picked up 24 single colonies to culture in 24-well plate for 48h and detected trptophon production by HPLC. Result was shown in figure 16. It also shown diversity of our mutation strategy. However, the mixture exhibited lower productivity. The mixture was a survival from high tetracycline concentration for its resistance tolerance, another"
HFUT_CHINA,2014,Team:HFUT CHINA#Database&Algorithm.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 User-based CF
The  main idea of User-based CF is to find similar users by analyzing the previous  behavior of different users and recommend biobricks based on the  behavior of similar user.
Pearson  correlation coefﬁcient is used to measure the similarity of different users.  The definition of Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is as follows:
 
2. Association rule
Association  rule is a widely used and well researched method for discovering relations  between variables. When using association rule for recommendation, there are  mainly two separate steps:
First,  minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a  database.
Second,  these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form  rules.
For  the first step, we first collect all the device chains from Registry of  Standard Biological Parts and then calculate the frequency of two successive biobrickes,  three successive biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive  biobrickes. Here successive biobrickes means the biobrickes are neighbors and  the frequency of a set of successive biobricks is named support. After the  calculation of the frequency, we find all successive biobrickes that  have support greater than the minimum support.
For the second step, the large sets of  successive biobricks are used to generate the desired rules that  have confidence greater than the minimum confidence. Here confidence a  measure of the reliability of an estimate. It consists of a range of values  (interval) that act as good estimates of the unknown population parameter.

Project
Every year, iGEM teams across the world work diligently all summer long on their individual projects. And every year, these projects are documented on each team’s wiki page. Although wikis are a great, and open-source way to depict all aspects of a team’s project, it still requires a scientific background to fully understand, making it less accessible to a non-specialist audience.
For UCSF iGEM’s Policy and Practices this year, we are addressing issues of communication, specifically between the scientific community and the general public. We believe that by translating a team’s wiki page into a short, interesting video, we can better communicate our projects to everyone. UCSF iGEM encourages your team to be as creative as possible! This is a fantastic way to effectively convey your project not just to the iGEM community, but to the whole world in short, easy minutes. You want your video to be informative, but also easily comprehensible for ANY viewer out there. Take this as an opportunity to explore new ways to communicate your awesome projects!
In collaboration with the Trinity iGEM team, we are hosting the videos on their iGEM Academy YouTube channel. This hub contains videos produced by iGEM teams on a variety of topics for projects, outreach, or educational purposes.

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

As as an old team that has been participating in iGEM competition for 8 years, OUC-China is very willing to help SDU-China. At the beginning of the team formation, they came to ocean university of China and asked for help. We explained the process of the iGEM competition to them in detail and remind them some important deadlines. For their project, we gave them some pertinent suggestions. For practice activities, during the summer vacation, we invited them and held a summer camp for high school students in order to popularize life science and synthetic biology. Members of SDU-China explained to the campers how to make insect specimens.

EAAAK x2 linker is an α-helix forming linker, has advantages of improving protein solubility, providing enzyme flexibility for catalysis and maintain domain separation. The share advantages of these two linkers are they provide good domain separation, crucial for maintaining the structures of original active sites in our fusion protein.
Fig 2. Construct of our fusion enzyme
Enzyme CDS Placement
At first glance, our fusion enzyme design may seemed counter-intuition for you: we placed the CDS for first enzyme of our substrate channeling device in the exact middle of the construct, instead of front. We did this actually to make sure the linker selection will greatly affects the reactivity of our fusion enzyme: if the linker selection is not wise, we would detect no reactivity of fusion enzyme at all. Placing nitrite reductase in the middle of the construct ensures that if the fusion enzyme can reduce nitrite ions from the solution, we can make the educated inference that the active sites of nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase are functional.
This design is due to the limited assay method for enzyme reactivity and we want to make sure our product will not release any toxic materials during use.
Construct Expression vector for NzFE
We used inFusion Assembly to construct this final vector. First we use PCR to eliminate the start codons for NiR and NOR, eliminate stop codons for nosZ and NiR, and adding overlap using primers. We added a T7 promoter and double terminators using PCR to complete the construction of the vector. Then we standardized the part using inFusion kit.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook )."
Edinburgh,2008,Team:Edinburgh#ELSI_-_-_TEXT.html," strain of E. coli:
Has multiple disabling mutations,
Will not colonise the human gut,
But divides slowly.
Hence, we are considering using an alternative organism - Bacillus subtilis as our final host. B. subtilis is not pathogenic and generally regarded very positively.
Consumption
The final product will be safe for consumption. E. coli can be killed very easily – by simply drying it out. Bacillus subtilis is hard to kill but non-pathogenic; in fact, it is currently consumed as a dietary supplement.
All bacteria contain high levels of RNA, which causes gout. Hence, we envision using the RNAse system developed by the UC Berkeley iGEM team last year to degrade bacterial RNA. Heat treatment of the cells would then disrupt the cell wall allowing the nucleotides to diffuse out.
Concerns amongst the European populace about GM products causing prion diseases are unfounded: prions responsible for BSE, etc. originate in animals, not bacteria or plants.
Security
'Could our organisms be employed to degrade forests or houses?' No:
There are many cellulose-degrading organisms in the wild which have evolved to be much more adept at the task than our recombinant E. coli or B. subtilis. If plants are able to withstand bacteria and fungi which naturally degrade cellulose, then our organisms should not pose a threat.
Wood contains large quantities of lignin so it is not susceptible to bacterial cellulose degradation.
Cultural, economic and environmental concerns
Considering people's gut reaction to 'food made from waste products', we must make Micromaize as attractive as possible. Thus, we envision an orange-coloured, citrus-flavoured product thanks to the presence of beta carotene and limonene.
Monocultures will not be necessary: anything and everything contains cellulose, so farmers will be free to grow whatever they wish.
Our product is not intended to replace food for humans but to make use of agriculture's waste products and to supplement normal food in times of crisis. Hence, there is no reason why starch-producing bacteria should have any impact on farmers' livelihood.
Ownership, sharing and innovation
No patent may be filed since we have already released our research into the public domain. However, if a company improves the process we have developed, then we cannot prevent them from patenting their innovation.

What are Gas Vesicles?
Gas vesicles (GVs) have been found to be expressed in various species of bacteria as well as halophilic archaea. In these organisms, gas vesicles are employed to allow the movement of the organisms up the water column, from areas of low oxygen concentration to a more oxygen-rich environment. Photosynthetic bacteria also use gas vesicles to reach areas with optimal light intensity. The hydrophobic proteins which compose the gas vesicles are known as Gas vesicle proteins or Gvps.
Many genes have been implicated in the formation of gas vesicles. GvpA is the major structural protein of the gas vesicle. GvpA has been shown to form gas vesicles with a single layer wall with a bicone terminal structures. This structure appears to be strengthened and extended by other Gvps including GvpC, which is the second major structural component of the gas vesicles. In 2007, the Melbourne iGEM team used an 11kbp construct containing many gas vesicle genes to produce floating bacteria; however, this construct did not include gvpA suggesting that GvpA may not be essential to gas vesicle production. This system was later improved by the Groningen iGEM team in 2009, which used the system as an indicator for lead accumulation in the cells.
In 2012, the Ocean University China (OUC) team created a construct using gvpA and gvpC coupled to GFP expression. Planktothrix rubescens was used as the source of the gas vesicle genes to insert into E. coli. They found that upon transformation of the E. coli with 2 plasmids (one containing gvpA with a constitutive promoter and the other containing gvpC with a constitutive promoter) that their constructs appeared to work better than the Melbourne BioBrick. Expression of these two biobricks led to slower"

Abstract
   This year，the ultimate goal of our team，iGEM_BIT is to achieve the commercialization of the biomarkers detection module type (JACOB)，we need our project go into people‘s daily life，that's why we need entrepreneurship.
   Starting with markets and businesses:
   Through the market, we clarify the characteristics of JACOB and discard unnecessary factors.
   Through the company, we optimized the design of JACOB in laboratory to make the project more consistent with the actual situation.
Market Analysis
   In terms of market, our market is IVD, we has carried on the SWOT analysis to project the market, which seriously analyzes the project's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and competition (see links). In addition, we conducted interviews with our future users and, through interviews with people of different ages, got further feedback on the project. we conducted SWOT analysis of the project，including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and competition（Hyperlink）.In addition, we interviewed with our users of different ages,getting more information for our project.
SWOT
Strength
1. Convenience
2. Adaptability
3. High Cost/Performance Ratio
4. Inelastic to change in test conditions
Weakness
1. Technology Barrier
2. Branding Barrier
3. Strict Market Admittance Criteria
4. Distribution Barrier
Opportunity
1. Favorable national economic condition
2. Positive national policies
3. Uprising Health-consciousness
Threats
1. Well-established industries control the high-end markets with related products
2. Industrial chain is currently complete
3. Technological applications are matured
Comments
   Comparing to technology equipped by clinics and hospitals, The use of adjustable aptamer and genetic modified microbes made JACOB more economical, adaptable, and stable. The integration of automated proceeding made JACOB more user-friendly and portable. JACOB does not need professional physicians reading results, behaving like glucose meter but less risky. In China it is likely to be deployed in units of household or local communities. Similarly, for United States the Food and Drug Administration classified the core mechanism of JACOB as Class I medical device (if designed to not detecting cancer biomarkers), means no premarketing control is required. It is worth noting though, Chinese in vitro diagnostic market is relatively new and have few competitors."
Grinnell,2011,Team:Grinnell#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," We picked 2 colonies from each transformed promotor, inoculated overnight cultures, and Miniprepped them.  We then performed a test digest but concluded that samples were contaminated by each other when we observed two bands in each lane corresponding to both sizes of promoters ( Figure ).
We made new overnights of PrsaA and Pxyl transformation colonies as well as a colony transformed with BBa_K081005, then Miniprepped and PCR amplified them this time using VF2 and VR so that the fragments would be large enough to see on a gel.  We also used One Taq instead of Phusion polymerase and our gel shows a lot of mispriming and extra bands. However, the PCR was sufficient to confirm the sizes of all three promoters ( Figure ). We sent PrsaA and Pxyl for sequencing and the results show successful isolation.
We digested the three promoters with SpeI and PstI to be ligated with esp plus rsaA and transformed.
This week is incomplete ( Figure , Figure , and Figure )
Week 5 June 26- July 2
Transformation plates of PrsaA and Pxyl with esp plus rsaA combination insert had a lot of growth, too many colonies to count and were unusually small.  We PCR amplified  with VF2 and VR but the gel showed that only the promotor region was present in the vector ( Figure and Figure ).
We decided to run some tests to see where we were going wrong.  We tested the restriction enzymes and the test showed that they work fine ( Figure ).  We plated competent cells without DNA on all plates with all antibiotics and plain L-Broth on plates.  We found that only our carb plates were contaminated with E. coli so we made new carb plates.  We also made new competent cells in case they were also contaminated.
We tried inserting the promotors into the vector containing esp plus rsaA rather than the other way around to see if we could get better results and got similar looking plates.  We also realized after looking at the gel ( Figure , Figure , and Figure ) that the size of one of the samples appeared be about 700bp, which is a size we would expect for rsaA alone.  We went back and examined the original gel image that led us to believe that it was both esp and rsaA together only to find that we had read the ladder wrong and we had in fact been working only with rsaA.

UNDERSTANDING AGEING
From Hamburg to London
OUR MOTIVATION
What does it feel like to be an older member of today’s society? Biosynthage really wanted to understand ageing from the perspective of the older people of the world. We believe that we can only design novel therapies for the ageing population when we understand the difficulties that old age brings – both physically and mentally. We have been talking to Dementia patients in a care home in Hamburg which has resulted in us creating our own old age simulation suit that our team members have been wearing to simulate the physical difficulties of being old.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai 2012 iGEM Team Parts
Overview
We have characterized and submitted 42 BioBricks which could either be used directly or serve as a universal tool readily for potential scientific or engineering use.
Those BioBricks could be divided into 4 groups.
1.BioBricks in Basic Parts are all basic components of the whole project. They can be assembled to carry out different tasks.
2.BioBricks in Membrane Anchors are fusion membrane proteins which could either constitutively aggregate or aggregate under signal induction.
3.BioBricks in Fatty-Acid-Producing Membrane Accelerator are Membrane Anchors linked with enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis.
4.BioBricks in Ligh-Sensing Membrane Rudder are Membrane Anchors linked with enzymes involved in Violacein synthesis and VVD protein.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," of interactions per day was seen at end of April. This high amount of interactions correlates with us being at the Danish Science Festival, where we inoculated bacteria from the fingers of the attendants on agar plates. The photo gallery of these plates was widely shared on our Facebook page, and it probably was the reason for the rise in amounts of interactions.
During the summer, we realised that an increasing fraction of our followers on Facebook were non-Danish speakers. Therefore, we set out to analyse the distribution of first languages among our followers seen in Figure 3, which showed that one in three of our followers were not speaking Danish as their first language. This data led to us switching the language used in our Facebook posts from Danish to English.

Figure 2. Unique interactions per day on our Facebook page.
Figure 3. Distribution of first language among our followers
On the 8th of September a commercial about our project aired on the website and Facebook page of the University of Southern Denmark. We made this commercial in collaboration with the communications department of the University of Southern Denmark, specifically a producer named Anders Boe. It was seen 27,526 times, which is equivalent to 16% of our hometowns population. The click-through rate was around 10%, which is much greater than the average rate of videos on their Facebook page. The commercial led to random people, including doctors on the hospital of Odense, asking team members about the project and about GMO in general. With all this in mind it seems fair to state that the commercial was a smash hit of our human outreach and our engagement in the social media. In combination with our easily recognisable logo and our human outreach initiatives, we have been using our social media as a platform to show interest in synthetic biology and for sharing our work.
After seeing the commercial a local newspaper reached out to us to bring an interview in their Saturday special Newspaper article from Fyens.dk (Danish) . In collaboration with the student media RUST and Beton TV we have been featured in their magazine and a video of our attendance in Boston will be shown on their Facebook page briefly after our return. This is done to ensure an awareness of the iGEM competition among the students on the University of Southern Denmark. We hope this will inspire a lot of students to apply for the iGEM team next year, since it is a hallmark of the SDU-Denmark team to be interdisciplinary.

Biofilms
Procedure: Degrading the July 17 Biofilms
The biofilms created on July 17 grew successfully. The solutions used to degrade the biofilms were Mr. Clean and Lysol. 3200 μL of solution was added to each Petri dish. 30 mins after the solutions were added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Two of the Petri dishes had been degraded. The other three from July 17 were washed with water once before being placed back in the 37 ˚C incubator. The goal of these three biofilms is to see if they can still grow and maintain the RFP biofilms.
Procedure: Reculturing July 17 Biofilms
To reculture the biofilms, 200 μL of LB media was added to one well for each Petri dish that had been degraded with cleaner.
The media was moved around the rim to where the biofilm had formed. Then the media was pipette back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the "

Indigoidine Production - bpsA
At the beginning of our wetlab phase, we wanted to transform E. coli cells with plasmids containing an indigoidine synthetase and a 4'-Phosphopanthetheinyl-transferase (PPTase) to see whether we can observe blue colonies on our plates as this has been reported by groups working with indigoidine synthetases (Takahashi 2007, Brachmann2012).
We focused on the work of Marius Müller et. al. in 2012 (Muller 2012). The group used the bpsA indigoidine synthetase (blue pigment synthetase A) from S. lavendulae ATCC11924 (Takahashi 2007) and the PPTase svp from S. verticillus ATCC15003 (Sanchez 2001) to establish both a fluorescence and a chromophore based reporter assay for mammalian cells by expression of bpsA and svp which results in production of a blue pigment/ fluorophore. The group kindly supported us by sending two of their constructs, namely the pET derived expression vectors pMM64 carrying the bpsA indigoidine synthetase with an ampicillin resistance gene and pMM65 carrying svp and a kanamycin resistance gene. Both bpsA and svp rom the Fussenegger lab are codon-optimized versions for expression in eukaryotic cell lines.

The 2016 UCLouvain iGEM Team is composed of twelve students from our bioengineering, engineering and biology schools and two biology professors. Come and meet the team ...
Adrien Gauchet :
Adrien is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. In his field, he loves everything about catalysis systems and chemical reactions. Then, he’s certainly our chemist (our own Heisenberg) and our glucose syrup master (show him some respect). Thanks to him we have had the opportunity to grow our bacteria on a homemade media. Adrien will also be our GO (literally “Gentil Organisateur” = Nice Organizer) for our trip to Boston. By the way, he’s the french one of the team but certainly the most belgian of all the french expatriates. He would certainly be the one to come at our team’s meeting a bit tipsy.
Adrien in one song ? Surely, “Quand l’appétit va, tout va !” (Astérix et Obélix, Mission Cléopâtre)
Alexandre Mattenet :
Alexandre is a master student in civil engineering in computer science. His task in the Team is the wiki support! He has an incredible sense of design. Listening and playing some music with nothing else than a GameBoy and drawing at any time, this guy does real ART. For him the answer will always be 42.
Alex in one song ? Surely, ‘Nyan Cat’ (Tosh 8.0)
Antoine Godeaux :
Aaaah, the God!! Antoine is a master student in biology, but he’s our god. When he speaks everyone listens. For every situation he will give you some wonderful punchlines such as “We all make mistakes” or “Trust no one”. He likes when everything is straight and right. The God has a lot of experience in biology and he has huge ambitions for his future. He’s the one that makes a Skype for an internship on the other side of the globe while making some experiments in the lab at the same time.
Antoine in one song? Surely, “Downtown” (Mackelmore and Ryan Lewis).

Initial Feedback
We sent a second questionnaire to find out more about whether the public would use a Solution from synthetic biology to treat Urinary tract infections. We asked more about whether they had heard of genetic engineering or synthetic biology, and how much they trust a recommended treatment by a doctor. In collaboration with UCL, we also filmed some of these responses on the street. The results were overwhelmingly positive.
Our Inspiration
Jorge Talk
Churchill Hospital, Oxford
Our first visit to the hospital was to the outpatient clinic during which we spoke with Jan, one of the nurses on the ward. Jan told us about a case of a person getting septicaemia as a result of a urinary infection. The patient had received antibiotics for seven days and had come back for a check up. Their urine sample was clear and all seemed fine but then the patient had started to shake. The bacteria were now in their blood as it had travelled back up the ureter to the kidney. Even though this was a rare case, it was shocking to hear about such a serious case and made our project feel very relevant.
Jan also made the following points:
People with infections have a catheter because they need a way to empty the bladder; else the urine travels up the ureter and back into the bladder
If a patient becomes septic the catheter has to be removed or can be fatal
UTIs are not just contracted by the catheter and it is important to also consider community based UTIs
“UTIs are very common and can be quite painful”
No separate ward for UTIs – they are treated in every ward
The protocol for treatment is to take a urine sample, see if there is an infection, and prescribe antibiotics that the bacteria are most sensitive to
Elderly hospital wards are likely to have many cases of UTIs
We took a lot from this initial conversation. We went onto investigating the pros and cons of the current methods of treating urinary infections and compared these to what Solution could offer. We realized that we needed to consider the catheter more from a hospital/medical perspective as up to this point we had confused its function, thinking it was more to do with administering medication rather than emptying the bladder. Following this meeting, the design of the catheter became an integral part of the project.
John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford
We still wanted to learn more about urinary infections as well as to get some feedback from nurses abourtour idea. We organized a trip to the Adams Ward (Geratology) to learn more about how urinary infections affect elderly people.

Survey
In today’s scenario where people have an opinion about anything and everything based upon the general view or from the opinion of subject who is followed by them which has become increasingly apparent due to the outreach of social media, it becomes essential to impart the correct knowledge among the people on a subject by the people actually involved in the field. Conducting a survey is great way to know the general perception of people and to find a way to address the incorrect perceptions and hence reduce the information gap. Synthetic Biology is one area where there are many ethical questions being raised based on the beliefs of the masses. Since this area of technology is progressing at a great pace and the applications are becoming more and more diverse, it is not so far in the future when they will have made it into our day-to-day lives. Hence, the public opinion on the subject is ought to be taken to check for the acceptance of the applications.
Our project is based on making industrial benefit in production of spider silk using E.Coli. bacteria. It is about minimization of production cost of spider silk using E.Coli. bacteria by introducing concept of extracellular secretion of spider silk by cloned E.coli.
As a part of our online knowledge sharing campaign, to understand the views of common man about applications of synthetic biology, we published two surveys . The first survey is essentially focused on getting broad overview of understanding of Synthetic Biology among common people. The second survey aimed at understanding the popular opinion regarding silk and its uses and potential applications of our idea.
First Survey
Our first survey aspires to establish a dialogue is first step to understand the needs and sentiments of community to gather their ethical, financial and social perspective which effectively communicated to scientists and policy makers will result in focused development in research. We received an overwhelming number of responses for this survey (more than 200 responses).Based on the information collected, we also performed the following series of statistical analyses to draw critical and relevant inferences from the point of view of a sustainable and efficient implementation of our project idea.
Second Survey
This survey aims at understanding the popular opinion regarding silk and its uses, and the potential applications of our idea.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest AdhesionTest_-_-_TEXT.html," to mutagenise B0034-BFP [BBa_K592024] to make it compatible with RFC25. It was designed to get an ATG followed by an NgoMIV site upstream of the BFP CDS. The original ATG from the BFP CDS was removed. In the end we would still have to mutagenise BFP, because we never got the RFC25 assembly to work.
Results
Mutagenesis of BFP into RFC25 was successful, verified by sequencing. All other constructs were not successful. Mainly because we had trouble with the RFC25-assemblies. The mutagenesis to remove TACTAG also failed because the reverse primer annealed to a region upstream of the desired site causing a frameshift verified by sequencing. The repeat-like sequence of the 60bp linker was probably one of the reasons for this.

Best Hardware Special Prize
iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.
To compete for the Best Hardware prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," antibiotics such as Streptomycin, Gentamicin, Oxytetracycline, Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol, and Doxycyline. Streptomycin is the antibiotic of choice for most treatments but due to its high toxicity its use is usually stopped after five to ten days and switched with less toxic antibiotics. Upon diagnosis, immediate isolation is required for at least two days to allow antibiotic treatment to take effect.
Virulence Factors
Some of the most common virulence factors of Y. pestis include serum resistance, the Fraction 1 capsule, the Ysc type three secretion system, and the secreted toxin/effector suite of proteins called YOPs.
Serum resistance is the ability of Y. pestis to resist complement-mediated lysis since it must be able to survive (and/or grow) in blood; the primary mean of infection. An integrated pMT1 gene allows for complete resistance to complement lysis. Y. pestis is resistant even in the presence of antibodies and is chromosomally encoded. The rough or short lipopolysaccharide of Y. pestis appears to mediate this resistance.
Fraction 1 is the name given to a potent antigen of the human blood stream. Unfortunately, Y. pestis possesses the ability to form a large gel like capsule around itself to prevent the antigen from binding to it. This form of resistance also coincides with Y. pestis’ ability to resist phagocytosis.
The Ysc type three secretion, evolutionarily based off modifications from the flagular membrane proteins, injects unfolded Yop factors into cells attempting phagocytosis of the bacteria.  These factors then fold into active configurations and specifically interact with multiple targets throughout the cell.  Some of the known actions of the Yops are to disrupt or alter signalling pathways, disrupt phagocytosis, and cause apoptosis of the cell.

Why ABCD?
These computational tools (detailed listed in figure below, Figure reproduced from The second wave of synthetic biology: from modules to systems ) are designed to facilitate the scientists in wet lab in purpose of saving time and cost. On the other hand, standardization components provide a powerful tool for engineering biological systems in lab even in future industrial factories. In other words, all the current efforts are put to assist the scientists and could never replace the intelligence of human beings who are the leading roles in designing experiments and mathematical models.
Is it possible to move further to the steps of intelligence? Is it possible to generate the design protocol and list feasible biobricks? Is it possible to make design of biological networks a funny game even for laymen who know little about synthetic biology? Even not that further, is it possible to suggest different topologies of network that can achieve desired functions? Is it possible to tune an existing network to perform new functions? Is it possible to make a biological network more robust against uncertainties?
Another unavoidable challenge is to fill the gap between dry design and wet experiment. Is it possible to guarantee our design solution biologically significant? Is it possible to propose several “strong” examples to illustrate availability and efficiency of our idea?
Here, we try our best to challenge these seemingly impossibilities and make them possible. We hope our software could be cradle where amazing happens. We don't mean we are on the summit of pyramid of computational synthetic biology and it’s of little significance to say whose work is more important or not. Instead, a vast of collaborations are needed among computational scientists, biologists and engineers. As we described in our flowcharts, ABCs of ABCD, relevant tools are strongly needed to cope with difficulties we meet separately.

Episode 1: The stray cats roaming in the city is actually a very serious problem in many parts of the world because they can transmit diseases, annoy human by their calls for mate and disrupt the ecological stability. The current solutions to the stray cat problem are not very effective.
GBC Documentary P1
Episode 2: The idea of our human practice and hardware design—‘the kitty wonderland’ emerged when we heard that capturing stray cats is difficult and we found the potential of nepetalactone to attract cats. However, to make the ‘wonderland’ come true is hard. This episode starts with a stray cat seeing our hardware and sighs light-heartedly.
GBC Documentary P2
Episode 3: We collaborated with professional designers in a maker space—X.factory to consolidate our design of the ‘kitty wonderland’. We have made several improvements.

South China Regional Meeting
Where: Shenzhen University
When: 6 May
Hosted by: SZU_China
Officially presenting our project mCATNIP to other iGEMers for the first time, we introduced the key element in project design — chassis specialization, and our human practice plan for applying the microbial catnip to feral cats rescue. Many questions have been asked regarding the human practice of mCATNIP: why is this method better than the existing ones, what if the use of catnip increased the level of aggression among feral cats etc. We were very glad to hear suggestions from other teams. Meanwhile, we listened to the presentation of other teams and exchanged opinions.

Figure 8.There is a high variability in the treatment cost of diabetes even within the European economic zone. Kanavos, Aardweg and Schurer (2012) summarise the cost of just Medicines, In- and Out-Patient Care to an individual, per year;
Germany - €5,899
UK - €5, 470
France - €54,32
Italy - €2, 756
Spain - €1, 708
Unlike most of the rest of the world, these price distinctions roughly translate to the purchasing power of each country's citizens. Gallup’s gross median household income elucidates the highly targeted nature of pricing in this market; [31]
Germany - €28, 343
UK - €26, 884
France - €25, 818
Italy - €17, 078
€18, 671
Figure 9.Europe’s familiarity with Diabetes management has allowed more comprehensive studies of the disease’s effect on society.. When an illness such as Diabetes affects all aspects of life, it creates significant externalities on society’s ability to function. Kanavos, Aardweg and Schurer (2012) give quantitative examples of these costs, adjusted to 2010; Diabetic Retinopathy/Blindness (10-28.7% patients, with 0.5-3.7% blinded);
Average cost of Blindness =  €1,589 per eye,
Foot Disease (1.5-9.9% patients);
Average cost of Treatment without inpatient care = €840/monthly and €2,772/monthly with inpatient care.
Highest cost for amputation/rehabilitation
Cardiovascular Disease - including angina (16%), myocardial infarctions (1-8%), stroke (1.7-7%), ischemic heart disease and heart failure (6.3-11%);
Diabetes results in 6-23% greater costs. Treatment costs range from €2,100 - €9,767.

Procedure
We organised a debate on the following motion ""This house would allow environmental release of genetically modified bacteria for applications in the following fields: medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, energy, bioremediation"".
Style
Debates have been organized over and over in iGEM. To be more origininal, we decided to use one of the codified debating style used by French debating clubs. This is the FDA style, also referred to as ""Paris 5 Debating Style"". Let me briefly run through the main features. There are 2 teams of 5 speakers. One team is assigned to be in favor of the motion (government side), the other team to be against the motion (opposition side). The first speaker of the government will speak, then the first speaker of the opposition, and so on. Speakers can be interupted by POI's, that is, in the form of a question made to a speaker by a member of the opposing team. The speaker may or may not accept the point, but is obliged to accept at least one and is expected to accept two during his or her speech. Speeches are 6 minutes long. The motion is annouced one week in advance.
Debators
Participants were students members of french debating clubs. There was a very big diversity in terms of background, though no synthetic biologist.
On the side of the proposition we had, in order of speech:
Mister Ivan PALENICK, from the buisness school ""Ecole Supérieure de Commerce Paris""
Mister Charles PARTINGTON, from the engineering school ""Ecole Centrale Paris""
Miss Xinglu LIN, from the institute of political study ""Sciences Po Paris""
Miss Alix MOMMEJA, from the law school ""Paris II - Assas"" AND from the buisness school ""Ecole Supérieure de Commerce""
Mister Omar LAYACHI, from the egineering and military school ""Ecole Polytechnique de Paris""
On the side of the opposition we had, in order of speech:
Mister Aurélien GLEYZE, from the engineering school ""Ecole Centrale Paris"" AND from the institute of political study
Mister Max FATHI, a PhD student in mathematics at the ""Ecole Normale Supérieure-Ulm""

The above picture is about the change of cell population with time, you can see that when I turn on the light, the population will decrease; when I turn off the light, the population will grow. So we can approximately get a conclusion that through light's control of cell movement, we can control the growing rate of the whole population.
How to explain this phenomenon in a cellular level? The light will inhabit cell's free moving, which prevent the cells from contacting the surface. And in fact, you can also observe the slight delay, which is a reasonable result considering the do many different states of cells.

USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," including no GFP response and strong GFP response. Because the interval we set is small, we define sensitivity according to the logarithmic nicotine concentration as the equation below
Equation 3 Sensitivity of GFP signal to nicotine input
Due to the application of difference without the calculation of limit value, the sensitivity value is not completely same as the real differential coefficient of GFP intensity-nicotine input curve. To increase the accuracy and smooth the sensitivity-nicotine curve, the sampling interval of log10 nicotine is set to 0.001.
Figure 5 GFP concentration vs nicotine
Figure 6 Signal sensitivity vs nicotine
The variation between promoter 1 strength may influence the GFP signal response to nicotine input, so we select three groups for comparison: 0.1 (group1), 0.5 (group2) and 1 (group3). Figure 5 shows the change of GFP maximal concentration with different nicotine input. All three groups have two bursts in the curve, which means that there are two regions with high sensitivity. This phenomenon is also reflected by figure 6. When nicotine input is between 1e-3.8and 1e-3 M, three groups have very strong sensitivity. The left boundary of the interval is the threshold of the sensing system, which is about 1e-3.8 M for group 2/3, and 1e-3.6 M for group 1. But for the second burst, the interval of the three groups vary a lot. The burst interval of the three groups is [1e-3.2, 1e-2] M, [1e-2.7, 1e-1.3] M and [1e-2.3, 1e-1] M separately. This difference of sensitivity distribution means that we can select specific promoter 1 strength to achieve high sensitivity and precision sensing and measurement in the defined nicotine input range. This idea can be developed to a new application in our future work.
Time point of signal processing
In the experiment, we need to choose the appropriate time to measure the GFP signal to determine the existence and concentration of nicotine in the medium. Besides, to collect the maximal quantity of final product, it is important to select the time point when 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine reaches highest concentration. This session we simulate the change of GFP/NicA2/3-Succinoyl-Pyridine and identify the start time of observable GFP signal and the duration time of GFP signal and NicA2 high expression.

Sequencing results came back positive for the Gibson cloning of hph, so a culture of the successful Gibson colony was made.  pC13AH was transformed and plated, and pC13K were miniprepped.  pC13X, pC13F, pC13Z were digested with SpeI and PstI along with pC13P (XbaI/PstI), and all were column purified.  Reran a PCR of pC13M and pC13E, and one of pC13K with standard biobrick primers.  All PCRs were cleaned, then run on a gel along with pBARGPE1 which had been digested with NotI. pC13E and pC13M looked good, but pC13K was too short. pBARGPE1 had a 4kb fragment (super-coiled) and pBARGPE1 with NotI had a 5-6kb fragment, meaning it has a NotI site. Ligations of pAK13D to inserts pC13Z, pC13X, and pC13F along with vector pC13P to inserts pC13Z, pC13X, and pC13F were performed.  Also, overnight digestions of pC13M, pC13E, and pC13K with XbaI and PstI were set up.  Transformation was attempted for pC13AI and pA13AJ, but  the cuvettes weren't cleaned properly so it failed.  Finally, our dwindling supplies prompted the ordering of more SpeI and membrane filters.
The Gibson sequencing came back positive! We then digested pC13X, pC13F, pC13Z and pC13P, and ligated pAK13D to inserts pC13Z, pC13X and pC13F, and pC13P to inserts to inserts pC13Z, pC13X and pC13F. We ran a PCR for pC13M, pC13E and pC13K. Sadly pC13K did not work… Transformation was attempted for pC13AI and pA13AJ but they both failed--we suspected that the cuvettes weren't cleaned properly.

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

⑧ Pulse-Width-Modulation Control
Converter adopts fixed-frequency to modulate.
⑨Overcurrent Protection
The overcurrent protection circuit is provided to trigger the overcurrent protection on the condition that the inner overcurrent indicator is set to true when current overloads.
⑩ Thermal Shutdown
When the junction temperature is higher than the shutdown temperature, voltage parameter will be set to ground and “high-side” MOSFET will be shut down. Controlled by soft-starting circuit, chip will restart when the temperature is 14℃ lower than the shutdown point. They are able to gain the stable voltage within the gap of 5V and input the voltage into the amplifying circuit of themselves through this circuit. So this circuit secures the stability of the amplifying circuit and makes exploitation easier for them.
Verifying the accessibility and the portability of the device
Besides the voltage stabilizing module we optimized for them, LZU-China also sent us the major components of their “Micro Holmes” device (including the pcDuino board, the voltage magnification circuit board, the analogue-to-digital Conversion chip, and the touch screen). So we can help them verify the accessibility and the portability of their device. According to their specification, we successfully connected these electronic components, start the device and tested the software pre-installed in their pcDuino board. Although most functions of their device can work normally, there were also some small bugs. For example, in the “initialization” UI, they put the “concentration” title in front of the “Output Voltage”. We reported these bugs to them, and they correct them.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,", we considered fluorescence spectroscopy as tested by Parker et al. (2008), where 410nm output was indicative of iron incorporation as per assembled ferritins.
Apart from using magnetism to manipulate magnetoferritin to isolate pathogenic DNA, we developed a backup approach. Watt et al. (2012) constructed a nanoscale battery where ferritins with two different cores were oxidized and reduced on gold electrodes. We are contemplating using a split TALE capture system to bring ferritin into close association of an electrode. Current could then flow from ferritin into an electrode to indicate binding of pathogenic DNA. Finally, we considered how we might construct a magnetic device to isolate ferritin. Bushart et al. (2006) discussed method for isolating metal chelating magnetoferritin for metal purification. However, the necessary magnetic field strengths, mesh density, or mass of isolated compounds in these systems were not explicit. Thus, we are still uncertain about the feasibility of using magnetism to isolate proteins attached to magnetoferritin.
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
The application of ferritin in our project has changed substantially. Due to uncertainties of using magnetism to isolate proteins attached to ferritin, our team proposes instead to use it as a nanoscale protein scaffold. Our team was inspired by the work of REFERENCE et al. (2011) who used gold nanoparticles bound to ssDNA to detect DNA in a lateral flow strip assay.
We have decided to modify the aforementioned system. We’ll replace gold nanoparticle with ferritin and ssDNA with TALEs targeted to pathogenic E. coli markers. These nanoparticles will bind pathogen DNA via TALEs, be drawn up through a strip via capillary action, and become immobilized with complementary TALEs affixed to other regions on the strip. A reporter marker will also be fused to the recombinant ferritins to allow visualization of the pathogenic DNA.
This system is unique since double stranded sample DNA could be detected without having to first melt the DNA. Cheap prototypes for such a system could be constructed and would be suitable for cost constraints in the beef industry. Moreover, this system is amenable to scale-up for the identification of multiple pathogenic markers on a single lateral flow strip. We are, however, unsure as to what to use as a reporter enzyme.
We also met with two U of C professors in nanoscience to discuss the feasibility of our magnetism idea. Dr. Max Anikovskiy, an instructor from the nanoscience program, allowed us to use"

6/9/11
- Finished the tabbed search today.  Jenhan is going to integrate this search into the BioFab IDE.  Also, I began categorizing and testing different invertase designs.  Thus far, my categories include the following:
1.  Reconfigurable Sites
- placing invertases inside invertases in order to switch their directionality and continue to use them even though they flip.
Pros - reusable sites, might be most easily generalized
Cons - requires extra invertases, requires more steps (added invertases) to get to certain permutations
2.  Preemptive Sites
- placing inverases such that they are NOT FACING THE CORRECT DIRECTION in anticipation of a flip that will give them the correct directionality.
Pros - requires less sites than Protected Site Method
Cons - probably harder to generalize than Protected Sites
3.  Quick Start Sites
- placing invertases such that any part in the design can be quickly moved to the starting position of the order.  While testing different ideas, I found that the permutations that required the most invertases added (i.e. the most transformations) were those that placed the final part of the original design at the beginning of the design.  For example, if our original part order is ABCD, permutations beginning with C and D required the most number of invertases to be added.
Pros - might lower the number of transformations
Cons - i haven't investigated this closely enough to specify the cons
If all of these categories can be generalized to an algorithm, our GUI could offer the user the ability to try different methods which might be interesting.
6/10/11
- Today I began working on an Invertase Simulator.  It will take in your design and generate a list of permutations by trying every set of inputs (all permutations).  I will update the notebook more when I make progress on this tool.
6/13/11
- I have developed two useful tools that we can use to test designs.  The first takes in a particular design and a sequence of input invertases.  It shows each inversion as each invertase is added and also tells the user if certain inversions cannot be made.  The second tool builds on top of this first tool.  It takes in a particular design and tests every permutation/combination of inputs for that design.  Based on the results of these tests it tells the user whether their placement of invertases allows for each part permutation to be made.
The notations for both of these tools is the following:

UNIPV-Pavia,2010,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Project#solution_-_-_TEXT.html," to create tags for proteins, while PHB can be used as the affinity matrix.
In literature, it has also been shown that the Phasin-tagged fusion protein's affinity with PHA granules can be improved by increasing the number of Phasins in the fusion protein.
The Ralstonia eutropha‘s Phasin coding sequence, <partinfo>K208001</partinfo>, was already present in the Registry in Silver standard. However, at the end of this gene there was a TGA stop codon which prevents the usage of this Phasin as a head or internal domain.
In order to overcome this problem, <partinfo>K208001</partinfo> has been improved for fusion protein applications by mutagenesis through PCR using custom primers. Two new BioBrick parts were built and submitted to the Registry:
<partinfo>BBa_K300002</partinfo>: Phasin - head domain (removed stop codon; Assembly Standard 10 prefix; Silver Standard suffix)
<partinfo>BBa_K300003</partinfo>: Phasin - internal domain (removed stop codon; Silver Standard prefix; Silver Standard suffix)
These two new parts allow the construction of composite synthetic affinity tags, built by assembling an arbitrary number of Phasins (it has been shown that a better affinity is achieved by fusing of two or more Phasins). In this work a flexible linker sequence (<partinfo>BBa_K105012</partinfo>) that connects the Phasins has also been used in order to test if it can improve or facilitate the binding and folding of the tag.
PHA production
PHA production in R. eutropha is achieved by the PhaCAB operon, which contains three genes, phbC, phbA and phbB, each encoding for an enzyme essential for the formation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB, a kind of polyhydroxyalkanoate) inclusions. In literature, the production of PHB has already been achieved in E. coli by incorporating the PhaCAB operon. The PHB granules produced by engineered E. coli can be used as an affinity matrix for Phasin-based affinity tags and the binding of the Phasin-tagged protein of interest can occur in vivo.
Several parts for PHB production are present in the Registry: in the past iGEM editions, the Duke (2008 and 2009), Hawaii (2008), Tsinghua (2008), Virginia (2008) teams worked on it and submitted a set of BioBrick parts"
British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Teamtest_-_-_TEXT.html," skills for my major and also get started on the modelling and the other computational aspects of microbiology and immunology. I also want to connect with other scientists in UBC and get to know UBC faculty and students.
What inspires you:
I am very inspired by the scientists that combine their information on different fields and solve big problems. I like the fact that by looking from different perspectives or approaching a problem in an entirely new way, it is possible to derive solutions- solutions that wouldn't possibly be solved  with the cumulative knowledge on one specific field. This makes me think that there is no challenge or problem that cannot be solved.
Desired impact on the world:
I want to create cures and drugs for autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases by not only using laboratory skills but also computer generated modeling.
Hobbies:
I appreciate every aspect of music. I like improving my classical music skills and participate in classical music activities such as performing Beethoven's 9th with Vancouver Symphony Orchestra as a member of UBC Choral Union. I also like spending time on Youtube and finding out news/improvements around the globe.

These pieces were run on a gel providing some strange unclear results on the image below.

- Streaked 3 plates from -20 degrees Celsius stock (Bba_R2000, Bba_R0040, and Bba_I13453)
Week 6: 7/9-7/15
- Visited MIT
- A few of the team members went to talk to MIT's postdoc, Jonathan to troubleshoot our ligation and transformation issues. He suggested checking our gel extraction samples, using a different transformation and ligation protocol.
- We thought there may be an issue with out TOP10 competent cells. As a result, we transformed ligation reactions in TOP10 competent cells and commercial cells to see if that was affecting our results. We noticed that once the cells were spun down the pellet of cells was much larger for the commercial cells as opposed to the TOP10 cells made by us. Unfortunately, nothing grew on the plates.
- Ligation reactions were attempted again between the YFP composite and various promoters.
- Since we thought that the backbones might be re-ligating with itself, we decided to use CIP on the backbone, which dephosphorylates the backbone. These reactions/samples had to be run through a gel, extracted, and quantified.
- Ligation reactions were made with CIP on the backbone and without CIP, using quick ligase. These reactions were transformed onto plates, but unfortunately did not grow.
Week 7: 7/16-7/22
As a team, we brainstormed ideas on how to find the right combination for ligation protocol between reaction time and ligation ratios.

WorldShaper Wuhan
We are team WorldShaper Wuhan . We are a team consist of seven high school students who has lofty ideals. Our target is to discover a new way to improve the degree of accuracy and efficiency of colorectal cancer early detection. Our instructor is Professor Zhou from Wuhan University. We have been doing some researches and experiments in the lab of pathogeny biology department of Wuhan University and have attained some decent achievement. This web is a brief introduction of what our team has done and how is it going to help the field of cancer detection.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html,". Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

But of course, we did not forget that we are iGEMers,                         so it was ineludible to talk with them about Synthetic                         Biology and all benefits that this field can contribute                         to society to make a better world. First of all, they                         were enquired about their ideas of what Synthetic                         Biology is, and we explained them the repercussion of                         biotechnology research on society with some fascinating                         examples. Nevertheless, we wanted them to catch the                         motivation and desire for creativity, so we proposed                         them to create their own organisms by using Synthetic                         Biology principles and all their imagination.
It has been clearly an enrichment experience for both                         children and us, which has provided us a different                         point of perception of biological sciences and how to                         face the problems with creative and innovative                         solutions. We must maximize children’s potential,                         because every child is a scientist.
It is never too late to learn
Fear of innovation comes from ignorance. We believe                         that rejection of science advances as synthetic biology                         or crop improvement happen because non-expert people                         don’t know how these innovations works or what can they                         do for us now and in the future. For that reason, we                         decided to give a talk about synthetic biology. Its                         title was ""Learning to program life"".
The talk was given in a pub, as part of the initiative                         “Skepticals in the Pub” in Valencia, were each Friday                         people interested in the topic of the day reunite in a                         pub to learn more about the subject. The relaxed                         ambient and the dynamic talks serve as appeal for many                         people to go to the pub and learn about science by                         listening to experts in the field. Even if we are not                         true experts, we thought that our team was prepared to                         show how synthetic biology works and what impressive                         things can be done with it.
Press
One of our proudest publications about our project is our post in the PLoS Blog, where we could explain and present our project in a specialized blog. Hopefully, our post could have reached many people which can be interested: HYPE-IT by Valencia UPV iGEM, Plos Blogs.
As a result of our social impact, many                             newspapers and webpages have published about                             HYPE-IT project. Many of them have highlighted the                             potential of the whole project, as well as the fact                             that all of us are high performance students.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#TeamMember_-_-_TEXT.html," Kiser
Kendall Kiser is homozygous negative for the “get-PCR-right-the-first-time” gene.  Labmates marvel that he was ever admitted to an institution of higher learning.  He insists that he’s “like, way smart” and “if PCR were baseball, I’d go 1 for 20 and still make a million bucks, so there.” He sticks his tongue out like he’s three.  This childishness is to blame for the entire children’s book text.
By other descriptions, he’s a Spanish-speakin’, piano-playin’ soccer-strikin’ neuroscience nerd.  Kendall’s left-handed talent for calligraphy is legendary, and entirely useless in an age of word processing software.
Darren Lasko
Darren Lasko is from Reno, Nevada. He is majoring in Microbiology and wants to go to Medical School, because he thinks it's cool. Darren is always the person in the lab who picks up the slack and gets the job done. When everything goes wrong, he'll lighten the mood. Darren also enjoys watching the Bachelorette, and is a real ladies man!
Xiuqi (Jade) Li
There are only three parts to Jade's schedule: in the lab, on her way to the lab, or thinking about the lab. What can you say? She is a total lab junkie. Between iGEM and a Cancer Research Fellowship, Jade spent more time in the lab than outside it this summer. Being cooped up all day in a small room that most students are not aware of its existence, Jade is disappointed that she missed her chance of absorbing as much Vitamin D as possible during the best part of the year. But at least she got to make something ""explode"" safely in a biology lab (see picture on the right).
Jade challenges everyone to guess what she is holding in the picture. If you can get it right in one try, she will offer you a piece of the famous BYU mint truffles!

Question 2: What ideas or suggestions do you have for our project?
Answer: The starting point of your project is very good. According to my understanding, the registry on iGEM online does have a lot of deficiencies, and some information even has errors. So, this is indeed a problem which is both distressing and worth solving. As for the suggestion, after the user finishes searching for the information of the biobrick, you can also provide some other biological components related to the biobrick. In addition, when searching for biobricks in the database, I hope that you can provide more ways and means to make it more convenient for users.
Talking with Gene Technology company and Professor in NUDT
On 3rd Aug, our members went to Chengdu life baseline technology co. LTD and interviewed engineers who is working on a database. They gave us useful suggestions on the optimizing of details. One of the engineers shared his experiences on the construction of database.
At CCiC, we had honor to get acquaintance to Professor Zhu in NUDT. He encouraged us to keep working on our database and he suggested that we should classify the biobricks by species.
“You can build the prediction results into a database. So, when users can't find what they need, they can use this as a reference.” —Engineer Xu of Chengdu Life-Baseline Technology Company
“In my opinion, you better assort the data by organism, which makes your database more convenient.” —Professor Zhu in NUDT
5th CCiC and Southwestern Union
We took part in 2 big conferences in China held for iGEMers to share experiences and communicated with each other. In the meantime, it’s a good chance to be acquainted with iGEM teams and collaborated with them.
The 5th CCiC was held in ShanghaiTech University with over 500 people participated. On this conference, we gained valuable advice and we first brought our project and many teams gave us their suggestions.
Southwestern Union was established for many universities in southwestern of China. Not only universities, but high school teams joined in it.

After second round collection of suggestions, we improved our project and our interval test version was finished.
Internal test & Feedbacks
We sent our internal test version to many iGEM teams and doctors and they gave us their feedback of using it. These feedbacks will be the supportive advice for further improvement. Meanwhile, we noted that some teams encountered some difficulties in finding the data they need. Therefore, our database helped them find"

She designed a new primer, skipping the final terminator because there will be another terminator in the Gibson-assembled plasmid.
Vincent and Alessandro did a colony PCR with Taq polymerase using the K1 transformations done on Thursday. The C5 transformations yielded a small number of colonies. The gel result is below. The bright bands correspond to K1-T7-const-RFP, K1-T7-lac-FRP, K1-T7-lac2-RFP.
After noticing the poor results for the lysis, Alessandro and Vincent realized that they had set the extension PCR extension time to 1 minute rather than the 2 that are needed for the lysis cassette (which has a length of 2 kb).

Saturday, 20 August
As part of Friday's Colony PCR, Alessandro and Vincent had made liquid cultures and made separate, dedicated plates for each colony that was used. Since the Colony PCR had successfully amplified the K1-T7-RFP plasmids, Vincent brought out those liquid cultures, made glycerol stocks of them, mini-preppred them with the new mini-prep kit, and recorded the resulting DNA concentrations. With these DNA tubes, he went ahead and made a transformation of the three plasmids into BL21 cells (which Alessandro had made throughout the past week). Vincent plated these transformed cells on kanamycin plates and incubated them overnight.
Since the previous day's Colony PCR had partly failed due to an extension time for lysis that was too short (1 minute rather than 2 minutes), Vincent made a Colony PCR for K1-T7-Lysis and a Colony PCR for C5-T7-RFP and C5-T7-Lysis. Perhaps because it was almost 9 in the evening, Vincent did not realize that he had successfully amplified both the K1 and the C5 T7 lysis, showing that the Gibson Assembly had in fact worked as expected. He saw the primer"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

Math model
We had a meeting with several professors to help us get a better idea about the                                         whole math model and the reach our project could have.
Hardware
Models for skin chip were design using AutoCad and Catia softwares, the                                         modelations of flows were done and the materials needed were investigated.
Week 32nd
19 August- 25 August.
Summary
This week we had several advances into the software and hardware part of the                                         project. The protein curve production was analysed by polyacrylamide gel. The                                         first insights into RFP purification were obtained.
Wet lab
The protein curve was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel and the results obtained                                         were not good enough, several factors affected the quality of the gel. We                                         started with nano encapsulation of RFP and visualization of nanoparticles in                                         SEM microscoped.
Week 33rd
26 August- 1 September.
Summary
Our protein production began, we consulted a professor specialized on proteins                                         that gave us several tips on it. We reworked the hardware design as a final one                                         that is less expensive and more innovative, then we sent the design into a                                         company so the corp was made.
Wet lab
We created a new production protein curve and performed an analysis by                                         electrophoresis and Bradford quantification. The polyacrylamide gel was done at                                         20% to obtain a better separation of protein, although no significant                                         overproduction bands were seen. The quantification by Bradford methodology                                         showed a low quantity of protein in pellet centrifugation. This results made us                                         re-evaluate the lysis protocol and change the quantification methodology. We                                         made contact with a professor expert in recombinant protein production and we                                         obtained new crucial points for a new definitive curve. We made nano                                         encapsulation with RFP and saw it in SEM microscope, no structure was seen, we                                         started seeking for new methodologies for obtaining better resolution in the                                         results. We performed a new assay of in vitro skin burn in L-929 cell line.
Hardware
The manufacturing of the skin chip was investigated, the final material used for                                         this purpose was glass as it can be reused and can help labs to cut their                                         dependence in trash-able cell culture bottles. Several companies were contacted                                         in order to quote prices, and at the end the company “” was contacted to create                                         the skin chip carcass.

Docking SspB-ClpX
Goal
To generate an interaction model for the SspB-ClpX system used in our V sublab.
Background
In the ClpXP proteolysis model reported by McGinness et al (McGinnes et al, 2006) SspB acts as an adaptor protein which helps in the target protein degradation (general information of SspB is presented in table 1). This SspB protein interacts with the protease subunit ClpX. ClpX (information of this protein available in table 2) forms a protease complex with ClpP in which the target protein is degraded.
Table 1. Relevant information of SspB protein from Uniprot protein database entry B1XHK1 and the corresponding SspB Pfam database entry .
Table 2. Relevant information of ClpX protein from Uniprot protein database entry P0A6H1 and the corresponding ClpX Pfam database entry .
The complete structure of ClpX was published by Glynn (Glynn et al, 2009) and it is displayed in figure 1. This molecule acquires a homohexameric ring-like structure which allows the peptidic degradation process when interacting with ClpP, the other protease subunit.

By detecting large strongyles in pasture the large strongyle “buster” can help horse owners prevent their horses from getting infected since they can see which fields that are infected or not.
Worm culturing
The first step in obtaining live nematodes is the recovery of the eggs from the feces. This is done through filtration of the feces and different centrifugation steps with saturated salt water followed by a bleach containing solution to obtain sterile eggs. The eggs are successively stored in LB media for a period between 7 and 10 days to allow them to hatch and reach the third larval stage. After this process the large strongyles are divided from the small strongyles under a microscope and stored for successive use.
Transcriptomics and Phage Display
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we need to choose approaches that allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we chose two distinct approaches. For the first one, we’re doing transcriptomic analysis, which relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli for 2 or 3 hours and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA, which will reveal which genes are upregulated when the worm is next to the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!
The second approach utilizes libraries of phages expressing a set of peptides on their surface. By various rounds of incubation and washing, only phages specific to the strongyle will be found and sequencing of their genetic information will allow us to construct a peptide that is specific to surface markers of the nematode leading to creation of a biosensor
Reporter system
Once we have the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, we’ll have to be able to see what we’ve done! We plan on using fluorescent chromoproteins to be able to detect our worms in both grass and in feces. This would allow a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect our worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!
Proteomics
Contributing to the lack of Cyathostominae research
A second part will attempt to explore the known concerted action of the parasites. Seasonal encystation and emergence of larvae occurs in a coordinated fashion, so the hypothesis is that the encysted strongyles react to a signaling compound. To find possible candidates for this compound a strategy is employed in"

Creation of synthetic T-domains
All R scripts used in the following sections are based on R version R-3.0.1.   Different assumptions about the evolutionary conservation of T-domains were examined: i) conservation of a specific module across different species, ii) conservation of T-domains across different modules for the same species, iii) conservation of T-domains across different species,  iv) conservation of similar modules across different species. According to these three assumptions, different libraries of homologous protein sequences were generated using ncbi protein BLAST (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with standard parameters:
query sequence: indC; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction
query sequence: indC T-domain; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences within P. luminescens
query sequence: indC T-domain; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction
query sequences: indC, bpsA, entF, delH5 and tycC6; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction;

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Notebook.html_-_-_TEXT.html," engineer E.coli to deposit gold nanoparticles on the anode;
        3) Use a quorum sensing system to control gene expression of genes involved in gold deposition.
Ideas which emerged during the meeting concerned the following:
        ● would the electron transporter introduced affect bacterial metabolism?
        ● would the bacteria form biofilms on the anode? Could this be avoided by expressing pilli?
        ● what is the gold concetration needed and where would we take it from? Possible  solution: pharmaceutical waste rich in gold ions, which would also allow the safe removal of toxic ions from the environment
        ● other metals have been discussed, as alternatives to gold, such as copper and silver. However, there are already genes which are involved in copper metabolism in bacteria, so their effects might interfere with our system.
        ● two bacterial strains could be used, living together inside the MFC, one for the electron secretion and one for the quorum sensing
May 1st
After the spring holiday, during which the team has worked from  home on iGEM, we had a n important  meeting with our supervisors.
We are considering using a peptide which can bind elemental gold, such as MIDAS, to create nanoparticles. We have discussed how to ensure the nanoparticles are deposited on the anode. There were several variants proposed:
        ● fuse the peptide to secreted protein and let the complex settle on the anode (by gravity or magnetism)
        ● fuse the peptide to surface proteins (such as OpmA) and then as above
        ● turn the whole chamber into a graphyte anode, to increase the chance of bacteria being trapped in the porous material and release nanoparticles there
        ● lyse bacteria once they have captured gold ions internally, to release the peptide, and then repopolate the MFC with the second bacterial strain, which secretes the MTR complex
        ● aqua regia was proposed as a source of gold ions for the initial stages of the project, as an alternative to pharmaceutical waste; the composition of the latter may vary between experiemtns and will prevent us from making controlled, accurate measurements between replicate experiments
May 15th
During today's meeting we discussed more the details of the peptides we want to create. We have looked into several secretion tags which we would like to fuse to the peptide. We have narrowed it down to two, for now. HlyA can transport small peptides outside bacteria (though our initial in silico simulations show the peptidic construct would not be very stable). We"

A. Finalized component average results for each component in varying inducer concentrations using our lab’s protocol. E. coli strain BL21 is designated by “BL,” and strain MG1655 is designated by “MG.” Values were obtained by taking the average of the fluorescence at each inducer concentration. Negative controls, which consist of the wildtype strain grown in each corresponding inducer concentration, were averaged and then subtracted from each component value. “R0010 BL” showed a 2x increase in fluorescence across inducer concentration; other components remained static.
B. Graph of finalized component average results with error bars showing standard deviations. R0010 in BL21 is designated by blue, R0010 in MG1655 orange, K314100 in BL21 gray, and K314100 in MG1655 yellow. No significant change in fluorescence was observed in any component other than R0010 expressed in BL21.
Additionally, we also used their protocol as a means to test the validity of the two parts. Similar to our protocol, stationary phase cultures were grown overnight. The following morning, those cultures were pipetted into their allocated rows with prepped, diluted inducer concentration corresponding to the appropriate column. The fluorescence values we measured followed no strict patterns and greatly differed from plate to plate. Since the deviations we obtained for each point were significant, the results from this experiment were inconclusive.

There are two kits: one freeze dried,   which permits the simplicity of manipulations and storage for high schools with low   budget, and one non-freeze dried, which permits for students to learn how to pipette   and make more elaborated experiments. At the same time, it would be equipped with a   detailed description of the experiments that could be performed with it as well as   suggestions as to which topics a biology teacher could cover with them. The ECFK is   a diverse toolbox suitable for demonstrating biological principles to all age groups,   as the teacher is free to provide the students with an adequate background for their   grade level.
We also reached out to our university’s biosafety department to make sure we   were complying with national safety requirements.

Professional Input on Viral Contenders
When the time came to test our software in previously unchartered territory    (eg. with new viruses), our first concern was finding a suitable ‘viral contender’.    It had to be present in a bodily fluid, if possible with high amounts of viral RNA    or DNA circulating. In order to make the best choice and detect a virus having a    high impact on today’s health landscape, we contacted several professionals form    different organizations and labs for their input. This included the following    scientists : Jacques Fellay whose lab is working on Human Genomics of infectious    diseases, virus-host interactions and translational genomics at EPFL; Samuel Cordey    from the Virology lab at HUG in Geneva; Bruno Correia heading the laboratory of    Protein Design and Immunoengineering at EPFL; and Didier Trono from the laboratory    of Virology and Genetics at EPFL.
Their suggestions for a relevant virus that needed quick detection as well    as our team brainstorming led us to single out the Hepatitis virus as a main    contender, of which we then chose genomic sequence unique to Hepatitis C,    genotype 1, as it is the most common of all Hepatitis C (HCV) genotypes.    Today, Hepatitis C is diagnosed by taking blood and liver samples that need    to be analyzed by a hospital laboratory. Our testing would dramatically reduce    the amount"
Johns_Hopkins-Software,2012,Team:Johns Hopkins-Software#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," did you manage to handle the safety issue?
    3. How could other teams learn from your experience?
AutoGene does not produce any new biobrick parts, and therefore presents no hazards or safety concerns in this regard.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
    1. If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
    2.  If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Johns Hopkins has an Institutional Review Board but our project does not require IRB approval.
4.    Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Since one of AutoGene’s modules is capable of quickly checking plasmids for features, this module can be extended to provide users with the ability to screen their sequences for potentially hazardous genes. We believe that producing simple, intuitive screening tools for hazardous sequences for future iGEM teams can help to reduce the chances of adding such parts to the registry. With efficient bioinformatics alignment algorithms, and the speed of cloud computing, this process can be made so that iGEM teams can effectively scan their newly created parts against a large database of pathogenic sequences with ease; in result, allowing iGEM to have screening as a major component of the competition.
While it is certainly true that this technique is applicable to the iGEM teams, this is also one of the main ideas we had for contributing to biosafety engineering. Through a pre-screening detection process similar to that found at an airport, new biological parts, devices, systems, can be scanned for unsafe components. Since DNA is the primary mode by which biological information is represented, a simple pre-screening process as described above is a reasonably easy and effective way of pointing out safety issues.

Innovation Forum of Stomatology Students 2017 in West China School of Stomatology
West China School of Stomatology Sichuan University is a country's top, world-class school in stomatology field. Every year there is a forum on research innovation to stimulate their students' interest   and to promote students' participation in scientific research. This year's Innovation Forum of Stomatology Students organized by the West-China School of Stomatology invited our team to share our project. It's a great honor for us to show our project to these excellent students. In addition, the synthetic biology and the iGEM competition are also introduced in detail. We encouraged these outstanding students participate in it sincerely.
Handbook of Hyperuricemia
By communicating with the doctors from West-China Hospital Sichuan University, we learned that most of the patients did not understand the knowledge of hyperuricemia, resulting in poor compliance and therapeutic effects in the course of treatment. Moreover, through the statistical analysis of the questionnaire survey from hyperuricemia patients, we found that the understanding degree and attention degree of the disease in patients with hyperuricemia were very scarce and they were in need of more education. Therefore, based on the above two reasons, we have made handbook to publicize knowledge of hyperuricemia to the public, and increase the understanding and attention to hyperuricemia.
Our handbook included what is hyperuricemia, the causes of hyperuricemia, relationship between hyperuricemia and gout, prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia, food purine content list, as well as our team and the introduction of our project. On the day of the scientific exhibition in the Chengdu library (see below), we sent out nearly 500 handbooks to passers-by, and answered to their questions patiently and detailedly. We sincerely hope that the public can strengthen the understanding and attention to hyperuricemia, which is not only beneficial to the therapeutic effects, but also is more conducive to improving the health level of the whole nation.

Education
Increasing knowledge for primary and secondary school pupils
The 27th and the 28th of September ""Ungforsk"" was arranged at the University. ""Ungforsk"" roughly translated means young science and was arranged for the 20th time. Secondary school pupils get to visit the University were they can visit labs and learn more about science. We were so lucky that we got to hold a total of six presentations for those who came to visit. Ragnhild, Paul, Marthe and Torleif held those seminars, and they did a really good job.
Torleif also handed out our comic book to Dokka VGS, the high school in the municipality of Nordre Land. Let's hope they'll get more excited about synthetic biology.
Increasing knowledge for new students at the university
The 30th of August and the 6th of September we held lectures for new biology students at the University. In addition to spreading the word about iGEM, we presented our project and told the new students of the problem of antibiotic resistance. We held three lectures each day and six in total. The students seemed very interested about iGEM, so we hope next years team will have loads of interested students. Marthe, Hans, Paul and Camilla held those lectures.
Roza and Marthe also held a lecture at Sundvolden the 22nd of August.
Increasing knowledge for master students
Ragnhild held a lecture the 16th of August for master students. It was held at Kristine Bonnevies house at the University and there were also pizza afterwards.
Learning material for high school students
The UiOslo team have used the iGEm season to teach synthetic biology to kids and high school students.  Because of this we have generated a 3D file for a bacteria. The idea behind this was to generate a bacteria that could be taken apart so one could have a look inside the bacteria, of what it contains and how it is build up.
The 3D-model is made in the online 3D-modelling software at https://www.tinkercad.com. The 3D-  model represent a E. coli bacterium and shows its DNA, plasmid, ribosomes, pili and flagellum. Unfortunately because of time limitations and technical difficulties, the 3D file was not printed.  However the 3D-model is available online, and we have given the file to the “Biologylab” at"
SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#officialjudging_-_-_TEXT.html," the 1980s, when the Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee was established, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were chosen as the three regulatory agencies for biotechnology.  Both of them did and do promote the use of GMOs. Authorization process of GMOs also belongs to these agencies, and their process is considered to be faster and more liberal than the one in the EU. This liberalism is also reflected by labeling GM products, which in the US is absolutely voluntary. “FDA determined that labeling was not required on the basis of the method of food production (i.e. genetic engineering), but only if the new food itself posed safety problems for consumers.” The barriers of this paper do not let the American jurisdiction to be presented in details, the objective was to give a brief compartment of the fundamental questions.
5. Conclusion
All 27 Member States of the European Union have signed and ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and thus undertook the duty “to improve methods of production, conservation and distribution of food by making full use of technical and scientific knowledge”  in order to ensure everyone’s right to be free from hunger. Also in the same covenant they recognized the fundamental scientific freedom by undertaking “to respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity”. Are Member States along with the Community really making full use of technical and scientific knowledge? It is not ours to decide, but considering the abovementioned circumstances, the United States seem to be a much more welcoming place for scientists working on GMOs and therefore outsourcing European jobs and loosing European scientists for the US is not really surprising. In this paper I presented the legal procedure of authorizing GMOs in the EU and placed it in a context to be comparable with the American government promotion of scientific innovations. Instead of collecting the short term benefits, the EU made a choice of values, and this should be respected.

Place all the tubes on the shaker at 37 Celsius.
After 20 minutes, take only the tube labeled 0 from the shaker. Take 1mL from this tube and pipette it into a cuvette labeled 0. Using 1mL of LB in a cuvette, blank the spectrophotometer at 600 OD. Then measure the absorbance of the cuvette labeled 0. (In the actual procedure, 2 readings were done on the tube labeled 0 to check for consistency. This means that the tube labeled 0 only had 8mL in it when the phage was added, which will slightly alter the phage to bacteria ratio for that tube.)
Remove the other two tubes after 30 minutes of incubation and add 87ul of T7 phage from the ""10ul 7.19 stock"" to each tube. (There should be a 1:10 phage to bacteria concentration. The calculations are as follows: The spectrophotometer reading was 0.435A, which indicates there are 2.175E8 bacteria/ml. Because there are 10ml in each tube, there is roughly 2.175E9 bacteria per tube. This means that we need 2.175E8 phage added to each tube. Because the 7.19 stock is concentrated at 2.5E9 phage/ml [5E7 phage/20ul], 87ul of phage will provide 2.175E8 phage.)
Incubate all the tubes on the shaker at 37 Celsius for 80 minutes.
Remove all the tubes and add 1mL of chloroform to each. Gently shake each tube and centrifuge it at 4000rpm for 10 minutes at 7 Celsius. Remove the supernatant from each tube with a pipette and place it in a new tube with the same label. Be careful not to get the chloroform or bacteria when you remove the supernatant.
Store the supernatants at 4 Celsius.
3) Spot test to determine phage concentration (8.14)
Dilution series -2 through -7 were performed all three samples (0, 200, and 500). These dilutions samples were then used in spot tests to estimate phage titer.
Specifically, three plates were prepared for spot tests using E. coli B by adding 0.5mL overnight into a tube, mixing it with 5m"
