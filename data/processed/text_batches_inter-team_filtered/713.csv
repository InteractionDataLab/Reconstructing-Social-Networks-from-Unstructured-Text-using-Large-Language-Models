Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#Prototype_-_-_TEXT.html," to pump the blood up from the container, so we will fill the syringe up with the blood before we attach it to the tubing. We also bought a plastic clear container that was $17.00 instead of cutting and assembling the plexiglass into a box.
Putting Our Prototype Together
For the assembly of our prototype we started off by drilling a hole in one of the sides and then we drilled another hole opposite of the first one so the tubing will go through the splash box. These holes were made into the shorter sides of the rectangular box. We cut the middle part of one of the longer sides so that the viewers can get a better view of the steak and our product being applied. We will fill the syringe up with blood from the blood container, then attach the medical tubing to the tip of the syringe. The medical tubing goes through the splash box and into our steak, then more medical tubing is attached to the other side of the steak and then out. At the end of the tubing there will be another container to collect the blood. Because we are not using a flow meter in our prototype to measure the pressure of the blood, we can qualitatively measure it by looking at the video that we took of our prototype in action, frame by frame.
Results
We have only done test runs of water and blood through our prototype, we haven’t tested our construct with it yet but we are planning to do that in the future. When we tested our prototype with water, we just filled a syringe full of water and attached it to the medical tubing that ran through our splash box. This was to see if the design of our prototype was successful or not. We ran it with the blood in our lab, for this we made a small incision in the medical tubing that was inside of our splash box. This simulated a wound site and this was successful as blood did gush out of the cut.
This video shows us using medical tubing with an incision in it to simulate a cut. Blood runs through the tubing and spurts out of the cut site. The end of the tubing is blocked with modelling clay and tape to prevent any blood from coming out of the end."

K343007
The part K343007 (from now on shortly called PS) is a generator for the SopII-HtrII photosensor from Natronomonas pharaonis coupled to E. Coli's chemotaxis pathway via the Salmonella enterica protein Tar. This part's effect on the system is to make E. Coli phototactic, so that it becomes aware of different light conditions. So for characterization of this part we made examination of motility and motility patterns our first priority and plasmid stability and growth of the cells our second.
There is a wide range of motility assays for chemotaxis in bacteria, this meant that we had a broad spectrum of experiments to choose from, which just had to be tweaked for making them suited for the analysis of phototaxis. The two experiments we chose for analysing the effect of this part (PS), were growth of the bacterial cultures in semi-solid agar and computer analysis of swimming motility through video microscopy.

∴ GFP synthesis rate of 104 = 1.3 x 2232 = 2902 molecules per min per cell
Assume 1 molecule in an E.coli cell gives a concentration of 1nM.
∴ GFP synthesis rate of 104 = 2902 x 1nM = 2.9x10-6nM/min per cell
Plasmid copy number assumed as 200 (as in derivation 1)

Possible reasons for an inability to obtain this approval could be due to lack of capital to do so, time pressures, or technical details of our technology that cannot be modified to meet requirements for both. In order to mitigate this risk, we have developed two strategies:
Should the accreditation process take longer than expected, we will utilize our other marketing strategy which involves targeting individual companies and environmental groups for monitoring outside of government-mandated regulation. Although this may present a smaller market opportunity, this would allow us to generate some initial revenue while we navigate the accreditation process.
If the process proves to be overly time- or resource-dependent, we may decide to completely change our target market. We have developed our product to make use of a versatile detector platform.  This not only facilitates development of additional cartridge systems for targeting additional compounds of interest, but will let us easily move into other markets. As such, should we encounter significant difficulties in meeting regulatory standards in the oil and gas sector, we may find that minor changes to our engineered strains will allow us to focus in on additional, less-regulated markets.  An example of this is in the waste water management industry.
Outside of the regulatory domain, other legal risks could involve the potential for lawsuits filed against us should our product cause harm. Strategies to mitigate these risks will involve obtaining proper insurance (i.e. business liability and product liability insurance). In addition, should our product not work as expected, we plan to offer a full refund to customers. As adoption by key players in the industry seems to influence large-scale adoption in the oil and gas sector, this would be necessary in order to maintain our image and bolster our sales among potential customers
Market Risks
As with any early venture, market risks are always important to consider. Particularly as our product will have a significant time to market with first sales projected for late 2016, changes to market demand could impact the success of our company significantly. In order to mitigate this serious risks, we have employed several strategies. We have developed a partnership with a large prospective customer, HydroQual Laboratories. Through sustaining detailed discussions and eventual testing of our prototypes with them, we are helping to ensure that our design continues to meet industry needs. In addition, as mentioned above, we may also make use of our versatile platform sensing system to move into other, more stable markets such as industrial food processing.
An additional possible risk is that our product does make use of a genetically modified organism. Although we have taken every step possible to ensure that our final product will be safe to use and will not pose any environmental concerns"

dr. Maarten Merkx
Maarten Merkx (1970) studied chemistry (cum laude) at the Radboud University Nijmegen and did his PhD with Prof. Averill (University of Amsterdam, 1995-1999) studying metalloenzyme catalysis. He was a Human Frontier of Science Program (HFSP) post-doctoral fellow with Prof. Stephen J. Lippard (MIT, Cambridge, USA) studying methane monooxgenases. His current research as an associate professor in the BMT department focuses on the development of protein-based switches, which include fluorescent sensors for intracellular imaging of small molecules, photo-switchable proteins, and protein-based sensors for antibody detection. Another important topic is the engineering of multivalent protein and peptides architectures to generate highly specific capture ligands for molecular imaging and diagnostics. He obtained several prestigious grants, including young investigator grants from the HFSP and the Netherlands Organization"

CAL, CMP and AFT made a batch of digested pSB1C3 backbone.
CAL and CMP did a digest verification of test part (p032) that consist of single chain avidin and amilCP with his-tag. This part will be used to test the single chain avidin binding with biotin beads and how it is affected by snake venom. CAL and CMP made an assembly of unregistered composite part this time with a different ratio in the ligation. Unsuccessful assembly.
CAL and CMP annealed primer sequences from IDT in order to make double stranded DNA coding different peptide chains cleaved by different snake venoms. It was a success.
CAL and CMP did assembly of all peptide chains parts within the backbone. These are the following parts BBa_K2355006, BBa_K2355008, BBa_K2355014, BBa_K2355015, BBa_K2355025, BBa_K2355026, BBa_K2355032, BBa_K2355033,  BBa_K2355037 and BBa_K2355039.

OUR MINDSET
The start of every venture begins with research. Before we began, we only had general knowledge of  hydroponics, and a limited understanding of oxidative stress damage and benefits. These topics, however, are fundamental to how Oxyponics works and how it will be applied. We knew we needed to understand the intricacies of the problem, the industry we were trying to break into, the needs and wants of the end users, the science behind the design, the environmental impact of our system, and the communities that would be affected by advances in hydroponics.
We set out on a mission to interact with, learn from, and integrate feedback from scientists in the field, existing businesses, our end users, and community leaders. We implemented the principles of design thinking to: first, identify the problem to be solved; second, go to the users to find how to solve the problem in the best way; and third, get user feedback on what we developed.
We developed our project using the expertise and personal accounts of the individuals we spoke to, from the beginning stages of conceptualization to the end creation of our project.
We simultaneously conducted interviews best organized into five categories, seen in the tabs below. Interviews in each category were conducted with interwoven timelines that spanned the development of our project. This method let us organically gain insights about a large range of aspects relevant to OxyPonics, and led us to see how far-reaching our project was, even beyond just improving plant growth. We gained a sense of how our Oxyponics would fit into the larger industry and how our biocircuit could have further applications. The learnings from all of our research and interviews were put together like puzzle pieces to make informed decisions regarding product development and to envision product impacts.
Throughout the process of bringing a product to reality with truly integrated human practices, we spoke to over 45 contacts:

iGEM rocks so badly, when you do it once, you just wanna do it again :)
But this year, I'm keeping a low profile, just helping out the newbies to settle in and feel comfy in the lab. I'm still enjoying working around bacteria, apart from B. subtilis producing lysostaphin, because it smells so badly you just wanna die when you happen to be working in the same room!
I also like playing volleyball, cooking, baking, eating and above all traveling and meeting new people ^^ See y'all at the Jamboree!

I am a third-year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA Lyon and taking part in iGEM for the first time. I am joining the iGEM team to have a first sight of what genetics and bacterial manipulation is and to step into something different from studies. I like sports, skiing and computer graphics and hope to make it to Boston.
Alexandre Duprey
This year, I’m back for another iGEM competition. I’m still at INSA Lyon, fourth-year biochemistry and biotechnology, and still interested in how we can regulate parts to make them work together. However this time I’m rather advising on the project with the intent to improve our weak points (who said modelling ?), and making sure the newcomers don’t make (too many) mistakes. Otherwise I play video games. A lot. Too much...
Patricia Gifu
I am an undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA de Lyon. This year, I participate for the first time in iGEM.  I am very confident that INSA Lyon team is going to win because the team members worked very hard on the project and they all are skillful. I am passionate by biosciences. Outside the school I like watching movies and traveling whenever I have time"

* 50 mM Glucose    * 25 mM Tris.Hcl (pH 8.0)    * 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)
This solution was made today in preparation for tomorrow's exercise. We were told that the total volume should be 250ml. We were presented with pre-made solutions - 1M Tris HCl and 0.5M EDTA - and were told we needed to calculate the correct volumes of each of these solutions to be added to the beaker to give the desired molarity.
We were presented with glucose in it's solid form and asked to make a stock solution of 1M glucose; after which we were asked to calculate the amount to glucose solution to add to the beaker to make a molarity of 0.5M! The following equation helped:
Molecular Weight    x    Desired Volume (Litres)   x   Molarity   =   Weight (grams)
Making the glucose stock solution
molecular weight of glucose = 180.2
desired volume of stock solution = 500ml
desired molarity of stock = 1M
Put these values into the equation above gives the amount of glucose solid needed for 500ml of water...
180.2   x   0.5l   x   1M   =   90.1g
We added to 90.1 grams of glucose to 0.5 litres to get a 1M stock solution.
Adding the solutions to the beaker
25ml of 1M glucose stock solution was transferred to beaker (to make 50mM)
6.25ml of 1M Tris.HCl was transferred to the same beaker (to make 25mM)
5ml of 0.5M EDTA also added (to make 10mM)
H2O made the rest of the solution
These values are derived from the above equation
Solution 3
We also needed to make solution 3 for tomorrow's practical. This involved the following ingredients:
* 5M Potassium acetate: 60ml    * glacial acetic acid: 11.5 ml    * H2O: 28.5 ml
The glacial acetic acid and the water could be added to the 'Solution 3' beaker immediately, but calculations had to be carried out for the 5M potassium acetate to"

SYSU-China,2013,Team:SYSU-China#Project#Future work_-_-_TEXT.html,"SCs into tissue cells with the process of cell kind division much simplified and (2) auto-clearing the cancerous cells if the iPSC-derived tissue is transplanted into human in the long term. MicroRNA is a nice one-shoot to both problems. However, there might be difficulties in finding single specific and reliable microRNA target for every desired cell kinds. Hence we seek for alternative way to solve this problem.
Combination of several microRNAs can increase the specific of devision. In our project, we let the cells with high level of desired microRNA alive, but with the introduction of toxin-antitoxin system, cells with specific high or low level of microRNAs can be alive. By engineering, our choice of microRNAs can be broadened from single, specific and high level of microRNA to cluster of microRNAs to stepwise choose the cells we want.
Instead of microRNA-based silencing, there are other ways to achieve the goals of our project. For example, placing the suicide gene under control of tissue specific promoter can also autonomously select desired kind of cells in a cell mass. By using tumor-specific suicide gene, apoptin under control of tissue specific promoter, same aim of our project can be achieved. If we just focus on eliminating cancerous cells, tumor specific promoter like hTERT can be utilized. Hence, we can intentionally select the functions independently and combine them together as we need.
Vector for gene therapy
Our iPS safeguard device is developed not only for tissue transplant but also for cell and genetic therapy. Patients with inherent metabolic disease would benefit from a safer and more reliable tissue from himself or herself with genetic information modified. There is a growing trend to inject immune cells back into patients' bodies to fight against cancer, but the dynamic development of immune cells remains elusive. Maybe we can insert an auto-adjust circuit into those cells and let them differentiate and migrate as we expected. Any transformed cells have the concern of origin or assistant of carcinogenesis, including the lymphoid cells previously defined as cancer fighter. In this regard, our device would be a safeguard to protect and care for cell therapy.

Also, just be careful with how much you adapt the insulin you design. Endocrinologists are hesitant to put their patients on biosimilars because they can never be taken off that specific biosimilar. Generally, if a person is taken off one insulin biosimilar and put on a different analogue, they will suffer from an allergic reaction to the new insulin!
Team DISCO
Well we’d better make sure that our insulin is classified as an analogue, not a biosimilar. Unfortunately, Human Insulin will be classified as a biosimilar, but we have designed it to be exactly the same as the human form. Since there aren’t any ‘other’ bits on Human insulin like His-tags or TEV digestion sites, we hypothesise that there will be no adverse reactions or allergies brought on by Human Insulin.
Len Mancini
Would you like some quick tips on how to figure out if you will be free to market the insulin you have developed. Basically we would be looking at the patent landscape including  granted patents and patent applications to see whether you wouldcould infringe if your developed molecule was formulated and sold on the market.
Team DISCO
Yes please! We have designed a single chain insulin with a 12 amino acid length linker between the A and B chains, and have made no changes to the human insulin A chain. We have added a glycine to the B chain, as this immensely increases stability.
Len Mancini
The main thing you need to read when looking at a patent to begin with is the claims. If you read a claim, and your proposed product falls within the scope of any single claim, then you would infringe the patent (and could be open to a law suit). However, if your product doesn’t fall within the scope of that claim you would not infringe.  One thing to be aware of, howwver, is that “patents” are published at the application stage and also again after they are granted. If they are granted at all. So the first thing you do is check the status of the application at the time it was published. If it was just an application, then the claims may be broader than what would ultimately issue from the Patent Office, or indeed, no claims may gain aceptance and the application may lapse. If you fall within a claim of an application its best to dig deeper and see if the patent is likely to be granted by getting any available examination reports for that application, or any foreign equivalent identified through patent family searches. Its not a quick and easy job!

NTHU_Taiwan,2017,Team:NTHU Taiwan#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"CA NZ Collaborate Memo :
This year we, SECA NZ, collaborated with NTHU iGEM in the exchange of international viewpoints and software. NTHU is developing an ingenious system to monitor and adjust the level of contaminants in irrigation drains using copper filters and a Watergates. The filter cleans the water, and a complex set of sensors monitors the output. If the level of contaminants exceeds the capacity of the filter, the water gate will reduce the flow to a manageable level. They are also investigating the water quality in aquaculture. New Zealand’s economy is largely based on agriculture and fishery industries, and so as a team, we participated in a questionnaire to assess our opinions on aquaculture and water quality in the agriculture industry. This provided NTHU with both an international and consumer perspective on the issue.
Our own project focuses on the development of crop plants capable of surviving snap frosts. NTHU contributed to our project by graciously providing software and specifications on how to build a temperature sensor which would allow us to monitor the temperatures of cropping land.

We had been collaborating with iGEM NAU several times. Each time, we focused on sharing experiment schedules and techniques to solve problems in Wet Lab and Dry Lab. On account of their suggestion, we changed our protocols which made a great breakthrough on the performance of enzymes and solved the problem we made in gene transfer. In Dry Lab, we offered our experimental experience in hardware design. We not only gave them a deep look into measurement analysis and practical application, but also gave our suggestion on data collection method, model designing, and hardware modeling. On the other hand, we both exchange our plasmid for further check and study. Thanks to the profession in molecular biology from iGEM NAU and our outstanding talent in the device, we integrated both our advantages and made a significant improvement in both our project.

For UV sterilization, light bulbs emitting 254 nm were used and samples were exposed to it for 3 minutes. After sterilization, also 30 µL of these cells were plated on LB+Cm plates. Besides that, 30 µL of non-sterilized cells were plated as well. Of the last mentioned cells, it was expected for them to be alive and grow after overnight incubation.
Two of the plates containing BolA transformed cells were UV sterilized in a Stratagene UV Stratalinker 1800. The manufacturer recommended power settings of 120000 µJ. In our experiment we have used a power of 120000 µJ and 240000µJ to sterilize our cells.
All plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C.
Results
Autoclaving
Cells containing the OmpA-silicatein gene were autoclaved and subsequently imaged with SEM.
Figure 1: E. coli BL21 cells transformed with OmpA-silicatein, provided with silicic acid and were autoclaved and subsequently imaged by with SEM.
As can be seen in figure 1, the cells were collapsed and lost their shape. Therefore they cannot function as biolenses, another sterilization method was used.
UV sterilization
To test the effectivity of UV sterilization on our E. coli cells, a growth study after UV sterilization was performed. For this 30 µL BL21 cells transformed with BolA in pBbA5c was plated on LB plates complemented with chloramphenicol. These plates were UV sterilized in a Strategene UV Stratalinker 1800. As positive controls the same cells were heated for 10 minutes at 95 ºC or washed three times with 500 µL ethanol. As negative control the same cells were plated on a selective plate.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Test3D_-_-_TEXT.html," to change the physical behaviour of C. elegans by using the two specific optogenetic traits. Through microinjection and selection, we are able to get two strains with two phenotypes of the preference to blue light and the aversion to red light, and the next step is to obtain the single worm with the combination of these 2 different traits.
To achive our objectives, we choose a mating method, because it is less time-consuming and easier to operate than microinjecting the other array to the existed strain.
In general, mating is the pairing of either opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms. However, for C. elegans, mating can hybridize two different traits on the next generation by the paring of the hermaphrodite and the male. Besides, one of the greatest advantages of C. elegans is that it can either autocopulation or hybridization, which means that after hybridization, the hermaphrodite can self-fertilize and guarantee to produce a large number of offsprings with identical genetic characteristics.
Here is the mating procedures: Mating procedures: 1.Heat shock to get males(30℃,8h). 2.Parents mating to get the first filial hybrid generation(：=3:4). 3.Single out each hermaphrodite in a small plate. 4.Test the fluorescence of F1. 5.Single out F1 and self-fertilizing to get F2. 6.Test the fluorescence of F2.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Result_-_-_TEXT.html," When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [5]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [9].
If farmers had the possibility to know when to treat their horses, prevention of mass rupture and other severe consequences like increased resistance development could be achieved. To reach this goal we have developed a model that (based on multiple parameters) calculates the optimal amount of treatments in a specified period. This will avoid unnecessary use of anthelmintics by raising the awareness in farmers regarding when they actually need to treat their horses.
Current Methods for Detection
Currently the only method for detecting/counting how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal    samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires time sensitive shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing; treating their horses regardless of need which contributes to the resistance problem [10].
Resistance Development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection  of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,4]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance [2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15].
Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of horse intestines. Moreover, we have developed new applications on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners"

Support from Chalmers University of Technology
We would like to extend our thanks to our University who have supplied us with funds, facilities and resources to be able to conduct this project. We would also like to thank the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering for letting us use their laboratory and equipment, and also for showing us great kindness and patience throughout the entire summer.
Support from our Supervisors
All the work on this project has been done by the student members of this team unless stated otherwise, areas of work include planning, research, implementation, human practices and funding. However, without the guidance and persistence of our supervisors, this project would never have been possible. Thus, we want to give our greatest thanks to Verena Siewers and David Jullesson who helped us with advice and directions in every aspect of the project. Their knowledge and experience in the field of synthetic biology has been invaluable and their never ending patience never ceased to inspire us.
Additional support from University personnel
We want to thank and acknowledge the people at the Division of Systems and Synthetic Biology for showing us great support and care, every day, giving us a second home for the summer. We want to give special thanks to Marie Nordqvist and Ximena Rozo Seville for always aiding us when working in the laboratory, spending time showing us how to operate machines and how to function in the laboratory. Additional acknowledgements are given to Eugene Fletcher, Michel Gossing, Raphael Ferreira and Lei Shi for their help with troubleshooting and providing invaluable advice when we needed it the most.

Jeremy Choo
I am a second year biological science student at the University of Calgary. My main interests include microbial biology so I intend to specialize in Cellular, Microbial, and Molecular Biology. I am extremely interested in constructing genes using the BioBrick method. Wet labs will definitely be one of the highlights of the project. My contributions to the iGEM team including working primarily on the translation transcription circuit and working with periplasmic RFP. Outside the wet lab my roles include t-shirt designs and working on the team wiki. When not doing academic related work I am either playing squash, running, attending martial arts, volunteering, tutoring or watching movies.
Raida Khwaja
I’m a first year student in Biomedical Science in the Bachelors of Health Sciences Program at the University of Calgary. My interest in research emerged from my participation in Sanofi Aventis Bio Talent Challenge in 2008 through a self-initiated research project involving the behaviour of pharyngeal pumping of C.elegans upon various exposures. iGEM has given me another opportunity to increase my knowledge on the various aspects of research, with an exclusive focus on Molecular Biology and hands-on experience with technologies like PCR, gel electrophoresis and chromatography. This year, I will be working in the Wet Lab to construct the circuit of our toolkit which will detect Periplasmic Protein Misfolding in E.coli bacteria, as well as the Ethics of Synthetic Biology. Apart from iGEM, I volunteer and also tutor high school students. In my spare time, I like to write poetry and enjoy the scenic beauty of Calgary.
Patrick Wu
I am currently entering my second year of Bioinformatics in the Bachelor of Health Sciences Program at the University of Calgary. I was interested in becoming a part of iGEM because of its interdisciplinary approach to biology and engineering. This year, I will be contributing to the construction of the team wiki, as well as contributing to the modelling and animation projects. I believe iGEM will be an exciting and unique experience, since this gives undergraduate students first-hand experience in wet-lab and dry-lab work that they design and direct themselves. I'm a bit of a gamer at heart, though I do some writing on the side. I also like karate, drawing, and sleeping. Especially sleeping.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html,") agreed to support our project by contributing scanning electron microscopic (SEM) imaging. Even better suitable for our purpose Prof. Wanner has developed a method in which he can correlate the fluorescence signal of a sample with the high resolution images obtained in SEM. As this kind of sample preparation, sample processing and imaging takes a while, we had to start 2 weeks before wiki freeze and at that point we did not have enough stably integrated T-REx 2cells, yet. Thus we used transient transfected, semi-stable MEXi HEK 293T cells that were pulled down with magnetic beads in order to increase the number of transgenic cells in the preparation and to show the specific binding of the beads to the cells. For this immunoprecipitation we incubated scAvidin-receptor and eMA-receptor cells with biotinylated magnetic beads and on the other side cells transfected with the BAP-receptor together with streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads. After the immunoprecipitation the cells were washed twice with PBS and it was visible that the portion of transgenic (red fluorescent) cells was largely increased after this procedure. The depicted SEM image shows two BAP-receptor transfected MEXi cells which have a cluster of magnetic streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads at their cellular interface. At the border of the cells the superimposed fluorescence image of these cells shows red fluorescence located at the periphery of the cells indicating the presence of mRuby3 fluorescent protein at the cellular membrane. The green fluorescence is caused by biotinylated eGFP that was used for other preparations on the same microscopic slide and came into contact with these cells when the suspension cells were sedimented on the microscopic slide by centrifugation. Although for a reliable conclusion one would have to evaluate several such images this figure already gives a valuable evidence that the BAP-receptor is present on the cells (although perhaps at lower levels) and can bind to strepavidin that was conjugated to the beads.
Design of an autotransporter construct for bacterial surface display
Besides the design of biotinylated and biotin-binding receptors for eukaryotic cells, we also wanted to apply our biotINK approach for prokaryotic cells. For this purpose, we designed an autotransporter device that is able to present biotinylated or biotin-binding protein domains on the surface of E. coli. Constructs for bacterial surface display are hereby already well known in the field of protein engineering of therapeutic proteins, such as"

Then, we determined the specificity of the mutant to the Tet operator sequence, expressed as a position-weight matrix (PWM).

Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," of the science behind previous iGEM projects, including Bacterial Photography, e-Chromi, and making bacteria smell like bananas! It was really fascinating to see just how much synthetic biology is like computer science, which also opens up a lot of possibilities for the direction in which to take our project. We also had a brainstorming session, talked about bacterial superpowers, and applications of Synbio research. At the end, we discussed the ethical implications and overcoming the distrust people might have regarding “engineered” organisms, in the context of the museum exhibit. Tomorrow we’re having a call with Anja and Romie from the Tech, so we are starting to develop concepts and preliminary designs for the actual project. One week in, we’re getting down to business!
6/9/2015: Day 7
We spent the better part of the day brainstorming ideas for the project. We started out with more general brainstorming, but by the early afternoon narrowed it down to three specific exhibit designs (Bac to Mars, BacFarm, and BacMan). They were all conceptually centered around letting users engineer bacteria to perform a particular task, given a list of tasks, but they had different “storylines” and engagement techniques. This is the very early stages of development, so we do expect all of these to change drastically, and possibly not even make an appearance in the final project we settle on. In the afternoon, we talked to Anja and Romie from the Tech, who gave us feedback on our ideas and designs, as well as provided us with more concrete information on what they expect out of the exhibit. As expected, our preliminary designs did not necessarily align with their thoughts, but we all shared the common theme of emphasising engineering and creative spirit in the exhibits. We will continue working on fine-tuning the ideas, and the rest of the week will probably be dedicated to exploring technical possibilities for getting the exhibit to work.
6/10/2015: Day 8
We are back to tinkering with Cornerstone. Since yesterday all of us agreed that it would be good if users had a tangible token they can carry around and put together while exploring the exhibit, we got started with looking into recognizing multiple markers activity on the MultiTaction screen. We also looked into optimizing the size of the markers, and trying to get them as small as possible (to minimize the size of the possible future token). We discovered that the smallest size the MultiTaction can reliably recognize for our purposes is 4x4cm, which should be small enough. In the afternoon, we started working on a"

Evry,2014,Team:Evry#Biology#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html,": Spongia officinalis
==
Spongia officinalis has been used for millennia and for various purposes: from the Greeks for bathing and lining their armours, to today's pharmaceutical attempts to produce anti-inflammatory and other therapeutics, not even mentioning the use by Arabic physicians as early as 932 A.D of soaked sponges with narcotic drugs to place over the patient’s nose to provide a state of anesthesia. In a nutshell everyone knows the ""bath sponge"".
Spongia officinalis is a leuconoid sponge. A leuconoid sponge has a thick body wall, and the ostia open into incurrent canals that draw water into the sponge’s body. These incurrent canals open into chambers that are lined with choanocytes. Water flows from these chambers into excurrent canals that empty into a relatively small spongocoel. From there, water exits through an osculum.
Unlike asconoid and syconoid sponges, which are basically built around their spongocoels and oscula, a leuconoid sponge has a complex, irregularly-shaped body that may have several oscula. It allows a leuconoid sponge to grow to larger size.
It also provides them with powerful filtration capacity (approximately 1200 times its volume per day) which makes it a perfect host for our system. But as mentioned earlier our aim is to engineer an epibiont and not the sponge itself.
Following this introduction, we will both describe  what Pseudovibrio denitrificans exactly is and how we turned it into a transformable/selectable-ready chassis.
Pseudovibrio denitrificans the bacterium to modify
==
From a poorly known genius, a jewel emerged
==
At first glance, working on the microbiome of sponges appears like a hazardous task: 5734 articles for marine sponges, only 51 with microbiome of sponges, only 28 articles mentioning Pseudovibrio genius, only 5 mentioning Pseudovibrio denitrificans, and finally none about a genetic engineering system in it.
Moreover with only 12 species in the genius, and 2 strains sequenced (Pseudovibrio sp. FO-BEG1, Pseudovibrio sp. JE062) we knew we would have to sequence our strain of Pseudovibrio denitrificans with a mapping to one of the 2 strains references. A formidable drawback even considering that in the first place the species was chosen because of its natural denitr"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," can use our Biolenses in real-world conditions, we need to sterilize them. The lenses contain a core of live bacteria that are carrying antibiotic resistance. This could cause a serious health risk when released outside the lab. Therefore we have used autoclaving and UV-sterilization to see if we could sterilize the biolenses. We found that we can sterilize the biolenses without disturbing the shape using UV-sterilization.
With our sterilized cells, we could test the cells in real-world conditions. We tested whether our cells absorbed light using spectroscopy. If our cells would absorb light, they would have a negative impact on the solar cells or optics we plan to use them on. In these experiments we have found that the Biolenses do not absorb any light, so they are suitable for usein optics or solar cells. We have also tried whether our microlenses were able to improve solar cells under real-world conditions, by putting them on a solar cell in a solar simulator setup. Unfortunately, we did not see an increase, but we believe this is due to our experimental setup. We were not able to make a microlens array yet, therefore we did not see an increase in efficiency. The next experiment should be designing and testing a way to produce these arrays and place them on a solar cell. However, we did see that the biolenses do not impact the solar cells in a negative way. Therefore, we are confident we are able to increase the efficiency of solar panels once we have produced our microlens arrays.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The ultimate goal of our project was to improve imaging techniques by capturing more light. To this end, we came up with two different approaches. The first one was to let the                              sample, in this case the bacterium Escherichia coli, emit more light without expressing more fluorophores: the Biolaser. Furthermore, we thought of a way to capture                              more light using biological microlenses, also made by E. coli: Biolenses
The Biolaser
The laser consisted of two main synthetic biology components: expressing fluorophores and coating the cell in polysilicate with the enzyme silicatein.                              We have successfully constructed two brand new BioBricks for fluorophore expression : mVenus and mCerulean.                              Additionally we improved the existing GFP BioBrick by adding a constitutive promoter. We also succeeded in expressing silicatein and locating it on the cell                             membrane of E. coli. This enzyme enabled the cell to coat itself in polysilicate . We confirmed the presence of the polys"

Figure 2 – Sequence alignment between our Citrobacter freundii sequence and the consensus E. coli operator region sequence
As it can be seen from this sequence alignment, the Citrobacter freundii sequence, while showing some similarities, is not completely identical to the E. coli consensus sequence, which might be the reason. We then looked at the sequence of the LacR repressor protein in Citrobacter freundii, as it is known that the N-terminal sequence of this protein is what binds to DNA. We wanted to see whether there are any differences between this protein’s N-terminal sequence and that of E. coli MG1655, the strain that is most often used in iGEM and in labs in general. The protein BLAST results can be seen in Figure 3.
Figure 3 – protein BLAST results showing homology between the Citrobacter freundii (Query) and E. coli
K-12 MG1655 (Subject) Lac repressor protein sequence. This result shows that the N-terminus of this protein is well conserved between these two organisms, but there are a few differences in amino acids that may account for this protein not being able to regulate a foreign Lac promoter.
Is an unregulated Plac promoter a bad thing?
Not necessarily, as regulation can still be obtained if the E. coli lacI gene is supplied in addition to the Plac construct. By controlling LacI expression levels, expression can be controlled without IPTG, as in the repressilator, toggle switch and other devices, without worrying about endogenous LacI activity.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html,"2012 ; Lentini et al. 2013 ). The strength of the RBS has a minor effect as long as it is not too weak ( Karig et al. 2012 ; Takahashi et al. 2013 ).
AATAATCT
According to Lentini et al. 2013, the sequence composition between RBS and start codon affects the expression level of the following gene. An AT-rich region gives the best results, whereas expression is lower with the biobrick scar TACTAGAG for example ( Lentini et al. 2013 )
Quality and purity of the DNA template is an important aspect. When using plasmid purification kits one has to keep in mind that RNase is part of the resuspension buffer. In the literature, opinions vary regarding which is the best method for purification ( Kigawa et al., 2004 ; Calhoun and Swartz, 2005 ; Sun et al., 2013 ).
RNA-Polymerase
The most widely used RNA-Polymerase for cell-free protein production is the T7-Polymerase from bacteriophage T7 which is highly efficient and provides fast transcription ( Shin and Noireaux, 2010 ). The T7-Polymerase is highly specific to its T7-Promoter, and is commonly used to express proteins in vivo ( Sousa and Mukherjee, 2003 ). Simple in-house production of T7-Polymerase has been described in many publications, so even E. coli strains without endogenous T7-Polymerase can be utilized ( Yang et al., 2012a ; Roos et al., 2014 ).
To overcome the limits of T7-Polymerase, Shin and Noireaux established CFPS based on endogenous polymerases and sigma factors from E. coli ( Shin and Noireaux, 2010 ; Shin and Noireaux, 2012 ). With this work the possibilities of in vitro transcription-translation were  extended; it became possible to characterize other than bacteriophage promotors in vitro ( Chappell and Freemont, 2013 ). This lead to the analysis of genetic circuits outside of living cells  ( Chappell et al., 2013 ; Sun et al., 2013 ; Takahashi et al., 2015 ).
NTPs
The four nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP are the building blocks of RNA and therefore essential for transcription. They are one of the"

NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," still strive for an ideal treatment no matter how expensive it might be, as long as it can guarantee efficiency. ‘Side effects’ accounted for the second, as cancer patients suffered a great trauma both physically and mentally. If side effects can be minimized, patients will received an utmost degree of relief.
Good curative effect and little side effect for the gene mutational patients are consistent with the advantages of our molecular target drugs, which is very practical and meets the real demands of patients. The biggest problem of our targeted drugs, currently, is actually about the price, since they cannot be covered in the medical insurance system and there is no policy support. In this way, for some ordinary wage-earning-class families, the medical expenses would be a big problem for them. The cost of the new therapies can be prohibitive, thus the patients shrink back at the sight of the price.
Molecular targeted drugs of our team have little side effects, can be taken orally, and are of good therapeutic effect for specific gene mutational patients. Would you be willing to try it if it was put into clinical practice?
Figure 11.
The reasons would be shown at the next question.
Your main concern with the new drug is …?
Figure 12.
Survey results on attitude towards the new drug showed that, only 14.52% holds absolute negative attitude to new drugs, and most of the patients and their families think it as acceptable, although 43.55% said they will make decisions in specific circumstances, and the cost, the curative effect, genetic testing are all the factors that need to be taken into account.
Consistent with the question 5, we could easily find that, with more than half respondents expressing this concern, the largest concern of patients and their families was that new drugs lack longstanding clinical cases. High charge was also one of the main concerns of patients. This showed that there is still much room for improvement and perfection of medical insurance system in China.
Besides, some patients still had doubts about the specific efficacy of new drugs, worrying they cannot receive fine curative effect even after paying high fee. However, 41.94% patients said they were very willing to try, and believed that the new technology should be well developed and progressed to better fight against cancer--even if the price is expensive, it is still worthy to try.
Summary
Our findings are compatible with our initial assumptions. In addition, after interviewing with the patients face to face, we also learned more of the current status of clinical cancer treatment and patients' actual thoughts and real needs, enabling us more aware of the importance and urgency of developing new drug"

These modules will be expressed from a plasmid containing an independent inducible promoter, pREP41X ( Forsburg, 1993 ; Moreno et al, 2000 ).  These fusion proteins or kymeras will bind to specific tetR operator sequences placed upstream of an inducible promoter and downstream of the marker GFP gene, controlled by that promoter.

UB_Indonesia,2014,Team:UB Indonesia_-_-_TEXT.html," for our TALEs, we received help from Lucas Schneider (member of Freiburg Team 2012) and Nicole Densch (Labmanager from BIOSS , Freiburg). We request the pTALEN and pTAL – TF from BIOSS and sent it to us on Whatman paper. Based on Sanjana et al. (2013), TALE-TFs are constructed by replacing the natural activation domain within the TALE C-term with the synthetic transcription activation domain VP64.
Figure 2. TALEs can be used to generate custom transcription factors (TALE-TFs) and modulate the transcription of endogenous genes from the genome (Sanjana et al., 2013)
TALENs are constructed by fusing a C-term truncation (+63aa) of the TALE DNA binding domain with the non-specific FokI endonuclease catalytic domain. TALENs form dimers through binding to two target sequences separated by ~17 bases (Sanjana et al., 2013).

B. LINKER
As we’ve said before that we inspired by the Calgary Team 2013 ’s project, so we decided to learn the linker from previous work by them. The E/K coil is a heterodimeric coiled-coil that often used for biosensors and as an expression and affinity purification tag. The E coil contains all glutamic acid residues and the K coil contains all lysine residues. This coiled-coil can be found in a wide variety of proteins and contain a single type of secondary structure or the α-helix. There are two ways to increasing the stability of this sequence: the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil (positions at a and d) and the α-helical propensity of surface esposed positions at b, c, e, f, and g (Litowski, 2002).
Figure 4. Helical wheel of the E4/K4 heterodimer (Litowski, 2002)
We used linker to connect  Tale and reporter. We used E and K coil since they can interact each other with high specificity. E-coil was fused to amilCP blue chromoprotein (reporter), while K-coil bound to Tale. This fusion make the reporter can be linked to Tale (detector) through K coil-. This"

Overview
This article presents information compiled from different online sources such as universities’ websites, newspaper, articles, and organizations’ websites. The information was searched both in English and Bahasa Indonesia. Information in Bahasa Indonesia was translated into English by Indonesian teammates. The general trend that we have notice from research is that information about synthetic biology in Indonesia is very limited. This might be due to the fact that not many people in Indonesia know about this field. Information of biotechnology, however, was more abundant. Many companies and universities are participating in biotechnology development. Most of the research related to biotechnology focus on agriculture. In the future, following this trend in biotechnology, synthetic biology may also be used to improve agriculture in Indonesia.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Out of 3100 universities in Indonesia, only three universities in Indonesia joined the iGEM competition. This reflects that very few people know about the iGEM competition and synthetic biology. The first Indonesian university that joined the iGEM competition is Bogor Agricultural University (BAU). This university joined the iGEM 2012 competition, but did not manage to get any awards. Two universities from Indonesia, Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) and University of Indonesia (UI), have registered for the iGEM 2013 competition
Funding of Biotechnology
In 2012, Indonesian Institute of Science (LIPI) received around US$ 14 million from the Indonesian government (""Dana 2012,"" 2013). This amount of money is only around 0.1% from national income. This year, in 2013, the government proposed that they would decrease the funding to LIPI by 9% from the total amount of 2012 funding (“Riset bioteknologi: Ter"

To isolate bacteria I performed a dilution series of phage starting from 10^-1 through 10^-10 in LB broth. Kevin combined 4mL of 0.7% melted agar with competent Top 10 cells. Five tubes were labeled with soft agar. Soft agar was combined with the corresponding serial dilution and bacteria and poured on a warm agar plate.
Week of 6/15/14 through 6/21/14
Progress of our three man effort. We took a little time this week to clean out our IGEM box due to a contamination that seems to be spreading! We had a meeting among us to re-evaluate our plan. Decided that we would continue everything in triplicate so our results would show replication.
We began the week by ligating J23102 (p-con) with I732020 (LacZoperon Mutant) onto a destination plasmid (pSB1AT3). Since we had various registry DNA parts of these individual cells, we decided to use different parts for each of us. We all used the same J23102, two different I732020 lines, and all three used a different pSB1AT3 line. Apparently Lyuda’s line of pSB1AT3 was not viable as her Destination Plasmid did not grow on Tet plates. The other two of us had plenty of growth with large red colonies and small white colonies, indicating that some of the J23102 must have went backwards to the original J23102 with red"

Figure 34: Scheme of hypervesiculation. Scheme of plasmids and strains used in characterization of hypervesiculation.
By measuring the size distribution of the vesicles with Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), we wanted to confirm vesicle production and determine vesicle size. Dynamic Light Scatter (DLS) measurements were performed following the DLS protocol . Vesicle size distribution in the KEIO strain and WT strain with either TolR or pET-Duet were compared at different time points after induction: three, four, five hours and overnight (approximately 20 hours). In Figure 35, the raw data of both TolR and pET-Duet in the KEIO strain clearly show a distribution of larger particles compared to the WT strain. Demonstrating that the WT strain produces a very low amount to no vesicles. Therefore, we decided to only focus on analysing the DLS data of the KEIO strain.
Figure 35: Raw data of the DLS experiment. Raw data of the size distributions of the pET-Duet and TolR in the KEIO (a and b) and WT (c and d) strain, measured with Dynamic Light Scatter (DLS). The samples are put against the size in nm and the colour represents the size distribution in percentages.
In Figure 36, the analysed data of the KEIO strain is shown. In this graph the mean and width of the size distribution is plotted per time for TolR and pET-Duet. Overall, neither time nor the presence of TolR shifted size distribution of the vesicles. The only exception is the time point after 4 hours, which might possibly be a statistical st. Therefore, the KEIO strain is mostly responsible for vesicle production. Pertaining to size, the average we found was around 18 nm in diameter (d.nm), which differs from the 80-100 d.nm sized vesicles found by the 2016 iGEM team of University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia . Further, they showed that the size distribution shifts to larger vesicles when TolR is overexpressed in the KEIO strain, which was not evident in our data. A possible reason could be the low amount of IPTG we added. However, due to time constraints, we were not able to test a range of different IPTG concentrations.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#NeuTest1_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM competition started in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already 165 universities from all over the world competed against each other. This year, it is the first participation of the University of Goettingen, Germany. The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for students to gain and improve a multitude of skills that are necessary during a carrier as a molecular biologist. Such skills would be planning and organizing a project, including fund raising and team recruitment, coordination of lab work, designing experiments and working together as a team. Next to intensive lab work during the summer, also literature search and well-structured documentation of the experiments is crucial. Moreover, safety for humans and environment is key.
Homing Coli
Escherichia coli is a commonly used bacterial model organism. It has lots of beneficial traits, e.g. a short generation time and it can be easily manipulated. Most E. coli strains that are used in laboratories do not exhibit high motility. The crucial element for motility is the flagellum, which is rotated by a molecular motor within the cell wall. Consequently, these are reduced in cultivated E. coli strains.
Our goal is to create an E. coli strain with increased swimming motility on special  agar plates. Therefore, we will overexpress regulators and parts of the E. coli flagellum in cultivated strains in order to enhance bacterial swimming ability. The fastest E. coli strains will be selected and  further improved. At the same time we will then be able to create an effective motility-selection   method.
Now, you are probably wondering what the advantage of a fast E. coli might be. The beneficial fast phenotype can be combined with the ability of this bacterium to sense specific compounds in their environments. Chemo-receptors enable it to move towards or along gradients of such substances. We will use PCR-based site directed mutagenesis on the E. coli Tar receptor. The combination of speed and chemotaxis allows us to identify E. coli strains, which can sense interesting compounds. Thereby, an easy method for the detection of pollutants, toxins or even tumors could be provided.

Ramp-PCR
Ramp-PCR is when you make the PCR-program to ramp the temperature down from x to y so you will get a specific annealing. For instance:
98°C for 2:00 - Denaturing and warm up
98°C for 0:10 - Denaturing after each cycle
65°C for 0:05 - Annealing
ramp 0.1°C/s until 60°C
72°C for 2:00 - Elongation
Go to number 2 - repeat 35
72°C for 5:00 - Final extension
End
A program like that will typically help you if your primers have annealing temperatures in the area between 65°C and 60°C but you don't know the best single step temperature.

7.28.15
Goal: Measure the luminescence and response from the estrogen sensor. Compare the fluorescence from J23100 RFP and J23115 RFP. To analyze the sequence for CD-cel Gaussia and to determine if there is luciferase activity. What we did:
Made dilutions (1:100) from the starter cultures for the estrogen sensors and controls. Made cultures for the J23100 RFP and 115 2 RFP. Left them overnight in the 37 dry shaker
Set up transformations for CD-cel Gaussia (on plates and in culture) for testing of luciferase activity in response to addition of coelenterazine.
Checked the sequence data for CD-cel Gaussia. It works so cultures will be set up for luciferase activity testing. The CD-cel domain and gaussia domain didn’t work.
Week 3
6.8.15
Goal: To begin quantifying fluorescent proteins produced in MACH cells: mRFP, OFP, YFP, eGFP, BFP. Also to create a strongly expressing culture of YFP
Created 5 mL cultures from previous cultures, with the exception of the YFP transformed bacteria, which was taken from a plate created 5/27/2015.
Streaked a new multicolor plate with all his tagged fluorescent proteins
Calculated OD of 1:10 dilution of each culture using online calculator
OD was 0.369, thus the non dilute concentration of bacteria we used was 2.95 * 10^9, and the amount of bacteria in each sample was 4.425*10^9
His-tagged soluble protein extraction outlined in our procedure using a washing solution with dilute imidazole
Used 50 uL of beads for each
extracted proteins from 1.5 mL of each culture

Functionalizing Fibers
Project Goals
Due to its remarkable physical properties, silk has a wide array of potential applications.  We hope to further the potential of silk by conjugating it to other functional peptides. This approach allows us to greatly expand the potential of silk. For example, a team in Japan, led by Dr. Tamura, has been able to successfully express recombinant silk-GFP fusion fibers from genetically engineered silkworms, suggesting that it is indeed possible to produce functional materials out of recombinant silk [1] . Although several groups have been able to express and isolate silk from microbial organisms [2] , the functionalization aspect has yet to be thoroughly investigated in model microbial organisms such as E. coli.
One of our goal this year has been to functionalize silk by genetically conjugating it with GFP and getting it to glow green. If this works, it would serve as a proof of principle for the next step of our project- replacing GFP with SpyTag, to have an “all-purpose” protein fusion intercalated into our fiber. SpyTag is a peptide that irreversibly forms an amide bond with its partner protein, SpyCatcher. Theoretically, this would allow us the flexibility to produce a number of various fibers via post-translational treatment. For example, a SpyTag-silk fiber could be treated with a SpyCatcher-RFP fusion to produce a red fluorescent fiber without ever having to directly fuse RFP to the silk at the genetic level.
Co-Spinning
A method of producing functionalized fibers is to simultaneously spin, or ""co-spin"" ordinary silk proteins with other proteins. These proteins will be expressed separately, but mixed together and spun into a fiber from a single dope.  This is an alternative to simply fusing the silk to a protein, and spinning only the protein fusion. This is useful because the fused protein can often interfere with the silk’s physical properties.  Therefore, spinning the functionalized proteins with normal silk proteins helps maintain the physical integrity of the resulting fiber.  In order to"
UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile2#Cyanolux#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Recent work on global gene expression in Synechocystis aided on finding adecuate promoters 7 , 8 . (Images at right from cited papers.)
To try our approach, we selected various promoters which could serve the purpose.  Our rational for selecting candidate promoters involved amplitude of oscillation, peak activity, hour, absence of restriction sites, predicted strength of promoter according to the role of the gene and reproducibility between experiments (based on the literature available).  We looked for promoters which would have peak expression nearby dusk hours and that were slightly out of phase to optimize production of bioluminescence according to our mathematical models (LINK OVER HERE!). We prioritized promoters from genes that would be involved in central energetic metabolism as we believe that their expression would be most robust and reliable.
We choose the transaldolase promoter (specific name here and code in Synechocystis Genome) to direct the expression of the LuxAB genes and we found a couple of other promoters which filled the other requirements from above. Pcaa3 (NAME HERE AND DESCRIPTION OF ENDOGENOUS ACTIVITY) and PsigE (NAME HERE AND DESCRIPTION OF ENDOGENOUS ACTIVITY), the former being already in Biobrick format (courtesy from the Utah team iGEM 2010).
Building constructs
When confronted with the different available strategies to express the genes from the Lux operon in Synechocystis, we concluded that the one that best suits our need is by using integration plasmids. The reason for this is that the available plasmids that replicate in Synechocystis are very large (8 Kb) without even considering the genes we need to include in the constructs (that would sum up to a final 16 Kb aproximately). Such a large plasmid would prove very difficult to handle through molecular biology techniques, let alone transform Synechocystis.
Using integration plasmids also proposes an additional advantage, that is to produce successive integrations which allow accumulation of different desirable elements in the genome. Integration in Synechocystis is undergone through double recombination of homologous DNA which also allows interruption of genes if wanted. In our case we have designed our system to produce suceptibility to copper as a biosafety measure to have further control over our recombinant Synechocystis.
We designed two constructs that have different recombination locations in the Synechocystis chromosome. We named them according to what Utah iGEM team from 2010 proposed for naming conventions :

Joel finished the logo redesign today - this time, he based the logo idea on a power button, recreating that with DNA and an E. coli cell, as you can see below. We continued with the teal based colour scheme, as it’s a gentle colour which we all liked, and the grey-teal colour scheme on the wiki looks really good.
The LB experiment Dan set up yesterday showed us that the chloramphenicol still functioned after one day, but all media was contaminated after two days. The DNase1 and Lysozyme transformations were unsuccessful again.
Of the LB flasks prepared yesterday, three were inoculated with Killer Orange and one was used as a control. The OD was measured every hour, and the proteins were left to mature for an hour. The lab team spread plated the cultures and tested two in the light box, then placed the spread plates in the cold room so they can be tested on Monday. The transformed Killer Red plate was put in the cold room with them so it can be overnighted on Monday.

The bulk of today focused on the team members visiting Westminster preparing, with Eloise and Jack (the speakers for our presentation) practising and perfecting the talk.
The lab team for today was Dan, Eloise and Jack. They found the Killer Orange spread plates had not worked, as there were still live colonies present. They took a sample of the Killer Orange cultures from the flasks and left them in the light box for the full day this time. The samples were tested in the FACS machine, which showed Killer Orange proteins only being produced in the non-induced culture due to a leaky T7 promoter.

The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]
P(cancer) is the figure generated by Tammemägi’s model, weighted by the probability of stage 1 detection (63%) and other stage detection (37%).
P(cancer) = P(true positive) + P(false negative)
As sensitivity ≈ 100%, P(false negative) ≈ 0
P(cancer) ≈ P(true positive) = specificity * P(positive test)
P(positive test) ≈ P(cancer) / specificity
P(false positive) = P(positive test) * (1 - specificity) ≈ P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
Therefore the probability of a false positive is approximately proportional to the chance of having cancer. P(false positives) always amounted to less 1% of the total cost per QALY so this error of this approximation is negligible.
To recap:
P(true positive) = P(cancer)
P(false positive) = P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
P(true negative) = 1 - (P(true positive) + P(false positive))
P(false negative) = 0
The probability of each option was calculated by multiplying P(true positive) * P(treatment success). In the table, P(treament) represents the chance of the treament being as described by the 2nd column.

Mass action kinetics
Mass action kinetics is the assumption that the rate of reaction is proportional to concentration of the reactants. We chose to create a mass action kinetics model as we could use relatively few parameters. Reducing the number of parameters, whilst keeping the model representative of the system, made it easier to understand the effect of varying each parameter. We built the model in MATLAB first, and later ported it to JavaScript to make it a better design tool for the biologists and better communicate how the model works.
Graph interactivity
We spent a long time reviewing previous teams models. A problem we found was that most models weren’t communicated in a way that was engaging and easy to understand. We’ve tried to explain our model in a way that someone with no experience in modeling could understand.
We’ve used interactive graphs on this page - when you get to them you can drag the sliders to change parameters and see how they affect the system.
We initially ported our model to a webpage so the design team could try out new stuff when they were designing our toehold switches. This turned out to be very useful for both of us. We decided to make it look a lot nicer and improve its compatibility with different browsers so we could put it on the wiki.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12).

Yes., but you need to make an appointment in advance (anesthesia colonoscopy: 2-3 months, common colonoscopy, 1-2 months). 1-2%.
6. What are the reasons for hindering the colonoscopy into a widespread one?
①The popularization of medical knowledge is insufficient, and many people do not know about items with colonoscopy;
②Afraid of colonoscopy;
③Medical resources are limited. One time of colonoscopy is about 20-30 minutes, and a skilled colonoscopy doctor can only examine about 20 patients a day. The demand for endoscopy doctors in China is about 200,000-300,000, but currently there are only about 2-3 million.
7. What is the impact and degree of pain of colonoscopy and other intestinal examinations?
①Colonoscopy: entering from the anus;
②Enteroscopy: entering from the mouth and anus, docking; a enteroscopy should take 2-3 hours; charge 2-3k RMB; painful; hospitals are less profitable and most are reluctant to do it;
③Capsule endoscopy: can not take biopsy; uncontrolled; 3k RMB; not suitable for large intestine examination (can not see, power is not enough).
8. What are other clinical examination methods of colonoscopy other than colonoscopy?
①There is currently no way to completely replace colonoscopy;
②Abdominal enhancement CT;
③Barium enema (can not take biopsy, not as clear as the colonoscopy).
9. What is the ratio of anesthesia colonoscopy to normal colonoscopy?
1:1
10. What assessments are needed before an anesthesia colonoscopy? What kind of people is not suitable for anesthesia colonoscopy?
①Body type: can not be too fat (anesthesia for too fat people may have breathing risk);
②ECG: can not have inflammatory arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmia, and have done a heart stent.
③Medical history: no allergies, asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes (the heart is generally damaged, and need to control the diet 3 days before the colonoscopy, can not resist);
④Prolonged bleeding time: the risk of major bleeding is not suitable for colonoscopy.
11. What is the side effects of anesthesia?
①Respiratory depression;
②Blood oxygen"

The article brought the issue into focus that it is difficult to raise money for student based projects like iGEM. Contacted 8 newspapers 6 specialist journals 4 TV stations Achieved Documentary 1 article in NyViden 1 news broadcast 1 article in Fyens Stiftstidende 1 article in SIJ - STUDENTS & INNOVATION JOURNAL
Documentary
We have had the great possibility to have a documentary made about us. One day a former worker at the local news station came and asked if he could be allowed to make a documentary about us. He would make it so that a layman could watch it and learn from it. The story was to tell about the competition and the story about students who spends all of their summer vacation in the lab.
He followed us almost two weeks and filmed a lot of hours in the lab and got a lot of interviews with the team members and our supervisors. In the end we got a great movie that gives the audience an idea of what iGEM and science is, and how it is to work in a lab.
Podcast
The start
During this years iGEM competition, we were involved in the making of a informational video in cooperation with several other iGEM teams around the world. It all started when Lars-Christian (a former iGEM team member turned adviser from our team) told us that Cornell University was considering making a collaborative podcast video as part of the human outreach aspect of iGEM. It didn’t take long for us to decide that we wanted to participate because it sounded like a fun and exciting project to work on. After the initial emailing and formal introductions were made we had a series of hangouts on google+ which enabled us to see and speak to each other face to face. This helped the process along very nicely, as it would probably have been a rather difficult task to achieve the same level of productivity and cooperation over email, when several different people from all around the world are involved in decision making.
The task
Very early on it was decided that the product of our labor should be focused on the ethical aspects of synthetic biology but also teach the public about iGEM and synthetic biology in general and that we, as scientist take the ethical issues regarding genetic manipulation seriously. The “problem” that we ended up wanting to tackle was that  of GMO’s and the way they are perceived by the public.
The idea

They start elaborating them with cayenne pepper and they continue using more serious stuff. The last person which gives up becomes the winner and receives a commemorative trophy and a photo for the “hall of fame” of the contest.
This year, the organizers of this funny contest decided on donating all the earnings to our cause.

Finally, if the secondary metabolite had no documented toxicity information, or if there was no specific BGC exposed by antiSMASH and just the general class of secondary metabolite or microorganism, the compound was categorised as “?” (black) with the note to consider if, according to the precautionary principle, one should pursue the use of the given microorganism in the laboratory.
As a proof of concept, the 30 organisms were screened using the CARE tool and the results showed that, although some secondary metabolites were considered as toxic (e.g. roquefortine, PR-toxin, isofumigaclavine and mycophenolic acid for P. roqueforti), their amounts do not affect human health, meaning that these organisms were safe to work with in laboratory settings and we could proceed with the experimentation with them.
When a laboratory works on a non-model organism with the objective of harnessing its industrial potential, genome editing processes may be involved (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 tool). Therefore, this tool could additionally be used in order to determine differences in toxicity between native and genetically modified organisms.
Outreach
In order to test the tool’s functionality, we contacted via social media this year’s iGEM teams and the following 25 teams engaged on our conversation: Vilnius, Dundee, Cardiff, Exeter, Imperial, Valencia UPV, UPO Sevilla, BIOSINT México, TEC Costa Rica, Tec Chihuahua, Emory, MQ, BGU, IIT Kharagpur, Technion, Barcelona, Leiden, TU Darmstadt, Queens, Evry Genopole, MSU, EPFL, Georgia State, DTU Denmark and LMU & TU Munich.
Special thanks go to the Tec Chihuahua, Tec Costa Rica and EPFL teams for being “CARE ambassadors” and helping us spread the word of our tool.
From a total of 29 organisms, the majority of the engaged teams used model organisms (81%) while 5% used non-model strains (Yarrowia lipolytica, Dechloromonas aromatica, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and Myxococcus xanthus). Some of those organisms were included in our program’s database depending on whether they had an annotated genome (accession number). It is also worth mentioning that the non-model chassis from this year was different from the list presented by the Yale iGEM team from the two previous years.
LIMITATIONS AND FURTHER IMPROV"
UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the sticky ends such that there was at least a two base pair difference between any two of the three sticky ends. Our final NEW sticky ends are:
A: 5'-AGTT-3'
B: 5'-TGTC-3'
C: 5'-CGTG-3'
We incorporated these NEWLY DESIGNED sticky ends into MaSp1 and MaSp2 sequences. We tested the ligation characteristics of these new monomers by ligating pairs of monomers. The expected result of this test is a single band corresponding to a 2-mer product.
Fig. 2 Ligation test of AB, BC, CA. Lane 1 is A+B, Lane 2 is B+C, Lane 3 is C+A. The expected band size for ligation is 204 bp. The bands at 102 bp correspond to unligated monomers.
Our test results show only the expected ligation product, which validates the proper functioning of our REDESIGNED MONOMERS
In addition to characterizing the ligation behavior of the MaSp monomers, we also characterized the behavior of the redesigned monomers with accessory oligos used in ICA( 6/3/2015 ). We tested ligating monomer with each capping oligo, and the AB and CA monomers with the initiator and terminator respectively.
Fig. 3 Characterization of initiator, terminator, capping oligos with MaSp AB, BC, CA. The first lane is the negative control with only one monomer type. The 102 bp band corresponds to unligated monomer size. The initiator is 59 bp, the terminator is 39 bp, and the caps are 20 bp. The 122 bp bands correspond to the capping oligos ligated to the monomer.
We showed that the caps work as intended and would be usable in ICA.
We expected the following combinations to ligate.
AB + Initiator (inconclusive)
AB + B-cap
BC + C-cap
CA + A-cap
CA + Terminator (inconclusive)
There was an insufficient amount initiator and terminator in the reaction, so no bands. But the sticky ends should work as expected.
CA weakly ligates with C-cap, which is shown by the double bands present. This result was not expected, and may be due to non-specific ligation.
Because of possible undesirable non-specific interaction between monomer CA and C-cap, we performed a test to verify which end of the monomer the cap was binding to ( 6/5/2015 ). If the cap bound to the C"

1.2 Procedures of Experiments
     1.2.1 PCR Proliferation
        Due to high content of G-C base-pairs in target gene segments, GC Buffer is required in PCR proliferation. Refer to Takara's protocols to prepare 200μL of system: 100μL of GC Buffer, 16μL of dntp mixture, 4μL of sense primer, 4μL of anti-sense primer, 4μL of DNA templet, 2μL of Taq, and 70μL of H2O. 60°C-70°C is used for Gradient PCR, the sixth bad is the brightest (Figure 9) thus the temperature of such is best for annealing. In new system, PCR is proceeded in that temperature; finally we get the gene segments with gene linkers.

HIT-Harbin,2014,Team:HIT-Harbin#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," (and each Pool) has an independent model (MDL file). After wiring them together, the model of the whole circuit comes from the composition of the models of all its components.
2. Building the model
As mentioned above, we used four different kinds of software: Parts & Pools, BioNetGen, ProMoT, and Copasi.
Every Part has its own input file. A promoter input file requires specifying the promoter structure (operator number) and the kind of regulation transcription regulation, if present. Since every operator can lie in two states (free, or taken by a transcription factor), a promoter with N operators can lie into at least 2^N states (combinatorial explosion). Indeed, the promoters we used in our circuits with simple activation host 4 operators, each bound by the same activator. Overall, these promoters host 36 species and 174 reactions. More complex is the promoter we used in the memory circuit. It has 6 operators: 3 bound by the simple LexA-DR (Dioxin Receptor) activator, and the other 3 by the fusion protein GFP-LexA-DR (we could not model operators shared by the two activators but this design is totally equivalent). The model of this promoter shows, on the whole, 133 species and 958 reactions. Such a complex description can be achieved with a rules-based modeling approach. Parts & Pools converts, therefore, an input file into a list of rules that are sent to BioNetGen. BioNetGen returns a list of species and reactions to Parts & Pools. Parts & Pools adds to this the only information missing to have a model for the promoter as an independent Part: the fluxes of molecules it exchanges with other Parts and Pools in a circuit. This final description (species, reaction, and fluxes of molecules) is written into an MDL file. These files are generated for each circuit components. They are loaded into ProMoT, the software we used for our circuit visual design. ProMoT generates the model for the complete circuits and permits to export it into SBML format for running circuit simulations. We simulated the dynamics of our circuits with COPASI (see the Figure above).

Emission spectra of induced and uninduced screening plasmid BBa_K494002 containing TrpTerm ; green: eGFP fluorescence ex: 501 nm, red: mCherry fluorescence ex: 587 nm
Making use of our improved screening system we also carried out some in vivo kinetic measurements in addition to the end-point measurements above. In contrast to the in vitro experiments we did not obtain significant results for the characterization of our switches. As the switching process is many times faster than protein synthesis our in vivo kinetics include the synthesis of mCherry as well as its maturation. Therefore we centered our attention on end-point experiments. For more information browse the lab book .
Considering our in vivo measurements, neither of the tested switches showed any effect regarding the signal induction. But due to the small number of tested switches and signals this can hardly be regarded as disprove of concept. In particular in light of the recent findings by Sooncheol proving antitermination in principle using a T7 system. [14]

in vitro Screening
To minimize the amount of disturbing factors we decided to countercheck our in vivo results with a set of in vitro measurements. While the in vitro systems are no doubt much less complex than living cells, the work with these set-ups proved to be quite as difficult. Just as with the in vivo measurements we could prove our switching system neither right nor wrong, leaving enough work for future iGEM teams.

in vitro translation
Beside optimization of the reporter proteins in use, the major problem occuring in the experiments was the low capacity of the kit. The signal intensity was very low, which made it difficult to observe any signal intensity alterations, so no conclusion could be drawn from these measurements.
in vitro transcription
We used two completely independent in vitro systems: Using E.coli RNA Polymerase we analyzed the His and Trp switches that had already been tested in vivo. In a second set-up, we used the well-established T7 RNA Polymerase and switch based on the T7 terminator as well as several signal sequences.
T7 System
In contradiction to the results of Kang and coworkers and other groups, in our in vitro set-up the T7 terminator did not seem to terminate at all. The negative control (Promoter_Terminator_malachite binding aptamer) showed a similar increase in fluorescence as the positive control (Promoter_random sequence_malachite binding aptamer).
