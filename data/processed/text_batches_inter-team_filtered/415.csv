UCL_E,2013,Team:UCL E#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," the classroom. We have successfully applied for a social enterprise grant to work with different communities in London and explore the potential of citizen biotechnology to increase science literacy and contribute to the solution of community problems.
With the funding secured, we are now approaching the first communities, such as Hackney City Farm and the Somerstown Community, which is in need of quickly increasing confidence about biotechnology, as it is faced with the construction of the Francis Crick Institute.
Speed Debate
We were invited to host an event for the Bloomsbury Festival, whose topic was ""The Future of Food"". This allowed us to explore, amongst other food-related topics, the idea of using Darwin Toolbox as a food testing device.
For the event, we opted for the speed debating format, which we pioneered last year and even gave a talk about at the annual science communication BIG event.
MakerFaire Rome
In October, we were invited to attend the MakerFaire Rome and present the work-in-progress prototype of Darwin Toolbox. We shared a large booth with The Kitchen, a London based BioArt studio and together we presented our own projects, iGEM and the Registry of Parts, and DIYbio. Rome gave us a tremendous boost of confidence. The response and enthusiasm we got for Darwin Toolbox was overwhelming, and almost a third of our visitors asked to purchase one. These included field researchers, but also parents who were keen to explore biotechnology with their children and get them interested in Synthetic Biology.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," the image we have of a professor is

. The unconscious bias has been highlighted as one of the main areas to tackle in order to change gender inequality in science and this must be involved in the massive social and structural change of in attitudes to gender equality and diversity.
Conclusively, Dr Wilson highlighted that
one of the big aims of this is to make sure that the student and staff population feels empowered
so that students and staff can challenge people if they are making inappropriate comments and those that cause offense. As both Dr Lewis and Dr Dixon both highlighted, giving women the confidence to represent themselves and the confidence to challenge for important senior roles, is incredibly important to improving immediate attitudes to gender equality.
Dr Wilson left us with some really key points:
He highlighted that there needs to be a massive social and structural change in science for that to be a significant difference in gender equality and we need to reevaluate how we are presenting professorship and senior roles in science.
Having the opportunity for shared parental leave, equalising the time available for maternity and maternity support is really important to make sure that people don’t really get left behind.
Which clearly echoes the points of all of the academics we have spoken to about maternity and paternity leave.
Really importantly, Dr Wilson stressed that:
We need to make sure really that from the moment the undergraduate students walk in through the door of the university that they can see that being a scientist, being an academic, is not a male job and there’s no reason why it should be.

Meeting with Professor Michelle Ryan - Professor of Social and Organisational Psychology, Dean of Postgraduate Research and Director of University of Exeter Doctoral College
On 27/09/16 we concluded our research of highlighting the work of academics at the University of Exeter in equality and diversity. We interviewed Professor Michelle Ryan a Professor of Social and Organisational Psychology, Dean of Postgraduate Research and Director of University of Exeter Doctoral College about her research, what she believes the problem is of equality in science and how we can improve equality and diversity overall.  Professor Ryan is an incredibly inspirational woman and true role model for all, who we spoke to for over an hour. Her research into the ‘Glass Cliff’ is groundbreaking, highlighting the fact that those women who break through the glass ceiling are put in leadership roles in times of crisis or risk meaning they are expected to fail.

Worldwide obesity has nearly doubled since 1980, while in 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight.               In particular, many low- and middle-income countries face “double burden” of under-nutrition and obesity. Rates of malnutrition is much higher in low income countries, while there is a greater exposure to high-sugar, high-fat, high-salt foods which are low in cost and nutrients. Such dietary patterns result in low levels of physical strength and sharp increase in childhood obesity with under-nutrition existing side-by-side.
2. In obesity, fatty acids delivered to liver may outpace fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes, resulting in triglyceride accumulation. Obesity leads to health hazards, including cardiovascular disease - mainly heart disease and stroke, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, especially osteoarthritis – a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints, and cancers, such as endometrial, breast and colon cancers.   Combined: http://www.healthcentral.com/common/images/1/19473_13187_5.jpg Cardiovascular: Obesity and other health conditions associated with obesity, including hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, are risk factors of cardiovascular disease.  http://www.beltina.org/health-dictionary/obesity-cardiovascular-disease-bmi-table.html Diabetes: Patients with type 2 diabetes are insulin resistant, in which high levels of blood fats, cholesterol and triglyceride levels inhibit cells from absorbing blood sugar needed.  http://www.bubblews.com/news/560642-cause-of-type-2-diabetes Musculoskeletal disorders: Those with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 26.4 had rate of osteoarthritis of the knees 6 times greater than those with a body mass index of less than 23.4. (Ref. J. Rheumatol. 20 (2) 331-5) http://pharmaworlds.com/obesity-a-growing-burden-for-physicians-and-patients/
The fundamental cause of obesity is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and expended. To increase expenditure of fatty acids (calories), HKUST 2013 Team aims to introduce glyoxylate shunt as an artificial futile cycle in HepG2 cell.

Summary of Week 10: August 8 - August 14
Computer simulations of the Notch-Delta interactions were presented in our group this week, and we became convinced of the possibility of creating self-patterning mammalian cells. On the DNA side of things, we are trying to create more and more DNA using miniprep, because midipreps have for some reason not been successful for us or the 2010 iGEM team. On the transfection side, a lot of new DNA parts were transfected, observed under the microscope, and FACS-ed to quantify their effect/behavior.

The recursive definition of tree nodes' weight make it possible to sort the forest. For convenience, we add a virtual node ROOT, whose weight value could also be obtained under the general rule, as the root of all trees in the forest and make a conversion from forest to tree. The tree structure could be uniquely determined by recursively sorting all children of each nodes by their weights.
Back to the question above, if two chains have the same unicode_c, which should be arranged ahead? The answer lies in the exchange of them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees. The tree structure (with virtual root) is also possible to change. If the tree structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the tree structure changes, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange the two chains with equal unicode_c. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm could be used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code is actually a representation of the path from current node to the root, we can restore the tree structure from the set of Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes set of leaf nodes could uniquely represent a tree structure. We could generate a string, unicode_t for tree structure by splicing the Huffman codes and their weight of all leaf nodes sorted by their weights and adding a asterisk between two adjacent codes, for example:
[000:0:1][001:1:3][010:2:3][011:2:4]
Based on this idea, we could obtain the tree unicode_t for any possible order by exchanging equivalent chains and choose the order which make the minimum unicode_t value. By checking the unicode_t value of permutation, chains are grouped in a number of equivalent classes, which contains one or more chains. Chains within each equivalent classes are equivalent: exchanging order of any two chains will not change the tree structure.
It is easy to compare two Chain-Model structures with the help of chain sorting. We only need to compare unicode_c value of chains in the chain list"

Integrated into the project
After the conference, we received some feedback from the audience. Based on their suggestions, we made some changes to our project. For example, we decided to change the UI design to improve the user experience. And we wanted to  build a community like GitHub, in which synthetic biology researchers can exchange their thoughts, share their experiences, and avoid the mistakes if some researcher has done the experiment before.
Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan
Motivation
We attended the International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference, held by National Chung Hsing University from July 30th to August 3rd, 2018. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 5 members of our team were sent to Taiwan. We hoped to review our work in a more objective way and learn about projects of other teams.
Integrated into the project
We have learned from other teams that the steps we provided are not enough for them to finish most of the reports. So we designed that users can create new steps and processes. And users can insert texts, pictures, lists, and tables freely in the result section."

She is from New York City and attended Stuyvesant High School, where she was active on the New York City Math Team. She has previously conducted research in computer science at the Research Science Institute at MIT. She enjoys swimming, piano, and will miniprep for chocolate.
Elizabeth is a sophomore in Lowell house, studying Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology with a secondary in Classics. While she's lived in a variety of places such as California, Germany, and Japan, I currently hail from Massachusetts. She loves art, ancient history, poetry, photography, nature, biology, and God. Elizabeth's been interested in science since she asked for a chemistry set and telescope in elementary school, but she truly found her love of biology in the Travis AFB Clinical Investigation Facility, helping to use medical-grade honey to control infections of antibiotic resistant bacteria in traumatic wounds as an alternative to antibiotics.
Sylvia is a junior at Harvard College concentrating in Neurobiology. She is from North Potomac, MD and went to Thomas Wootton High School where her area of expertise lied in computer science and graphic design. She had worked previously at the National Institute of Health doing a range of projects from researching the progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis to data analysis of hemophilia patients. Her passions however lie somewhere between studying human behavior, artistic expression, and not being “normal”. She enjoys sunsets, long walks on the beach, and frisky women.

A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Sampling survey: After we received the results of questionnaire, we took 20% sample out to figure up the data, which is shown below.
Interview: We visited two professors in Northwest A&F University. They gave us some suggestions about our project which is shown in our intergrated page (https://2018.igem.org/Team:NWU-China/Intergrated) .
Detail Data
Q1:How old are you?
First of all we collected suggestions from many people in all age from many fields online. They mainly are teenagers and middle-aged people.
Q2:Do you know synthetic biology?
Three fourth of the people we surveyed are 17~28 years old. Most of them have a brief understanding about synthetic biology. Only a little of them said they were very interested in synthetic biology and willing to research it.
Q3:How do you think about synthetic biology?
We surveyed how people understand synthetic biology and the data is shown below.
According to the data, many people think synthetic biology is close to artificial expression system to express recombinant gene. This result is basically identical to the concept of synthetic biology.
Q4:Have you heard of iGEM?
We surveyed the acknowledge of people about iGEM.
The result is that about half people don’t know much about it. At the same time, one tenth people wants to join the competition.
Q5:Do you know saline-alkali land in China?
Then we designed this question based on our project and the aim is to know how people think about saline-alkali land. The data we collected is shown below.
The result shows three fourth people only have basic acknowledge about saline-alkali land. They just know the harm of it but they don’t know how it comes out. It shows that saline-alkali land doesn’t draw people’s attention enough.
Q6:If there’s a bacteria transformed to ease the saline-alkali land and is rich around root level, are you willing to eat the crops growing on this soil?
This question is designed to get aware of people’s attitude about biology.
The data shows that over a half people are uncertain about the crops growing with artificial transformed bacteria. The survey shows there’re still many people have understanding deviation of synthetic biology. So we expect that synthetic biology can be spread wilder and promote people’s life actively.
Q7:If you joined iGEM, which track will you choose to be your project?
At last we surveyed about the hot point about iGEM. In these choices, most people choose “food and nutrition”. “Gene diagnosis”"

Conclusion
In conclusion we would like to highlight the following
Due to flying being a necessity for us when going to Boston we have a massive carbon footprint.
We acknowledge that any local initiative we have made are pennies on the dollar in regards to CO2 emission and reduction.
The main initiative from us is the partnership with CO2 Neutral Website, which has had a global impact.

Introduction
Welcome to our wiki! We are the iGEM team from the University of Southern Denmark and we have been waiting in great anticipation for the chance to tell you our story.
Our adventure began with a meeting between strangers from eight different studies. Despite our different backgrounds, we had one thing in common; a shared interest in synthetic biology. Soon after this first meeting, we were herded off to a weekend in a cottage - far away from our regular lives. The cottage was a place to bond and discuss project ideas. It immediately became apparent that being an interdisciplinary team was going to be our strength as each member had unique qualities that enabled them to efficiently tackle different aspects of the iGEM competition. So, we made it our goal to take advantage of these qualities.
We decided to make a proof-of-concept project. Specifically, we wanted to use bacteria as a novel and greener solution for solar energy storage. This project was later dubbed the PowerLeaf – A Bacterial Solar Battery.
Since it is a one-page wiki, you can just keep on scrolling, and you will be taken on a journey through our iGEM experience.

B indicates their succesful growth showing OD values gradually increasing up to a peak of around 175, although the time taken to do so is approxiamtely double that of normal processes, and this can be attributed to the introduction of new parts into the E.coli genome resulting in some sort of interaction, that's our theory!
Graph C once again confirms our characterisation as it shows the AU of the green fluorescent dye produced increasing with time. D & E show how the circuit reacts to changes in oxygen at certain intervals where we cut the oxygen of to observe the circuits reaction.

From the paste removed from the fermenter vessel following the successful characterisation of the parts, we used it to creatively mark the words UCL iGEM in plates and hence further emphasizing the results that the parts do work.
 
 
These images further conclude that we succesfully characterised our mNark Promoter as both images have both a control with no observed dye and one showing the green dye, with which we crafted the words UCL and iGEM as shown above.
3. Charactisation of Cambridge Part:BBa_K274003
E. coli turned dark green after transformation of this plasmid. This is unexpected as there is no promoter upstream of the operon.
Diagnostic DNA gel was run to test all 4 restriction sites. BBa_K274003 was cut with XbaI, PstI, EcoRI & SpeI, XbaI & PstI. A gel picture is shown as below.
This plasmid did not cut with Xba I restriction site in our hands. As such we could not use it to assemble after other parts.

Switch BioBrick Digest
We have characterize the Switch BioBrick and shown that it works as expected. Now we are preparing sample for submission, just to make sure that the Switch BioBrick size is correct and has been cloned into pSB1C3 we digested the Switch BioBrick.
We performed 4 digest reactions, first is an uncut plasmid, second and third is a single digest with EcoRI, PstI in this order, and last one is the Double Digest with both enzymes. After leaving the reaction to run at 37oC for 3 hours, we then load them into 0.7% Agarose gel.
The results of the gel revealed that the Switch BioBrick is indeed the correct size and been cloned into pSB1C3 backbone.

We then picked the Switch BioBrick transformed E.coli XL1B colonies from the plate and inoculate 4 bottles of 10ml LB with it. This is to amplify the plasmid, and so will be able to do Plasmid Extraction MiniPrep to extract large quantities of plamid and ready for submission.
Making L-form
We picked B. subtilis str. 168 with HBsu-GFP + Switch BioBrick and HBsu-RFP  + Switch BioBrick transformed into them from the LB+Cm+Ery+0.8%Xylose plate and innoculate them into 12 bottles of 10ml LB.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," in the United States in 1972. A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. In India the use of DDT in order to fight malaria and leishmaniasis is still allowed due to its high effectiveness [6].
To conclude: Until now there is no effective insect repellent without any side effects for public sale! This situation is absolutely inacceptable and searching for an alternative is of high importance.
As we don’t want to be sitting around but do something we discovered an effective alternative – the sesquiterpene nootkatone. Nootkatone is a flavoring substance which is present in the peel of grapefruits and is responsible for its characteristic scent. It has been proven that nootkatone is toxic to the disease-vectoring insects [7]. It is nontoxic to humans and commonly used in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals [8]. Furthermore since it is a natural ingredient in some foods it is officially classified as safe [9]. Additionally, it is environmentally friendly, volatile and does not persist in the environment. Right now, nootkatone costs $4000 per kilogram. This makes it impossible to use it as an insect repellent as it’s not affordable, especially for poor countries where the need for repellents is immense. There are different production ways but all have high costs. The isolation from nootkatone from natural plant sources suffers from low yields, and chemical synthesis involves carcinogenic or hazardous compounds. Many of the production pathways are based on the bicyclic sesquiterpene (+) valencene which is the main component of the volatile oil from the Valencia-Orange and grapefruits. Biotechnological approaches to produce nootkatone in fungi, bacteria and plants all have one major problem in common.  The pathway of nootkatone is toxic for the cells [10].
Here is where our compartmentation comes into play. We want to implement the whole pathway into our modified peroxisome in yeast. Peroxisomes are known for accommodating toxic pathways so this compartment fits our needs just perfectly.
This implementation of the pathway may lead to a high and cheap production of nootkatone.

Construction of aceB constitutive expression construct. While all components of our intended aceB construct were obtained, the construct is yet to be completed. The full construct with EF-1alpha promoter, mitochondrial leader sequence, aceB gene, reporter protein and polyadenylation sequence are to be assembled in pSB1C3 backbone.
Tests of promoter efficiency. GRP78 and FABP1 promoter efficiency can be measured by fluorescence intensity of green fluorescence protein at different fatty acid concentrations.
Construction of inducible glyoxylate shunt construct. The inducible promoter is to be fused with two functional genes, aceA and aceB.
Transfection of construct for the inducible glyoxylate shunt. The construct developed to establish the inducible glyoxylate shunt is to be transfected into HepG2 cells to test its functionality. We plan to place the cell in media of containing different concentrations of fatty acids. The fatty acid uptake rate of our cells engineered for inducible glyoxylate shunt will be compared with that of those expressing constitutive glyoxylate shunt.

We designed four games in our iGEM adventure to explain our project and synthetic biology. The Smelling game, the Lego Receptor game and the Fluorescent Game were three smaller games for the Nacht van de Kunst en Wetenschap in Groningen. Our Llowlab Game for Lowlands was a bigger game.
Nacht van de Kunst & Wetenschap Games
Lego Receptor Game the light went on when a banana was placed but not when an apple was placed. This was to show that each receptor is activated by a specific molecule.
Smelling Game we had 10 different bottles with odors and the visitors of our table were called to find out what they smelled. The one that would find the most correct answers was the winner of our yeast cuddly toy.
Fluorescent Game was with two vases. One with sand the other with paprika powder.  Mixed with water the solution with the paprika powder was becoming fluorescent. We explained that we mixed adapted yeast with a solution with our desired molecule and then yeast would activate the production of the fluorescence protein. /p>
Llowlab Game
We used this game to explain the molecule-receptor-protein-amino acids-DNA steps. It consisted of several parts:
Large illustrations of molecules
Wooden colored bricks representing amino acids
Table with the translation codes
Parts Registry
Yeast cuddly toy
We would start by a explanation about our project. Then we would encourage them to try to solve the puzzle and experience the process.
We had several large illustrations of molecules, representing a scent. Mostly familiar for them like alcohol or THC. Then they would start by building a receptor around the molecule. After this they could read the order of amino acids, the amino acid is written on the side of a brick. With these amino acid, they could"

Short Summary
1.  Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues? Researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
The bacteria we are currently working with are defined as biosecurity stage 1 (S1). Our produced GMOs (genetically modified organisms) are therefore harmless to the user, mankind and the environment. Thus they are GRAS - generally regarded as safe.
Further we are working in a biosecurity laboratory of the stage 1 (S1). There is no possible access for the public. :Every person working in the lab is trained and instructed by the safety rules for laboratories S1.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No. All GMOs are S1 biosafety level. We did a risk assesement and know what kind of modulation we did on the GMOs. There are no risks of hazard or biological safety issues to mankind. We used phage activators as sensitivities tuners. Hence the user of our sensitivity BioBricks must be aware of the risks concerning working with phage DNA.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice#Panel Discussion_-_-_TEXT.html," interactive panel discussion. The event took place in the State Theatre of Darmstadt. Experts in the topic of biotechnology were invited from the field of science and industry. The iGEM team from Darmstadt could get Dr. Maurer for the panel discussion, who had worked 25 years for Henkel and became new Director of Business Development of AB Enzymes. Prof. Dingermann from the Goethe University in Frankfurt took part as a scientific representative for the red biotechnology. Prof. Warzecha of the TU Darmstadt was proponent as Instructor of the iGEM team as well as a representative of the green biotechnology. For the ethical and moral issues in the field of biotechnology, the team from Darmstadt got Prof. Nordmann, who deals with the philosophy of Synthetic Biology. At the beginning of the event, Prof. Warzecha conducted a presentation on biotechnology. He gave the audience a short overview of biotechnology and its applications in today's world. He spoke to the fears of the people and tried to clarify them. This was followed by the presentation of the project of the iGEM team by Arne Wehling. Afterwards was a ""get-together"", in which the audience could talk to speaker and members of the iGEM team. The audience had the opportunity to write down questions on flipcharts that should be answered in the upcoming panel discussion. In the subsequent discussion were the issues of the flipcharts discussed with the audience and the experts. The panel was moderated by Henrik Cordes, who also brought in the discussion as a representative of the team. The event officially ended after three hours, but enough guests remained until late in the evening with the experts and students to discuss about the pro and contra of biotechnology and also Synthetic Biology. It was a good step of the iGEM team of Darmstadt to organize this interactive panel discussion, as it allowed reaching the people. The event shown young scientist, which concerns prevail in the human and which misinformation need to be clarify.
25th August 2012 ""Umweltbörse Darmstadt""
At the 3rd Anual Meeting of Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+ the eleven German iGEM teams agreed to a common event throughout Germany on Synthetic Biology. This took place on 25th August in the respective cities. The TU Darmstadt iGEM team was particularly lucky, because at this time the environmental agency of the city of Darmstadt organized an environmental event on the Ludwigs Platz in the heart of Darmstadt. This meant that the iGEM"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," will call these cells the Biolaser.
A second approach to increase the chance of a photon hitting the detector is by directing the photons towards it. An easy way to do this is to apply a layer of lenses over the detector to focus the light onto it. A layer of tiny lenses is also called a microlens array. However, these microlens arrays are hard to fabricate and their synthesis is harmful for the environment. Therefore, we will modify bacteria in such a way they will become lenses: the Biolenses.
Figure 2: two ways to improve the amount of photons detected in fluorescence microscopy.  First, by modifying a cell so it emits more photons at once using the same amount of fluorophores, we increase the chance of detecting a photon. This method is based on the working principle of a laser and is therefore called a Biolaser. Secondly, using an array of lenses we can focus light onto the detector, increasing the amount of photons detected. These lenses are synthesized using microorganisms, hence they are called Biolenses.

Synthetic biology to produce biological lasers
In order to modify Escherichia coli in such a way that it is able to emit laser-like light, meaning it emits more photons, we first need to understand how a laser works. A laser has three essential components: a gain medium, an excitation source and a reflective agent. The gain medium is a medium with the ability to fluoresce. This gain medium is surrounded by a reflective agent, such as a mirror. This gain medium gets excited by the excitation source, which could be either an electric pulse or an external light source. Once this gain medium gets excited, it will emit photons. Because the gain medium is surrounded by a mirror, the photons cannot escape the gain medium but will ‘bounce’ back. When one of these photons hits an excited fluorescent molecule, something remarkable happens. This molecule will release an exact copy of the incident photon. This process is called stimulated emission. The result is that the light gets amplified each time it passes through the gain medium. Therefore, with only a limited amount of fluorescent molecules we can emit a lot more light compared to ‘conventional’ fluorescence.
Figure 3: a schematic representation of the process of lasing. First, the fluorescent gain medium is excited by an external excitation source. The excited molecules emit photons, which bounce back on the mirror surrounding the gain medium. When one of these photons hits another excited molecule, this molecule releases an exact copy of the incident photon, therefore ‘amplifying’ the light.

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,", which for a PhiC31 style system takes part in the interactions,
the differential equation is:
Estimation of Parameter Values
Promoter J32101 was reported to drive transcription at a rate of 0.03 PoPS (polymerases per second) [3]. We ranged our promoter strengths from 10-12 to 0.1 PoPS, as this was the range in which we saw interesting dynamics.
A previous study found that the average half-life of an mRNA is approximately 5 minutes [4]. We used this parameter for mRNA degradation in our model.
To find a reasonable range for translation rate, we referred to a study in which lacZ translation was found to range from roughly 15 to 50 translation initiation events per minute per mRNA [5]. We assumed translation occurred at a rate of 20 initiation events per minute per mRNA, and varied only transcription rate to change protein concentrations.
Based on a study of protein degradation rates [6], we produced protein degradation constants by assuming the half-life of all proteins to be 60 minutes.
For the forward and reverse rate constants, we did not have any data. We assumed k1, k-1, and krec all to be 1.
For all simulations discussed below, we ran the simulations with varying rate constant values to check if our assumptions had a significant impact on the results. We found that results were qualitatively similar.
Sensitivity Analysis of Bxb1- and PhiC31-style Switch Systems
We simulated the behavior of each switch with varying integrase and RDF promoter strengths. We used 50 switches in the simulations, and kept track of the percentage of switches that had flipped from PB to RL state at the system’s steady state (Figure 3). We also ran the simulations with different switch copy numbers and obtained qualitatively similar results.
Figure 3. Comparison of a) Bxb1-style and b) PhiC31-style switches flipping with various Int and RDF promoter strengths.
These graphs are qualitatively similar to those obtained by Bonnet et al using their simulation [3].
We note that the dynamics for very low Int and RDF promoter strengths (10-12 – 10-9 PoPS) are similar for the two switches, but that for higher promoter strengths they differ. In the Bxb1-style system RDF promoter strength above 10-9 PoPS rules out flipping of the switch, regardless of integrase promoter strength, while in the PhiC31-style system high RDF expression can be matched with high Int expression and the switch can still flip. Since the PhiC31-style system allows for RDF to complex"

Atlanta Science Festival
The Atlanta Science Festival is an annual event each spring, featuring a week of hands-on activities, facility tours, presentations, and performances throughout the metro Atlanta region. It culminates with the Exploration Expo held at Centennial Olympic Park, located only a ten-minute walk from Georgia Tech’s campus. The free expo attracted upwards of 15,000 visitors and featured over 100 booths with hands on activities, science demos, and presentations, designed to expose STEM topics to patrons of all ages and inspire them to appreciate the sciences.
On March 28th, our iGEM team collaborated with Georgia State’s iGEM team to run a booth on synthetic biology. We taught children about BioBrick assembly through a LEGO brick activity. Each color of a small LEGO brick represented a different BioBrick part, such as a promoter, ribosomal binding site, or a coding sequence. These parts were attached to a larger “backbone” LEGO brick that represented either a bacteria or yeast cell. We thought that brightly colored and tangible LEGO bricks would appeal to children and allow them to visualize the organization of gene sequences. In addition to the LEGO models, we also had displayed samples of E. coli with the gene mCherry fused into them, to demonstrate how we can use recombinant gene sequences to allow E. Coli to take on new properties.
Informational iGEM Pamphlet
In order to spread the word about iGEM to our Georgia Tech campus, we created an informational iGEM pamphlet that talks in layman terms about what iGEM is and how students can get involved. We handed them out to introductory biology, chemistry, and some upper level biology/biomedical engineering classes. Following these hand-out sessions, the iGEM Club, which has been established recently by Georgia Tech’s iGEM team, has seen a huge surge in interest. We hope that these pamphlets will serve as a great stepping-stone for students to not only gain interest in iGEM, but also to foster their curiosity in synthetic biology.
iGEM Lab Techniques Video Series
Following the success of our informational pamphlet, we decided to make a series of educational videos detailing the methods we practiced in lab. The videos include the following topics: PCR, Transformation,"

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Social Project_-_-_TEXT.html," one big wiki and changes done to the layout will change all other team wikis as well.
The best way of styling your wiki anyway is by using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). To read more about CSS read the following section.
Read more
CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) is a language that is used to describe what elements on a web page are supposed to look like. So a webpage is created using HTML code and can be styled using CSS. The CSS instruction are to be placed between an opening ""<style>"" and a closing ""</style>"" in the header of a HTML page or can be directly included in HTML tags using the ""style"" attribute:
<html> <head> <title>CSS example</title> ... <style type=""text/css""> a {             color: green;          }          a.external {             color: red;          }          #bestImage {             border: 1px solid green;             width: 500px;          }          .red {             color: red;          }          ... </style> </head> <body> <p '''style=""color: red;"">Just some text</p> </body> </html>
If the style-attribute is used, the CSS instruction will only affect this tag and all its child-tags. In case of the ""<style>"" block in the header section, two types of information have to be provided: What is to be styled and how is it to be styled.
The first information is provided by so-called selectors. A selector can select an element of the page in many different ways. A selector can generally select all tags of a certain kind (e.g. all <p>-tags). Secondly, a selecotr can select an element that has a certain identifier. An identifier is a unique ID for an element within the webpage and is specified by the attibute ""id"" (e.g. <img id=""bestImage""><nowiki>). Thirdly, a selector can select a subgroup of elements, called class. HTML elements can be grouped into a classes by using the attribute ""class"" (e.g. <nowiki><img class=""goodImages"">).
A selector is always placed before the opening bracket ""{"". In the example above all three types have been used: ""a"" is a selector that selects all link elements (<a>-tags). ""a.external"" addresses all links that have been assigned to the group ""external"" (<a class=""external"">-tags). ""#bestImage"" refers to the element that has the ID ""bestImage"" (e.g. <img id=""best"

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Idea#Pre study_-_-_TEXT.html," secrete any necessary molecules to the keratinocytes such as melnin, which gives skin color. From here I thought that we could via our bacteia on the skin introduce the lacking melanin to the keratinocytes, hence in a short time period giving skin color.  :)
Nina: Our aim is to have our bacteria on the skin to produce the missing melanin in vitiligo skin as a fusing protein with a cell penetrating peptide, thus passing into the skin layer (epidermis) and entering the “empty of melanin“ keratocytes. This will result in giving a vitiligo skin back its color somewhat directly (matter of days maybe, depending on how much melanin our bacteria produces and enters the target cells ->keratocytes). This approach of allowing for repigmentation to occur will help many people in a short time (compared to current techniques, taking 6 -12 months). Additionally, the vitiligo skin will be more tolerable against UV-light thanks to the bacteria produced melanin entering keratocytes.
Nina: We have found an article about transgenic e.coli producing one type of melanin. Hopefully in the future one might by research find a color spectrum of different pigment molecules (melanin) that will match to different people’s skin color.
“Melanins are polyphenolic heteropolymers with a wide range of colors and applications. Due to their chemical composition, melanins have physicochemical properties that allow them to act as ultraviolet absorbers, cation exchangers, drug carriers, amorphous semiconductors, X-ray and γ-ray absorbers, and in some instances, substrates with antioxidant and antiviral activity (Riley 1997; Lagunas-Muñoz et al. 2006). Bacteria are known to produce 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-melanins, the pheomelanins or eumelanins, and melanin-like pigments that are derived from non-nitrogenous phenols (the allomelanins or pyomelanins; Gibson and George 1998).” - Characterization of a Deep-Sea Sediment Metagenomic Clone that Produces Water-Soluble Melanin in Escherichia coli p. 125

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," Aedes genus. It is or has been endemic in almost all tropical parts of the world, and is slowly spreading to colder regions [15]. The symptoms after infection include fever, photophobia, headaches, joint and muscle pain and skin rash [16]. As many current infectious disease outbreaks involve viruses [1] it is important that Mantis can detect these as well. For this, we are using chikungunya as proof-of-principle.
Alternative applications
Apart from a point-of-care screening test during epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases, Mantis can in principle be applied in other situations. We explored several of them.
Veterinary
As described before, HAT causes many deaths in Africa. This is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense. However, related parasite species like T. b. brucei and T. congolense can infect livestock. This causes Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) that results in major economic losses in the affected countries [9]. Our test can be used for veterinary purposes as well. However, since the social and economic impact will be less significant, we focussed on human testing.
Vector control
HAT is transmitted by the tsetse fly. In order to reduce the spread of the disease, surveillance of vector populations can be valuable. Moreover, the other form of HAT, caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, is difficult to eliminate not only by the lack of available screening kits, but even more by the vast amount of animal reservoirs which serve as an intermediate for disease transmission. A key part to control T. b. rhodesiense HAT is the monitoring of the domestic reservoirs infected by the parasite, as well as reduction of the tsetse fly population [17]. For viral diseases, like Zika and chikungunya, vector control is also a very important factor, since these diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes. Since the Mantis device is equipped with GPS data storage, it would be suitable for vector monitoring and spread. However, we found out that a modular tool like Mantis is not the top priority within vector control, hence we decided to focus our project on human screening. You can read why on our Integrated Human Practices page .
There are thus several opportunities for our modular test to be used in the field. For our integrated human practices, we emphasized on applying our device for screening during new disease outbreaks. How we got to this idea, you can read in our timeline . In the roll-out plan , you can read how our"

You always heard from the news that drunk driving accidents killed people. The police improve the road traffic safety by the field sobriety test. The breathalyzer is the most often used tool to identify the suspects of “drunkards”. However, the method is not so ideal for some issues and we’ve researched the news about these.
INDIVIDUAL METABOLIC DIFFERENCE
Alcohol in the human body is flowing through the blood and metabolized in the liver. Some of the alcohol will diffuse out through breathing. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) could be estimated from breath alcohol concentration (BAC) by Henry’s Law statistically. That is, the amount of alcohol in the blood concentration is 2100 times greater than that in the breath concentration. However, individual metabolic difference could hugely affect the accuracy of this evaluation by breathing method.
The hypothesis was further supported by a research (Figure 1) and a breathalyzer experience activity (Figure 2) held at the campus of Mingdao High School, showing that the huge variation of alcohol concentrations between individual differences.
DISEASES LIKE DIABETES OR METABOLIC DISORDERS
Diabetes is a disease associated with a high glucose level in the blood. Ketoacidosis is very common in diabetes, in which the body prefers burning the fatty acids and produce ketone bodies due to the lack of insulin. Acetone , a breakdown product of ketone bodies, cannot be distinguished from ethanol by the infrared (IR) beams in an infrared-based breath analyzer. Isopropanol is a by-product of acetone metabolism which cannot be distinguished from ethanol in an electrochemical breathalyzer. That all causes false-positive breathalyzer test.
REFUSAL
Refusal to conduct the sobriety test is very common in the news on TV. The “suspects” were willing to pay the fine (i.e., NTD 90,000 in Taiwan) rather than blowing through the breathalyzer. Possibly they avoid being charged with a crime of drunk driving in such a way.
People in coma or dead
The police are never able to force a dead or unconscious people to breathe and run the breathalyzer.
Is a blood sample a good alternative you may think? According to"

Microfluidics
In our experiment, we want to study the neural network activity and behavioral response of Caenorhabditis elegans under light stimuli of specific wavelengths. Thus, we need to design an accurate and user-friendly platform for studying the collective behavior of worms with high throughput as well as live neuron-level observations under natural conditions.
To meet these design goals, we designed three microfluidic chips: the Selection Chip to select worms of appropriate sizes, the Gaussian Plate to monitor changes in the worm’s group behavior, and the Immobilization Plate to observe live neuron activities without anesthetization. (Fig.1)

Detailed Microfluidics
Light Modulator
Multiple devices of optics are designed and created for the various experiment requirements, such as, stimulate neuron of C. elegans, train C. elegans and induce C. elegans move in a special direction. All devices attempts to modulate the spatio-temporal pattern in an elegant and effective way. We constructed projector light source and modulated mercury lamp. Just let us start to play with light.
We use 395nm light to activate calcium indicator protein GEM-GECO by Lumencor LED Illuminator. Then CoChR and Chrimson are activated by blue light and red light from LCD projector. LCD projector and LED Illuminator are merged by a double LH Adapter contained a semi-transparent mirror, which"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Localization_-_-_TEXT.html," our transmembrane receptors right before the Strep-tag. Cells that express and fold the protein properly should give a signal of 605 nm (red) when exited at around 558 nm (rfp channel). [20] We tested our contructs three diffrent cell types: HEK293T adherent cells that were stably transfected, HEK293E suspension cells that were semi-stably transfected and N2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, that we transiently transfected.
As you can see on the images the signal developed over time. In the beginning, before selection, the protein was visible in little dots and therefor seemed to be localized more in subcellular oragnelles than in the membrane.  During selection on hygromycin B resistency most of the cells died, leaving some resistant cells behind, which over time grew to bigger foci consisting of stably transfected cells only (See Fig. B). For the BAP-receptor there was hardly to no fluorescence detectable neither in semi-stable nor in the stable transfection approach. But in latter case the cells still grew on hygromycin B and formed foci, which leads us to the conclusion that chromosomal intergration was susccesful (as already shown via PCR) hence there must be some problem in later steps of transcription, translation or protein maturation.  After 2 weeks of selection on hygromycin B the foci were harvested and expanded. The cells seemed to recover fast and moreover the red dots nearly disappeared leaving only the membrane of the scA-receptor cells illuminated by mRuby.
High resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy
In order to obtain high resolution confocal fluorescence images from our receptor constructs we transfected the Neuro-2a (N2a) mouse neuroblastoma cells line with the respective plasmids. Shortly before the end of the project Christoph came up with the idea to include a trafficking signal to the C-terminus of the receptor proteins that is described to increase the surface presentation of receptors by sorting them intracellularly towards the cell membrane. The sequence of this trafficking signal is DFFdDFFJDFJDKJFKFDJFD (aagagcaggatcaccagcgagggcgagtacatccccctgg accagatcgacatcaacgtgGGCGGCttctgctacgagaacgaggtgtaa) [21] and we have inserted it into the assembled BioBrick device using PCR cloning.

The remaining interactions of succinate with R60, R63, R254, and Q65 are analogous to the malate structure where they establish six hydrogen bonds.

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

However, it exists few case where a drug can be sold with no AMM:
The Temporary Authorization of Use (ATU): if a drug doesn’t have any AMM and has significant positive result in the clinical trials, doctors can be authorized to prescribe the drug. But this is only possible if the disease concerned is sufficiently rare or severe.
The Temporary Recommendation of Use (RTU): grant the possibility for a doctor to prescribe a drug if there is no other possibility of treatments, with conditions ruled by the ANSM
Doing further analyse on how our box and the protein It produces could be used in the market, we thought that we could produce protein or hormone used in the livestock industry.
Maxime has then given us insight on how such molecules could be authorized: In France, and on the European scale, the companies that want to sell a new molecule on the European market, must get their products assess buy the European Food Safety Agency (ENSA). They will go through a process where they must produce a study the risk of their molecule, and the result will be analyzed by the ENSA, which will allow the molecule if it doesn’t present any harmful effect for the human and animal health and doesn’t show any unacceptable risk for the environment. If allowed the molecule will be registered in the list of authorized molecules. To be then authorized in France the molecule will be analyzed by the French regulating agency for food and sanitary security (ANSES). The ANSES will verify if the molecule registered has the right composition, and basically, do a similar work as the ENSA.
This whole process is much shorter than the AMM and can take up to 3 to 5 years.

The survey reached thirty students from different teams and from several countries. The majority of participants come from academia (53.33%) and industry (30.00%).
Overall, this study shows a very positive opinion on biomanufacturing. Indeed, even if more than half of students do not feel sufficiently informed or trained on biomanufactring, the vast majority of students think that biomanufacturing presents a sustainable alternative to traditional manufacturing techniques. The survey reveals that most of the participants value that, with further research, biomanufacturing technologies will outperform traditional manufacturing techniques in terms of financial efficiency.
Though, many students deplore the facts that the connection between academia and industry in biomanufacturing research is still pretty weak and that negative public perception deters investment in biomanufacturing.
When analyzing these data, you should keep in mind that all respondents participate in iGEM competition"

We designed an online questionnaire ‘Investigation of situation about the use of iGEM parts’ and spread it to over 16 districts and nearly 100 iGEMers and synthetic biologists.
Of course, questionnaire cannot live without analysis. We spent some time analyzing the results and used the method of binary-crossover analysis. Surprised results were found and it inspired us for the next step.
Our analysis results
We used binary-crossover analysis to the question ‘How do you feel about searching information in iGEM Registry? ’ and ‘What difficulties or problems you would encounter when constructing a gene circuit? ’. The former is the independent variable X and the latter is the dependent variable Y. Through this method, we were surprised to get a message that was easily ignored before. From the initial statistical results, the ratio of option A ‘I don't know which part to use’ is the smallest. However, after analysis, we could see that most dissatisfied people chose ’I don’t know which part to use’. In other words, in our project we should focuses more on this issue. According to this, we are more determined to added more accurate information to the database as much as possible.

Communication with Dr. Dai
On 31st Jul, we attended the scholars' forum on synthetic biology, led by Dr. Dai Junbiao from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. After the forum, we communicated with Dr. Dai. We simply introduced what BioMaster is and what we want to achieve. He gave us his opinions and what he think about our projects. Also, he provided something that we should improve such as experimented data.
Full conversation
Question 1: When the experimenter conducts synthetic biology research and gene circuit construction, what aspects of the biological bricks should our database focus on and provide information to facilitate its work?
Answer: First, the sequence information of the components is very important. Second, the description of the function of biological components is also critical. At the same time, if you can provide data of some experiments carried out on some fragments or sites, it would be better. The experimenter will make good use of this information.
Question 2: What ideas or suggestions do you have for our project?
Answer: The starting point of your project is very good. According to my understanding, the registry on iGEM online does have a lot"

Familiar with each other, we frequently communicate our experiment process, giving a helping hand while one facing difficulties. Plasmid backbone psb1c3, DH5α, interlab… Whenever they are in need, we are by their side. Also, they shared experience in cell culture and lent machines such as fluorescent microscope to us.
Jilin_China
We first got acquaintance with Jilin_China in Nankai Conference and kept contact with each other afterwards. To ensure the repeatability of our data, we sent C-terminal and N-terminal of ECFP to them, requesting them to test whether we have split the protein right. Meanwhile Jilin_China works on RNA thermosenser this year and they need to test the expression of sfGFP in different temperature, indicating in what condition the designated thermosensor is open.

We consulted the professors in Chun Shin University and Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute for the advice about insect cultivations and feeding assays.
We used the IoT talk system in our project which is invented by Professor Lin Yi-Pin of NCTU.
We visited the tea shop owner and organic farmers in green market to ask them about the feasibility and directions of our project.
We attended many conferences in Asia.
We had online meetups with iGEM teams to exchange some project opinions.
To investigate the public willingness, we released an online survey. The result shows that 84% of respondents want to try our PANTIDE.
We held biocamp for high school students and introduced iGEM to them.

No graph provided for this experimental data - activity consistently low.
Attempt 2
No data was gathered as no colour change was observed during the incubation period. With this in mind, the identity of the BioBrick was investigated - it was at this stage we realised that the BioBrick only contained LacZα, not the full copy of LacZ we had originally thought. Armed with this new information we transformed the XL1-Blue E.coli strain and tested adding IPTG to the cultures in attempt 3.
Attempt 3
Cultures were grown at 0mM, 15mM and 30mM [KNO3]. Two parallel sets of cultures were set up, one in the presence of IPTG (set 1), one in the absence of IPTG (set 2). All cultures were grown in both Ampicillin and Tetracyclin together.
Table
Graph
With these pleasing results we went on to attempt to create our PyeaR+LacZ(full) construct. Attempt 4 was made with the construct before we discovered the slight faults that had occurred during its preparation.
Attempt 4
Cultures of M182 cells plus the new construct were grown at 0mM, 15mM and 30mM [KNO3]. All cultures were grown in Ampicillin.
Table
Graph
As is clearly shown by the graph, the results are now the complete opposite of our original observations - consistently high activity, with no correlation to the [KNO3]. On sequencing of the construct, the reason behind this is clear. The promoter sequence (PyeaR) doesn't appear in the construct! (see the page on design of the PyeaR+LacZ construct for more details). After this, we returned to the BBa_K216009 for the final two attempts at getting some worthwhile data.

BphP (or BrBphP for the Bradyrhizobium variant) is sensitive to far-red light (~770nm) and controls PpsR1.
For more info, see [1] .
Similar constituents could possibly be derived from R. Palustris as well with the following model derived from [2] :
Implementation
There are two modes in which we can use the system. The minimal complement requires PpsR2 and its regulator BphP. We can generate a hybrid system that uses a well known activator or transcription factor, or a constitutively active promoter which will be repressed via PpsR2 upon exposure to far-red light (770nm).
It is also possible to reconstitute the entire system including PpsR1-C429S, which will serve as the activator and will be de-coupled from the oxidative state of the cell due to the ablation of the disulfide bond formation.
Strains
We contacted Eric Giraud and ask if he could send us the following material:
Bradyrhizobium ORS278
The following plasmids:
pBAD::ppsR1

Drylab Overview
The investigation for design of the dome have now been expanded into investigation of internal structures. That means Lau has also decided on what kind of brick forms should be used, as the result of his work revealed that he had to have at least two types of bricks designs. In regards of simulation microscopic mycelium growth, this week was spent investigating how to make the branch extension dependent on growth kinetics of the specific fungi.
The mechanical compression tests were carried out, where Mathias and Mathies have been crushing many bricks. The mycelium bricks have a lot of moisture of them which influenced the bricks quite a lot in terms of pressure resistance.

Experiment: Verification of PCR amplified camV terminator
The camV. T. PCR amplificants were run on a gel to verify that the amplification had been successful. It seems that the amplificants seem successful.
The colonies were cultivated further in a liquid overnight cultre for miniprepping tomorrow. Lastly, we redid the gel for the hph selection marker. From this, it seems like H2 is the most viable selection marker.

Experiment: Gibson Assembly of gene casettes.
Since the previous PCR amplification with Gibson primers didn't yield any backbone to assemble into, as well as lacking some other amplifications, these were attempted again. This time both plasmid-inserted and linearized PCR amplification was performed. As can be seen from the gel below the plasmid amplifed backbone (PCR product 4 in the freezer) yielded an amplfied backbone.
The products ampflied are pTrpC-MelA (A. oryzae), GfaA, CaMV-GfaA, backbone from plasmid and backbone. The last three are from an investigation of a construct from the"
Tufts,2015,Team:Tufts#app scenario_-_-_TEXT.html," seeds [2]. Legal suits have forced private farms and small businesses into using the company’s products -- or worse driving them bankrupt.
        Can either Dr. Doudna or Dr. Zhang decide to prevent drugs from coming to market if they use the CRISPR/Cas9 system? If so, they could be denying the public of a greater good because of a contract negotiation with the company that develops the drug. Had Jonas Salk done so in the 1950s, the world would not have had as wide access to the polio vaccine.
        If we switched to a system based on open biology, would scientists in academia, biotech, and pharma industries continue to do groundbreaking work? Research is expensive, requiring numerous grants and external funding. If companies cannot afford to pay their employees for work, how can they expect to attract top notch researchers and continue developing drugs?
  We have concluded that a mixture of open and private biology is the best option for the field of synthetic biology. The courts need to establish a legal distinction between engineering biological systems to perform new functions, and discovering the functionality of an existing element. Manipulating systems to carry out novel functions still requires the discovery of new materials, but in order to encourage the brightest minds to science, there needs to be an incentive for new researchers to join the field. Companies that alter the genome of an organism have the right to that intellectual property; however, we begin going down a slippery slope when we allow naturally occurring genes to be patented -- as a company may want to patent the human genome. We must also establish recourse for companies that invest millions into drugs in order to prevent them from being “falsely sued.” We hope to discuss many of these issues and generate potential solutions at our conference: Intellectual Property in the Age of Synthetic Biology.

At a final concentration of 2M*⅓=666 mM NaCl, the aggregates were the most intensively changed of color. One mistake was made by pipetting the complete d-AuNPs tube into the wells without mixing the tube constantly. The d-AuNPs were sedimentating to the bottom of the tube and this was pipetted into wells E1 and E2. These results should be left out of the data analysis.
From the data, the spectrum of the mixtures with 0 mM, 1000 mM and 2000 mM NaCl were plotted. Due to pipetting errors and mixing errors, the standard deviations at lower salt concentrations were high. Additionally, the from all the samples with different salt concentrations, the ratio 620/520 was calculated and plotted over the salt concentration.

Positive traits: It was very easy to use.
Traits to improve: User interface: even though it was simple and easy to use, the output screen for showing HTML texts could have been larger.
Comments: Our team makes HTML version of lab notebooks by making a template first and letting people (who may not know HTML) fill in the blank template. If no one in the team knows how to write HTML codes, we think this software could be very helpful. However, if there were someone who can, it may be faster for them to create blank templates. However, a system to register names was very useful, as we didn’t have to type in the experimenter’s name every time. Biobrick parts are also very long and tiresome to type in, so allowing us to register BioBrickparts in the same manner may also improve user experience. We would like to use this software with such improvements in the future.
From such feedback, we improved the registration process of the experimenter names, and continue to provide and upgrade this software. For more information, please follow the links we provided above."

Our results also allowed us to conclude that at temperatures close to 4°C and 37°C growth is limited, as there was little to no change in area. Below (images 1 and 2) are time-lapses of the dishes used to grow the dikaryion monokaryon strain at 24°C, 30°C, and 37°C over the course of 9 days. This information was important as it also informed our mission architecture. Temperatures on Mars can fluctuate greatly, with a common average being -55°C. Because of the low temperatures on Mars and the slower growth rate of mycelium at low temperatures we realized we needed to configure a heating system into the design of the habitat during the growth period.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," broaden their horizons. We needed to make sure that they understood how synthetic biology worked without needing to leave GMOs in the resulting honey, which we did. This task was done by preparing beekeepers a simple presentation with terms that were comprehensible for them, where we explained some examples of how it has been used in the last few years.
After this, we presented our first research project proposal and they told us some feedback that we used later to integrate and improve it. They congratulated us for making research projects in beekeeping because it is being forgotten, and if we can do something in benefit of bees, we are totally welcomed to this business.
IV State’s Beekeeping Forum
In our state, 250 honey producers are distributed in 10 regional associations. We count with more than 43,000 beehives. We produce approximately 600 tons of honey per year, of which 400 are exported mainly to Germany and the rest stays for local consume.1
We live in a state where beekeepers must be informed of what is happening in the outside world. Having said that, we think that they should know how synthetic biology can influence their business with our given approach. For us, it's very important to keep in touch with the people who are directly related to bees. Therefore, we went ahead with the task of making a bigger step and getting more informed citizens and more conscious beekeepers.
After our meeting with beekeepers in Cuauhtémoc, we noticed that beekeepers needed to  stay  updated  with
science and that besides reaching our locality,  we wanted to embrace our state.
That’s why we participated in the “IV Foro Estatal de Apicultura” (4th State’s Beekeeping Forum in English), to discuss what is behind synthetic biology and to let people who are not related with the laboratory know that this new area of genetic engineering is not that far away.
This event took place from July 27th through July 29th in our state in the city of Delicias, a couple of hours away from our home. The “IV Foro Estatal de Apicultura” was organized by the Delicias' Beekeepers Association and the State's Government, which counted with the presence of state and federal authorities.
The Delicias' Beekeepers Association invited beekeepers from Chihuahua’s state, future beekeepers, the delegate of the Secretariat of State in charge of administering federal funds to rural development, general public that was interested in bees, and the iGEM team Tec-Chihuahua 2018.

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#testpage_-_-_TEXT.html," deems this set of genes unsuitable with regards to our SIM device. To switch the SIM device on, we would need to find a promoter common to genes that are highly expressed in milk. No set of genes in this experiment jumps out and so we would need to investigate expression patterns in milk further.
Outlook
Had we the time and funding, we would have liked to have repeated these experiments in slightly different conditions. We would have decreased the time interval of exposure, changed the media so that there were fewer confounding variables e.g. trying to reduce amino acid presence in the base media as far as possible, and performed more detailed growth curve analyses prior to sending our samples.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

Fluorescent Microscopy
The genetic switch systems that are being characterised make use of two different reporter genes, namely green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP). These will give a visual indication as to the functioning of the parts being tested. The biobricks, BBa_I13521 and BBa_I13522 were transformed into E. coli and serve as positive controls for fluorescent microscopy. These two parts consist of the reporter genes, GFP and RFP respectively and are under the control of a constitutive promoter.
Figure 1. The fluorescent microscopy positive controls GFP (BBa_I13521) and RFP (BBa_I13522).
Cloning of Parts
The parts required for the characterisation of an inverter switch as well as a switch based on excision were synthesised by Integrated DNA technologies as part of their promotion to iGEM teams. These gBlocks were received and blunt end cloned into pUC19 plasmids to create high copy number of our parts. The inserts were then retrieved by restriction digests of the flanking EcoRI and PstI sites for sticky end cloning into the pSB1C. The digests were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel for electrophoresis to separate linear vector from inserts. The bands corresponding to the respective parts being characterised were excised and purified using a Zymo Gel purification kit (Inverter 1, BBa_K1768001; Inverter 2 BBa_K176800; Cre generator, BBa_K1768004).
Figure 2. Restriction digest of Inverter 1 (Lane 1), Inverter 2 (Lane 2), Cre generator (Lane 3) and their respective undigested plasmids (Lanes4-6).
The purified inserts were ligated into pSB1C for part submission and the Cre generator BBa_K1768004 ligated into pSB1A for experimentation. These vectors were supplied with the 2015 Distribution Kit and were digested with EcoRI and PstI to create complimentary sticky ends to the inserts. Cultures were grown from the resulting colonies and screened for biobrick parts with the standard VF and VR primer"

Apoptosis Induction
Title: Validation of pMLPm activation with dCas9-VP64-gRNA and induction of apoptotic signal in C8-D30 astrocyte cells.
Conducted by: Liat Tsoran, Mor Pasi and Ori Tulchinsky
Date: 30/9/18-14/10/18
Aim: In this experiment we wanted to validate that our synthetic engineered system could induce apoptotic death by the activation of the synthetic minimal adenovirus major late promoter (pMLPm) via dCAs9-VP64-gRNA complex that is expressed by A1 reactive astrocyte specific promoters.
Importance: In the astrocyte-cells pathway we aimed to eliminate only A1 reactive astrocytes by triggering apoptotic death, while maintaining the resting cells in the central nervous system (CNS) intact.
In this experiment we wanted to validate our enginnered system, in which, dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex that is expressed by A1 reactive astrocyte specific markers, can activate the pMLPm promoter to regulate the expression of exogenous reverse caspase3 that will trigger an apoptotic signal.
Theoretical background:
pSTEAP4 (Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of Prostate 4 promoter)  and pTIMP1 (Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 promoter) are regulating the exoression of genes that are highly expressed in A1 reactive astrocyte cells when compared to other cells in the CNS1-2.
In our therapeutic approach, we wanted to use these markers in order to express dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex that will activate a synthetic promoter to induce an apoptotic signal.
The synthetic minimal adenovirus major late promoter (pMLPm) contains three repetitions of the ""a1"" sequence, which are complementary to the gRNA sequence, enabling dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex to target the pMLPm synthetic promoter1.When the transcription factor VP64 (an engineered tetramer of the herpes simplex VP16 transcriptional activator domain) is fused to dCas9 enzyme, it can be guided to a specific location in the genome, in this manner we can exploit it to promote downstream translation2.
The dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex will target the pMLPm synthetic promoter"

UESTC-China Tec-Monterrey
UESTC-China
During the time we designed a flow chart for our CO2 utilization system for                                     application. We were lucky to find our friend, UESTC-China , to work together and                                     end up building a completely eco-friendly system with negative carbon footprint.
We tried to figure out another way in carbon utilization as an                                         contribution of carbon reduction and save energy. However, we face some problem                                         when we tried to apply our Engineering E. coli into industrial scale. Cost                                         evaluation and carbon footprint are big challenges                                         When we were designing the whole CO2 utilization system. We were delighted when                                         we found out someone who will be able to resolve our problems. UESTC-China mainly                                          focused on degrading straw into useful raw materials, including glucose, xylose,                                          ferule acid, and lignin. In addition, they aimed to convert glucose into butanol                                          and hydrogen. As xylose is the main carbon source for our                                         engineered E. coli, we came up with a collaboration idea by integrating our                                         system at the downstream of their system. Xylose is one of the side product                                         produced during straw degradation, it can be extracted and utilized in our                                         system. Concerning the synthesis of xylose may produce greenhouse gas and                                         chemicals, we would like to obtain xylose produced via biological method.
Through UESTC system, xylose will be produced in their fermentation broth as well as                                          other three raw material. In order to calculate the amount of xylose production,                                          they tested the ferulic acid which yield by gas chromatography (GC) after 12 hours.                                          Basically, ferulic acid cover for 1.15% of straw.                                          Then, the enzyme activity of ferulic acid degradation can be calculated.                                          Next, we assume that the rate of xylan decomposition is the same                                          as that of ferulic acid while 30% of xlyan composed of straw.                                          Finally, through derivation, we can get 0.0348 kg xylose from 1 kg straw.                                         "
