DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#products_-_-_TEXT.html," developed by our team. By combining these two parts in a device ( BBa_K2117005 ) the expression should in theory be easily detected due to the fluorescence signal produced. The cloning flow can be seen in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Cloning flow of the expression test of pSB1A8YL in Y. lipolytica. The expression of the GFP should yield a flourescent ouput detectable by fluorescence microscopy or fluorometer measurements.

DESCRIPTION
Results
The parts were ordered as gBlocks and assembled in E. coli using A3 assembly. The assembly was confirmed using restriction analysis (See Figure 2), PCR and sequencing (data not shown).
Afterwards the construct was transformed into Y. lipolytica PO1f and grown on plates containing selective media. Single colonies were picked and grown in liquid selective media, and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. Figure 3 shows the Y. lipolytica PO1f cells under a confocal laser microscope with 100x magnification. The high fluorescent output from with the BBa_K2117005 construct, proves that the cells are producing hrGFP, and ultimately that our expression system consisting of pSB1A8YL and the TEF1 promoter ( BBa_K2117000 ) can be used for heterologous protein expression in Y. lipolytica.

Ethical issues in synthetic biology on a macro level
Discussing synthetic biology
Since the “reintroduction” of term synthetic biology in 2005, several reports have appeared in which the ethical and social issues related to this field of research are described. Ethical and social reflections in a stage this early in scientific development have not been observed in other novel technologies, like nuclear energy and genetic engineering, some decades ago. Yet with the recent introduction of nanotechnology, experts tend to see the necessity of these considerations. This report will not describe into detail why these social and ethical reflections are said to be necessary;"

We made a plan to prepare the electro competent cells tomorrow and perform a test electroporation by tomorrow itself.  Discussed with Laura about the use of the BioTek Synergy instrument which will be used for making measurements of the delay device working and she gave consent to help us by giving a demo of its use in next week by performing a test assay (GFP expression with growth). She too doesn't know too much about the instrument, which is the reason for this test assay.

Introduction
We believe that it is important to think about the way to implement a synthetic biology project in real live. This is why we have decided to write a business plan about our microlens arrays (MLAs). Our MLAs can be used as encapsulation layer for solar panels. This will result in an improvement of the efficiency of the solar panels.
We have written our business plan in three steps:
In the first step, the introduction phase, we have used the Business model canvas as a starting point. The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management - and entrepreneurial tool. It allows you to describe, design, challenge and invent your business model. In our opinion it is a very useful tool to get the first insight into your new business.
In the second step, we have done extensive research into our customers. We have talked to multiple potential customers in order to determine exactly what their needs are and how our product can meet these needs.
In the third step, we have used the knowledge of the previous two steps to write"

WLC-Milwaukee,2013,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," combines a secretion and purification tag, a tripartite pump that is specific to the sec tag, a antinorovirus particle like antibody, Tse2 toxin mediated horizontal gene transfer mechanism.
Tripartite SecI pump
These are the three essential parts prtD, prtE, prtF, that make up the Type I secretion system from Erwinia chrysanthemi.This part is made of 3 genes: prtD, prtE, and prtF, that constitute a type I Erwinia chrysanthemi secretion system. The Pump is expressed from a strong constitutive promoter, BBa_k206000, and has the translational terminator BBa_B0014. In pSB1C3. Used to secrete proteins containing prtB C-terminal tag. The prtB C-terminal tag is built into the protein generator [BBa_K1175012]. Any protein of interest can be inserted into the protein generator and then secreted when used in conjunction with this secretion system.
Secretion and purification tag
This part BBa_K1175012 A composite part formed between BBa_K206000 strong pBAD promoter, BBa_B0034 strong RBS, and BBa_K215001 a purification and secretion tag; a secretion system designed by Washington iGEM team 2009 BBa_K215001. This tag can be used to secrete proteins of interest by inserting them into a specific NheI cut site flanked by C terminus His tag and an N terminus Secretion tag. Both tags can be removed by a TEV protease. The secretion tag is also specific to the tripartite pump.
Antinorovirus like particle antibody
This construct BBa_K875004 is designed for the expression of an already described engineered antinorovirus (NoV) monoclonal antibody (mAb 54.6) in fusion with LPP-OmpA. The antibody is expressed in a single chain fragment variable (scFv) format containing light (VL) and heavy (VH) variable domains separeted by a flexible peptide linker. It has already been reported that the scFv 54.6 binds a native recombinant NoV particles (VLPs) and inhibits VLP interaction with cells. LPP-OmpA functions as a leader sequence and an anchor to display the scFv ot the bacterial surface.The construct consistes of T5 Lac Operator (Bba_K875002), ribosomal binding site, LPP-OmpA-scFv 54.6 antinorovirus,"
IONIS-PARIS,2017,Team:IONIS-PARIS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," and some of its applications (of which our project is only one example)                 we presented Softer Shock to other students.
On Thursday October 12 we worked at the Musée des Arts et Métiers (The Museum of Arts and Trades, emblematic as the                 cradle of French engineering). We  presented different applications of synthetic biology tools.                 We had 2 groups of 4 girls in the 10th grade. These were very interested and returned with knowledge                 and the desire to learn more!
The next day we went to the University of Orsay, also famous for its historical standing science.                     There, we met two classes of science-track high school seniors. During our presentation we played a synthetic                     biology card game with them to show that science is a matter of creativity, ideas, and the desire to innovate in                     particular. Based on current problems, students had to propose a solution (a “mini iGEM project”) with a chosen organism                     and the functionalities they could give them. A few students gave some funny solutions that might be tomorrow's innovations.                     It was very interesting to discuss with students and have their point of view. They were interested in our project and asked                     many questions about synthetic biology and its limits.
The Softer Shock iGEM special week
Another way we communicated about our project was to organise an entire week of iGEM events in our school.
We decided to organise an iGEM week from 05/08/17 to 05/12/17 to promote our project, sell home made food, and invite           people to look at our softer shock project.
It worked very well and when students came for food they asked about our project: Why did we choose this name?           What is the goal of this competition? What is the main purpose of Softer Shock? They were interested in our specific           project but also in the larger iGEM competition.
We also had a conference with few third year students at our school, who are interested in taking part in the iGEM           competition next year.
We asked them to produce a video describing a previous iGEM project in an entertaining way. The winning team got             free tickets to the prom!
Here is the link of the winner's video.
Bravo to this team, they all enjoyed participating in the activity and had a few ideas for next year's competition.
Finally, some pledges were organised to challenge students with biology. One of the funniest was to disguise one               person from each of the student unions (Sharkomère and Western Shot)  as a bacterium and"

An example of this can be seen in the genetechnology debate, in which, through ignorance of the topic often irrational fears are raised which prevents a professional informed debate on this matter.
It is crucial to apply a definition, which is without ambiguity and reflects real possibilities and boundaries of this field. A proposal for a solution could be ""mechanical living organism"", through which the problem of the misleading hybrid character of terms is dissolving.

A “Peltier” element for temperature control
A camera module controlled by a Raspberry Pi which autonomously takes pictures of your samples at pre-scheduled intervals and uploads them online, allowing you to view the progress of your samples from anywhere with an internet connection (and also to produce time-lapses)
A thermistor and LDR for measurement and analysis of temperature and light conditions throughout growth (the growth chamber produces tables of this information which can be imported into Excel), as well as for feedback to the “Peltier” element
Fans for controlling air circulation in the growth chamber, and for cooling electronic components
The design of this growth facility is fully documented, and published in a full tutorial on Instructables and our wiki , with the intention that anyone who wants to will be able to find the tutorial and follow it without difficulty, regardless of experience.
Extendibility
This growth chamber houses 1 petri dish. The reason I made this design decision was that housing multiple petri dishes in the same growth chamber would have resulted in inconsistent conditions in temperature and lighting (and larger material costs), whereas having multiple chambers joined together wouldn’t have had any obvious advantages over building several separate units, in order to justify the extra material costs and effort required under the time pressure.
If one wanted to house several petri dishes, the options would be to either build separate units, or to modify the CAD files and acquire extra components (the CAD files will be uploaded to the wiki and Instructables along with the tutorial) in order to house the extra petri dishes.
Possible improvements
Improve efficiency of Peltier element by adding extra fan to remove air from the “hot side”
Add H-bridge, allowing the Peltier to be controlled as both a heater and a cooler
Acquire a higher-power Peltier element
Improve organisation of wiring
Power Supplies
It was originally intended to house both the 5V power supply and the 700mA LED driver within the electronics enclosure, however, due to Jake's hastiness with soldering, Jake accidentally soldered the LED driver to the mains cable before putting the mains cable through the hole for external cabling, so that the LED driver now doesn’t fit through the hole. Hence Jake decided to keep the power supplies outside of the box. Jake will resolve this issue for the future by modifying the CAD files so that the hole meets the top of the box.

It is noteworthy that the starting concentration of ALA fed to the pathway does not affect the production of chlorophyll a. Our third model of PPIX to MgPPIX shows that the maximum PPIX concentration after 8 days=100 µM, and that by adding more enzymes to this pathway, the rate of reaction is not increased.
There are 2 enzymes involved in this transformation of PPIX to MgPPIX. If enzyme 1 (magnesium cheletase) = 0.45 µM and enzyme 2 (magnesium protoporphyrin IX-methyltransferase) = 1 µM, the concentration of the PPIX substrate = 100 µM. Over the course of 8 days we get a concentration of 50 µM of MgPPIX, the consequent substrate in the chlorophyll a pathway (see Fig 4).

5. Selection of positive colony
Colony PCR is the most convenient selection method. Pick a single colony with tips to 20∼50 µL of LB medium, mix thoroughly and take 1 µL as PCR template. To avoid false positive PCR, we recommend at least one sequencing primer of the cloning vector should be used. Inoculate the remaining medium of positive clones into fresh LB medium and culture overnight. Then, extract the plasmids for subsequent authentication.
3. ClonExpress MultiS One Step Cloning Kit
Abstract
ClonExpress One Step technology is a simple, fast and highly efficient cloning kit which is based on homologous recombination technology. It allows to directly clone any amplified product(s) to any linearized vector, at any site.
  Click on Me
Introduction
ClonExpress MultiS One Step Cloning kit is a new version cloning kit based on ClonExpress One Step Cloning technology. Exnase MultiS and reaction buffer supplied in this kit are especially optimized for multi-insertion seamless cloning (MultiS for short). With the help of this kit, sequential assembly of up to five insertions can be realized in a single reaction. Additionally, Exnase MultiS is also compatible with the endonuclease digesting reaction and the PCR reaction. Thus, the digesting products or PCR products can be directly applied in recombination reaction without purification, which greatly simplifies the experimental procedures.
Firstly, the expression vector will be linearized at the cloning site of choice. A small sequence (15∼20 bp) overlapped with the end of the cloning site will be added onto the insert through a PCR step. After the inserts and the linearized vector are mixed in the presence of Exnase for only 30 min, the cloning DNA products can be directly subjected to E.coli. transformation with true positive rate over 95%.
Steps
1. Preparation for linearized cloning vectors
Select appropriate cloning sites and linearize the cloning vector. GC content of 20 bp regions at both ends of linearized cloning vector has great impacts on the recombination efficiency. The maximum recombination efficiency can be realized when the GC content of these regions is within 40% ∼60%. Thus, it’s better to avoid regions with sequence repeats and select regions containing"

Aim
Our aim was to generate a BioBrick containing the PezT gene for autolysis as shown in “project → kill gene”. We wanted to amplify the gene from a plasmid provided by Prof. Meinhart (Robert Koch Institute, Heidelberg, Germany) via PCR. To get rid of illegal restriction sites, such as PstI, we planned a mutagenesis PCR. Finally the PezT gene should get ligated into the pSB1C3 backbone.

We designed primers for mutagenesis and started first PCR steps but had to stop due to the submission deadline.

During our meeting, we discussed the issue of dual use research, i. e. the potential risk of misusing the knowledge gained from our project by third parties.
To address this issue, we participated in the dual use initiative from the iGEM team Bielefeld and organized a presentation where we informed about the potential risks of dual use research. Although dual use can never be                       excluded, the experiments we demonstrate with our robot do not exhibit a direct potential for being misused.
In previous mechanical engineering projects at our university, teams were required to develop a safety concept.d

Responsibility
Interview with Greenpeace
For the societal and environmental consideration of our project, we deemed it important to engage with critical audiences outside of our scientific niche. Greenpeace is one of the biggest non-governmental environmental organizations             worldwide and has traditionally a rather critical opinion on genetic engineering. We interviewed Philippe Schenkel, Sustainable Agriculture Campaigner at Greenpeace Switzerland, and discussed the general position of Greenpeace on this             topic, the iGEM competition, our project and the communication between scientists and NGOs.
Keypoints of the Interview
Greenpeace does not have a general position against genetic engineering, especially not in the research sector or for medical reasons. In agriculture however, they have a clear position against the use of GMOs as there is more                   research needed to study the long time effects.
As long as safety standards are met and bacteria are kept inside the lab, the iGEM competition does not represent a conflict of interest with the principles of Greenpeace.
For our robot it is equally important that biocontainment is ensured. This can not only be supported by mechanical devices but also by the implementation of biological mechanisms like kill-switches or auxotrophies.
Already there is some knowledge exchange between Greenpeace and scientists who tend to be rather critical. Philippe encourages researchers to expand this dialogue in order to increase the understanding

Background
When studying the toxicity of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin-LR in higher eukaryotic cells, we found out that it causes oxidative stress in them. This is due to inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) which then leads to hyperphosphorylation of target proteins. This excessive phosphorylation in turn increases the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in a oxidative stress response. This is presented in the figure 1. [1] Reactive oxygen species have many effects in the cell. For example, catalase production is significantly increased in the presence of ROS. Catalase is an enzyme found in nearly all living organisms that catalyses the decomposition hydrogen peroxide. It is one of the most important enzymes in protecting the cell from reactive oxygen species meaning that its production is activated when there is oxidative stress. We found out that similar toxicity effects can be observed in some lower eukaryotes, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [2,3] Realizing this made us think of how we could use MC-LRâ€™s natural toxicity effects to sense the toxin concentrations.

Researches revealed that some auxotrophic strains can better colonize in tumors, indicating that special nutrient-rich environment can compensate for the nutrition the strains lack for.  Therefore, we knocked out one gene in amino acid metabolism pathways of VNP.
We found CFU (Colony Forming Units) of auxotrophic strains 5 and 6 could reach 109, while that of VNP can only reach 105 at most in normal tissues.  The ratio of number of bacteria in tumor tissues to that in liver on the 4th day shows that after knocking out related genes to the metabolism to synthesize certain amino acid, the ability of tumor targeting was highly enhanced, nearly 10 times compared to that of VNP.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," year’s project we are working on establishing two- and three-way co-cultures between Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus. One of our approaches is establishing a cross feeding of amino acids between a leucine-auxotroph E. coli and a lysine-auxotroph S. cerevisiae; they are producing the needed amino acid for each other. What is your first impression about our plan?
Sh: It is an ambitious plan. If we only consider the 2-way interaction between the modified E. coli and BY4742 you need to remember the additional auxotrophy in BY4742 and provide histidine in the medium. This may affect the dependency of the auxotrophic E. coli strain. In my experience in some situations the auxotrophy can be fulfilled even by the presence of other amino acids in the medium. Hence it would be ideal to test of all auxotrophs that are to be used in the project in the presence of the different amino acids to be used in the project. There should be a clear difference here - growth when focal amino acid is provided, no growth when any other amino acid is provided.
TD: Exactly. Our Auxotrophy system is used in a two way co-culture. We have already added histidine but didn’t consider that it could influence the dependencies. So, thank you for this tip! Why did you start researching auxotrophies and co-cultures?
Sh: I got interested in studying the interactions between bacteria (in a social or community context) during my studies for my masters degree in microbiology. Then I further read about metabolic dependencies in microbial communities and how this possibly affects the percent of bacteria we can cultivate and isolate. It was fascinating to learn how auxotrophies can lead to interactions and networks between microorganisms.
TD: Interesting! Where can this focus on co-cultures built on auxotrophies lead to in research?
Sh: Auxotrophies can be thought of as the  dependency of an organism on an external source of an essential molecule which in most cases are amino acids, vitamins or nucleotides. These metabolites have to be part of the primary metabolism in a cell and hence essential for growth and proper cell function. A co-culture or interaction based on the exchange of such essential metabolites makes the interaction itself obligatory for the involved partners and hence a good model system to study. Furthermore due to the involvement of the metabolites, especially amino acids, in primary metabolism one can observe direct effects of the"

    In order to place their research in greater context, many iGEM teams organise surveys and request other iGEM teams from all around the globe to participate. This year, our team participated on a number of surveys to offer help to theses teams. The followings are examples of various surveys that our team had participated in this year:
Survey about food problem : Team Botchan Lab Tokyo organized a survey that questions about society’s recognization toward food. We could not get a specific reason why they made this poll since we could not be replied by them. However, participating in this survey, we sincerely answered questions about nutrients of food or GMO(Genetically Modified Organism) problems.
Invasive Species Survey: Team UNebraska-Lincoln is trying to create an effective bait for the Emerald Ash Borer Beetle, an invasive species to North America. We assisted Team UNebraska-LincolnOur gathering data by answering 10 questions in the survey, such as basic knowledge of invasive species or preference of GMO products.
Burn General Knowledge Survey: Team TecCEM organized a survey to gain information about different treatments of burns around the world, the prevention that is held in your country and how are the statistics in it. By answering their project, we could help their project since Team TecCEM is looking forward to developing a new treatment for burned people, that will reduce the time of hospitalization and help skin regeneration.
Team ICT-Mumbai survey - BBrickIt: Team ICT-Mumbai developed a program that Bio-Bricks any dna sequence for you. The software checks for illegal sites and suggests changes in the sequence too. The team organised survey in order to gather the needs of iGEM teams in regards of their software, with questions regarding how each team created bioBrick parts and which softwares the team used in the course of iGEM project.

Overall project
Who said scientists don't care about microbial cultures?
This year, Valencia Biocampus team members are going to break down communication barriers among species through an artificial language based on light wavelengths, which will allow us to know more about the requirements of the microorganisms we thrive everyday in our labs. Depending on different metabolic conditions, our microorganisms (bacteria and yeast) will express fluorescent proteins that are under the control of promoters sensitive to these environmental factors. Therefore, by using a fluorimeter controlled by voice-recognition software, we are able to ask and get answers (like real-life talking!) of the microbial environment! Moreover we have a brand-new experience, related to UV-regulation, in which we force bacteria to express a gene!
Our final goal is to characterize and  completely model bacterial behavior affected by these factors. And last, but not least, our Human Practices team has an awesome story-telling script for the audience!
This is a general scheme of our project. All the experimental work is outlined and splitted up into color boxes: Modeling (purple), Human Practices (blue) and Talking Interfaces (yellow). As long as you surf through the wiki, you will find out the special case of the question “Have you taken your pill?” , which has not been actually asked to our bacteria, but plays a central role in our Human Practices work. Check our achievements to understand our project as a whole!

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Achivements_-_-_TEXT.html,". This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [5]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [9].
If farmers had the possibility to know when to treat their horses, prevention of mass rupture and other severe consequences like increased resistance development could be achieved. To reach this goal we have developed a model that (based on multiple parameters) calculates the optimal amount of treatments in a specified period. This will avoid unnecessary use of anthelmintics by raising the awareness in farmers regarding when they actually need to treat their horses.
Current Methods for Detection
Currently the only method for detecting/counting how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal    samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires time sensitive shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing; treating their horses regardless of need which contributes to the resistance problem [10].
Resistance Development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection  of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,4]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance [2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15].
Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of horse intestines. Moreover, we have developed new applications on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.

iGaME: Synthetic Biology for Gamers
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team is devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically. With a mass of data for the use of modeling, we propose the Standard Biological Parts Automatic Modeling Database Language, which enables descriptions of complicated biological processes. Additionally, previous iGEM project models will be featured to demonstrate the availability of our idea.

1)Miniprepped the resistance cassette cultures. Previously, to get the part for the template for the PCR, we just picked a colony, but we thought that it would be beneficial to have a plasmid stock in case we needed to repeat the PCR.
2)PCR with new (biobrick) primers was attempted. We received primers for the Dsz genes and also for the amino acid genes. We did not, however, receive the DszA forward primer, and decided to hold off on working with the Dsz genes until later. We performed a cPCR for all the genes we had, and ran the results on the gel.
3)Ran an important gel. Below are the results from yesterday's and today's PCR. Cameron made the gel and taped the edges of the gel box to prevent the gel from escaping. The gel itself was made to 1% agarose in 0.5% TBE, and run on a 50 well gel box. 3 uL of loading buffer were used for 8 uL (10 uL for yesterday's products) sample to increase contrast, and various ladders were tested. The negative control PCR tube for today's PCR popped open during the reaction, and evaporated.

IGEM CHINA 2010 Held in Shanghai
We set up a Google group to improve the communication among Chinese teams. A growing number of Chinese undergraduates are interested in Synthetic Biology and iGEM. This year, there are a dozen of Chinese teams attending in iGEM competition. Some of them are newcomers to this competition. Since Peking University is among the earliest ones to establish the iGEM team in China, we would like to share our experience with other teams. In this Google group ( http://groups.google.com/group/igem-china ), a lot of information about iGEM 2010 competition and the experience of team construction have been shared.  Based on the idea from SJTU-BioX-Shanghai and us, almost all members got together in Shanghai to discuss project design and lab experience in August. On August 5th, teams from 7 top universities in China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, ECUST-Shanghai, Peking, Tsinghua, USTC & USTC_Software, ZJU-China, and Sun Yat-sen University all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup. Each team made a presentation displaying their projects and progresses since the summer began, followed by free questioning and discussion time. Particularly, the leader of our team, Haoqian Zhang, gave a presentation about team construction and development.

Interaction with Paris team
Paris team is our old friend, and we had interaction with them since 2009. This year, a member of PKU 2008 iGEM team joined in Paris team. We offered a set of experiment protocols to help them develop the new tech standard ""openProtocol"". Also, we translated their human practice project in Chinese( download PDF of its Chinese version ), not only to promote the internationalization of their openProtocol tool but also raise awareness of each team to make a better and safer iGEM competition in the future.

Berkeley_Software,2009,Team:Berkeley Software#Misc_-_-_TEXT.html," and globally. Languages like Eugene allow high level specifications to be shared easily in a human readable format. Sharing allows users to be more productive as well as move research forward faster by allowing labs to build on the knowledge of other researchers. In a growing field like synthetic biology sharing is going to be vital for the growth of the field. We contributed to sharing by:
Providing ways to share high level specifications (Eugene and XML)
Allowing software to talk to centralized repositories (Clotho data API)
Security - if software is built correctly, it can encrypt data as well as provide mechanisms for time stamping intellectual property for the legal purposes such as patenting. It can also provide checks on DNA information to prevent the construction of biologically hazardous designs. It can also track the history of biological material which can be vital in determining its origin. Specific security features are not currently the focus of our projects but we can envision the following ways we could incorporate security:
Provide a time stamp allow with verified user info along with all parts developed using Clotho
Encode rules in Eugene which prevent specific sequences from being generated during composite device development
Safety
As a software project our work did not raise many of the safety issues typically associated with biological project. Nevertheless we will explicitly address four safety questions here:
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
Researcher safety?
The development of software requires many hours in front of a computer. As programmers we must guard against repetitive stress disorders and environments which are not ergonomically friendly. We made sure that we took regular breaks, worked in a comfortable lab environment, and used proper equipment. Our team rarely ventured into a wet lab environment, but when we did it was accompanied by a trained worker in the lab and we were supervised at all times.
Public safety?
We did not perform any work that put the public at any risk.
Environmental safety?
We did not perform any work that put the environment at any risk.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Not applicable to our work on software.
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Not applicable to our work on software.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Our tools helped develop the parts built by the UC Berkeley 2009 iGEM wet team. They took the necessary steps to address safety issues raised by the parts created.

From 2008.igem.org
Model constructions: from the modelling to the characterization
Our project BacterioClock is based on an oscillating FIFO synchronized at the population level. To obtain and have preliminary results of this system we divided it in three ""little"" modules as the modeling team exposed them previously.
The First one aims to see the FIFO which constitute our core system
A simple manner to see it, is to implement one class II promotor followed by a reporter gene like GFP in a bacteria strain that is able to produce the flagella.
By this way, we are able to see in single cell the order of the activation of pFliL then pFlgA then pFlhB and then the inactivation in the same order as a FIFO will do.
These constructions are equivalent to the experiments realized by Uri Alon in the article ""Using quantitative Blueprint to reprogram the Dynamics of the Flagella Gene Network"" Kalir S, Alon U. Cell 2004.
A better way to observe the FIFO is to study the system with an inducible regulator of class II gene in a bacteria strain deleted for this gene. We are extremely grateful for Alon U. that send us the inducible gene FlhDC, and FliA in pBad18 plasmid. These plasmids with our own araC/pBad-EnvZ* will allowed us to study the system in mutated strains that we have in our lab (ΔFlhD, ΔFliA, ΔFlgM, ΔEnvZ). By cotransforming in mutated strains the inducibles regulators of the class II promotors with one of this promotor associated to a fluorescent protein, we could characterize the influence of the master regulators of the flagella on their pormoter. The fluorescence is normalized to the OD600.
For example below are some constructions to see and induce the FIFO:
pFliL alone
3 promoters of the FIFO in one Cell
FIFO and oscillating construction in a single cell
To perform such a cotransformation we take care about the ORI of each low copy plasmid which are often incompatible and we made all our final constructions in the pSB4T5 plasmid that care the only one resistance that was not already used and the pSC101 ORI which is compatible with the ColE1.
We could see the FIFO in a more convenient manner with the assembly of two class II promotors associated to"

1. Christopher Chang
 
In May, we were very lucky to meet with Christopher Chang from UC-Berkeley and discussed our project with him. He showed us amazing ways to mimic hydrogenase using chemical methods and gave us important suggestions about the background knowledge. After the discussion, we took him to tour around the campus.
 
 
2. Xinghua Xia
 
On the afternoon of July 19th, we interviewed with Prof. Zou from state key laboratory of biochemistry in NJU who is an expert in hydrogen production. He introduced to us new methods for hydrogen production such as biomimetic catalysts for hydrogen production. We also got inspired about some chemistry problems in our project. First, the function of S2- in CdS is to change the energy state of Cd. The S2- that we added in our experiment is different from Cys. Thus we should add the control experiment: no S in the solution, add S2-, add Cys. He also advised us to test the size of bandgap for utilization of visible light. Second, he suggested that we should consider the interactions between S2- and protein PbrR. Third, there are two ways for transmembrane electron transduction. Last but not least, we should consider the choice and optimization of reductants. The interview with him was indeed inspiring because Prof. Zou showed us a broader way to think about problems.

As a physicist and material scientist, he applied the technology of crystallography to catalyzing the hydrogen production by water electrolysis, and this work was published on Nature in 2001 and simultaneously commented by Science to mark its profound significance.
 
The biggest question Professors proposed is the reason why we choose E.coli instead of photosynthetic organisms such as algae.

Week 9
Monday, July 16, 2012
Chris ran some mini-preps for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. Victoria revved the results of her sequencing with Kait. Kevin worked with Hannah and taught her some HTML.
Tuesday, July 17, 2012
Hannah came in early to mini-prep cultures from her most recent CBAR for the Multiple Start Codon Project. These were subsequently digested to check for proper length. The result of this gel raised some questions. The colonies that she had grown up were all expression RFP. There were some colonies that were expressing GFP, but these were not cultured. Analysis of the gel and expression of RFP indicates that those plasmids did not contain all of the correct components. The GFP colonies probably would contain the entire construct. These were cultured to test this hypothesis. Victoria worked with Jyotsna to design primers to make some of the necessary parts for the Codon Optimization Project construct. Alexander is also beginning presentations for describing all of the projects. Kevin made some headway with the animation, which is till humming along. He also prepared materials for making new Chemically Competent cells.
Wednesday, July 18, 2012
Kevin updated some of the website and made some new chemically competent cells. Hannah and Kevin then transformed a number of fluorescent protein plasmids into these new cells. Hannah prepped her GFP presenting colonies from her CBAR. These were then digested to check them for length. The correct plasmids were prepped to be sent to sequencing. Victoria planned and designed primers for the Codon Optimization Project.
Thursday, July 19, 2012
Victoria ran a PCR of one of her components for the Codon Optimization Project. Hannah sent her plasmids to sequencing. Some of the plasmids that she transformed yesterday with Kevin were successful and presenting the correct fluorescent protein. Chris ran a gel on the construct for the Multidirectional Promoter Project. Kait and Victoria transformed some plasmids in preparation for another PCR to make a fragment for the Codon Optimization Project.
Friday, July 20, 2012
Victoria and Alexander completed a ligation to hopefully give them their desired construct. Kevin created a new run of chemically competent cells for the lab. Hannah ran a PCR of one of the components of her construct. This was to test to see if the deletion in the construct was caused by the PCR or if the problem resided"

All absorbtion spectra do not have relative intensity all peak around 1 arbitrary unit.
The light sensor absorption spectra are estimates of data taken from literature.
The pigment sensor absorption spectra are estimates of the pigment absoption of colour printer ink.
The operation of the light sensor is an idealisation of the true relationship between sensor activation and incident light
These will all contribute to the errors in our model but have been chosen to demonstrate our model in action. These can easily be replace with experimental results.
Results and analysis
All results in this section are obtained from the beta version of our model. In this section we will discuss the results that our model has produced and also how sound the model's operation is.
Results of model
Preliminary results suggest that the mix of colours in any individual E.coli system is very unpredictable. The model was run multiple times with all sensors at the same activation rate. The mix of colours between separate simulations is very unstable. However the average for a cohort of cell systems is more stable. It is due to the relatively small number of DNA agents with which the RNAP interacts. This amplifies the effects of chance and causes the instability observed in the model.
This shows the pigment populations during 5 runs of a cell given the same initial conditions each time. It demonstrates the instability in the gene expression and also inequality in the magnitude of expression. The 'x' character lines represent the average of the 5 runs and are more stable as a results.
This will serve reduce the spacial control of tri-chromatic control system in E.coli as a predictable average expression of a gene will require multiple individuals. For a biocamera this will reduce the pixel density and therefore the resolution. One solution to this potential problem could be to introduce many copies of the light regulated genes. This could also serve to prevent one pathway dominating by having greater numbers of less prolific light regulated genes to compensate.
This shows the pigment populations during 5 runs of a cell given the same initial conditions as the previous graph. However in this run there is a ten fold increase in the number of pathway DNA present in the system. It demonstrates increased stability as a results and this supports the idea that the low number of DNA in a cell amplifies the effect of chance in the simulation. As before 'x' character lines represent the average of the 5 runs and are more stable as a results.
An increase in light regulated DNA has been shown to stabilise the system. However it is impractical and expensive to insert large amounts of DNA into individual bacteria with current methods.

Using the remaining cultures from the DNA2.0 chromoproteins after plating and cyrostocking, I  selected the brightest colors (prancer purple, cupid pink, dreidel teal, blitzen blue, vixen purple) and added 1 uL of .134 M EDTA to the clumped cells after discarding the supernatant. The remaining cultures that did not express color strongly enough to merit testing were placed on the shaker at room temperature.

The five chromoproteins selected above were placed in a PCR at 40 °C for 5 minutes then photographed. After this, they were placed in the PCR again, but at 45 °C for 5 minutes and photographed. This process repeated by stepping up the temperature by 5 degrees and photographing the chromoproteins after 5 minutes at that temperature until the final run at 100 °C.

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#pr_-_-_TEXT.html," The biological networks are complex, but growing evidence shows that some core topology structures are capable of robustly executing functions, which are known as motifs. And some of them may be more efficient under certain parameter combinations. After observing the relatively functional network topologies, we are inspired to traverse all functional networks and marked the most commonly appeared motifs. We did some analysis aiming at motifs such as Mutual-Inhibition, Self-Activation, Feedforward with buffer node, Feedback with buffer node and Strong Inhibition and Strong Activation. And we found that the most common motifs in adaptive networks exactly make up the 2 core optimal networks we obtained from previous results.
3. Results and Application
Results After complex screening and testing work, we finally got 2 optimal networks. These 2 networks are reliably functional to sense input difference and show great adaptation to DNA template abundance (copy number variation). So these networks meet our needs and goals.
Besides, we summarized the topologies of functional networks and obtained  Feedforward with a buffer node and Mutual_inhibition motifs that are significant to adaptation. Application According to our conclusion, we in fact realized a biomachine for sensing signal and effectively switching between high-low states. This function is also the very basis of an automatic sorting machine, which could robustly distinguish two kinds of cells. And the most important thing is that this simple sorter is stable and reliable enough in face with DNA template fluctuation. So our project can be adopted in the future to:  Sense signals and realize a robust bio-switch in gene circuit.  Distinguish cancer cells from normal cells and kill cancer cells with specificity.  Refine a network construction method to synthetize adaptive networks with the intuitionistic impression of regulatory motifs.   …

Barlow Professor of Geriatric Medicine
Our interaction with the public highlighted the importance of gaining doctor’s support for our project. With this is mind, George went back to Hornsey UTI clinic to speak with Dr. Sheela Swamy and Professor Malone-Lee, the consultant clinician as well as the principal investigator of the laboratory associated with the clinic. The Professor’s feedback on our project was extremely positive. “Biofilms have a profound effect on antibiotic resistance and so bacteria that can penetrate through biofilms strikes me as a very sensible project direction.”
Dr. Sheela Swamy, Hornsey UTI clinic, said:
“We get through so many buckets of antibiotics here, if your product could prevent infections or reduce our reliance on those antibiotics that is hugely appealing as a practitioner.”
“It will be really great if we actually have bacteria engineered to achieve biofilm and cellular penetration and a bactericidal effect will be a total seller. That may be the answer to the Chronic UTI if we can get it to work.”
The doctors at the UTI clinic left us with a few points to bear in mind as we are currently focused on only killing Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa :
The bladder biome is complex with many culturable and nonculturable pathogens. What role each of these have and what concentration they need to be in to cause UTI symptoms is unknown.
Uropathogens listed in literature are not the only organisms responsible for UTI as they are also present in normal controls yet don't cause symptoms.
Bacteria are opportunistic and a skin commensal if in the bladder can cause symptoms, and we have had many women with pyuric UTIs even though they only grew a Staphylococcus so you may have to try develop something that works on a wide spectrum of bacteria.
Speaking with Patients
During his time meeting with Dr. Sheela Swamy and Prof. Malone-Lee, George was invited to attend a pair of clinic sessions in which chronic urinary infection patients came to see doctors and change their treatment plan or give samples for urinalysis. During these sessions George sat in on 8 consultations and interviewed 6 urinalysis patients to gain an understanding of their symptoms and the way their infection is currently managed. George was also given the chance to interview each of these patients and learn what they thought about antibiotic regimes, catheter-based delivery and our synthetic biology solution to their infections. From the 14 interviews conducted George drew these particular conclusions from his conversations with Hornsey’s patients:
That comfort levels with catheterisation are reliant on previous experience with"

Q8,Have you ever heard the word, ""Synthetic biology""?
[ YES / NO ]
There is not much difference between students and others. Overall, person who knows “Synthetic Biology” is few (10~20% of all respondents). So, we need activities to convey this.
^Top
Conclusion
We take the view that genetic engineering is not good impression by ordinary Japanese (expect students) from the questionnaire result.  So, we had some activities to improve this.
・@Science café(at University of Tokyo) May 29, 30
Some of iGEM Japan team( UT-Tokyo , Kyoto , Osaka ) had the Science café.We could talk to let people know Synthetic biology and iGEM!
・@ International Biotechnology Academic Conference (at Tokyo) June 30 - July 2
We did a poster presentaion with UT-Tokyo and Osaka .
・@Mitaka science technology and science fair (at Tokyo) September 18, 19
We communicated “What is DNA?” and “What is genetic engineering?” to the public. Many civil came, and we could talk to them.
And our participation in some fairs after iGEM jamboree has already decided.
・Teaching experiments to junior and senior students with UT-Tokyo .
・Doing a poster presentation with UT-Tokyo and Kyoto at Science Agora in Tokyo.
・Teaching experiments to students collaborated with Leave a nest co., ltd .
We want to continue such awareness activities, and spread knowledge of genetic engineering.

A Genetic Limiter Circuit in S. cerevisiae
We have designed a modular genetic circuit to limit the expression level of a gene of interest to a user-defined, tunable threshold.  The limiter network reacts to the transcription of an endogenous gene within each cell, entering a regulatory state only where and when the rate of transcription lies beyond an acceptable range of activity.  Along with its potential therapeutic utility, we offer our device as a foundational tool for researching gene expression in a eukaryotic model.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.
To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one"

lox66 is a site specific recombination cassette. It belongs to the loxP family frequently used in genetics, particularily in mouse genetics. lox site recombination is catalysed by a Site specific recombinase, Cre. lox sequences are composed of an 8 bp Core sequence surrounded by two Arms. The particularity of lox66 is that it has an altered sequence at the end of it's left arm compared to loxP. This sequence variation reduces affinity of the Cre recombinase for the arm. As a consequence, after a recombination between a lox66 and a lox71 (altered right arm sequence), one of the two resulting generated lox sites has very low recombination potential as it inherited both mutated arms. Use of lox66 & lox71 sites is potentially interresting when the recombination reaction must be ""irreversible"".

UC_Davis,2012,Team:UC Davis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," As it turns out, the genome sequencing library did not turn out well. The genome had not been sheared, so we began our work again. This time the reactions all worked well and we will continue our work with this piece. Finally, we PCR screened the B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, B0034 + Reductase + B0015, and B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015. They are all present in the colonies we have!
Thursday August 23rd
We glycerol stocked the constructs that we PCR screened yesterday. We are excited for the end of our construction process! Continuing on with the results from the PCR screen pieces, we are ligating the promoters (J23101 and K206000) with B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, R0010 with B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015, and B0034 with C0012. We’ll see how the ligations are when we transform them tomorrow. We got our sequencing data back, and it turns out that we have some mutations that we need to fix in the reductase and dehydrogenase enzymes. There was a mutation and a deletion in the reductase, and there was a mutation in the dehydrogenase. However, these will be fixed with some site-directed mutagenesis (SDM). PCR screen on KAN and Full Cutinase performed.
Friday August 24th
Time to transform! We transformed the ligations from yesterday, and we will hopefully see some colonies tomorrow. Later, we analyzed the sheared genomic sequence concentration with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). It is really nitpicky to do qPCR because of the sterilization required because we do not want bacteria to be introduced in and have their DNA be replicated through the thermal cycler. We also devised another experiment for directed evolution of the Strain E-15 EG3 to choose for efficient, rapid growth. We will grow the cells in 30mM of ethylene glycol and when they reach 0.2 OD, place 200µL of the cells into 5 mL of 30mM ethylene glycol.  Currently, the doubling time of Strain E-15 EG3 on ethylene glycol is about 6 hours, so we want to decrease this time to see colonies much more rapidly.

- No cross recombination with sites that are not loxP (5)
-                                         Good temporal or tissue-specific control of genetic modification
- Knockout efficiency                                         is independent of target DNA length (6)
- Off-target not shown in this type of                                         chicken (7)
Limitations
- Different Cas9 homologs require different PAM sequences
- Mosaicism in mice (8)
-                                         Large fragment deletion is achieved at low efficiency (less than 10%) (9)
- Not a site-specific genome editing
- defective CRISPR
- Organism may tolerate                                         PAM sequences (PAM sequences should be properly designed)
- More targetable spacer:                                         Use more flexible PAM sequence

- Off-target effects
- Not yet experimented in mammal cells                                         due to large size
- Can only target bacterial cells because cas3 is too big to                                         enter mammalian cells (11)
- Mutations in target sequence
- Knockout efficiency is dependent of target DNA length                                         (12)

Procedure
Please, before doing your preparative gel, use one sample to make an analityc one !
Equilibrate a water bath or heat block to 50°C.
Excise a minimal area of gel containing the DNA fragment of interest.
Crucial: To protect the UV box, it is a good idea to place the gel on a glass plate if available.
Try to get as little excess gel around the band as possible.
Weigh the gel slice containing the DNA fragment using a scale sensitive to 0.001 g.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," extreme, there are genetically modified human cell cultures, and genetically modified animals. There are major controls here; any animal experiments require a Home Office license. Graeme has never needed one of these but many of his colleagues do; there are lots of animal experiments done. These clearly need to be controlled. Graeme said everyone involved recognises this.
As for plant modification, what's done in experimental systems is very different from what's done in the field. Everything has to be contained. He doubted anyone would dispute the need for legal control. Some of his colleagues find regulation an inconvenience due to the time it takes to deal with the paperwork, but it's just a fact of life.
Allan asked if these regulations strike the right balance between safety and allowing research to go forwards.
Graeme said that in this country, the regulations were pretty well informed. A lot of research is possible in this country that wouldn't be allowed in some other countries, but some things are not allowed here, which are allowed in the most liberal regimes. He said this suggests there was some sort of balance.
Allan wondered whether research might just go overseas if it had to. Graeme said it could, but if the UK thinks there are problems, particularly in human research, it might be better to set an example of not doing it here. Maybe it would go overseas, but maybe it wouldn't.
Fionn asked how funding and commercialisation affected the motives of science. Does it lead to hasty attempts to commercialise research, and does it affect what projects are done?
Graeme said there was some funding from industry but really it's incredibly little. He said the recession was partly to blame for this. But he noted that there is some research that is more easily done in a university than in industry, and gave an example where this led to funding: a model system was made in yeast by the university, and was later transplanted into plants by the company.
The research was not interfered with by the company, though there was constant contact. He said this was fairly basic research that the university might have done anyway. He said this is often the case; companies will approach universities to tap into expertise that already exists.
He said scientists are generally motivated by a desire for knowledge, though some are more entrepreneurial than others, and some are blissfully naive about the commercial world. And some have come into academic research having first worked in companies.
Graeme said drug companies are keen to develop interactions with universities, so as to get new ideas. But this is not the same as saying that they influence the basic research that goes on"

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"We visited the trade fair “Analytica”, for analysis, biotechnology, laboratory technology, and devices in Munich. Here we got in touch with different companies and presented our project to them. Moreover, this trade fair gave us the possibility to win over supporters for our project. We also met members from the iGEM Team Munich.
SynBioBeta
SynBioBeta is one of the main communities of entrepreneurs, investors, and policy makers devoted to promote the responsible growth of the synthetic biology field. On their international conferences and events many members of the synthetic biology community come together and discuss possibilities to promote the development of this industrial field. The background of people, visiting these conferences, is very diverse and therefore various aspects are discussed. Our members were not only able to meet industrial members and scientist, but also other iGEM Teams and Randy, founder of the iGEM organization. This was an amazing experience for us and left a big impression on our members during their visit in London. Furthermore, our members were able to listen to different lectures and participate in many discussion rounds.
Figure 4: Some members of our team meeting Randy and other iGEM Teams at SynBioBeta
Biomedica
In 2016 the Biomedica trade fair took place in Aachen from the 30th to the 31st of May. So, many members of our team decided to visit this conference and look at the different topics, which were presented. Moreover, the four headwords: “Pharma, Biotech, Meditech, and Innovation” called our attention. Biomedica started in 2007, as the first Euregional conference on lifesciences. Biomedica started as a joint conference of three already existing conferences in Liege, Aachen and Maastricht. It focusses on combining business and science.
Meet ups
European iGEM Meet up
The iGEM Teams from Paris invited us to visit the European iGEM Meet up in Paris. For our members it was a great experience to participate, because they had the opportunity to get in touch with other iGEM teams, learn something about the different projects and establish a personal contact with other members. Moreover, they had the chance to include the expertise and suggestions from other teams in the planning process of our project. But of course we also had a lot of fun in this amazing city. In this context we want to thank once again the iGEM Teams in Paris for their invitation.

In other conditions, this trend was not so significant,  which inferred that the condition for our sweet pressure part to work must be  finely tuned. What is more, we have proved that tryptophan addition greatly  inhibited growth of cells. Therefore,  the trend of better growth induced by tryptophan addition was very strong proof  for the successful construction and function of our sweet pressure part,  although it only worked in this particular condition.

Human Practice - Science Communication
The Team
This project was set up mainly by two students of the Heidelberg iGEM team, who felt the need to communicate the work of the iGEM team in the context of synthetic biology. Additionally to the wet lab work for the main project, they put all their remaining time and ressources into the buildup of this science communication platform. This fact already reflects one major challenge of the Human Practice Project Heidelberg: Abrogating the separation between scientific work and science communication. The science communication team was highly supported by the advisor Jan Eufinger. And last but not least there have to be mentioned all the members of our iGEM team, who supported this project with ideas and help and without whom we would never have been able to carry out events like the public survey and the Open Day.
The Idea
Synthetic Biology is a very young and dynamic scientific field. And as most modern scientific fields, synthetic biology offers many chances in solving actual problems. But on the other hand- and we want to communicate that quite clearly here- synthetic biology also comprises risks. The same risks that every modern science entains. Profound and detailed analyses of the ethical aspects concerning synthetic biology can be found on the following pages of other iGEM teams ( TUDelft , Calgary , KULeuven ). In our opinion, there is an important step before ethical considerations of synthetic biology can be made by the public or by policy makers: They first have to know about synthetic biology, have to understand this new research area and therefore have to understand the basics of molecular and"

Public presentations
As our project ventures into a fairly unexplored field, we had a fairly easy time gathering interest for our project. We held a multitude of public presentations for large audiences. We presented our work for several renowned experts in molecular biosciences, physics and microscopy on two occasions, which provided us with valuable feedback and advice on our project. We talked about our work for several large student groups; notably at Realistforeningen in front of interested students at April 6th, to new physics bachelor students (Img 3) and new bioscience master students at August 15th (Img 1). On the 20th of October, we also got to present our project to the Norwegian Minister of Education as he was visiting the University(Img 2), along with the leading university administration, which was a greatly successful endeavour.
We also made an effort to spread knowledge outside of academia. In this endeavour, we talked to startup expert company Inven2 to learn more about entrepreneurship and the possibilities of working further on our project post-iGEM. They were enthusiastic about the possibilities of the bio-laser, and wanted us to present our work at the Cutting Edge festival held in Oslo 26th of September. The festival is to celebrate innovation and science, bringing business and academia together, and spreading knowledge and ideas. We had a stand manned for the entire day, discussing the opportunities and potential of our project, while also being provided critical feedback from experts in the fields of bioscience, physics and commerce.
In addition, we joined an initiative from iGEM Uppsala and several other teams to talk about ethics and potential dangers in regards to our projects. The result is published on youtube, and all involved parties learned much from the fruitful discussions. We also had a case about our project published in the newspaper Porsgrunn Dagblad(Img 4), and another one in Brønnøysund avis , which helped us reach the wider public.
We have also been active on Facebook and Instagram, announcing events and sharing pictures. With more than 600 followers on Facebook, we've been able to reach a lot of people and spread our project further.

SOE-PCR
Figure 10:  Control digestion with MluⅠ and SacⅠof of plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli cells that were transformed with pSMF2.1-has2-gfp. The digestion reveals a band at 2413 bp which corresponds to the length of has2-gfp fusion gene combining the 720 bp gfp fragment and the 1693 bp has2 fragment. Another band at 6510 bp shows the restricted pSMF2.1 plasmid.
Lane 1: pSMF2.1-has2-gfp (MluⅠ/SacⅠ)
Subsequently the pSMF2.1-has2-gfp plasmid DNA was transformed into B. megaterium and cultures were induced with xylose to start recombinant protein expression. Non-induced cultures served as negative controls. After 48 h of expression, corresponding samples were prepared for analysis by fluorescence microscopy (fig. 11).
Figure 11:  Fluorescence micrographs of B. megaterium cultures transformed with pSMF2.1-has2-gfp show fluorescence signals after excitation of λexc= 488 nm. Exposure time 100 ms (transmitted light) / 10 s (fluorescence) at a magnification of 630. The images in the upper row are transmitted light microscopic records. The images in the lower row are recorded by fluorescence microscopy. All images show liquid cultures. (C) No fluorescence signals are detectable in the non induced culture. (D) Fluorescence signals of the induced cultures are poorly localised in the cytoplasm membrane. Noticeable fluorescence dots of higher intensity are visible in the cytoplasm of the microbes.
Figure 11 illustrates that fluorescence signals of induced B. megaterium cultures were probably detectable in the cytoplasm membrane after excitation with light at a wavelength of 488 nm. Furthermore the image shows several fluorescence dots of higher intensity that might derive from an accumulation of Has2-GFP protein in the phospholipid monolayer that surrounds insoluble spheric inclusions, also referred as poly hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) inclusion bodies. The not induced negative control does not show any fluorescence signal.
To proof the accumulation of GFP tagged Has2 protein in the cytoplasm membrane of B. megaterium cells localisation studies were carried out with a laser scanning fluorescence"

add checking to grammar, if rules have been declared, if components or device instances inside the rule declarations are valid and have been declared
think of better messages if some rule has been violated but the overall result of the Assert statement is true?????
add to Rule declaration ability to compare properties using the operators ==, != , <=, >=, < , >
add this functionality to AssertRule method or maybe write a similar method for comparing properties
Week of July 6, 2009
In short, what I did this week
restructured and cleaned up some code to make it more modular, and corrected some minor bugs
included action code into a method to make it easier to use
improved rules, so that can compare primitives and not just components, devices
included if statement which evaluates a rule expression
created boolean primitive
changed declaration of devices to Cesar's suggestion:
Device BBa_K106019 (   PrimerSite BBa_X1();   Promoter BBa_X2();   ORF BBa_X3();   ORF BBa_X5();   Terminator BBa_X6();   Terminator BBa_X7();   PrimerSite BBa_X8(); );
Still To Do
to make include <filenames> in the .eug file:
need to write a method which looks if include statements exist
extract the filenames and concatenate those files with the user defined .eug file to make on full file to be passed to the compiler
Week of July 13, 2009
continued to debug code and refactor
expanded capability of if statement to evaluate regular expressions
enabled include files as headers
