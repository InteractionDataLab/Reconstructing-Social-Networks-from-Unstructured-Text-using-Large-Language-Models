Overview
We have tested the two eGFP reporters that we designed, and have validated their efficiency. In general, the ATG/ACG reporters have shown high efficiency in terms of the difference in the level of expression between the wild type and mutated version, while the β-globin reporters showed significantly less difference. The exact efficiency of these reporters are shown below:
ATG/ACG eGFP Reporters
We transfected HEK293T cells grown in 6-well plates, fixed the cells to slides, and obtained images via microscopy ( details ). For each chosen field, two images were obtained in order to perform calculation: one image for green fluorescence (Figure 1a), and one for red fluorescence (Figure 1b). The red fluorescence produced by the constitutively expressed RFP gene (mCherry) serves as an indicator for successful transfection, as well as a baseline for measuring the amount of green fluorescence. The fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ , which measures the amount and intensity of the fluorescence by grey scale.
Figure 1a & 1b: eGFP positive control, HEK293T cells, green/red fluorescence, 100X. The two images are of the same field.
The positive control transfected cells showed that the transfection method functioned properly for both the eGFP and the mCherry RFP plasmids. Additionally, when compared visually, the RFP fluoresced significantly less than the eGFP, but was expressed at about the same level as the eGFP. This was noticed because the cells shown to have slightly more RFP were also the cells that fluoresced green to a higher extent when filtered for eGFP.
HEK293T cells from the same cell line were also transfected with a combination of our custom ATG GFP plasmid and the same mCherry RFP plasmid. These cells were placed under the same microscope and used the same exposure times to take pictures of the fluorescing cells. Two examples of the ATG eGFP plus mCherry reporters were recorded in Figure 2a and Figure 2b.

Methods for Producing Recombinant Silk Films
Dialyzing silk to remove ions and prepare for lyophilization
Following recombinant protein expression and purification, the solution contains many ions and other molecules, which are easily removed by dialysis. We dialyzed the solution in a SnakeSkin tube with 3.5 kDa MWCO against 5mM ammonium bicarbonate for 24 hours with 2 total bath changes. Dialyzing against ammonium bicarbonate also prepares the solution for lyophilization, as ammonium bicarbonate facilitates the sublimation of water in the lyophilizer.[5]
Lyophilization
We froze the dialyzed silk solution using liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized the frozen sample in a LabConco FreeZone 4.5-105. Lyophilization allows us to recover all of the protein that was purified, which is around 5 to 8 mg from 1 L of recombinant cell culture.
The lyophilized silk can be seen on the walls of the tube. In this form, the silk is pure and without any solvent.
Dissolving in HFIP
Very few solvents are capable of dissolving pure silk. HFIP, a highly polar organic solvent, is one of them.[1] We dissolved our recombinant silk in HFIP to obtain a dilute silk dope of 5% w/v (50 mg/mL).
Casting films and water annealing
We pipetted 100 uL of silk dope into a small weigh boat and let it dry in a fume hood for 24 hours. We then removed the film from the weigh boat and placed it into a vacuum desiccator along with water in a separate container. Vacuum was then applied to the desiccator, and the film was allowed to anneal for 24 hours. The water annealing process encourages further formation of the silk's secondary structure, giving the film stability in aqueous environments as well as added strength.[4]
Measuring thickness of the film
A Vernier micrometer was used to measure the thickness of the film.
Mechanical testing
Just as with the fibers, strips of the fiber were mounted onto cardstock frames with 10mm gauge lengths. The mounted strips were then loaded into the Instron for testing.

We tried to construct operon for zeaxanthin biosynthesis, using the existing biobricks for B-carotene synthesis and part I742158, but it appeared that all biobricks containing crtEBIY operon lacked SpeI site, which was later confirmed by sequencing.
Production media for B-carotene and lycopene production with increasing concentrations of arabinose to assess the responsiveness of pBAD promoter for different concentrations of arabinose.
6/28/2010 –7/4/2010
 
New procedure for B-carotene and lycopene production was tried out, using mixture of ethylacetate and ethanol (1:1 vol.), the 50°C heating step was omitted for the thermolability of carotenoids. Extracts were analysed using HPLC, which confirmed the production of predicted compounds. Primers for mutagenesis of SpeI site in B-carotene operone biobricks were designed and ordered.
7/5/2010 –7/11/2010
 
While waiting primers for the mutagenesis,  we tried to combine the construct by blunt-end ligation. We had problems with inactive restriction enzymes, so most of the cloning experiments were unsuccessful.
7/12/2010 –7/18/2010
 
Operones for B-carotene biosynthesis with SpeI site were amplified by PCR, but we were unable to ligate the long fragment into the vector.

The plasmid further exhibits the BlcR repressor under the control of a constitutive promoter. Hence, the repressor is expressed, binds to the operator sequence and  prevents the expression of the sfGFP. With no analyte present, the system should not give a fluorescence output signal. With an analyte present, the binding of the repressor should be weakened and a fluorescence output signal should occur.
For in vitro characterization,  we transformed cells with a plasmid that carried the repressor only ( BBa_K1758370 ). Afterwards, we prepared cell extract from this culture. Together with a reporter plasmid containing the blc-operator sequence in front of sfGFP ( BBa_K1758376 ), we employed it in our established CFPS system.
Genetic structure of BBa_K1758377 . UTR: 5'-untranslated region. RBS: ribosome binding site. BBa_K1758376 and BBa_K1758370 are subparts of this complex
Characterization – BlcR function
We performed EMSA-shifts and verified: BlcR binds to the operator site described in Pan et al. 2013 , even when it is N-terminal fused to sfGFP (see PRIA results ).
EMSA shifts caused by addition of BlcR protein (see BBa_K1758370 ) and BlcR-sfGFP fusion protein (see BBa_K1758204 ), respectively, to Cy3-labeled blc-operator site. 5 pmol of following proteins were applied: 1: BlcR-sfGFP, 2: ArsR-sfGFP (see BBa_K1758203 ), 3: BlcR, 4: none.
Characterization – in vivo experiments
With this proof of functionality, we set out to investigate how the two substrates (in the following referred to as analytes) GBL and GHB can influence the binding interaction.
To do so, we previously needed to test the cells resistance against GBL and GHB. Both are toxic to E. coli if their concentration in the medium exceeds a certain limit. We observed that for GHB the tolerable dose is under 1% (v/v), whereas E. coli can live in medium supplemented with 3% (v/v) GBL.
An E. coli strain carrying BBa_K1758377 in pSB1C3 (as described previously) was induced to express T7 polymerase in medium with different concentrations of either G"

Only a small numberof chemotactic signals have been identified for H. pylori. Thebest-haracterized chemoreceptor is TlpB, which is requiredfor chemorepulsive responses to acid, as well as the quorumsensingmolecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) and H+.  TlpB is the first bacterial chemoreceptor of known function shown by crystallography to contain an extracellular PAS domain. Strikingly, a molecule of urea is found within the canonical ligand-binding site of the PAS domain, bound in a manner predicted to be sensitive to changes in pH.

Emily Goers Sweeney et.al. report that urea is bound with extremely high affinity andspecificity and is essential for the thermodynamic stability ofthe TlpB molecule. The urea-binding site includes an aspartategroup (Asp114), which we propose to be the key titratableresidue responsible for pH sensing. Mutational and biophysicalanalyses of the urea-binding site support a mechanism in whichthe urea cofactor, by binding in a pH-sensitive fashion, stabilizesthe secondary structure of TlpB and signals a pH response.

Therefore, we turned the dilemma to the students, let the public to decide           which one is the incredible project that we are going to work on it.
Process
First, we introduced our club and the fact that we are looking for new bloods to them. Since a good iGEM team definitely need members from diverse back ground , every per-son who is interested in it is welcomed no matter which grades or what is his or             her sub-ject.
Second, we described iGEM and synthetic biology to them, even though they might not understand the details and the biological terms, we are still trying to let them understand the importance and the magical power of synthetic biology.
Third, we talked about the three candidate topics that we want to do, and described what issue we want to conquer. But most importantly, we asked them to choose a project that they want the most, and collected their opinion on each topic.
Feedback
It is our first time to join a club festival, we learnt a lot about executive works, and how to organize a event. However, there is some details we can improve next time. For example, if we had a microphone or anything can amplify our voice, we may attract             more students.
It’s a pity that on the first day of the festival, one club burn the wires so the power is off. Perhaps next time we can prepare more for the accident.
We got a lot of cool comments on our three candidate topics, and even some advices which really inspire us. Besides, each of us had to explain our three candidate topics to the public, which made all of us understand our topics more.
Overall, I think we do great at our first debut. We achieve all the goals we set and got some students who are really curios about us, moreover, we got many new ideas form the public to improve our topics.

3.Quest for parameters
We can divide the different processes going on in the cells in 7 categories: transcription, translation, DNA binding, complexation and dimerization, protein production kinetics, degradation and diffusion. We went on to search the necessary parameters for each of these categories.
3.1 Transcription
Transcription is the first step of gene expression. It involves the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the formation of mRNA. The transcription rate is dependent on a number of conditions like the promoter strength and the used strain. The prediction of the transcription rate has been an important hold-back in the past, even though Polymerases per Second was introduced as a unit. This is the amount of Polymerases that passes through a given position in the DNA per time unit and is essentially the transcription rate at a particular location on the DNA ("

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,", this shows to be a simpler design with a higher specificity and lower toxicity. To form in vivo clusters of multi-enzymes the TALEN technique seems to be more efficient based on TALE-fused enzymes and their corresponding DNA scaffolds. It has been demonstrated that the TALE–DNA scaffold system can be efficiently used to cluster and order TALE-fused proteins, as well as enhance the rates of heterologous metabolic pathways in prokaryotic chassis.
Another possibility is an in vivo RNA scaffold that is the target of synthetic proteins that are linked to specific RNA binding domains. This way a co-localization of the proteins in living E. coli cells can be achieved. The synthetic RNA strands consist of polymerization domains and aptamers. The presence of the polymerization domains enable the formation of a macromolecular structure out of the single RNA strands. By applying a certain orientation and localization of the enzymes on the scaffold the diffusion of the substrate is limited and the pathway flux is increased.

Liquid-liquid phase separation – state of the art
Phase transitions play an important role in many processes. The most well-known example of phase transitions are those involving water, ranging from vapor, over condensed water up to solid ice phases. Phase transitions however, also play a key role for proteins, lipids and other macromolecules. Usually an in vitro formation of a liquid droplet phase can be detected in concentrated protein solutions. The physics describing this process are similar to the ones describing the condensation of dew droplets from concentrated water vapor. Phase transitions may be represented graphically by a phase diagram, in which the different regions of the diagram indicate the distinct phase(s) which are favored under given conditions, such as temperature and molecular concentration. A schematic phase diagram is shown here"

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.      It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",     and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,     and theological speculation throughout history.

SILVER REQUIREMENTS
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
We verified and classified our parts/devices by means of flow cytometry analysis. We validated the expression strength of three different alpha-factor responsive promoters by creating circuits in which fluorescent reporters were being driven by the promoter. We induced these promoters with purified alpha factor and measured them with flow cytometry to determine the expression strength of each promoter. The promoters characterized were pFig2c ( BBa_K1829002 ), pBar1 ( BBa_K1829001 ), and pAga1 ( BBa_K1829005 ); all are endogenous yeast promoters that participate in the mating response pathway. We additionally submitted the yeast protease Bar1 ( BBa_K1829000 ) which cleaves alpha factor, and made silent mutations to make it BioBrick compatible. We characterized the effect of adding Bar1 to our communication circuit with alpha factor, showing it effectively degrades alpha factor and reduces circuit sensitivity. Our parts were integrated within the pSB1C3 plasmid. All parts delivered are risk group one organisms and do not violate any safety standards. Specific part details can be found on our iGEM parts registry page and our Parts Page.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.

iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
This year, in addition to addressing cellular communication, we wanted to explore other issues of communication, specifically between the scientific community and the general public. Despite the breadth of iGEM and the open-source nature of its data reporting, the wikis and science content still remain very complex and not easily accessed by members of the general public. We addressed this with three ambitious projects:
We utilized social media, such as Twitter and Youtube, as a way of conveying scientific research to the general public through a video series on synthetic biology and research.
We contributed to the planning of a Synthetic Biology conference -- the Sierra Systems and SynBio Symposium -- which highlights undergraduate research in synbio"

Later, the team would measure GFP fluorescence levels in growth medium with or without rapalog. The emission of any fluorescence by the tripartite split-GFP would validate our BDC tool [Fig4] as it would mean the two target sequences are close.

Gene expression tests
In order to test a possible influence of the spatial proximity in gene expression, we would test the expression of two different reporter genes. With the aim of having more accurate variation measurements, we should use enzymes such as luciferase or beta-galactosidase.

This year the Stanford-Brown-RISD iGEM team worked with the Danish Technical University (DTU) overgrad team from the beginning. Both teams were inspired by the idea of mycotecture as funded by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Program to our faculty advisor, Dr. Rothschild. With our expertise in applying synthetic biology to problems of space exploration and settlement, and DTUs particular expertise in filamentous fungal biotechnology, we worked together towards the goal of using synthetic biology enabled fungal mycelia as an material for space settlement. We shared protocols for growing the material and helped troubleshoot each other’s projects. Both teams agreed to frame the project around a mission to the Martian surface and with with advice from resident NASA experts, both teams worked to add suitable benefits to the material.
Modeling
Both teams possessed some expertise in modeling and decided to put it to use to create models which described different stages of the mycelium production process. Working together, the goal was to have models which could inform future scientists that wish to use mycelium from the stage of a single spore all the way to building the final structure.
The DTU team created two models, one taking us from a single spore and modeling its hyphal growth and the second modeling what properties of mycelium would be necessary in a building Brick to make the final structure. Our team worked on a model which  spanned the intermediate between the two, taking a large colony of fungus and modeling its growth into a mold from which building Bricks could be made. Further details on the two teams’ models can be found below.
Our teams met several times over video chat to compare and contrast our approaches to models. Key takeaways follow:
The DTU model begins from a single spore; SBR’s begins from a “plug” of existing mycelia of given dimensions.
DTU’s model maps 2D, unconstrained growth; SBR’s model maps 3D, constrained growth (within a mold). Note that early iterations of the SBR model mapped 2D, unconstrained growth"

Promotion-Video
Another idea was to make a short movie which introduces our project concept and us. It was not that easy to combine the project idea with introducing us, but after brainstorming together with Professor Fritz Treiber we came up with a good concept. He told us how to do a screenplay, the importance of a good time table and borrowed us his sound equipment. It was a fun time recording and cutting the movie and we are very proud to introduce you: The Last Colinator – Trainingscamp:

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," pertain to the oil and gas sector for several years and have greatly supported the growth of synthetic biology in Canada and abroad.  As a sponsor of the University of Calgary iGEM team, OSLI has provided our team with an opportunity to interface with oil sands companies and interest groups which greatly aids the development of our project.
A Synthetic Biology Dialogue
In September our iGEM group was invited to a rare and important opportunity to share ideas on synthetic biology in an industrial oil sands discussion. A synthetic biology/microbiology workshop was hosted on September 27, 2012 at the ConocoPhillips Canada office in Calgary, AB, Canada. The goal of the workshop was to bring together industry representatives and researchers to discuss the current state of research in both petroleum microbiology and synthetic biology.  Furthermore the hope of the discussion was to identify areas of common interest for collaboration. One of the focuses of the meeting was to determine what barriers or threshold conditions that synthetic biology technologies must meet in order to be considered by oil sands companies for their operations.  Due to the relevance of this discussion to our project, our team sent two representatives to actively participate in this discussion and to identify areas where FRED and OSCAR could benefit the oil industry as well as identify areas where our projects should change to better work in an oil sands application.
Figure 1: Our group working at the OSLI Synthetic Biology Workshop.  Our group worked with a number of industry professionals to aid oilsands leaders in making decisions about synthetic biology.
What Did We Discuss?
During the OSLI workgroup, we met with approximately 30 professionals from various backgrounds including industry, government , academic institutions, researchers and technology enthusiasts.  Various conversations through e-mail had led up to this meeting where we discussed the motivations and direction in which synthetic biology might possibly be  applied to  industry.  Our group was proud to be able to provide the synthetic biology introduction to these individuals and explain the importance of synthetic biology and iGEM.  From this we began to discuss the potential relevance of synthetic biology to the oil sands’ industry.   The day continued with group discussions of the different forms of microbiology and synthetic biology technologies which could potentially be applied to the oil sands.  Our group was happy to discover that numerous groups had identified biosensor and tailing ponds remediation technologies as  areas that synthetic biology could impact the oil sands.  By the end of the day the collective group had come to the consensus that the most important technology platforms to continue to look into and which may provide early benefits to the oil industry are microbial degradation/conversion systems and biosensor"

Question 6: Do you think you have the water you drink? Are there antibiotics in the dishes?
Analysis: More than half them agreed that it is sustainable and possible that there is antibiotic residue in their body, and only 8 percent of them disagree with that, suggesting that antibiotics have been utilized in people's             daily lives widespread, it is hard for us to avoid problems caused by antibiotic residues.
Question 9: How do you think of the use of modern genetic technology to solve environmental bottlenecks?
Analysis: More than half of respondents accept to use synthetic biology for addressing current environmental problems in the genetic level and they are curious about these technologies. We are full of motivation and confidence, since our project is considered  as  highly receptive and greatly promising.
Academic conference
This summer, we were of great honor to be invited to attend the 4th Synthetic Biology Young Scholar Forum in Shenzhen which attracted lots of domestic and overseas experts specialized in synthetic biology field. Through this forum, our teammates understood that there are still many urgent problems needed to be solved and synthetic biology is an effective and efficient way that can be exploited and developed. Meanwhile, we had the opportunity to introduce our projects to the expert for their professional viewpoints and deep understanding about antibiotics, we are really appreciate that they gave us enlightening suggestions to improve and perfect our project. More importantly, experts and professors emphasized safety issue for us, pointed out that safe rules are overwhelmingly significant and we must obey from basic lab regulations to our project as a whole, after that, we did more work about safety and bear in mind the teacher’s instructions from beginning to end. Besides, we communicated with other IGEM-teams, talked about our projects and also gave suggestions to each other. It is really a fantastic process in which we gathered more information in medical sector and picked up intriguing ideas for a better solution. They thought our work was very meaningful to decrease the pollution and provide a more             healthy environment for creatures. This forum has affected and improved our project and we indeed had a lot of gains.
iGEM Community
After the project was established, the experiment was carried out step by step, and some problems encountered were not as smooth as expected. So on July 7, 2018, we participated in the Nine-School Association sponsored by iGEMer of NKU-China. We exchanged suggestions with more iGEM partners, listened to their ideas about our project. Meanwhile, we also consulted experts and scholars to seek some help in improving our experimental design and solving the problems encountered. As you can see"
Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#md_-_-_TEXT.html," offer stronger processor power and larger space. We finished the first round of screening with the help of High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) in Tsinghua University.
Adaptation to Copy Number -- Decision Based on Probability Distribution
In order to obtain an ideal and robust network which is adaptive to DNA template abundance (copy number), we firstly did parameter scan analysis and made comparisons among all the selected 476 structures intuitively. We changed the range of reaction rate to represent the change of copy number (proportional relationship), and expected to get a cluster of input-output curves (when copy number changes). Besides, we analyzed the correlativity between copy number and output, and expected the curve to be saturated.            
Since the target network structure is supposed to robustly distinguish different cells with either low or high endogenous input signal, there needs to be a saturated tendency to copy number. In other words, the output shouldn’t infinitely increase when the value of copy number increases, especially when the input is low. Otherwise, the network would wrongly regard the low-input kind of cell as the high-input kind when copy number is at high level. According to our simulation, we selected 111 network structures that tend to be saturated out of 476 structures.
Considering that the actual number of DNA templates that may be transferred into cells is not certain but rather follows a certain distribution in probability, we assumed that the copy number follows Poisson distribution. Then we studied each kind of distribution output follows when inputs are low and high respectively. For a better quantized comparison among the 111 structures, we raised Overlap (the covering part of two output distribution) as index, and hoped to get the optimal network with lowest Overlap.
Finally we figured out 2 optimal network structures, and the corresponding network structures contain following core topologies.
Compared with unsaturated networks, the 2 optimal network performance well when copy number follows Poisson distribution.
Because the target network is expect to be functional in distinguishing different cells, we designed a simulated screening test (sorter case) to verify our results above. In this optimal test, we offered 1000 cell A with low amount of endogenous microRNA (low input) and 1000 cell B with high amount of endogenous microRNA (high input). And both of them followed Gaussian distribution. Then we packed the network as a black box sorter which only receives these different cells and tries to distinguish them correctly. We then counted the number of the sorting results, compared with correct decisions and calculated the Accuracy Rate. The low overlap of optimal networks indicate adaption to DNA copy number.

Mathies Brinks Sørensen
My involvement in the project has mainly been in the modeling part of the project. Particularly most of my time has been invested into statistical modeling as well as creating the experimental designs regarding compressive strength experiments. Furthermore, my involvement also included initial attempts in creating a growth model of the fungi via a hidden markov model approach.
Konstantinos Zifkos
My early involvement in the project was mainly about fundraising and generally being involved in the handling of the group economics. Later on, I was part of the mycolab where I focused on determining the optimal growth conditions of our fungi. Moreover, I was responsible for developing a protocol for the manufacturing process of our bricks.
Melissa Emilie McGrail
During this project, I’ve mostly been placing my energy in Human Practices where my main focus has been the collaboration with KU and Exeter. My competences in chemistry have been put mostly in consulting throughout the project.
Mathias Hoeg Boisen
Early on, my main focus was increasing the strength of the material, which has been the main drive in creating the statistical model. I’ve also worked on the collection of data, such as structural data, and design of experiments. I’ve worked on creating a simple growth model of fungi based on existing literature. This model can describe how fungi grow on a meso level, which means that its measurable quantity is explicitly density of mycelium. I’ve also been a part of creating the statistical model and helped gather structural data of the samples.
Alejandro Ventura-Traveset
During the first three months I focused in the economy group, where I was writing funding applications, creating budgets and booking accommodation and flights for the whole team. Then, I was part of the mycolab, where I carried out experiments related to fungal biology. I have been involved in culturing fungi, generating protoplasts, transforming fungi and other lab activities. Also, I have been in touch with several PhDs at the bioengineering department that have provided us with knowledge to continue with our project.
Michelle Lind Østrup
During the project my main focus was on creating a responsive wiki. I worked both with the wiki framework and the design aspect of it.

Guide on high school
Tsinghua-A team 2013 have done some promotion of iGEM HS in China with the help of ITCCC (International Teenager Competition and Communication Center), a Chinese organization devoted to the promotion of science and technology competitions for young people. We went to Haidian foreign language experimental school and had a lecture about synthetic biology and iGEM, which had attracted nearly 300 students, and through this lecture we got some helpful and beneficial communication and interaction with those students. After that, we give some guidance towards their iGEM HS team’s experiment, project and competition. And in the iGEM HS 2013 competition the Haidian Foreign Language Experimental School team got an Individual Awards.
Experience sharing
Our team member Lei Wei participate the Synthetic Biology and IGEM Exchanging Meet, held by Nanjing University, on April 26th, 2013. As our team leader in the last year, he shared his experience in doing research of synthetic biology and his feelings about participating the iGEM competition. Also, as a non-biotechnology-major student, whose major is Automation, he shared his experience and feelings standing on the Automation field, which would give students attending the meet some different inspirations. We also collaborate with Nanjing-china team. As a team coming from Department of Biology, they were not so good at building model and coding, so they asked for our help to build model and code for them. They sent their circuit to us, and through our hardworking we finally sent the equations and codes back to them. They did some more work basing on our code and got the result meeting expects.

SEE OUR WORK WITH NONA
NONA and the iGEM Community
We mentioned that our team could give NONA a hand. Indeed, Neptune is the first iGEM project to be placed on NONA, and in our discussions with NONA we found that our team could pave the way for future iGEM teams that want to have a place for their software tools.
The Problem: iGEM software tools get lost
Each year, software solutions to synthetic biology problems are generated from teams around the world. iGEM software tools are especially prone to losing support or community after they are developed, as teams that developed those tools for the competition often find it hard to maintain those projects in the years thereafter. And worse yet, there have been dozens of software tools to come from iGEM, and none of these tools have a clear or coherent locations where they can be found.
The Solution: NONA to protect iGEM software tools
Our team offers itself as a point of contact for NONA at the iGEM Giant Jamboree this year. We want to extend the hand to other iGEM teams that have developed amazing tools, but are worried about how these tools will be maintained in the future. We will have an active NONA “about” booth at our Jamboree table, where we will provide information about what NONA is, how NONA can help iGEM teams with software, and information about how these teams can contribute their tools to NONA. We will also actively help these teams contact NONA and we’ll give them information on how to properly send their tools to NONA, expediting the integration process.
We are very excited that Neptune is now part of the NONA software tool platform. We are even more excited about the incredibly potential of integrating iGEM software tools with NONA. We envision a future where iGEM is integrated with NONA such that NONA has an entire section dedicated to tools developed by iGEM teams. This would be a huge way to make software tools in synthetic biology more integrated, well documented, coherently located and above all, accessible."

The N-terminus contains a type III secretion signal (T3SS), which allows the proteins to be translocated from the bacterium and into the plant cell. The C-terminus contains nuclear localization signals (NLS) and an acidic activation domain (AAD). The DNA binding domain, also termed repeat region, mediates DNA recognition through tandem repeats of 33 to 35 amino acids residues each (Bogdanove et al., 2010). The binding domain usually comprises 15.5 to 19.5 single repeats (Figure 1). The last repeat, close to the C-terminus, is called “half-repeat,” because it generally is 20 amino acids in length. Although the modules have conserved sequences, polymorphisms are found in residues 12 and 13, also known as “repeat-variable di-residues” (RVD). RVDs can be specific for one nucleotide or a number of nucleotides; therefore, 19.5 repeat units target a specific 20-nucleotide sequence in the DNA (Mussolino & Cathomen, 2012).
Figure 1.(A) Schematic representation of a TAL effector with the DNA binding domain in red. (B) 3D structure of TALEs obtained from our team’s work in Autodesk Maya. To learn more about our modeling, click here .
When in contact with the DNA, the TALE aligns the N-terminal to the 5' end of the DNA and the C-terminal to the 3’ end of the DNA. Each repeat is made of two alpha helices connected by a three-residue loop, two of which amino acids comprise an RVD. Although both amino acids 12 and 13 are responsible for base specificity, the TALE-DNA interaction happens through intermolecular bonds between residue 13 and the target base in the major groove of the DNA. Residue 12 plays a role in stabilizing the RVD loop (Meckler et al., 2013).
Over 20 different RVDs have been identified in TAL effectors. However, four of them appear in 75% of the repeats: HD, NG, NI and NN (Bogdanove et al., 2010). Quantitative analysis of DNA-TALE interactions by Meckler et al. (2013) revealed that the binding affinity is affected by the RVDs in the following order (The letters in brackets show the base that the RVD binds to): NG (T)"

I will go to bed before 12 today!
Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN
If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.

Conoco Phillips Oil Sand Tour and Oils Sand Discovery Centre
Today, we were fortunate enough to join a tour at one of Conoco Phillips oil sand sites near Fort McMurray. We received a quick information session about how their extraction process works and we were able to walk around the site (perimeter walk) to see how these processes actually work. A lot of the details that I learned today was taught through one of the petroleum geology classes I took, however, it was definitely great to see how classroom knowledge is applied in extraction of oil. Some of the possible areas that they wanted us to consider is:
Since bitumen is difficult to extract due to its viscosity (its very thick), is there a way to engineer bacteria that can lower viscosity. As of now they use heat to change the viscosity of the bitumen, but if there is a more cost effective and efficient way to change the viscosity, it would be a great project...
About 10% of the water that goes through the whole treatment is not reused
After the great tour, we also went to the oil sand discovery centre and we were able to learn the details of oil composition and how oil is extracted. I thought the tour was excellent because it gave me more insight of how all these"

This characterization included a full kinetic analysis, pH optimization, temperature optimization, and exploring the use of Prussian blue ferritin in a strip assay. In conjunction with our modelling efforts we also were able to evaluate the efficacy of different techniques of constructing our FerriTALE. Moving forward with the data gathered so far on ferritin we would like to further explore its application to our system. This includes fine-tuning the use of ferritin as a reporter for our system based off of the modelling performed. In order to increase the efficacy of the Prussian blue ferritin produced from our parts we would like to also explore different iron loading techniques for ferritin in order to ensure that the nanoparticle is fully saturated with iron before it undergoes the Prussian blue synthesis process. In the context of our prototype we would also like to explore different methods of applying our Prussian blue ferritin to our strips during experiments in order to see if we can reduce the minimum level of detection for our strip assay. We are excited to use ferritin in the context of our full system and to see how future iGEM teams can make use of ferritin.

1% bleach: Centrifuged spores re-suspended in 50 μL 1% bleach.
70% ethanol: Centrifuged spores re-suspended in 50 μL 70% ethanol.
Drying: Centrifuged spores were completely dried in a Vacufuge at 30 °C for 10 minutes.
Heating at 60 °C: Centrifuged spores were placed in a hot water bath at 60 °C.
Heating at 90 °C: Centrifuged spores were placed on a hot plate at 90 °C.
The spores were subjected to each of these conditions, at 5:35 pm on September 25, 2014, and left for 24 hours before  they were re-suspended in 50 μL of distilled water.  From this solution the spores were centrifuged to separate spores from the supernatant so that the spores could be spread on LB agar overnight to see if the spores were able to regenerate and cultures were able to grow.  This allowed for quantitative data to be taken of the cultures to see which conditions proved to be the hardest on the spores.
Transforming B. subtilis spores
The final design of our device would contain B. subtilis in the spore form due to its robust nature. Before the blood sample reaches the compartments containing B. subtilis, the cells need to be activated back to the vegetative state. Due to this, it was essential to test activation and transformation directly from spores. We made our first attempt by pelleting cells from long-term and short-term stored spore solutions and added LB, xylose, and linear thrC DNA (~200 ng) at the same time. We incubated these tubes for a day, and spread them on plain and spectinomycin plates. There was growth on plain plates but not spectinomycin plates, suggesting unsuccessful transformation. One reason for failed transformation might be the addition of insufficient DNA.
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
We continued trying to biobrick lacZ. This week the team focused on getting parts ready for submission. We are having issues plasmid switching out parts.

Conclusion
Dans la société actuellement, de nombreuses personnes sont favorables à réduire et encadrer les pratiques de biologie synthétique jusqu’à ce que tous les risques soient déterminés et écartés en vertu du principe de précaution. Cependant l’application de ce principe met en évidence un paradoxe qui nuit à l’innovation :
Pour utiliser les techniques de biologie synthétique, tous les risques doivent être connus et maitrisés. Or, ces derniers ne peuvent pas être déterminés à moins d’avancer en pratiquant la biologie synthétique. Ce que refuse le principe de précaution puisque la biologie synthétique n’est pas encore fiable.
Le principe de précaution refuse en fait l’innovation tant qu’il y a le moindre risque.
A l’inverse le principe de responsabilité permet de concentrer son travail sur le risque le plus grave après avoir estimé l’ensemble des risques. C’est une solution qui est donc envisageable pour établir une réglementation, puisqu’elle permet de poursuivre les recherches malgré les risques non maitrisés.

About Us
We are a university team based in Lethbridge Alberta.
Our Project: ""Bacuum"" Cleaner
The tailing ponds created when water is used to extract oil from the Alberta tar sands or other mining operations pose a major environmental dilemma. How can we isolate the tailings and byproducts of the extraction process? Despite the efforts of the corporations responsible, chemicals can leech from the ponds into the surrounding ground water and soil. These toxic and often corrosive water beds not only affect the immediate land and water environment but also cause severe repercussions to larger ecosystems as much of the wildlife relies on getting their food and water from the now disrupted bionetwork. The exact composition of tailing ponds is highly complex, often laced with heavy metals and other toxic chemicals, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, and are difficult and expensive to filter or degrade. One powerful example is the high level of mercury in our fresh water fish, stemming from the tailing ponds of gold mining operations and the refinement of chloralkali metals.
It is our goal to create a bacterial vacuum cleaner, or “Bacuum”, which will seek out and degrade a particular harmful hydrocarbon. We intend to use the theophylline riboswitch we worked on last year as a platform for directed evolution to create a novel riboswitch capable of binding a particular aromatic hydrocarbon or class of hydrocarbons. The riboswitch will be used to control expression of the motility protein cheZ in Escherichia coli at low concentrations, thus directing the bacterium towards local areas of high ligand concentration. At a threshold level, a second riboswitch will be used to activate a pathway capable of metabolizing the aromatic hydrocarbons. Ultimately, the resulting product will be funneled into an anabolic pathway, such as the TCA cycle or fatty acid biosynthesis, from which an alternative fuel source can be produced, thereby turning toxic tailings ponds into a bioreactor with the help of a self-guiding ""search and destroy"" bacterial operative.
We also worked with the Lethbridge Calvin Christian School iGEM team, introducing their high school team members to basic molecular biology lab techniques.

We first explained our interpretation of things they were unclear about. In order to offer further help to them, we learnt about their project abstract and design through frequent mails. We further discussed with them on parts improvement and documentation. We explained to them what is parts improvement, listed examples of it and told them how it can be done. Moreover, in parts documentation, we examined their parts and provided recommendation on how to present parts in a more standardized way. Hopefully their documentation of parts will be very informative and they'll do well in part improvement.

This July trip was our first opportunity to                                     share our ENABLE project internationally. The Meetup has provided us with many valuable suggestions.                                     For example, since then we started to focus more intensely on how we could help our general audience                                     better understand our project. It was primarily thanks to the workshop sessions where we had to come                                     up with solutions to promote our project and human practice within \[just 1 minute](link to our 1-min intro video or audio).                                     Furthermore, we made many friends, especially with members of Team:TuDelft and Team:SZU-China . We sincerely hope that our collaboration will extend to the next competition season. See you next summer!

Hefei City
Hefei formerly known as Hofei, Luzhou, or Luchow, is the capital and largest city of                                 Anhui Province in Eastern China. A prefecture-level city, it is the political, economic,                                 and cultural center of Anhui. Located in the central portion of the province.
From the 8th to the 6th century BC, Hefei was the site of many small states, later a part                                 of the Chu kingdom. Many archaeological finds dating from this period have been made.                                 The name Hefei was first given to the county"

What we have done insofar is focused on two-cell oscillation. Quorum-sensing oscillator is not simply a matter of expansion in magnitude, but a matter of robustness in allowing difference of each individual cell. Moreover, we test the adjustment of phase and amplitude of oscillation in this part.
As we all know, no two things in this world are the same, so do cells. The major difference of individual cell that we take into considerations is twofold:
●Each cell's activity of promoter is varied, so each cell has different rate to generate AHL.
●The initial amount of AHL may be disproportionally distributed among cells.
The rate of generating AHL is closely related to parameter m and n. Therefore, we introduce randomness to both parameters by letting them obey normal distribution, that is:
m(i)= μ1+N(0,σ1);
n(i)= μ2+N(0,σ2);
μ1 and μ2 are the average ability of generating 30C6HSL and 3012CHSL, and normal distribution--(0,σ)--describes the fluctuations of AHL generating rate in individual cell. We then expanded our equations from 2 cells to a population of cells. Each cell share a mutual environment in which we assume that AHL in environment is proportionally distributed.
Figure 16 100 Cells Varied in parameter m and n
The figures indicate that our system can oscillate synchronically being able to tolerate differences among a population of cells. Furthermore, the figures prove that different ability of generating AHLs of cells have nothing to do with the period and phase of the oscillation. We can also see that the oscillation amplitude of each cell is to a greater extent varied when the Variance of interruption is enlarged.
Moreover, we test whether the oscillation is dependent on initial distribution of AHL by changing the initial amount drastically by letting them follow uniform distribution. That is:
Initial(i)= U(0,20);
The results would give evidence to prove that our system can start to oscillate synchronically given variant initial starting numbers.
Based on this distribution restraining the initial AHL concentration in each cell, we simulated out a figure as follows.

The results demonstratively give evidence proving that our system can start to oscillate synchron"

C. Human toxicity of the AMPs
AMPs will be produced and released in water with the aim of wiping out V. cholerae. The amount of AMPs remaining in water should not be toxic to humans. Experimentations must be done to know the quantity of AMPs in the water supposed to be drunk and especially their effects on epithelial cells (esophagus, stomach, intestines, etc.) and on the microbiota.
D. Limiting media leaks
The amount of nutrients allowing GMMs growth should be correctly calculated so that they are all consumed during the lifetime of GMMs. An excess of nutrients in the compartment could diffuse into water and cause the emergence of new microorganisms and an unintended taste for user.
2. Environmental
A. Waste management of the GMMs
As GMMs are used in this system, it is essential to think about waste management. After the use, the GMMs  must be inactivated before discarding them as regular garbage. The important questions to consider are: how to kill them and where to discard GMMs?
B. Recyclable device
In order to have an eco-friendly approach, the materials used for the device must be recyclable. Moreover, the device must be used several times in order to limit as much as possible the waste.
3. Material
A. GMM storage
GMMs (V. harveyi and P. pastoris) must be confined in the same compartment because they need to interact with each other. The microorganisms must be kept in this compartment. If they are freeze-dried, the water to be treated must rehydrate the microorganisms. Therefore, water must enter into the compartment.
B. Easy to use
In developing countries, war-torn countries or those affected by natural disasters, people cannot be provided with a complex device from both scientific and technical point of views.
C. Transportable
The device must be easy to transport in order to reach the populations of remote villages or in conditions of natural disaster and armed conflicts.
D. Treatment speed
The treatment time must be reasonable compared to the volume of water to be treated.
E. Water treatment capacity
The water treatment capacity must be adapted to the device function and to the capacity of the microorganisms to detect and treat water. According to Alama Keita (UNICEF), the quantity of water to purify for one week for a whole village is about"

Let us explain how to make differential equations expressing behavior of genetic circuit. First, we will talk about transcription control by sigma-factors. The transcription rate of a gene, under a certain promoter which starts transcription by binding a certain sigma factor, is proportional to the following formula including the Hill equation when no anti-sigma-factors exist. $$\frac{[\sigma]}{K + [\sigma]}$$ $K$ is the dissociation constant between sigma-factor and promoter.
If anti-sigma-factor exists, it inhibits the activity of sigma-factor. Therefore, the ratio of inhibited sigma-factor to all sigma-factors is expressed by the following formula including the Hill equation. $$\frac{[anti-{\sigma}]}{K’ + [anti-{\sigma}]}$$ $K’$ means the dissociation constant between sigma-factor and anti-sigma-factor.
It follows that the gene transcription rate of sigma-promoter is proportional to the Hill equation of activated sigma-factor, $$ [\sigma] \frac{1 - \frac{[anti-{\sigma}]}{K’ + [anti-{\sigma}]}}{ K + [\"

Editing the Human Microbiome: Proactively Preventing Conotoxin Pathology
Conotoxins are small neurotoxins that bind to and affect the opening and closing of ion channels, thus altering membrane potential and disrupting neurological signaling pathways. Our goal of this project has two components. The first is to create a program to mathematically model both normal and conotoxin-affected intracellular ion concentrations. The second is to develop a signaling and responding pathway to detect changes in membrane potential and eliminate the conotoxins.

It is important to use the same batch of electrophoresis buffer in both the electrophoresis tank and the gel preparation.
Loosely plug the neck of the Erlenmeyer flask using a paper cap. Heat the slurry in a boiling-water bath or a microwave oven until the agarose dissolves. The agarose solution can boil over very easily so keep checking it. It is good to stop it after 45 seconds and give it a swirl. It can become superheated and NOT boil until you take it out where upon it boils out all over your hands.
When the molten gel has cooled to ~50 deg C, add 0.5μg/ml of ethidium bromide. Mix the gel solution thoroughly by gentle swirling.
While the agarose solution is cooling, choose an appropriate comb for forming the sample slots in the gel. Apply cellotape tightly onto the sides of comb to form a mold for gel.
Pour the warm agarose solution into the mold.(The gel should be between 3 - 5 mm thick. Check that no air bubbles are under or between the teeth of the comb).
Allow the gel to set completely (30-45 minutes at room temperature), then pour a small amount of electrophoresis buffer on the top of the gel, and carefully remove the comb. Pour off the electrophoresis buffer. Mount the gel in the electrophoresis tank. Wash the Erlenmeyer flask as quick as possible. (Add just enough electrophoresis buffers to cover the gel to a depth of approx. 1mm).
Mix the samples of DNA with 0.20 volumes of the desired 6x gel-loading dye on a clean piece of cello tape spread on an even surface.
Slowly load the sample mixture into the slots of the submerged gel using a disposable micropipette or an automatic micropipettor or a drawn-out Pasteur pipette or a glass capillary tube. Load size standards into slots on both the right and left sides of the gel.
Close the lid of the gel tank and attach the electrical leads so that the DNA will migrate toward the positive anode (red lead). Apply a voltage of 7-10 V/cm (measured as the distance between the positive and negative electrodes). If the electrodes are 10 cm apart then run the gel at 50V. It is fine"

The remaining pigments, magenta and cyan, will combine to form a blue colour.
The Future
Our project aims to provide a foundation for the control of organisms using multiple wavelengths of light for future development. Using lasers to control bacteria will provide high spatial control, while a well characterised system will provide good temporal control. Importantly, response is not limited to a molecular output. Possibilities include taxis, luminescence, electricity, magnetic fields and sound. As has been proven in past research, systems expressed in E.coli can be modified and expressed in a eukaryotic model. In consideration, such a system could enable finely controlled mixed volume outputs of medically relevant molecules, for example patient specific antibody treatment. From an economic angle, a calculatable light input will correlate to a desired complex output from a single customizable organism strain, vastly increasing production times from current processes. Attractively, laboratories will have reduced chemical usage and only require a single processing machine, as light is a cheap, easily manipulatable and mostly harm free resource.
So what do our constructs look like?
As we have the three different light modules to work with, we can experiment with different techniques and companies when it comes to our assembly techniques and synthesis.
The Red Light Module is the ""easiest"" to work with, as we only need to be working with the red light sensor and cyan pigment (the intermediate protein, OmpR, is already present in the genome of E. coli, so we don't need to include the genes which code for it). We will try and assemble this module ourselves in the lab, using a variety of assembly techniques.
The pink arrows indicate the direction of transcription. OmpF is the specific promoter which matches OmpR, the intermediate protein. The black brackets indicate the separate BioBricks (eg. BBa_S05058 is an RBS with the gene that codes for our cyan pigment).
The cyan pigment has been placed before the red light sensor so that if there is accidental read-through, we're not getting unwanted transcription of the cyan pigment.
The Blue Light Module is being synthesised for us by DNA2.0. It includes YFI (our blue light sensor), FixJ (the intermediate protein) and amilGFP (our yellow pigment).
The pink arrows indicate the direction of transcription. The central section, coding for FixJ, has been flipped backwards and upside-down. This ensure that, if we get accidental read-through from the RNA polymerase from YF1, the sequence for FixJ"

Leading by Cheng Li who is the director of Peking University's team of iGEM in 2018 and was the member of this team in 2016., we visited the campus of Peking University and the Lab belonging to the team of iGEM.During this time,we talked about how to improve the morale of our team, ensure the promotion of our project ,the way of guidance from instructors and the train of team member. From this communication, our delegation not only gained a lot of pertinent suggestions directly , but also inspired a lot of feelings and reflections indirectly.
We were informed of the sound competition system and the unique team system of these colleges during this event and recognized the gaps in resources and capabilities with these outstanding universities in our country.However, this situation aroused our spirit to fight for a promising future. As long as we have a believing heart, we will be able to stand in the highest mountain though  we don't have extraordinary talents."

The Plug 'n Apply system (PnA system)
A big challenge of our project is the attachment of ligands and functional proteins on either the outside or inside of a virus-like particle ( VLP ). We decided to use a noncovalent anchor-like system, which consists of two different coiled-coil proteins. We called it the Plug-and-Apply-system (PnA-system). In figure 1 is shown the actual connection of a ligand (yellow color) via the PnA-system (shown in red and green color) to a VLP (light blue colour).
Figure 1: The Plug-and-Apply-system. The VLP (blue) is fused to the E-coil  (red) and the ligand (yellow) will be fused to the K-coil (green) as described in the follwing texts

Furthermore, when cultures transformed with BBa_K1218011 were checked for Cas9 expression with SDS-PAGE, no convincing Cas9 band could be observed. Because of time limitations I decided to continue working with the Addgene construct for making the mutations, and chose an established system for protein expression. For that reason I did not submit any Cas9-biobricks. Furthermore, the pEVOL construct containing an aminoacyl-synthetase and a tRNA for introducing BipA in response to the TAG stopcodon were isolated from a strain kindly received from George Church (described in Mandel et al., 2015 ). The MTA that was signed to receive the strain does not allow for redistribution.

We showed that the caps work as intended and would be usable in ICA.
We expected the following combinations to ligate.
AB + Initiator (inconclusive)
AB + B-cap
BC + C-cap
CA + A-cap
CA + Terminator (inconclusive)
There was an insufficient amount initiator and terminator in the reaction, so no bands. But the sticky ends should work as expected.
CA weakly ligates with C-cap, which is shown by the double bands present. This result was not expected, and may be due to non-specific ligation."

As the iGEM web said, before you pick up your first pipette you should think about Human Practices.                     Human Practices is an integral aspect of iGEM.
As we advance our project, we always think about how our work be responsible and good for the                     world. At                     the same time, we want the society to influence the direction of our project. In order to show what                     we                     did in Human Practices part, we divided an iGEM project into four parts: purpose, design,                     execution,                     and outreach, demonstrate respectively in the Integrated Human Practices                     and Education & Public Engagement modules.
Now, we present you how we use HP as a channel to open up the gap between the laboratory and the                     society.

Micro Holmes
A Novel Device for Monitoring Heavy Metal Ions
Watch video
Abstract
With the global industrialization, heavy metal ions have become significant factors of water pollution, which may cause serious damage to human health. However, the devices to measure the concentration of heavy metals are complex and expensive. Therefore, the aim of our project was to create a cheaper and portable device. In our project, we have applied several transcription factors which are sensitive to the concentration of copper ions and chromium ions to regulate the expression of protein ribB.RibB will enhance the production of riboflavin. Riboflavin, as the electron carrier, improves the electricity producing performance of the Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs). So in this way, we successfully correlated the concentration of heavy metal ions together with the output voltage of the MFC. This process is used within a convenient new device we created, Micro Holmes (a combination of MFC and electronic components), to monitor heavy metal ions in water sample any place any time.

We've done an investigation about water pollution in the past few months. Through street interviews and online questionnaires,369 valid replies were collected from 9 countries. Here's the conclusion: Although different countries have varying degrees of water pollution, people are uniformly worried about this. Accordingly, there is support, and even demand for a method that is both cheap and convenient to tell them whether their water is safe to drink. And that's the reason for this project.

We had constructed 14 different parts. All of them, including several ion sensors, have ribB CDS. Our experiments confirmed that the expression degree of ribB can influence the riboflavin production. Then we took them into MFC and the voltage showed that our genetically engineered E.coli responded to the change of Cu2+ concentration. Thus we linked the concentration of metal ion to the electricity production.

Trong hàng thế kỷ qua, các nhà giả kim đã tin tưởng vào sự tồn tại của “hòn đá phù thủy”, đó là một vật chất bí ẩn không chỉ có khả năng biết những kim loại thông thường thành những kim loại quý như vàng, bạc mà còn có khả năng thực hiện được những mong muốn to lớn, bất tận của con người như trẻ mãi không già hay trường sinh bất tử.
Mặc dù “hòn đá phù thủy” đó chưa bao giờ được tìm thấy nhưng chính việc tìm kiếm nó đã thúc đẩy những nhà giả kim kiểm tra trong phòng thí nhiệm của họ rất nhiều vật chất và sự tương tác giữa chúng. Chính việc đó đã xây dựng nên một nền tảng kiến thức khoa học mà chúng ta được kế thừa ngày hôm nay trong các ngành khoa học như hóa học, luyện kim và dược học.
Sống trong thế kỷ thứ 21 theo dòng chảy của thế giới khoa học, niềm tin vào “hòn đá phù thủy” đã phai mờ trong chúng ta. Tuy nhiên, hơn bao giờ hết, chúng ta vẫn còn một nhiệm vụ quan trọng, đó là tìm ra những giải pháp để không chỉ giúp cho từng cá nhân sống khỏe mạnh và lâu hơn mà còn giải quyết những vấn đề về sinh thái học mà bản thân"
Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," team with lovely people and great scientists! We had trouble with a ligation of a gen in three parts, and they found the solution – a Golden Gate Assembly! Since we hadn’t designed one yet and were already delayed in our planning, we couldn’t work it out on our own. Jeremy developed a complete program for us ready to work with, from the primer design to sending us a suitable vector. They supported us during the entire length of the experiment. A great thank you to Jeremy and his wonderful Team Evry!
Aalto-Helsinki
We met the iGEM Team Aalto-Helsinki at the European iGEM Meeting in Delft. They developed a usage for the peptide dermcidine, but since they did not have access to a S2 lab they could not perform any tests. We offered them our facilities in cooperation with the TU Delft, unfortunately we did not have enough time for it in the end. Thank you for the nice time!
Heidelberg
The team Heidelberg is an expert in PCR an offered their help with their PCR-First Aid Service, which we used when we couldn’t get our reactions to work. Heidelberg listened to our problems and gave us valuable advice and tricks how to change our experiments. We went through several rounds of trial and error and they always came up with new ideas. Thank you to the team Heidelberg and especially Pauline for her immediate help!
Harvard
The iGEM Team Harvard developed a questionnaire to standardise interviews with experts. Since we had several interviews in the scope of our project, we were happy to participate working out some questions.
KU Leuven
The team of KU Leuven launched a wonderful program where the teams translate other projects into their own language. We took part in that project and thank the KU Leuven for their great idea and the teams of Duesseldorf-Cologne, Heidelberg, Pasteur_Paris, Peshawar, IONIS, Moscow_RF, NYMU_Taipei, Tec Chihuahua, UChile_OpenBio_CeBiB und XMU-China for their translations!
Peshawar
We had a Skype call with the iGEM Team Peshawar to exchange our experiences. Thanks for the nice meeting!
Cologne-Duesseldorf
As last year, the iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf started a postcard information campaign in which we gladly participated. We designed a postcard ourselves and were send some by other teams, which we distributed at our university and events.

We are honorably served as one of the members of it and responsible for Traditional Chinese.  Through this multilateral collaboration, we have learned many aspects of synthetic biology and combined them with our education human practice.
iGEM Franconia
Asist team Franconia on their education project
We noticed an interesting collaboration request on iGEM Community Collaboration page and decided to communicate with the Franconia team. NYMU team got this amazing opportunity to collaborate with iGEM teams around the globe by designing and finishing the translation of the biological themed card (whose idea originated from Franconia team) into universal languages. The biological themed card is a card game where the basic deck contains cards that can be pathogens, cures, preventatives, or anything that influences human health. Since the NYMU team has specialists in the field of medicine, we collaborated with team Franconia and other iGEM teams to help the iGEM community translate the biological themed card into traditional Chinese.
We believe that this cooperation is significantly meaningful because not only does this card game raise people’s awareness of pathogens and biosafety issues, but also the translation of the basic deck into universal languages can help the biological themed card itself extended to more areas in the world. We are honored to collaborate with these teams and deeply believe that our translation can make people stay away from anything that negatively impacts their health. The following PDF file is our translation.

Asia Pacific Conference
Later in July, we attended the 5th Annual Asia Pacific Conference held at National Chiao Tung University. During the four-day event, we had the opportunity to meet around 25 iGEM teams – from Taiwan, China, Japan, and the US. The conference began with each team displaying their posters and getting a big picture of what everyone’s project is about. For the following days, each team would each hold a 40-minute presentation session with Q&A time. Through our presentation, our presenters acquired a sense of what the final presentation at Giant Jamboree will be like. Furthermore, during the Q&A session, we received many feedbacks in regards to improvements that could be made -- including the utilization of waste proteins that are produced in the cycle of biofuel. For the rest of the conference we attended others’ presentations; by listening to every team’s progress and obtaining a sense of the field they are researching in, we were able to acknowledge the pros and cons of our own project while seeking for possible collaborations. For example, we were able to establish a partnership with National Chang"
