Figure 1. Picture of surfactin
As a proof of concept, we tried to modify the surfactin synthase by substituting aspartic acid with aspargine using oligo mediated recombineering.
Experimental design
Surfactin (Figure 1) is a surfactant cyclic lipopeptide produced by Bacillus subtilis. It is important for sporulation in B. subtilis [1]. The cyclic peptide of surfactin is produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS). antiSMASH prediction of adenylation domain specificity corresponds to surfactant. The NRPS modules are divided out on three contigs (ctg1_353-5) with 3, 3, and 1 module, respectively (Figure 1).
The second module (or module 5) of surfactin synthetase is responsible for incorporation of aspartic acid. Using the Stachelhaus code the fewest changes on nucleotide level that would lead to a change in amino acid is Asp->Asn. Three different oligos with either a change or no change in wobble position of the Stachelhaus code and with different length were designed (Table 1), yielding different number of mismatches in the oligo.

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

Regulation of pyocin S5
To regulate the secretion of pyocin S5, we may develop a BioBrick based on a pathway designed by Saeidi et al. (45). They designed a synthetic genetic circuit for E. coli to sense P. aeruginosa , produce pyocin S5 and to lyse E. coli for the release of pyocin. Detection of P. aeruginosa is based on acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), autoinducers uniquely produced by specific gram-negative strains. The lasR transcriptional factor regulated by a constitutive promotor binds AHL 3OC12HSL to form an activator complex for the PluxR promotors regulating pyocin S5 production and the production of cell lysis protein E7. Once the threshold concentration for E7 is reached, E. coli is lysed, releasing the accumulated pyocin into the extracellular environment. This inhibits P. aeruginosa . Thanks to our secretion tag, we will not need the cell lysis part of the circuit. Instead, we could also equip our secretion system HlyB/D with a PluxR promotor (figure 7).
Figure 7. A quorum sensing-regulated pyocin secretion circuit adapted from the circuit developed by Saedi et al. (45). Upon detection of AHL 3OC12 HSL specifically produced by P. aeruginosa , lasR form an activator complex with 3OC12 HSL. It activates the PluxR promotor which ensures the production of pyocin S5. Subsequently, pyocin S5 is secreted by E. coli’s Type I secretion system (through the HlyB/D complex) and inhibits P. aeruginosa .
Kill switch
To further improve the biosafety of Gelcatraz, we considered the use of a kill switch. If bacterial leakage happens despite the adhesin system, the kill switch will ensure that any escaped bacteria die. This will prevent the dispersion of modified DNA. The dispersion of modified DNA is not desirable, since it can have unpredictable consequences on its own or after mutation several generations later (47–50).
After reviewing several kill switch systems by the group"

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"VR. G: guanine, C: cytosine, A: adenine, T: thymine.
To exclude the possibility of a bias towards specific amino acids within the library, clones of the transformation efficiency plates were picked randomly for sequencing. The nucleotide and corresponding amino acid sequence are represented in Figure 14A. No clones were picked twice and only two deletions/frameshifts were identified. On the basis of these data the sequencing alignment was done. Figure 14B supports the good quality of the generated library showing the DNA sequence and amino acid diversity. The sequence alignment also reflects the well-targeted mutations as conserved nucleotides are resembled according to their letter size. As shown in Figure 12D, the used mutation primers incorporated NNK at desired positions, whereby N stands for any possible nucleotide and K for guanine or thymine. All introduced nucleotides ‘N’ show at least three diverse nucleotides, whereas all introduced nucleotides ‘K’ showed the expected pattern. The diversity of the nucleotides is reflected in the translated amino acid sequence.
To sum up, our J23100_TAR_QC library is unbiased, well targeted and of good quality.
Chapter III: Reading the Library
Fig. 15: Animation of the combined results of the three focus groups
Based on the knowledge of the well characterized J23100_TAR_QC library, we assumed to have constructed novel chemoreceptors. Due to the modification of the binding site these should be capable of recognizing new chemical substances. Therefore, we performed library selection assays using seven different chemicals. We expected E. coli to perform chemotaxis towards these chemicals as illustrated in Figure 15.
Figure 16: Novel chemoreceptors recognize different tested chemicals. The designed Tar_QC library was transformed into BL21 cells and then tested on swimming agar plates with seven different interesting chemicals. After three rounds of selection of the fastest swimming E. colis towards these, three clones per chemical were picked. Sequencing results identified two novel chemoreceptors that were found for different chemicals: the novel receptor with amino acid sequence LTAQPD…SSAVP (red boxes) was identified for swimming towards D-aspartate, 2-ethyl-hexanol and sodium cyclamate and the novel receptor with amino acid residues PPAQPP…PSAVT (orange boxes) was identified for swimming towards L-aspartate and caffeine. The green boxes show different identified receptors. The receptor colored in yellow are structural similar to the orange boxes.

Event summary
On September the 7th, 2015 we organized the KU Leuven iGEM 2015 Symposium on Synthetic Biology, Cell Systems and Ethics in Biochemistry. Hosted guests included 4 neighbouring iGEM teams, academic staff, students, sponsors, and iGEM supporters from 6 different European countries. During this full-day event, the participants had a chance to attend the lectures by home speakers as well as by invited international keynote speakers from both the academia and the industry. The iGEM teams presented their research, and probably the most awaited part - the debate on ethics in biochemistry with panel of well selected experts lead by an experienced professional moderator - took place in the afternoon. To fulfil all the needs, goodie-bags, drinks, lunch, and dinner were provided to our guests. The day finished with a sightseeing walk around Leuven centre. Participation was free of charge. We hosted almost a hundred guests and received a very positive feedback.

Home speaker Vera van Noort talked about lessons from systems biology of a                 minimal organism for synthetic biology. In the EMBL, where she worked, they                 wanted to completely describe one organism, namely Mycoplasma                 pneumoniae. For complete understanding, three different levels were studied:
The metabolism, transcription (regulation) and protein complexes. The take-home                 messages for synthetic biology in short: transcription regulation is more than                 operons and transcription factors; enzymes can catalyse multiple reactions and                 are organized in multi-subunit complexes; proteins can be part of multiple                 complexes and can be regulated by post-translational modifications and small                 peptides are essential.

Introduction. Motivations & Aims
This project and entire iGEM process has given us such wonderful experiences in the classroom and laboratory. As high school students we have gained an incredible amount of appreciation for how lucky we are to have these opportunities through the afterschool BioBuilder club. It is the second year of BioBuilder at our school and thus, it comes as no surprise that still most of our school community do not know what exactly our club does. Nor have many come to realize that we are becoming part of a global scientific community. All of us in the club are just beginners to the synthetic biology field. In fact most, if not all of us, had never heard of this exciting new field before lst year.
During our learning and exploration, our team generally found the concepts of defining problems, designing solutions, and being autonomous quite challenging, especially in a life science context. Our BioBuilder coach has also taught many of us in honors or AP biology, and we often chatted about how the skill set and demands required for success in regular core classes can at times be quite different. Our instructor expressed his frustration sometimes that some core curriculum are not reflecting real STEM industries and careers, and instead are instead too exam focused and on recall. He wished that he could incorporate more engineering and design tasks and assessments into his core biology courses ala BioBuilder.
Together we saw an opportunity to develop an educational engagement program designed to help the iGEM foundation with one of their key commitments: “to help promote synthetic biology education”. Our program aims to achieve this at the base level - with the biologists, engineers and policy makers of the future in secondary school classrooms. We wanted to create student made lesson plans and guides that any educator teaching a core biology class could implement when appropriate into their curriculum. We hoped that both teachers and students will become more aware of synthetic biology and also begin to develop the skills necessary for the continued advancement of the field.
Approach
Our first point of action in this program was to use the concept of BioBuilder to learn about how to approach creating biodesign and engineering lessons. We learned from an earlier publication by the creators of BioBuilder, what were their educational philosophy surrounding it, and what was their motivation for its development. Kuldell"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#model features_-_-_TEXT.html," inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.
Figure 1: The Chain-Node Model of a E.coli cell
Example of a species: pLacI*:LacI4 and its tree structure of binding.
Here is another example of template species with more complicated structure.(see Figure 2) In biology, LacI tetramer (or LacI4) can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription"

Seeing everyone’s projects and how they managed to progress gave us an overall idea of what was left to do and where we should put more efforts. We also got the chance to participate in discussions about bioethics.
European Meetup in Munich
On the 21st and 22nd of July, we attended the European Meetup in Munich.
The different talks were highly interesting and we had the chance to ask Katrin Lang, one of the speaker, for advice about the unnatural amino acid part of our platform. The poster session was a great opportunity to practice the presentation of our project to the other teams. The feedback and tips we received from the other teams were very helpful to improve our poster for the oncoming events. This meetup was also a good opportunity to talk about collaborations and to get to know each other by spending time with the other teams.
Postcard Project
We took part in Duesseldorf ’s project to exchange postcards about synthetic biology. We decided to use a photo of our city, Toulouse, on the front and a world map on the back with Toulouse marked by a dog’s paw as a reminder of our mascot Cerberus.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," used the syringe pump to make four layers of the bio-ink, with cells containing RFP on the bottom and layers of cells containing GFP, RFP and GFP, respectively, on top of that.  This sample was imaged with a spinning disk microscope at 488 nm and 561 nm, for the excitation of respectively GFP and RFP (Figure 27).
Figure 27. Spatial distribution in z-direction of cells expressing GFP (green) and RFP (red). Layers of hydrogel containing GFP (layer 2 & 4) or RFP (1 & 3) cells were created on a plasma-cleaned coverslip.  The first and third layer do indeed contain RFP cells (1.2 & 3.2), while not containing GFP cells (1.1 & 3.1). The second and fourth layer contain GFP cells (2.1 & 4.1), while not containing RFP cells (2.2 & 4.2). Reduced visibility of layer 3 and 4 is due to increased distance from objective, which results in a higher background signal. Imaging was performed using spinning disk confocal microscope with a 100x objective. Images were captured by excitation at 488 nm for GFP and 561 nm for RFP, both at an intensity of 9.7% and using an exposure time of respectively 200-ms and 50-ms.
As can be seen in figure 27, the first layer does contain red cells (1.2), but does not contain green cells (1.1). The same holds for layer three (3.1 & 3.2). Layer two and four both contain green cells (2.1 & 4.1), while they both do not contain red cells (2.2 & 4.2). The visibility of the cells in layer three and four is reduced due to their increased distance from objective, which results in a higher background signal. This spatial distribution of the cells proves that we can make distinct layers of cells.
3D-stack
We proved that we are able to make distinct layers of cells, but we did not know yet whether there was a mixture of the different cells at the interface between two layers, or whether they are clearly separated. Also we did not know yet how thick the layers were. To test this, we made a new sample with two layers and took images with the spinning disk microscope in 74 planes over a distance of 146 μm at the same two wavelengths. Of these planes, 34 were used to make a 3D stack of"

Activity tests of TTHL under a constitutive promoter did reveal TTHL laccases capable of oxidizing ABTS. Fractions 1 to 5 of the purification above were rebuffered with deionized H2O and incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2 for 2 hours. Activity measurements were performed using 140 µL sample, 0.1 mM ABTS and 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) to a final volume of 200 µL. The change in optical density at 420 nm was detected, reporting the oxidization of ABTS through laccases. Fractions 1 to 5 show activity (Figure 6). Fraction 2 seems to contain most of TTHL showing the highest activity compared to the other fractions: 40 % of the used ABTS has been oxidized after 2 hours. Based on these results protein concentrations have to be determined and the activity of the TTHL laccase can be characterized in further experiments including pH optimum and activity in regard of temperature shifts.
Figure 6: Activity test of TTHL fractions resulting from the purification. Reaction setup includes 140 µL fraction sample (CuCl2 incubated), 0.1 mM ABTS and 100 mM sodium actetate buffer (pH 5) to a final volume of 200 µL. Measurements were done at 25 °C and over a time period of 5 hours. TTHL shows activity in oxidizing ABTS except fractions 1 seems to have no active TTHL . (n=4)
Since Regionals: Initial activity tests of purified fractions
The purificated fractions of the cultivation after the Regional Jamborees in Amsterdam were tested concerning their protein concentration . After re-buffering the protein concentration was determined again and all fraction were incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2. For the initial activity test the protein amount was adjusted for comparison. The fractions were measured in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 5 with 0.1 mM ABTS. Fraction 50 % 1 showed the highest activity (Fig. 7). Regarding the protein amount of this fraction and the statement, that 90 % of this are TTHL laccase, fraction 50 % 1 contains 4,03 µg mL-1. To ensure enough protein for further experiments, the second best fraction, which is fraction 5 % 3"
Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#app scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," is nevertheless a partial list. More bacteria should be targeted, and with a much wider range of phage. Phage diversity can be achieved with conventional methods for screening of phage from natural locations such as sewage. Although these isolated phages can be utilized without genetic modification, endotoxin release by lytic phages may pose a problem. The removal of lysis genes and addition of exogenous genes to confer lethality would prove most effective.
Engineering Phage
Engineering a more potent bacteriophage involves two main components.
1. Selecting a bacteriophage platform into which exogenous genes can be inserted
Non-lytic phage, although they do not kill bacteria as aggressively or propagate after infection, would be preferable since endotoxin release would be minimalized and they would not mutate and replicate uncontrollably. However, lytic phage can be adapted to function like a non-replicating strain if their holin and/or endolysin genes are knocked out. Various non-lytic phages which can be readily modified to include exogenous genes are:
-   Pf3 (P. aeruginosa)
-   M13 (E. coli)
-   P954 (S. aureus, created by removing endolysin gene)
2. Identifying exogenous genes which confer lethality or increased antibiotic sensitivity to bacteria
-   Endonucleases that cleave bacterial chromosomal DNA (BglII in PA01)
-   Expressing lethal genes gef and chpBK via M13 phage (E. coli)
-   Expression of lexA3 gene to prevent the repair of DNA damaged induced by antibiotics
-   Introducing a CRISPR system to cleave/degrade specific regions of the bacterial genome
-   Using small regulatory RNAs to silence antibiotic-resistance genes or genes necessary for cell survival
Specific bacterial strains and their complementary phage may require significant modifications, but the basic workflow can be accomplished with standard microbiology techniques. Although working with an established phage platform can be easier, greater phage diversity will be generated by isolating bacteriophage from the environment. This is typically done by centrifuging sewage samples and then growing the supernatant in LB broth containing the bacteria strain of interest. After a sufficient incubation time, the cells are centrifuged and the supernatant is filtered. This filtrate is then grown on an agar plate with the same bacteria of interest to observe plaque formation. From areas of plaque clearing or preventative bacterial growth, the desired phage are isolated.  The endolysin and holin genes"

It seems that the difference volume required for utilizing same amount of CO2 is disadvantage of E. coli carbon utilization system. At this situation, we have to look into the design of the different bioreactor. For microalgae culture, it requires a large surface area to increase light intensity. As usual, the height of the  microalgae culture pond cannot exceed 0.5 m. In other words, we have to build a 7 m diameter culture pond with the volume of 19000L. In constrast, engineered E. coli is not limited by light. The bioreactor of E. coli can be built with any height in the indoor or outdoor. To scale up the bioreactor, a 5.8 m diameted with 1.9 m height equals to 51000 L which has lower floor area required.
As a result,the bioreactor of engineered E. coli can save more than 30% floor area compared with micoralgae culture pond. Take the floor area of Taiwan as an example, we can build 94 billions of microalgae culture pond to uilize 10% of annual emission with 12 operation hours. However, 1 over 3 of floor area will be save if we replace them with E. coli bioreactor. E. coli bioreactor is more flexible on spacing using, and is less sensitive to weather effect.
Cost
The most expensive source in the medium of our engineered E. coli is xylose.                                          1 mole of xylose will capture 0.17 mole"

The Problem
Think of petrochemicals as specific chemical compounds, which can be manufactured from oil, natural gas, coal or other sources. The majority of petrochemicals, however, is derived from oil or natural gas [1] .
These chemicals are mainly used for the production of plastic, digital devices, clothes and tires [2] . According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), petrochemicals will be the largest driver of oil demand in the future [3] . But with all the oil extraction come high environmental costs. The extraction of natural gas on land can be done via hydraulic fracking methods. Fracking is a highly used method, in which rock is split up with pressurized liquids. Since the fracturing of the rock is not controllable, cracks might reach up to the ground water and contaminate it [4] . This results in not only harming the people living in these areas, but also the local ecosystems. Since the demand for petrochemicals produced from cheap oil or natural gas increases, there is a significant increase in the construction of petrochemical factories. Even during the production of petrochemicals, these factories emit massive amounts of greenhouse gases. In comparison, a coal plant running at full capacity twenty-four hours, seven days a week will release about 4.6 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, while a petrochemical factory in Louisiana, USA, emits 9 million tons of greenhouse gases per year [5] . All this pollution of the atmosphere leads to smog and acid rain. Additionally, the greenhouse gases warm up the earth, melting the polar caps and thereby raise water levels. The rise of the water level then endangers oil refineries, which are built at a certain level above the water"

Sheffield,2016,Team:Sheffield#project#device#microfluids_-_-_TEXT.html," of liquid from the middle channel can only be initiated when the blood sample flows past it.
Figure 4. Diagram of the mixing idea 1 containing a capillary stop valve. Surface tension holds the blue liquid in place like a valve until the red liquid flows past, pulling the blue liquid into the main channel where they mix.
This design allows the stock solution to be contained in a chamber prior to a blood sample being taken. The length of the main channel between the middle chamber and the end chamber can be specified so that the binding of siderophores to lipocalin would have reached equilibrium by the time the solution reaches the end chamber. A potential pitfall of this design is that the surface tension is inadequate to contain the stock solution.
Design 2: The Well Idea
The second design consists of two layers of PDMS (figure 5). The bottom layer has a well holding the stock solution (blue). The middle well needs to be filled to the brim but should not flow into the channels when the top layer is placed on it. This can be done by calculating the volume that the well can hold prior to adding the stock solution. The blood sample (here shown in yellow) will flow across the well, mix with the blue solution and flow out of the well as the mixed green solution.
This design is harder to manufacture, as two layers of PDMS have to be made and aligned with each other and this often incorporates considerable amount of human error and poor reproducibility. It has also not been seen in literature before, thus the effectiveness of this design is unknown. The advantage to this design is that it is a simple idea that does not depend on the quality of the manufactured PDMS, unlike capillary stop valves (design 1). The timing could also be easily controlled by varying the lengths of the channels.
Figure 5. Diagram of how mixing design 2 should work. The yellow fluid flows over the bottom well and mixes with the blue fluid contained there before flowing to the end chamber.
Design 3: The Mixing Chamber Idea
The third design consists of a large mixing chamber where the two fluids will spread out over a larger area and thus flow over a longer distance, which would give them a higher chance of mixing. A longer distance to flow over also means we can extend the time for which the reagents are in contact, further promoting adequate mixing. The final channel is deliberately made to be long so that if the fluids are not mixed by the time they enter the final channel, they could mix via diffusion within the smaller width of the channel. When the fluid flows from the mixing chamber to the"

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 20% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Nickel Affinity Chromatography. 20% SDS PAGE of Tn5 (expected size 53.3kDa) Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 whole lysate, lane 3 clarified lysate, lane 4 cell debris, lane 5 not bound lysate, lane 6  flow through, lane 7 wash, lane 8 elution 1, lane 9 elution 2, lane 10 elution 3, lane 11 elution 4, lane 12 elution 5, lane 13 elution 6.
The nickel chromatography was not completely successful, but there is some purification of Tn5. The Tn5 did not completely bind to the nickel resin and was observed in the flowthrough and wash (lane 5-7). It is recommended to further optimize the nickel chromatography to further reduce losses, and reduce contaminating proteins due to non-specific binding to the nickel resin (lane 8-10). However for our purposes, the losses were tolerated. Elution fractions 1 to 3 were pooled (lane 8-10).

Goals
The goal of this project is to produce various mutants of a 3-dimensional protein fusion capable of self-assembling into a tetrahedral cage structure (PDB: 3VDX). These variants will have thrombin protease sites (LVPRGS) introduced in selected locations, allowing for dissociation of the cage structure upon thrombin treatment. Ultimately, we aim to develop a controllable system allowing for both drug-loading and release using the protein cage scaffold.
Achievements
We used Pymol software to model our protein cage and determine where to insert out thrombin cut site mutation.
Using the design restriction listed below, we narrowed down 13 possible locations for the insert
We successfully cloned and expressed one of our mutant cages and our wild type cage.
We ran dynamic light scattering on both but did not see correct size cage formation.
Design
Following is a list of our insertion sites. Sites marked with asterisks are preferred sites. Sites were selected by examining the DSSP secondary structure to ensure minimal disruption of existing alpha-helices or beta sheets, ensuring sites were sandwiched by glycine residues, and using PyMOL to check if the site would be accessible to the protease. Top candidates are based on two main criteria:
1.  Geometric accessibility by protease
2.  Speculated extent of conformational changes by insertion (minimum preferred)

Our project is designed concerning about detection and early warning of radiation dosage so that we can acquire information for its feasibility and market recognition. We had a questionnaire survey to ensure the feasibility, and took some interviews with some professionals. Those provided us with great useful suggestions. After that, we had interschool communications and freshman teach-in to let others know more about our project and our team, and we got useful feedback which improved our project at the same time.
We devised one questionnaire and received 240 feedbacks in total including 35 people working with radiation and 205 not. Here are the statistical results and analyze to questions.
According to survey result, we can see that there is widespread exist of radiation in working and living environment of interviewees, most of whom feel uncomfortable with it. However, when the interviewees were asked if they would buy monitoring instrument willingly, merely 6.3% of non-radioactive practitioners would buy definitely and 58% if necessary. Among radioactive practitioners, 40% agreed.  Based on the statistics result, we believe that primarily our project aims to radioactive practitioners. During the project investigation, we also got interviewees’ opinions and attitudes towards synthetic biology. From result, most people once ever heard of it or even remained unknown with it. Despite this, almost all of them agreed that much more public promotion ought to be advocated for citizens’ understanding and that we should use synthetic biology to benefit human beings. Nevertheless, most interviewees held worries about the security of synthetic biology. During the questionnaire investigation, we had prepared souvenirs printed with our team logo for interviewees and introduced our project and the booklet of iGEM, eager to their enthusiasm towards our project and iGEM Competition.
After questionnaire investigation, we conducted exclusive interviews with radioactive practitioners particularly including staff in Radiation Monitoring Department in Datong Nanjiao Environmental Protection Bureau, doctor of Radiology Department in Datong No.4 Renmin hospital and engineer in Lianyungang Tianwan Nuclear Power Station.
We received many great ideas and suggestions from professionals we interviewed. In the meantime,"

Our Edutainment Products
The most fantastic thing is that we created a series of edutainment products such as Gene Card Online, Crazy Lab (a MOBA game), Plasmid Rubik and E.mocoli (online emoticon) to bring more fun in education. What we created was not only an edutainment product, but also a carrier of iGEM and synthetic biology which output influence no matter where it is. It can be applied in most situation such as classes, entertainment, activities, or even in our daily communication.
Many teams were amazed at our innovative idea. We are also invited as the only team in CCiC (the largest iGEM Conference in China) to share our experience in Human Practices these years.
Gene Card online
Gene Card Online is an online board game developed by Team UESTC-China, realizing the organic combination of synthetic biology and board game. The most basic elements of synthetic biology are clearly delivered to people with the combination of restriction enzyme, DNA ligase, vector, target gene, bacteria and PCR. People can easily understand what synthetic biology is in the process of enjoying the game.
Considering many limitations of paper board games, we decided to put them on the Internet this year to further realize the goal of promoting the development of the project. Nowadays, any place with access to the Internet can use Gene Card Online at any time for various purposes, such as teaching, popular science and entertainment.
Gene Card still seems to have a bright future. Click here to see more in our Software Tool

Circuit Board Manufactoring Process. The circuit board was manufactured by Beta LAYOUT GmbH. The process involves the following steps: (A) The holes and cavities are drilled into the 0.062 inch thick base material. After intensive cleaning, a photosensitive dry resist layer is laminated evenly onto the surfaces under extreme temperatures and pressure. By using an individually manufactured photoplot, the areas that shall remain free of copper are exposed to UV light. (B) Afterwards, nonexposed parts of the resist layer are removed through development in a 1 % sodium carbonate solution. Now, the areas free of resist layer are coated with approximately 35 μm of copper, overlayed by a thin tin film. The residual photoresist is stripped away with a 2.5 % potassium hydroxide solution. In the following etching step, excess copper is removed by applying ammonia solution. Afterwards, the tin that protected the copper layer is removed with a nitric acid based tin‑stripper. (C)  Finally, a green solder mask is applied and developed through light exposure. It covers and protects most of the PCB except for solder pads and vials. These are covered with protective tin by a process called Hot Air Leveling (HAL) at 270 ℃ and 5 bar and immersion in liquid tin.
For the subsequent assembly of the PCB with the surface mounted components, we decided for reflow soldering. Nevertheless, if a reflow oven is not available, the design is suitable for soldering by hand too. First, a thin layer of solder paste is applied onto the solder spots on the PCB. For this purpose, stencils were used that are supplied by most PCB manufacturers. Stencils are thin metal sheets with cut-outs at the positions were solder shall be applied, ensuring that the perfect amount of solder is used. Afterwards, the components are placed on the solder paste with tweezers. The viscosity of the paste holds the components in place until they are soldered inside the reflow oven. For soldering, a two-stepped program sequence was used, consisting of a 70 s preheat step at 210 ℃ followed by 40 s at approximately 300 ℃.
Solder paste is applied to the PCB using a metal stencil.
SMD components are placed on the solder paste.
Exact positioning of ICs is controlled with a magnifier lens.

*NorR = NorR binding site, Pol= RNA polymerase factor sigma 54 binding site, esabox= EsaR binding site
Lactate-based AND gate
The lactate and NO AND gate was designed to demonstrate the potential multiplexing power of our circuit. Unlike AHL, which is quorum sensing molecule, lactate is an intermediate metabolite of microbial metabolism. To detect lactate, we used the LldR repressor. In the absence of lactate LldR binds to the two LldR-binding sites and represses the transcription through looping of the DNA between the two binding sites. To get a promoter with an AND gate logic, we placed a pNorV promoter between the two LldR binding sites.

BBa_K2116027
Promoter displays an AND gate logic. The induction rate is 1.5.
Model
In order to match the experiments, we modelled independantly The EsaR interaction system, and the NorR systems. This way we could easily tuned the two facets of the AND Gate sensor module so that it matches the system sensing requirements. Later on, we combined those two independant modules together to model the complete AND Gate behavior.
PnorV is a looping promoter, which allows NorR to come in contact with the RNA polymerase. Transcription is initiated     once NO binds and NorR is active. [3] The initial results showed that the AND gate was repressed by EsaR, but could not     be fully induced. Our first hypothesis was that looping prevents EsaR from unbinding. However, further analysis of the EsaR system alone tend to show that two species $DEsaR_{AHL}$ and $AHL$ compete to disable/enable the promoter for transcription. Thus the system dose response does not display a monotonal behavior. On the contrary, the rate of freed promoter srongly depends on the $DEsaR_{AHL}$ / $AHL$ ratio, and displays an unexpected not so repressive behavior"

The Precellys® 24 homogenizer by peqlab
The Precellys® 24 is an effective and efficient sample homogenisation to enable effective DNA, RNA or protein extraction. To disrup tumor tissues, hair, cartilages, bones, plant materials, yeasts, bacterium and fungi the samples are loaded in beads containing 2 ml tubes. The tubes can be supplied with steel, ceramic or glass beads. The homogenization effect takes place during a 3-dimensional figure of eight motion. This lead to strong acceleration of the used beads. The forces between the beads and the collisions induce the disruption of cell or the homogenisation of samples.
The first cell disruptions ot the iGEM-team Bielefeld were made by this system.

At the beginning we transfected HEK293T cells with different TC/PC ratio. We used VEGF-STEP as an example. We controlled the final concentration of TC and PC respectively and changed it of the other chain (Figure 3). Cells were transfected 12 h after seeding and VEGF was added 24 h later. Photos were taken 24 h later under 561 nm exciting light.
Figure 3. Transcription ratio test. (a) Relative fluorescence intensity at different PC concentration. Relative fluorescence intensity is evaluated by grey level measurement of ImageJ. The dynamic range increases as TC/PC ratio rises, while the gene expression drops after 14.  (b) Relative fluorescence intensity at different TC concentration. It seems not to have a significant difference from 8 – 16.
Total Quantity
From the results above we could conclude that TC/PC = 12 is a relatively ideal ratio. So we chose this ratio for the following experiments.  Our model also confirmed the results and suggested that better dynamic range may be achieved by reducing the total quantity of plasmids. Thus we changed the total quantity, and obtained best effect at 0.75 fold of the original quantity (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Relative fluorescence intensity at different transfection quantity. The 1.00 indicates the original quantity of 3 μg/ml TC and 0.25 μg/ml PC. . The best dynamic range is found in 0.75-fold, presenting a 4.90-fold of reporter expression level.
To conclude the results of the overall VEGF test in HEK293T, the best transfection ratio is around 12, and the best quantity of plasmids encoding the two chains is around 2.44 μg per ml.
Further Results
We then use HEK293T cells to examine our D-Dimer-STEP (Figure 5a). It’s quite surprising that this system has extremely low background noise (data not shown), and reached a 3.17-fold dynamic range at the TC/PC ratio of 12. This results suggests that D-Dimer-scFv may has a better characteristics for STEP system than VEGF-scFv, and we plan to quantify related features of them and further examine their influence to the quality of the whole system.
Apart from tests in HEK293T cells, we also tested the TC/PC = 12 ratio in HeLa cells, but didn’t get expected outcome (Figure 5b). This means that transfection ratios and quantities must be measured and modelled separately"

A synthetic multicellular system for programmed pattern formation
The article discusses about pattern formation which is a typical characteristic of both single and multicellular organism. Pattern formation involves cell-cell communication and intracellular signal processing.  In the article the authors have showed a multicellular system in which genetically engineered ‘receiver’ cells respond to AHL (acyl-homoserine lactone) chemical stimulus which is sent by the ‘sender’ cells and form ring-like patters. The pattern that forms accounts to the ‘band-detect’ gene network which the receiver cells have, that respond to specific AHL concentration. By having a reporter gene which produces a fluorescent protein on induction, a lawn of receiver cells around a sender colony can give rise to bullseye pattern. Depending on the location of the sender colony different patterns can be formed as per the article. Such experiment is done to improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring developmental processes.
The multicellular system was constructed with the principle that the receivers at intermediate distances only express the fluorescent protein. This is explained with Figure 1 (a). This kind of band detection is achieved by having a high detection component (pHD plasmid) and a low detection component (pLD plasmid) in the engineered construct of receiver cells (Figure 1(c), (d)).

(a) Band detect receiver cells are engineered to respond only to intermediate concentrations of AHL as shown by the graph where the concentration differs with distance from sender cell.  (b) Sender cell- plasmid map (c) pHD plasmid (d) pLD plasmid  (figure adapted from Basu S et. al . 2005)
Cell-Cell communication from the sender cell is triggered by the expression of LuxI enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of AHL. The AHL which is thus synthesized diffuses through the cell membrane and gives rise to a chemical gradient around the sender colony. AHL in the receiver"

Low to little DNA after gel extraction so we plan to use AE blue from our cryostock next week to run a PCR again in hopes that the low yield is a result of the AE blue culture having sat incubating too long
Monday, 7/18

Ran PCR of AE Blue from cryostock. Running it from the cryostock will hopefully increase yield of vector in gel so that we can perform a gel extraction on that

Ran a gel on AE blue PCR product and also on 5 samples of colony PCR we created last week from DNA 2.0 Gibsoned product. The 5 samples we ran from the Gibson product were:

Looking at the gel, the AE blue bands were too faint to perform a gel extraction on and means a step is going wrong either in out PCR, with our primers, or taking directly from the cryostock to run a PCR. We are going to mini prep from the cryostock and then run the PCR and gel again to see if this solves the issue of the cryostock now working directly in a PCR and to see if this is the issue with our gel

Strut extrusion is disfavoured by the surface of the petri dish. It rather sticks to the nozzle than the plastic, thus it slides over the print surface instead of sticking to it. Extrusion on a paper tissue improved this, thus follow up experiments will be conducted on agar plated petri dishes.

The hydrogel did not dissolve in 0.1M NaCl over the weekend. To discover the reasons for this, the literature should be checked again. 0.1M sodium citrate could actually be up to 0.3M in Na+ concentration.

Experiment: dissolving hydrogel by sodium citrate (2% (w/v)). In the ratio 500 µl alginate and 500 µl CaCl2 (0.1 M), hydrogel formation occurs within seconds.
To the formed hydrogel, 500 µl Na3C6H5O7 was added in order to dissolve the hydrogel. The following observations were done:
1. There was no direct response in the first few minutes;
2. Even after a vortex period of 2 minutes, the hydrogel was still untouched;
3. Even at 09/07 it was still untouched.
09/07/2015
Since Na3C6H5 was sufficient to dissolve the hydrogel, another strategy has been tried. In this setup, we tried to dissolve the hydrogel by LB medium. Two different conditions were chosen:
1. 250 µl alginate, 250 µl CaCl2 (0.1M) and 250 µl LB;
2. 250 µl alginate, 250 µl CaCl2 (0.1M) and 1 mL sodium citrate.
First both the alginate and CaCl2 were added, then it was quickly vortexed. After hydrogel formation, the LB or sodium citrate was added. Both did not have a direct effect.

Given that Zhang et al., 2017 reported some kind of toxicity resulting from the N-terminal sequence of PtNTT2, we first investigated if we could also observe the same toxicity associated with the N-terminal sequence. We also tested whether our own versions of the transporter result in better growth and reduced toxicity compared to the native transporter. Therefore, after cloning the plasmids in E. coli DH5α and verifying the correct assembly via sequencing, all plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The presence of the correct plasmids was again verified by colony PCR.   The first cultivations were carried out in shake flasks in LB media. A total cultivation volume of 50 mL was used. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 180 rpm. All cultures were inoculated with an OD600 of 0.01. OD600 was measured every hour during lag and stationary phase and every 30 minutes during the exponential phase. The optical density was measured using an Eppendorf Photometer and standard cuvettes. E. coli BL21(DE3) without a plasmid and E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were used as negative controls. Two biological replicates of each strain were tested and three technical replicates were measured for each timepoint.

E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2, not expressing PtNTT2, were used as negative controls.

A clear difference in the growth rates can be observed, with E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-TAT-SP-PtNTT2 showing the weakest growth.

Vana Vani Matriculation school
To expand the synthetic biology community, we believed it’s necessary to create interest in the fundamental stage itself. We went to a school in our locality and interacted with our fellow student community in 12th grade. They all had their major as biology but still they were overwhelmed to know that they can engineer life!
We started with the very basic of DNA, as a source of information written in the language of cells which has only four letters and went to central dogma with proteins as meaning of the words created by those letters. Several analogies made by us like ‘RNA as a  photocopy of a particular page in a book’ made them understand well about the concepts. After this we went on to restriction enzymes which cut at palindromic sequences.
We made a simple activity to make them understand a palindromic sequence. A set of letters were given (say ‘AGACTT’) and the teams were asked to come up with as many palindromic sequences as they can with those letters. Many teams came up with many answers but actually one found out that it is just a simple math! With this we made sure that they understood the basics of complementary base pairing and reverse complementary matching in palindromic sequences.
Atlast the students were told what synthetic biologists are capable of and were asked to come up with some fun applications. We found our future IGEMers as their answers really amused us like glowing roadside trees, toxin detection using fluorescence and many more!

OVERVIEW
HKUST iGEM understands the risk of working in the lab and intends to take all necessary measurements and precautions to prioritize the safety of our iGEM members. Following this matter, we have assigned the following procedures below.
LABORATORY SAFETY CONCERN
Our project uses SYBR Safe and Midori Green as our gel electrophoresis stain. However, we utilizes the same gel imaging machine with gels from the other lab that uses Ethidium bromide, which is a very harmful carcinogenic chemical. We use blue light for gel visualization. Our project also involves media culture with antibiotics that can be lethal in large amount. For sterilization, we use ethanol 70% that can be dangerous in large doses in the long term.
SAFETY PROTOCOL
During the wet lab, all lab members were instructed to always wear disposable nitrile gloves, closed-toe shoes, long pants, use eyes protection under the blue light gel visualization. Gloves are disposed each time we finished the lab. The glasses used in the experiments must be washed everyday after use. All the biohazard waste is autoclaved and transported to another facility which is responsible for regulating the biological wastes. Hand soap with antibacterial protection is provided to wash our hand thoroughly. Each module has one person in charge to better ensure the safety.
Our laboratories in HKUST are compatible for biosafety level 2. Our lab is equipped with biosafety cabinet with HEPA filter, first aid kit, fire extinguisher, flame-retardant benches, spill kits, safety showers and eye-washer. Our wet lab experiments are all performed under the supervision of our supervisor, Dr. Jessica Tang. At the same time, all of our reagents and materials are kept in a safe container with specific sign and precautions to handle. Each tube is labeled and sealed off before putting it together with other reagents. We put our media culture in a different refrigerator from the regular substance to prevent any unwanted reagents from contamination. We always maintained a clean workplace and tidied up after use.

Each of the 24 subunits forming ferritin can be fused proteins of interest, such that when the nanoparticle assembles, proteins surround the ferritin sphere (Kim et al., 2011). We used this in the FerriTALE to allow variation of the number of detector TALEs per ferritin reporter, enabling us to modulate sensitivity of the system. To improve flexibility of the type and composition of proteins which can be attached to ferritin, we introduced a system of complementary coiled-coils onto ferritin ( BBa_K1189012 , BBa_K1189013 , BBa_K1189018 ). This makes our ferritin a platform since other teams can manufacture intricate protein nanoparticles by fusing their own proteins of interest to our coils (Figure 4). We are excited by how future teams might customize ferritin by interchanging different proteins and enzymes from the Parts Registry.
Figure 4. Using the E and K coils in combination with ferritin as a scaffold system allows the creation of brand new FerriTALEs or protein scaffolds.
Additionally, these coils dimerize with high affinity and specificity and can be repurposed for affinity purification, capture systems, and development of self-assembling biomaterials (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008).

The next day, we spun down 500μl of each culture, resuspended in 1ml PBS buffer, and took OD600 measurements to calculate the relative cell density of each culture. For the fluorescence measurements, we used a Typhoon FLA 9500 with the samples in a 96-well plate. Each of the 16 samples were pipetted into 3 wells with 300μl each. The settings on the Typhoon were: 1) excitation laser at 532nm and emission filter above 575nm and 2) excitation laser at 473nm and emission filter above 575nm. Both were across the whole 96-well plate, but the second lower excitation wavelength was included in case the first was too high to excite the KillerOrange protein.
Results
For each of the wells, a fluorescence value in arbitrary units (au) was calculated using ImageQuant software, where we set the 3 wells of PBS only blanks as 0% fluorescence, and the well with the highest value as 100% to convert au into percentage. Next, we normalised for any natural fluorescence in the cells by subtracting the average of the “cells only” wells (DH5α, and DH5α.Z1, both with and without IPTG) from all wells, and then corrected for the difference in cell density between samples by dividing the normalised fluorescence measurements by the OD600 values. For each sample, the average across the 3 wells was plotted on a graph:
These data indicate that there is no difference in fluorescence between either KillerRed or KillerOrange and the cells only control either with or without induction with IPTG. There could be several reasons for this, including the light was not intense enough to excite the fluorescent proteins, however no fluorescence from this type of the test with a laser for excitation would be unlikely.  It is also possible that no protein is being produced, which could be due to insufficient IPTG. However, the RFP in BBa_J04450 under the control of the lac-repressible promoter BBa_R0010 clearly shows that in the DH5α.Z1 strain, there is less fluorescence without IPTG, than with IPTG. While this does show that 1mM IPTG is sufficient to induce"

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Harry Gandhi, founder at Medella Health
Our team wanted to get more information on the challenges of the diagnostic space. To do this, we got in touch with Harry Gandhi, a founder of Medella Health, a startup that sells glucose sensors and is expanding into other spaces. Because of his background in the diagnostics space, we thought it would be a good opportunity to understand the some of the challenges associated with developing a wetlab technology given real world constraints. Our conversation with Harry primarily centered around the challenges of using hypermethylation as a clinical variable . He was intrigued by our choice and explained that one reason not a lot of people are focusing on it is that unlike most clinical variables which are binary, hypermethylation is on a continuum, meaning that everyone has it . Thus, our methodology would have to also have heightened diagnostic ability, which would be even more of a challenge for us compared to traditional liquid biopsy tools. He also gave us further insight on sensor design and some of the key pivot points to be aware of.
Takeaway:
Our team was determined that using synthetic biology, we would be able to address many of the challenges that Harry had brought up. Our baseline genetic circuit centered around engineering a protein that would be able to detect the methylation somehow and then attach a fluorescent reporter gene that could give a quantitative signal that could be captured and analyzed. After some literature research, we decided to use the methyl-binding-domain protein (MBD) and for that, we decided to play around with different variants until settling on a murine variant for our circuit.
Amogha Tadimety, pHD student at Thayer School of Engineering
After designing our baseline circuit and fleshing out some of our wetlab plans, we had a second discussion with Amogha. She helped validate our planned circuit methodology . Because she has extensive knowledge about liquid biopsy applications in a clinical setting as well in point-of-care devices, we asked her about what to consider for the different use cases. Our initial instinct was that we wanted to implement this as a point-of-care device because we believed that is where it would have its greatest impact, but she explained that it would be better to first focus on a workflow for a clinical methodology that met clinicians’ needs before moving on to the next use case. She re-emphasized that we should focus on the sensitivity and the specificity because administering it in point-of-care would inevitably have lower accuracy to lack of high-quality instrumentation. She suggested that we have try strategies for implementation that would allow for sample DNA amplification or increased sensitivity.
Takeaway:
As a result, we engineered a second genetic circuit that"

""Bio-Lab Rescue"": game promotion
In many people's eyes, synthetic biology is mysterious and hard to understand. We hope to change this situation. We think synthetic biology is also funny and easy to get close to ordinary people — if we integrate the principle of synbio into online games.
In the summer, our team designed and developed a game "" Bio-Lab Rescue "". We hope to spread synthetic biology in a funny way. And we promoted the game around our university, and posted its URL on social medias.
Figure 22.Bio-Lab Rescue Game
Obviously many students were attracted by the game. They were very excited and gave much advice to us about improving the game experience. When we asked the players if they realized the topic we wanted to tell them, a player said yes and described what he learned from our game, which encouraged us a lot. However, he is the minority who can understand the game. We should think more about the combination of knowledge and entertainment, and how to spread synthetic biology.
Mini lectures for freshmen & high school students
We held several mini lectures for freshmen and high school students. In these lectures, we introduced our project this year -- S-Din, as well as principles of synthetic biology. We received their remarks to our project. From communication with them, we found some previous defect of S-Din, and their views help us think more about the project and improve it.

""Synbio Summit"" with people from different fields
What would happen if people from different fields get together to talk about synthetic biology? We decided to have a try -- to hold ""Synbio Summit"".
We invited guests majoring in sociology, computer science, environmental science, law and so on. At the beginnning of the summit, we introduced the basic concepts of synthetic biology, and express our previous thinking about what synbio will affect other fields. Participants were the first time to learn about synthetic biology, but they gave their opinions to us, including phrase, puzzles and worries after they realized what synbio may do with everyone's life.
For 1.5 hours, we talked about lots of topics around synthetic biology, including safety,"

The early meetings
To get acquainted with iGEM and previous projects that were done by other Universities, we all looked at different subjects.
April 7th, 2009
Orr
Bologna 2008 - Ecoli.PROM: an Erasable and Programmable Genetic Memory with E. coli
The Bologna team created here a genetic memory for E.coli that would switch between two states as a response to a certain signal (a UVc signal would inhibit Lex A (an inhibitor of LacI), thus allowing the production of LacI, whereas an IPTG signal would inhibit LacI and allow the production of TetR).
Cambridge 2008 - iBrain: Foundations for an Artificial Nervous System using Self-Organizing Electrical Patterning
In this project, the Cambridge team decided to do three simultaneous sub-projects: one involved the creation of an artificial neurological system for E.coli (using potassium channels to transfer the ion and thus allow for a gradient of the ions), the second involved generating Turing patterns in order to integrate two signalling systems into Bacillus subtilis, and the third part involved generating standardized tools and techniques for B. subtilis. We learned from this project an important lesson: quality is definitely more important than quantity, and there is no point of doing many simultaneous experiments if we cannot finish any one of them properly.
KULeuven 2008 - Dr. Coli, the bacterial drug delivery system
In this project, the KU Leuven team presented the idea of using E.coli as a transporter of medication in such a way that it would be targeted at a specific location. Furthermore, the E.coli would react to the presence of foreign organisms and would express certain proteins to destroy them, followed by it's self destruction after the area would be completely cured. It is important to emphasise that the project was not intended to produce a specific medication to a specific disease, but merely as a way to show that the general concept of curing a disease in a direct manner is possible.

Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," discussed the fundamental guidelines and foundations of ethics in scientific experiments.  The lecture was mainly focused on plagiarism- its definition, its use with or without the intent to deceive, the amount of previous knowledge that people enter college/grad school with, and its consequences.  We also had a conversation about ownership, and it was just a very odd concept to me that upon submitting an article to a journal, the journal now owns those words and you cannot re-use your own words without asking for permission.  Overall, this was quite an interesting workshop-- all throughout elementary school and middle school I’ve heard “Don’t plagiarize!  Or else…” but I’ve never had a very full understanding of what fits into that definition and the possible repercussions.  It was definitely a useful time.
We then had a large, collaborative brainstorming and sharing session with Romie and Anja.  Both the Wellesley-side and The Tech-side shared our available resources-- we introduced them to the educational tools and technology we have in the HCI lab, and they shared the current and future exhibits that they are working on as well as the technology that are available alongside those exhibits.  It was very exciting to see what The Tech is working on and the educational concepts that they want to teach, and there were definitely moments where they shared hopeful ideas (such as representing bacterial growth and development) and I thought, “We can definitely program that!”  I’m glad that we had the first two weeks to tinker around and further understand Cornerstone.
Tonight, we’ve all been assigned to find possible biobricks that can be applied in our project from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Finding these biobricks requires going through previous iGEM projects which is absolutely fascinating-- I’m so amazed at the incredible creativity and scientific ability of some of the teams!  Looking forward to returning to the lab tomorrow to share my findings and hear about what others discovered.
6/16/2015: Day 12
This morning we all shared the individual research we had done last evening and took inventory of all of the biobricks we had discovered.  Afterwards, we continued to brainstorm and flesh out possible ideas. We finalized Mars, Deep Sea (Cave), and Antarctica as locations for our users to explore, and then moved on to brainstorm possible storylines and discuss what expectations the users approach the exhibit with.  I am learning that there are so many other things to consider and discuss outside of just the software/back-end-- we’re doing so much more than just coding, which I’m glad about- I love this design and brainstorming bit and I"

Pathogenicity screens of FCP2-01 and more complete evaluation of antibiotic resistance
Review genomes of Enterobacter ludwigii for insights into plasmid stability and other factors affecting biotechnology potential
Field trials of FCP2-01 (if the strain is cleared as safe) to test persistence and physiological effects in real-world applications
Project Achievements
Successful Results
Isolation and screening of endophytic bacterial isolates provided a diversity of strains and for synthetic biology experimentation.
A transformation protocol was developed for a endophytic bacteria, which provides a chassis for affecting plant physiology without engineering the plant
Reinfection and persistence were observed in a distantly related grass 51.6 ± 7.9 (SD) million years since divergence (Vicentini et al. 2008). FCP2-01 is capable of stably expressing a fusion protein of acdS and GFP for at least 4 weeks in the plant.
Modeling
Unsuccessful results
Most transformations did not work. We were unable to transform and express any of our vectors in Pseudomonas spp. Attempts at transformation via conjugation were also unsuccessful.
Due to timeline disruptions by unviable seeds, we were unable to evaluate the effect of engineered FCP2-01 on plant growth
None of our engineered strain could grow with ACC as the only available nitrogen source. It is possible that the attachment of a GFP tag (used for identifying transformed colonies and visualizing bacteria in and on roots) disrupted the quaternary structure of the ACC deaminase"

BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#Model#GPCRpathway_-_-_TEXT.html," can simulate the growth of yeast in some certain condition. And we considered activated cell as effective bio-meter in our project.
Combination Model coupling single cell and yeast growth
Based on the above results, we combined these two models together to simulate the performance of whole system in population level. We multiplied the value of Yeastactive and the value of RFPmature directly.
And we altered some parameters to fit the experimental data.
The result of this combined model was shown below (Fig. 18).
Fig. 18 The simulation result of RFP intensity in population level.
Discussion
Combining two models, we discovered that the RFP intensity is almost the same as base line (value is 0) at the beginning. And after 15 hours, the fluorescence intensity were reflected from single cell level to population level.  because the cells entered into stationary phase.
As for the curve after 22 hours, the RFP intensity starts to decrease slowly in all ligand concentration. It may due to the death of cells.
We decided to select the RFP intensity at 22 hours as the final output value of sweetness signal based on our model. In order to avoid the cell growth impacts the RFP intensity, we selected this specific moment as the sampling time.
SWEETENESS MODEL
Purpose
We expected to set a model based on our above model to simulate the RFP intensity of sweetener. Make a comparison between the results of simulation and practical measurement, Our system could not only work like people gustatory sensation system with universality but also is more accurate and less interference than people.
Method
Although we finished the GPCR model, the combination rate between the sweetener and receptor had not reported or measured yet. So we needed to measure this data from wet lab.
But because of the instability of our system, we only got a useful group of data. More discussion was established in Project Page. The result was shown (Table 6). Then we utilized these values to optimize our pheromone model.
Table 6． The result of sweetness measurement using Sugar Hunter at 16 hours
Group Name
RFP intensity/ unit
2%  Sucrose

Analyzing previous methods of sweetness measurement, we made two assumptions for this sweetness model:
1. Sweetness of all sweeteners could be transformed into the different concentration of standard sucrose (10% dissolving in water) with the same sweetness.
2. The bind between different ligands and GPCR will not impact signal transduction in pheromone pathway.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Biobricks_-_-_TEXT.html," protein is exposed on the entire outer surface of the capsid, so this protein is an ideal candidate to be fused to a cellular internalization protein.
The D protein is organized as a trimer. Each monomer is distant of 5,1nm in a trimer. The crystal structure of the protein D, as a trimeric form, shows that the Nter and Cter ends, are exposed at the capsid surface, and are very closed from each other. The Nter and Cter ends are exposed at the mature capsid surface, which allows the choice for the location of the fusion protein (Nter or Cter). However, several studies have showed that the fusion to the Cter end, allows better results. So the D protein can be used to perform a fusion protein. The internalization protein, called polypeptide III, is issued of the adenovirus penton base. It can be used to design a recombinant Lambda phage able to infect eukaryotic cells. This sequence comes from the Lambda phage genomic DNA. It has been amplified by PCR and introduced into a plasmid which comes from the registry. We have some problem to find the best primers annealing temperature. And we performed a lot of trial to introduce it into a plasmid.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,".  That it is about 200 bp different from expected indicates either an unexpected PCR product or that the vector map we are using to predict its length is incorrect.
Took all yeast transformations out of incubator.  Although the cells are rather dense, it is possible to find at least one or two decently isolated colonies on each one.  Noticed significant contamination on the transformation for pRS304* + pRS306.  Decided to take a colony from the opposite side of the plate and streak it out onto a fresh plate, just in case this might work.  However, it will probably be necessary to re-do this transformation.  For the others, we'll make glycerol stocks next week, possibly in conjunction with testing.

Control Module
Lac promoter is known to be a leaky promoter. It means that there will be a transcription even though lactose is absent. To increase the control-ability of our construct, we add LacI module. We differentiate the strength of additional LacI production (none, weak, medium, or strong) using constitutive promoters with different strength.

Outcomes
1. Acquiring the CAT-Seq enzyme
In order to choose the enzyme to prove the concept of CAT-Seq method, a library of various hydrolyzing enzymes were expressed using In vitro transcription and translation kit. The newly synthesized proteins were mixed with substrate nucleotide of our choice - N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate. This type of substrate nucleotide shows a strong absorbance at 310 nm due to the benzene ring conjugating with the pyrimidine ring of cytosine. The removal (hydrolysis) of the substrate from the nucleotide abolishes this absorbance making it convenient for tracking catalysis and kinetics of enzymes. Fig. 1 shows the kinetics of 16 different hydrolase family enzymes as a decay of substrate absorbance intensity at 310 nm. As seen from these results some of the enzymes show no affinity to this type of enzyme, some of them catalyse a minor. Based on the speed of catalysis the RM537 (The CAT-Seq esterase) was chosen.
Figure 1. The hydrolase library screening results. The larger absorbance signified the removal of the substrate cytidine modifications. The chosen esterase for CAT-Seq is colored green (CAT-Seq Esterase).
Kinetic characterization of CAT-Seq Esterase
After the biomolecule of interest for Substrate Nucleotide Catalytic conversion was chosen, we termed it CAT-Seq esterase. This enzyme will be used to prove the workflow concepts of CAT-Seq.

4.2 Approach
To model all the observations, we will use the Gompertz function[10], which can be expressed in the following way:       $$f(t) = ae^{-be^{-ct}}$$      with:       $$b, c >0$$      The reason for using this model is that it best describes the lag phase, the exponential phase and stationary phase.
4.3 Results
The observations were given to us in OD600. We know that for bacterial cell cultures OD600 of 1.0 = 8.0 × 108cells/ml [6].
For the first set of observations we fit the curve to our data.
Figure 12: Fitted data
with the following parameters:
General model:          ans(x) = a*exp(-b*exp(-c*x))          Coefficients (with 95% confidence bounds):            a =   3.876e+08  (2.782e+08, 4.97e+08)            b =       18.97  (-22.7, 60.64)            c =      0.4938  (0.1035, 0.884)
For the second set of observations, we fit the same model. However, we obtain different parameters, since we enter the stationary phase after the exponential phase, which we did not observe in the first data set. But we also notice that they fall into the 95% confidence interval for the parameters of the first observations. Hence we can assume, with some certainty, that the parameters we got for this curve fitting process would also fit for the previous one.
Figure 13: Fitted data
The parameters are as follows:
General model:          ans(x) = a*exp(-b*exp(-c*x))          Coefficients (with 95% confidence bounds):            a =   5.707e+08  (5.355e+08, 6.059e+08)            b =       5.127  (3.785, 6.469)            c =      0.1989  (0.1603, 0.2376)
5. Discussion and Future Directions
Based on the results of our differential bioreactor model we postulate that a bioreactor of this design could perform at appropriately small time-scales with a sufficiently optimized flotation construct in a bioremediation context. This bodes well for future laboratory endeavours where the bioreactor schema along with an engineered cell-line optimized for flotation from gas"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"
