ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#Biofilm_-_-_TEXT.html," Dots (QDs) to bind with the histidine in Histags on our biofilm and thus characterize its formation. The whole linkage is performed by forming firm coordinate bonds. They could be applied to quick detection of biofilm expression of His-tagged proteins with naked eye under UV light owing to the photoluminescence of QDs, and accurate concentration measurement under fluorescence spectrum (A detailed protocol for repeatable measurements is included in our Wikipage).
PLAN 1
Construction of CsgA-Histag
CsgA-HisTag is a part from the previous year IGEM competition. It is documented by team TU_Delft with the Part ID BBa_K1583003 . However, its status not released. Luckily, we obtained the sequence from Allen Chen at Harvard. The two shared the same amino acid sequence, with some difference in the DNA sequence, possibly modified due to the PARTS Standards. We used the Histags on the CsgA-Histag mutant as the binding site of CdS nanorods, meanwhile, we applied methods described previously to characterize CsgA.
Characterization
1. Congo Red:Successful biofilm secretion and expression
The series of Congo Red assay are aim to visualize the expression of biofilms. To produce curli, we spread the CsgA-Histag mutant E.coli onto a low-nutrition culture medium, YESCA- CR plates[1] (Details in protocol:Biofilm Part ) Red staining indicates amyloid production.
Fig 3. Congo red assay of CsgA-Histag on YESCA plates
The figures shown above point out that the CsgA-Histag mutant induced by 0.25 µg/ml of aTc produced amyloid structures which are dyed red by CR in comparison to the negative control after 72h culture at 30?. This assay indicates the success in expression of the self-assembly curli fibers.
2. Crystal Violet Assay:quantification test of biofilms
Further, we use crystal violet assay to simply obtain quantitative information about the relative density of cells and biofilms adhering to multi-wells cluster dishes. As illustrated in pictures, CsgA-Histag mutant distinguishes itself in absorbance after applying standard crystal violet staining procedures (See protocol:Biofilm Part ) in comparison to strain ?CsgA and 30% acetic acid negative control. There’s certain amount of background absorption of strain ?CsgA because the dye can stain the remaining E.coli adhering to the well. This difference between induced strains secreted CsgA"

Tec-Monterrey_EKAM,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Modular_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence microscopy, using specialized software (ImageJ) for an objective appraisal of the images. The results here presented reveal the successful implementation of the promoters in the system and the functionality of this product of gene expression. Further characterization includes the detailed study of the effect of inducer concentration in the medium over time.  We are aware of the characteristics of GFP that make it a non-ideal reporter chromophore. The availability of molecular oxygen in its surroundings is a source of variability in its fluorescent activity. Also, the correct folding of the protein takes a certain amount of time and also depends on the medium’s conditions, inserting noise into the results. However, GFP provides an easy way to track gene expression in simpler systems. The data to be collected on promoter strength is purely relative and specific for its setup, providing a general baseline for their usefulness on other projects.  The availability of inducible promoters for a biosystem is useful when a tight grip on expression of the genes of interest is desired. Applying the modular biofatory design strategy, they come extremely handy if the purpose is for each module to be expressed at different times. It would be possible to construct a mathematical model quantifying the effect of each of the separate modules using distinct promoters for each group of genes associated to a specific function of the genetic construct.

Valencia_UPV,2018,Team:Valencia UPV#Integrated Human_-_-_TEXT.html,"Where will Printeria have a great impact?
Yturralde recommends the US to launch such innovative projects. The fact is that it is not without reason, as in Spain there have been many television media and laboratories that have ignored us, for example TVE (Spanish Television) or A3 (Antena tres) which are very important TV channels in our country. Therefore, if we continue with the project after iGEM, we will direct all our efforts abroad, it is decided!
Printeria, the near future
When we asked him about improvements of printeria, he said: "" It is not what is missing is what is going to come"". He encoraged us to continue with Printeria because we will be the start of a new and revolutionary way of expression.

Ryan Fobel is CEO of Sci-Bots located in Toronto (Canada). He has a PhD in medical biophysics.
We e-mailed Ryan to get in contact with a company that actually does Digital Microfluidics. We learned a lot from the variables involved into this technology. Our final design was heavily influenced by our conversation via Skype with him. We even got the chance of  using some of the Digital Microfluidics Chips that Sci-Bots uses for their machine.
Highlights of design changes:
Pad distance: It is really important that pads have the shortest distance between them as possible. On our early tests we used around 6 mils of separation between pads. He really advised us to use 4 mils pad separation, and this was implemented on the final PCB for the experimentation surface.
Surface coating: This is the hardest part to get right. We learned that currently is better to reapply the coating everytime we do a reaction on the surface. To solve this we got inspired on the design by OpenDrop of using disposable surfaces that are held on top of the PCB. We used that concept on the final design of our machine.

Ana Pastor and Miriam are two Spanish artists from Alicante, who are really interested in combining science and art in their artwork pieces. Ana creates her pieces of art by using her own blood, either lyophilized or even painting with it, while Miriam is working with urban vegetation.  So, what will they think about Printeria? Will they find Printeria useful?

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Off targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," is lacking. As such, it is possible that experimental work proves Cas13a to have increased off-target activity. We investigated what the effect of this would be on the reliability of the system, and subsequently propose methods to experimentally reduce the off-target probability.
We repeated the simulation for a higher energy gain for matches ($\Delta C=0.30$) and lower energy penalty for mismatches ($\Delta I=0.80$). In this situation, we find the off-target probability to be much higher than in our original simulations: $P_{FP}$ is 10 to 800 (Figure 7). It is now more intuitive to interpret $P_{FP}$ as the total number of false positives per true positive. Given a positive output, the probability of it being false is higher than 90% in all simulations. This situation would greatly compromise the reliability of the detection system, so we set out to investigate possible solutions.
Figure 7: Number of false positive outputs (per true positive) for crRNA 1 to 4 on the genomes of four organisms. $P_{FP}$, now more intuitively interpreted as the total number of false positives per true positive, or relative signal strength, for crRNA 1-4 for the E. coli, S. aureus and S. epidermis genome and the Bos Taurus chromosome 27 ($\Delta C=0.30$,$\Delta I=0.85$). The large values indicate a false positive probability higher than 90% in all simulations (given a positive output).
In our simulations, we assume equal representation of all genomic sequences. In reality, only part of the sequences are transcribed and available in RNA, and of course in different quantities. We can correct for these effects by applying a mask over the genome which takes into account the amount of RNA transcripts for each position. Moreover, our simple sample preparation method for gene amplification (RPA) and in vitro transcription are able to specifically amplify a region of interest at least 452 times ( notebook of sample prep 15-08-2017). This amplification changes the ratio between true and false positive output probabilities (by the same factor of 452) in favour of on-targeting (Figure 8). We can incorporate this amplification factor in a generalized version of $P_{FP}$: $P_{FP}'$ and we call the amplification factor α:
$$ P_{FP}\textrm{'} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{\alpha \Sigma_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\Sigma_{off}\"

SCUT-China_A,2016,Team:SCUT-China A#Model#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to multiple the proportion of enzymes, then we have:
The graghs above show that when multiple enzyme B and enzyme C respectively, the productive rate of HBP and the consumption rate of DBT almost stay the same. But regarding the quantity of the intermediate, with more expression of enzyme DszB, the reaction becomes more stable.
We can get a linear inequality equation based on the level of importance of three enzymes: DszB>DszC>DszA.
Under real conditions, we could regulate the intensity of the promoters in order to regulate the enzymes’ proportion.
3. Water-Oil Ratio Model
The process of fermentation is shown as below:
3.1 Theories
Recently, the studies found that the number of DBP and HBP stored in the cytoplasm is determined by the cytoplasm and the distribution coefficient of oil phase and water phase. We managed to derive the best proportion of water and oil in the reactor to optimize our system.
We collected information and listed the distribution coefficient of DBT and HBP in different phrases by searching the literature:
3.2 Related parameters
Distribution coefficient refers to the proportion of the components in two phrases, in the condition of equilibrium and certain temperature.
3.3 Modeling
Hypotheses:
1).The volume percentage of the cell constantly maintains at 3%.
2).The stirring rate is fast enough to approach the chemical equilibrium and materials transfer balance at a fairly quick speed.
Construction:
In order to meet the actual need of making the remaining DBT least while maximizing the product HBP in oil phase, we establish the following models in order to eliminate the remaining DBT in the oil and preserve the HBP as much as possible:
In the initial state, the amount of DBT is a constant:
In the final state, the amount of HBP becomes a constant:
Assume that the volume is 1, then:
Substitute the known quantity into the equation, we get:
Which are equal to:
According to the actual demands, we define:
Which are:
Substitute the known quantity:
We can derive: xH2O≤0.08818349 or xH2O≥0.470590405
Because we can not calculate a result to satisfy both two optimal solutions, we take aonther new evaluation method.
Definition:
M1 represents the level of importance of DBP: 
M2 represents the level of importance of HBP: 
Because the toxicity of organic solvent has direct impact on the living of bacteria, then:
M is a parameter that has a positive correlation with the optimization of the whole system"
WLC-Milwaukee,2016,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," in chemistry. This is my second year on the team and this year I had the opportunity to be one of the lab leaders. This involved coordinating lab schedules for the team and working with our instructors to determine which experiments needed to be performed and the direction that the team would likely take with the project. I was also one of the team members who presented at the Biotechnology Info Night. I also had the privilege of working as one of the lab instructors for the 2016 Summer Bioengineering Camp which involved teaching labs to the high schoolers in attendance as well as modifying labs if needed. It was certainly the most exciting part of this year’s activities! In my free time I enjoy Netflix, the occasional video game, rousing games of ping pong against Troy, and sharing time with friends and family.
Anna Curtis
I am Anna Curtis and I am a senior biology major, this past year has been my first involved with iGEM. My role in the team has been largely in assisting with lab work, researching, and helping with the bioengineering summer camp. My favorite part about being a member of the group is getting more experience performing lab protocols and working in the research field. Other involvements of mine at WLC are running for the Cross Country team, competing in Track and Field, and singing in the Concert and Chamber choirs. When not consuming mass amounts of caffeine, I enjoy reading, listening to music, and video games.
Melissa Helmer
My name is Melissa Helmer and I am currently a Junior at WLC majoring in Biology with an emphasis in Health Science and an intended minor in Chemistry. I come from a small country town just north of Madison WI, called DeForest. This year has been my first year on the iGEM team, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. All the members make you feel welcomed and help you out when you need extra explanation on a concept. Once I graduate my goal is to become a Cyto-Technician and work either in a medical lab or doing research. Outside of iGEM and school I have a job as a horseback riding instructor, and also compete in show jumping as well.
Ching-Tzu Yu
I am Ching-Tzu Yu (Jeanie) and currently a junior biology major at Wisconsin Lutheran College. My plan is to apply to graduate school after graduating from WLC. Outside of iGEM, I did a project on visualization of osteogenesis in developing embryo of fish and have recently interned in a research lab back in Taiwan over the summer of 2016 where I worked on a project to explore the potential substrate stiffness"

  Biodesign
    Our second project, Biodesign, is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for both iPhone and iPad. Biodesign is based on previous iGEM software named Tinkercell and was elaborately improved to adapt to mobile platform. It provides hundreds of biobrick icons as well as lots of fancy functions including dragging graphics, drawing curves and automatically connecting figures with corresponding arrows. With Biosearch, users can draw biochemical reaction schematics anywhere they want and share their drawings with friends. Biodesign will be available online very soon!

Fig 1. The concentration of Hg-bound dimers can be ‘diluted’ by Hg-free dimers. Because both of them can bind to PmerT promoter but only Hg-bound dimer activates the transcription, the activation effect of MerR is therefore determined by the concentration of Hg (II), the binding affinity to PmerT (namely the sequence of MerR binding site) and the concentration of Hg-free MerR dimer (or the total concentration of MerR).
The model shown in Fig 1 indicates that the apo-merR and Hg-bound merR have a competition. Because both of them can bind to promoter but only Hg-bound dimer are capable of transcription activation, the regulation role of MerR is therefore determined by the concentration of Hg (II), the binding affinity to PmerT (namely the sequence of MerR binding site) and the expression intensity of MerR. We speculate that except manipulation at the dyad sequence of PmerT, the threshold of MerR response can be also manipulated by controlling the concentration of MerR in cytosol.
As with the bacteria in natural environment, the concentration of MerR is stabilized at a certain level. In order to verify the speculation, promoters from partsregistry constitutive promoter library with different strength were prefixed before BBa_B0034+MerR coding sequence to exogenously maintain MerR expression at different intensity (Fig 2). Tthe sensitivity of PmerT under different MerR concentrations can be denoted by mercury threshold concentration at which reporter (GFP) expression emerges. Furthermore, we used pSB1A2 and pSB3K3 as backbones because of their different copy numbers which could also result in different MerR expression intensity (Fig 3), which was confirmed by an additional experiment.
Fig 2. The construction of the system used for MerR operation characterization. Promoters from the partsregistry with different intensities were selected, leading to varying MerR concentrations. The transcription of PmerT is controlled by the percentage of Hg-bound MerR dimer, thus the expression of GFP can reflex the concentration of Hg (II).
Fig 3. The strategy of backbones swiching. We used pSB3K3, a low-copy number backbone, and pSB1A2, high-copy, to differ the expression of merR.

We attempted transformation by incorporating the suggestions made by Dr. Schryvers. Instead of diluting the overnight culture directly with xylose, we diluted it with LB media that was also shaken overnight. This was followed by adding xylose to make a final xylose concentration of 1%. Unfortunately, we did not get transformation despite repeated trials. We returned to our old method of diluting the overnight culture with a stock solution of 2% xylose. However, this method no longer worked. We are guessing that our cells might have been contaminated so we will try to get new cells.
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
This week we received the primers designed for the thrC sites. We tried using miniprepped thrC vector to obtain our desired PCR products which we could then use to transform ''B. subtilis''. Our first few tries were unsuccessful. Our team advisor suggested diluting the miniprepped sample since too much template can interfere with PCR. We tried a 1 in 100 dilution and it worked!
Week 18: August 25 - August 29
Dr. Wong was kind enough to provide us with a fresh batch of supercompetent B. subtilis cells. Initially, we were still having trouble transforming the cells since the starting absorbance was not high enough, but we figured out that this was due to the LB being contaminated. For the first set of transformations, although colonies that grew on the plain agar plates were clear while colonies that grew on spectinomycin plates were red suggesting successful transformation, this was not the case; the untransformed colonies grew on the spectinomycin plates, which should not have occurred. Also, these cells were red so they were somehow exposed to the thrC DNA.
The second set of transformations were also unsuccessful because not only were the colonies that grew on the plain agar plates red, but so were the untransformed colonies that grew on the plain plates. We are guessing that our pipettes might be contaminated with spores, which are highly resistant to heat and ethanol among other things (Eichenberger, 2012) .

This week we transformed B. subtilis using PCR product. Unfortunately, each trial gave us different results. For the first trial we used frozen B. subtilis cells (1% xylose, 10% glycerol). The plates did not contain"

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," device. Using this system, we aim to create an universal and standardized point-of-care diagnostic that helps anticipate and combat rising epidemics all around the world.
We use synthetic biology to create Mantis: a point-of-care diagnostic device that can detect disease antigens in blood samples. This whole-cell system can detect the pathogen, after which it emits a fluorescent signal. Below we discuss how Mantis improves upon current diagnostics. By providing a better ASSURED diagnostic, we do not only help the population by lowering casualties and economic losses, but also enable the local community to protect themselves from infectious diseases, without being dependent on the help of foreign countries or institutes.
Applications of Mantis
By developing Mantis, the Modular Antigen-based Test for Infectious diseases, we can contribute to containing and eradicating tropical infectious diseases. Mantis can be applied in all endemic situations. We focus on the intervening role in new outbreaks of tropical infectious diseases, but Mantis can be applied in alternative situations.
Surveillance of current outbreaks
Human African Trypanosomisis (HAT) is an infectious diseases caused by the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei and is transferred via the bite of the tsetse fly [9]. It is one of many neglected tropical diseases; a disease common in (sub)tropical third world countries with a lack of funding to control the epidemics [10]. HAT is, and has been, endemic in many African countries since the beginning of the 20th century. Although great efforts have been taken to contain the disease, resulting in a decline of new cases in the last decade, it was estimated that currently still over 70 million people in the sub-Saharan region in Africa are at risk of getting the disease [11]. The symptoms start with general infection symptoms, like headaches, fever and pain, but progress further to neurological disorders like a sleeping disorder, sensory disturbances and ultimately seizures, coma and death [10].
While the WHO targets HAT for elimination by 2020, there is still a great need for the development of a new, point-of-care test for both screening and surveillance [10, 12, 13, 14]. Since HAT is a neglected tropical infectious disease with a long history, we take it as a proof-of-principle for our diagnostic device to be applied to parasitic infections.
Chikungunya, or CHIKV, is an alphavirus that is transmitted via the mosquitoes of the Aedes genus. It is or has been endemic in almost all tropical parts of the world, and is slowly spreading to colder regions [15]. The"

Short Summary
For our project we used two different types of ferritin, the bacterioferritin BfBr and the human ferritin. For our purposes it was enough to only use the human ferritin heavy chain subunit which when assembled forms a ferritin cage named HuHF. We showed increased iron nanoparticle formation through BfBr overexpression and engineered HuHF to investigate stability changes in the presence of copper ions. Furthermore, we constructed HuHF mutants with the ability to form gold and silver nanoparticle.
Enhanced Stability and Reassembly of Mutant Ferritin
We chose E. coli as the host organism for producing of a stability enhanced mutant of HuHF heavy chain. Wild type ferritin consists of two different subunits, the heavy and the light chain but for simplicity reasons we only use the heavy chain which can form the ferritin cage on its own without the light chain being required.   We used DNA synthesis from IDT based on the part BBa_K1189019 which was introduced by Calgary 2013 but codon optimized the sequence for expression in E. coli resulting in the following part.
Using the synthesized sequence of the human ferritin as a template we introduced the desired mutations via primers.   We changed 4 amino acid to histidine which resulted in two new binding regions for copper in the surface area between two adjacent subunits (Figure 1) which supposedly (Wang Z. 2018) enhances binding strength between the subunits and resulted in the following part BBa_K2638601 .
Figure 1: Four amino acid changes should lead to enhanced stability after copper ions are added to the synthesized HuHF.
The second mutation we introduced was meant to weaken the ferritin cage"

   Algorithm 1 can only be applied effectivelyto chain regulatory network but, in a real situation, we may need to deal with cyclic regulatory network.
   In cyclic regulatory network, every targeted protein shown on the cyclic path is responsible for one expression of the genes so it does not have such entry in algorithm 2.
   There are three factors contributing a “negative feedback” system by the regulatory network itself, which are an equilibrium solution would exist in any set of differential equation that represents its related regulatory network; the degradation of each component; and the regulatory relationships between genes. The “negative feedback” system is a system that to maintain the expression level of various genes on an equilibrium solution by regulating the network when the concentration of targeted protein in one of the genes is higher or lower than the equilibrium solution. Based on this concept, we propose another algorithm for computing the regulation rates in a general network.

   Step 3: To make a cycle for each gene,Circuitn(n=1,...,N) , in the network. If Circuitn is regulated by Circuitm, we substitute the Circuitm’s concentration of targeted protein obtained from the former cycle into one of the following equations, (4)(6)(8)(9)(10)(11), in order to compute the regulated Circuitn’s concentration of targeted protein.
   Step 4: If the relative error of ([Protein1]k,[Protein2]k,...,[ProteinN]k) and ([Protein1]k-1,[Protein2]k-1,...,[ProteinN]k-1) is less than a fixed threshold, or the number of iterations k is greater than a set limit, then please go back to step 3. Otherwise, please continue to step 5.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Le bactériophage étant naturellement infectieux pour les organismes procaryotes, l’internalisation cellulaire et la sortie de l’endosome sont des facteurs limitant pour son utilisation au sein de modèles eucaryotes. Des études ont prouvé que la base du penton améliore de manière très significative l’internalisation cellulaire et  la sortie de l’endosome. Sans base du penton, un bactériophage perd la quasi totalité de son efficacité de transfection. C’est un élément important pour le maintien d’une bonne efficacité de transfection du vecteur cellulaire.
L’ajout de la protéine d’internalisation, le polypeptide de type III, permet au vecteur cellulaire l’internalisation et la sortie de l’endosome des cellules eucaryotes. Une fois sortie de l’endosome, le plasmide thérapeutique est libéré au sein du cytoplasme de la cellule cible et peut ainsi agir.

In order to find a solution, one must first have a problem. Some of the problems we tackled included genetically engineered machine awareness, arsenic contamination, and safety.
We are aware that the community is not familiar with the science behind iGEM. Once our device is completed, we plan to take the knowledge learned in the lab to the area's high schools. Already more awareness has spread, but there will be more awareness when our team members spread the word about iGEM.
Our team focused on creating a device that can benefit societies that have had arsenic contamination. Our device is made to be used in the real world.
From the beginning of the project up to the very end, all team members took precautions in order to protect human safety. Our project does not not raise issues on safety.

Additionally, I used the sonicator to perform protein extraction; 6 pulses of 30 seconds at 20% power. In between each pulse, the cells were chilled down in ice water for 30 seconds. I tried different power settings as the cells did not lyse well. In the end, I incubated each sample with 10 mg/mL hen egg lysozyme for 1 hour at 37 degrees Celsius. Then I repeated the sonication procedure. The sonicated samples were centrifuged and the cell-free extract was frozen in aliquots. No protease inhibitors were added, as these can be toxic to insects.
I used the protein extracts to do a toxicity test . 35 mites were collected; 5 mites were used per protein extract. Bee pupae were also gathered as a food source for the mites. Most pupae died when they were gathered, but the mites feed on dead bees and larvae as well. I had enough mites to test the following six protein extracts: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis tenebrionis, Bacillus thuringiensis tenebrionis pellet, Bacillus thuringiensis HD350 and isolates V46, V47. As a positive control, mealworms and Bacillus thuringiensis tenebrionis were used.
Initially, I tried to keep the mites in a 6-wells plate. They escaped. When the plate was sealed with parafilm, some were still able to get stuck in the parafilm. The mites and pupae were transferred to sterile microcentrifuge tubes with a hole poked in the top and wetted cotton in the bottom to maintain humidity. They were incubated at 35 degrees Celsius. All mites died after 24 hours, including the Bacillus subtilis negative control.

Abstract
An intragenic complementation approach to engineer a faster fluorescence biosensor
Our goal is to engineer a novel biosensor with a faster readout than is currently available. Many bacteria produce, secrete, and respond to chemicals called autoinducers to monitor population density and to synchronize gene expression, a process called quorum sensing. In quorum sensing based biosensors, detection of autoinducer activates transcription of a reporter gene, which must then be translated and accumulate to detectable levels, which can take two to four hours. In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused traR to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce. This new approach may drastically reduce the time necessary for future biosensors to produce detectable output.
Project Overview
Motivation
Design Considerations
Plasmids provided by Dr. Regan from Yale
We decided to first make the fusions in the plasmids provided by Dr. Lynne Regan from Yale. By choosing this method, we were able to use the provided controls in testing our part.
The pET11a plasmid is under control of T7 polymerase, so we used Bl21(DE3) E. coli cells which have an IPTG-inducible copy of the polymerase on their chromosome.
The designed fusion into pET11a was compatible with the TraR sequence, but the pMRBAD fusion was not. The pMRBAD fusion was designed to use NcoI and AatII, but TraR had two AatII sites in the coding sequence. We instead cloned TraR"

Prototyping
The prototype was build using laser cutting, 3D-printing and printed custom boards (PCB). It is controlled by an Arduino UNO R3 that was programmed using the Arduino IDE. All the files are created in the native formats of open source programs. We have used the programs listed below and recomend them, as the source files are in the respective native formats.
In addition, all these programs have great communities to help, if you get stuck.

Figure 13: First experimental set-up
Together with Docent Erik Vilain Thomsen and Associate professor Martin Dufva, we developed a first prototype. In this version, a single cuvette was stirried with a small magnetic pellet in a black measuring chamber. The light intensity was regulated manualy using a very precise geared potentiometer. The microcontroler received the voltage level from the photodiode, converted it into a 10bit number and send this via USB to the laptop which wrote the output to a file.
We learned the following:
The LED remains constant during the whole duration of the experiment, giving constant light output.
The Arduino requires an external power supply larger than 5 V  to supply stable voltages
Magnetic stirring in a cuvette is insufficient
Martin changed the container to a small glas flask which was giving sufficient stirring and demonstrated that the measuring unit was functional.                     However, the measuring cell grew even bigger. In order to reach our initial goal, we continued working on our own. We wanted to keep"

What will you do if you could reprogram cells and design there life processes?
A periodic drug delivery to precise drug release in sequential order, appropriate time?
An automatic cell factory where all biosynthetic procedures in one fermentation tank?
Cells that can survive in harsh environements by doing a series of functions their surroundings going where no cells have gone before?
Why sequential logic?
Cells are responsive to a myriad signals under most conditions and adjust their own internal mechanisms order to survive. This adjustment depends not only on processing a combination of current environmental signal inputs , but also on determining the cell’s current state, which is a result of a series of past inputs.  In digital circuit theory, this operating mode is known as sequential logic. Nowadays, a wide variety of tasks can be performed by synthetically engineered genetic circuits, mostly constructed using combinational logic. Contrast to sequential logic, it's output is a function of the present input only. It is difficult to perform functions in a specific order, which has limited the widespread implementation of such systems. The ability of sequential logic circuits to store modest amounts of information within living systems and to act upon them would enable new approaches to the study and control of biological processes . A cell can be designed to do work that is more complex if it has more states. In other words, we can reach a new dimensionality in designing synthetic life – time.
What we did
This year, the Peking iGEM team is attempting to develop a frame of biological sequential circuits that are programmable. The envisioned circuit is capable of both storing states in DNA and automatically running a series of instructions in a specific order. More specifically, the sequential logic that consists of a clock , flip flop and control unit in bacteria. The clock is an oscillator with a repeated signal cycle that is utilized like a metronome to trigger actions of sequential logic circuits. Flip-flop is a memory device that can remember a state. Paired with a clock signal, it can realize state transition. The control unit is a functional part which can convert a signal from flip-flop into complex functions. With such a design, historical events are recorded and influence current cell behavior.
This work tries to point the way toward building large computational sys-tems from modular biological parts—basic sequential computing devices in living cells—and ultimately, programming complex biological functions. Computers have thus become ""alive"". A unicellular organism itself cannot pack much computational power, but considered as a modular building block, its potential is impressive."
Vanderbilt,2014,Team:Vanderbilt#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," product. As it happens, two well established and genetically manipulable model organisms- the bacterium Escherichia coli and brewer's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae- produce moderate amounts of GPP and FPP as part of their endogenous non-mevalonate pathway (MEP) and mevalonate pathway (MEV) respectively3. All that is required for either of these organisms to begin producing terepenes is to introduce that single synthase gene.
Yeast initially was our main target for a few advantages it appeared to have as a production platform. First, the MEV pathway is found in all eukaryotes including plants and fungi, so better yield were expected by choosing it over the MEP pathway in prokaryotes4. Second, it would be possible to physically integrate our gene into one of the yeast's chromosomes by using homologous recombination. An inducible promoter could be included to further increase production. Third, as a diploid the yeast could be made homozygous for the terpene gene. We soon found out that no exiting vector had all of the features we would want. Therefore, we designed our own new plasmid vector, pVU140006, that contained a number of important features and advances over previous plasmids for this purpose. See our parts page for more information on what special features we included and their relevance to the project
Methods
Our project had several co-dependent sub-projects that, thanks to our unusual design, could all be worked on in parallel. These can roughly be divided into two categories: the first involving work on our synthase genes and the second involving the construction of a new, specially designed plasmid vector. We tried two different team structures over the year to see which would give the best results. For the Spring, we had the original idea of dividing members into independent groups, each working on a specific terpene. Each group was headed by a single group manager who would teach 4-5 new members the protocol that was to be preformed and then supervise that the work was carried out correctly. On occasion either the group managers or the organization president or wetware director would also given lessons to teach members about the techniques and theory involved at each step. All group managers were in turn trained by either the president or wetware director, whom had come up with the experiment, acquired all the necessary primers and reagents, wrote up the protocol, and had preformed it prior to any group-phase work for the purposes of troubleshooting and predicting where issues may come up.

Results of exposure to HMF show no stress reaction for the pCspA-GFP (Figure 1A) and pRpoE-GFP (Figure 1C) strains. CspA is involved in metabolism related stress and RpoE is involved in protein synthesis stress.           Because both strains did not invoke a stress reaction, there is no indication that HMF delivers stress in these pathways. However, to firmly conclude these stresses are not being experienced, more extensive testing is needed, since these           are just two promoters involved in these stress pathways.
Both the pDnaK-GFP (Figure 1B) and pSoxS-GFP strains (Figure 1D) do show some response when exposed to 0.5 μg/mL HMF. DnaK is involved in the process of chromosomal DNA replication and SoxS is involved in DNA damage repair.           Therefore, these results indicate that HMF delivers stress to bacteria by damaging their DNA and disturbing their replication process. However, the stress being experienced at these HMF concentrations seems to be low.
Figure 1. pDnaK-GFP and pSoxS-GFP show a slight stress response to HMF Four stress detecting strains were exposed to multiple concentrations of HMF. Figure 1A shows little to no response of the pCspA-strain to all 5 concentrations of HMF. Figure 1B shows a reaction of the pDnaK-strain when exposed to 0.5 μg/mL HMF. Figure 1C shows no reaction of the pRpoE-strain for all 5 HMF concentrations. Figure 1D shows a reaction of the pSoxS-strain when exposed to 0.5 μg/mL HMF.
We have shared these results with iGEM Bordeaux. Hopefully helping them further with their project, providing them with insight into the effect of HMF on bacterial cell processes. We are very thankful for this meaningful collaboration and           look forward to meeting their team again in Boston.

Synthetic Biology is too exciting - we can't keep it to ourselves. We want you to get involved!
We had a stall at the Scottish National Science and Engineering Week and participated in our University's 600th anniversary event Food For Thought. In May, we delivered a well received TEDx talk. We're also active online on Twitter and Facebook , where we hold little online debates and give you a peek into synthetic biology research!

National Science and Engineering Week exploded in Fife, Scotland with a regional ""Science Discovery Day"". Team St Andrews worked to convey the fundamental concepts of synthetic biology in new and exciting ways.
We had a number of exhibits, each catering to a different audience:
For the littlest kids, we ran an interactive ""Codon Game"", where children could ""build a gene"" from little paper parts.
We had interactive visualizations of DNA and Thermus aquaticus polymerase III, complete with 3D glasses, thanks to an impromptu collaboration with the Psychology department!
For those who like to see the things we work with, we had a display of of E. coli on plates, under a microscope and in broth. Children and adults alike were fascinated by our live experiment, extracting DNA from bananas using everyday kitchen equipment.
We took every chance to mingle with the crowd and to answer questions. The varying exhibits were helpful in starting discussions. Being able to refer to an actual colony of E. coli or the 3D structure of Taq pol III made these discussions more interesting.

Notes on experiments
The same procedure was used for both attempts at creating the construct. The first failed attempt is fairly simple to explain. During Step 4 the wrong band was chosen from the 3 which presented after running digested BBa_I732017 on the gel. This occurred due to confusion concerning the size of the BBa_I732017 insert compared to its vector - as it turns out the insert is over 1000bp longer than the vector.
The reason behind the second failed attempt is a little harder to pin down. For all the tests we ran as the procedure went on, the ligation appeared to have worked correctly. We even went on to attempt a β-galactosidase"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

NCKU_Tainan,2018,Team:NCKU Tainan#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," ton of carbon tax is NTD 100 (35 USD),                                                      which is that industrial work hard to avoid high tax. However, what is the next step?
In the downstream process, can we reuse the waste heat produced from the factory for sterilization?
That is not a big problem. The temperature of waste heat produces from factory                                                      is around 100 to 1500 and 150 degrees Celsius is suitable for our sterilization.                                                      So it is kind of a win-win situation because it do not cost extra energy or money for factory.
Taiwan does not focus on carbon sequestration,                                                  so will Taiwan use our technique? How to reduce the cost?
From the cost side, it is one thousand per gram because is not large scale                                                      but only laboratory level. How much cost can be reduced for one ton?                                                      How much cost can be reduced if we enlarge the scale?                                                      It does not cost too much reusing the industrial waste.
Now the technology renewable energy is mature,                                                      why not convert carbon dioxide into energy?
If we convert it to bio-fuel, the cost is NTD 50 (2 USD) per litter.                                                      And the price that China Petroleum Corporation (CPC) sells is NTD 30 (1 USD) per litter.                                                      Although the government will subsidize NTD 20 (1 USD),                                                      it might not be a long-term strategy. The industrial must find a way to reduce the cost itself.                                                      Besides, the edible product is more valuable than energy,                                                      but it also has higher limitation about listing.

Process
In order to obtain more information about CO2.                                          biofixation, we visited microalgae cultivation in An-nan Campus of National Cheng Kung University                                          which is a biofixation project managed by Professor Jo-Shu Chang.                                          The research fellows showed us different scale of microalgae culture system,                                          including open pond and photoreactor. We also have a discussion about the position of biofixation                                          in CO2 emission problem. They shared their experience along the way developing                                          the whole microalgae fixation system in ten years.
Suggestion and Question
Microalgae cultivation plant and our system both contribute to carbon utilization. The An-nan campus has advanced and well-developed technology. Therefore, the visit was important to us when designing the whole E. coli carbon utilization system, especially the bioreactor design. Besides, we had a discussion with each other to define the different advantages and disadvantages between different system. For example, the"

Procedure
PCR Amplification (50 ul)
To a small PCR tube (on ice) add:
enough water to fill to 50 ul (19 uL)
1 ul of template DNA
2.5 ul each of 10  uM forward and reverse primers
25 ul of PCR Master Mix
Quickly transfer PCR tubes from ice to a preheated thermocycler with the following conditions:
initial denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds
25-35 cycles: 94°C for 15-30 seconds (we did 30 sec)
45-68°C for 15-60 seconds (we did 60°C for 30 sec)
68°C for 1min/kb (we did 2 min)
final extension: 68°C for 5 min
hold: 4°C for as long as necessary
NOTE: For colony PCR just add a single colony using a pipette tip as the last thing you add to the solution instead of the template DNA. Twirl the colony into the solution in the tube and then proceed as usual
PCR Purification  We used the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit from Qiagen.
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of PCR sample and mix. Apply sample to a spin column and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 30-60 seconds.
Discard flow-through.
Place the column back into the same tube.
Wash with 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 30-60 seconds.
Discard flow-through and place the column back into the same tube.
Dry spin for an additional 1 minute at 13,000 rpm.
Place column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 uL of nuclease free water to the center of the membrane.
Let sit at room tempature for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge the column  at 13,000 rpm for one minute to elute.
Store at -20°C.

3. For the quality of wound dressings
Bacterial cellulose is well suited for wound dressings due to its good biocompatibility, high mechanical strength in wet state, good liquid and gas permeability, and inhibition of skin infections. For secondary and tertiary burns, ulcers have been successfully used as temporary substitutes for artificial skin. For the application of bacterial cellulose in medical materials, our team visited the BC factory and learned more about what conditions are required for the products of BC films used as wound dressings.

The plate was incubated at 30°C in a FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader with 200 rpm shaking in between reads, and OD600 was monitored every 15 minutes. The data obtained from each six-plicate was averaged, and error bars were constructed using the standard deviations at each time point.
Conclusions
- 1% curdlan does not appear to present any additional toxicity over the 0.5M NaOH solvent.
- Curdlan seems to be not toxic for our markers.
Results of the toxicity assay
Perspectives
This assay is a good news for us but we have to go deeper into our safety tests. A good way to do that is to test the toxicity of our curdlan on Mammal cells and test a bigger quantity of curdlan (up to 10%)
Collaboration on Policy and practices surveys
Throughout the year, we have been contacted to answer surveys and to share surveys. We answered to the best of our abilities all of the following surveys: UI-Indonesian , UCL , TEC-Monterry.

BBa_K1830003:CBD
     This year, we reduced 27bp of a registered part( BBa_K1830003 , 12bp at 5’ end and 15bp at 3’ end) and then created our new part CBM3b( BBa_K2155005 ). According to a paper published by Stéphanie Perret in 2013, Both modules(CBM3a and CBM3b) bind to phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) with the same affinity. So we use a smaller module(CBM3b) to achieve the same function in our project.
BBa_K1830004:coh1C3
     In scaffold protein, there is a linker between adjacent cohesin, and it is the linker’s length that determines the adjacent enzyme’s distance and influences the passing on of intermediates between co-located enzymes. Therefore, the linker’s length is a main influence of multi-enzyme system’s reaction efficiency. Based on a registered part( K1830004 ) submitted by iGEM15_Concordia’s, we isolated the cohesin module of this part from the linker, which makes following team could adjust linker’s length according to their requirement when they use this cohesin. We created a new part number for the cohesin module(BBa_K2155006). Besides, we applied this part in our scaffold protein( BBa_K2155012 ) with other cohesins, and proved it was functional.The details were documented in our Result Page.

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Lab#Plants_-_-_TEXT.html,"ive mutations introduced by NHEJ will change the DNA sequence enough to prevent prevent Cas9 from recognizing the site for a second attempt. In these cases, suppression of the 35S or 19S promoter using dCas9 might do more to prevent virulence that cleavage using Cas9.
gRNA Selection Criteria
To select the gRNA targets, we ran the CaMV genomic sequence through the Benchling CRISPR design tool, identifying 682 possible targets in the CaMV with NGG pam sites. To narrow down the list of targets, we considered four factors: genome position, conservation, off-targeting and efficiency.
Genome Position
The goal with many of the designs is to target a specific gene or genes and induce frameshift mutations. Previous research
suggests that any frameshifts within the first 50% of a gene should be deleterious enough to prevent it from producing a functional protein. For design I we used a 40% cutoff after looking at the functional regions of the CaMV transcripts. The targets for Designs II-IV were subset by location (correct protein for II and IV, non-coding for III) but didn't have to all be near the beginning of the gene.
Conservation
We want to target areas of the genome that are functionally important and assumed this would correspond well to areas that are conserved (i.e. unchanging) between CaMV and closely-related viruses. Targeting conserved areas should also make our gRNA targets more robust, since those areas are unlikely to contain many mutations or isomorphisms among different strains of CaMV.
Off-Targeting
Since we want to provide extra protection for Arabidopsis plants against invading viruses, a major design priority was to avoid cutting apart the Arabidopsis genome by accident. All the gRNA candidates were given off-target scores according to the algorithm employed by the MIT CRISPR design tool (though as implemented by Benchling). Screenings by Hsu et al.
showed that each position in the gRNA contributes differently to binding efficiency and this is accounted for in the off-target score. Many regions of the Arabidopsis genome are non-coding, so we also ran a BLAST result of all the off-target matches identified by Benchling. For example, we considered an off-target match in a tDNA insertion site or a putative protein to be less important than one related to a known mRNA or protein.
Efficiency
Benchling, the tool used to find candidate gRNA targets, also includes an efficiency score for how well the gRNA is expected to knock out the target"

• Engineereed a plasmid that would express the Sulfite reductase (cysI or Dsr) and Sulfide-Quinone reductase (Sqr) under a constitutive promoter. CystI and Dsr were cloned from Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Desulfovibrio Desulfuricans respectively. Sqr was obtained from Synechococcus (SP. PCC 7942). Sulfite reductase converts SO-3 to H2S and sulfide-quinone reductase convert S-2 to S.
• To test the working of the engineered bacteria for the reduction of the NOx and SOx gases we decided to design a prototype model of the reactor.
•Although we were unable to design a prototype, but we have done design calculations and made a solidworks model for the reduction of NOx and SOx from the exhaust gases.
Work plan (methodology/experimental design that we have accomplished to achieve our aim)
(a) Engineering the E.coli
● NOx removal:We tackled the nitric oxide produced during the combustion processes by using the nitrite reductase enzyme NrfA of E. coli. We engineered a plasmid that expresses the nitrite reductase enzyme NrfA under the control of a constitutive promoter so that the promoter is active independent of transcription factors, and is ""on"" by default. nrfA will be expressed in excess and will convert the NO to ammonia.
● SOx removal: Sulfur Oxides (SOx, SO2) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a serious problem now a days. Apart from producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides also cause breathing problems such as asthma, pneumonia and destroy farm crops, buildings and environment as well, causing millions in loss each year. Our plan is to genetically engineer E.coli by cloning CysI gene into E.coli and use this bacteria to remove SO2 from our environment. Also, this bacteria produces H2S, which is a substrate for Sulfide-Quinone Reductase (sqr). This H2S will get converted to Sulphur.

The wetland, slowing the speed of the passing water, can trap suspended solids in the vegetation which also accumulates pollutants by absorbing them. As these wetlands are a perfect habitat for microorganisms various degredation processes take place ridding the water from a variety of pollutants.
Figure 3: Constructed wetland plant [ EPA ]
Higher environmental standards in first world countries as well as the growing industrialization have led to a skyrocketing demand in sewage water treatment. The capacities of traditional treatment systems have shown to be ineffective and too expensive. Constructed wetlands pose a real alternative to conventional technologies as they are not only reliable and cost-effective but the most natural and environmental friendly way of cleaning water. They leave no waste behind, are self-sustaining and have no demand for artificial energy. As opposed to most other environmental measurements, constructed wetlands are very attractive for businesses as they are cheap alternatives to existing systems rather than costly additions.

Colourimetric Application
Background
        In the perverse experiments, we have developed an efficient method to detect metal ions. In order                     to make our method can be used more extensively and popularly, we plan to build up an application to                     help people who are non-professional to deal with the result of chromogenic reaction.
        So why we developed the APP of the smart phone in our project?
        1. Smart phones have been widely used in all over the world, and their ability                     of taking photos has become better and better, which is able to achieve gray scanning accurately. Therefore,                     an application helping people to use our devices can improve the convenience of our method.
        2. The gray scale of our result can been modeled to refer the concentration                     of metal ions.
Gray scanning analysis
        Each color in RGB model has a corresponding value, and each RGB value has a corresponding                     gray value which change as the color change. The darker the color is, the smaller the gray scale value                     is; The lighter the color is, the bigger the gray scale value is. The formula is
U=0.299*R+0.587*G+0.114*B
APP: Insight into metal ions
1. Choose metal element that user is going to detect. Initialize corresponding relative molecular mass, the Chinese name or the English name of the metal.
2. Take a picture of the colorimetric card, which can be taken by camera, or be obtained from the mobile album of your phone.
3. Obtain available color of the colorimetric card one by one.
4. Take a picture of the sample.
5. Obtain available color of the sample.
6. Process data. Based on data from step 3 and 5, by means of the formula, the app knows which section the color of the sample is in. So that the app works out the approximate concentration.
7. Display data. Based on the relative molecular mass and the concentration of last step, work out the concentration before dilution.

Afterwards the Golden Gate could be repeated and the isolated GG product was tranformed into 2060 electro competent cells. When recovering after the transformation, after 4 hours of incubation at 37�C a centrifugation step followed to gather the supernatant containing SP. Using the supernatant, a Plaque Assay was performed.
Modeling
A first numeric model of PredCel works without oscillations. Graphs look reasonable so far. Modelling was performed on three levels: On the lowest level one Step of Predcel monitoring Phage concentration as well as uninfected, infected and phage producing E. coli concentration Graph of level 1 Predcel model . One level above all the concentrations were tracked over 100 iterations of Predcel Graph of level 2 Predcel model . And on the third level different sets of values for starting fitness, starting phage concentration and starting E. coli concentration were tested. In this case we only monitored how long the phage titer at the end of each iteration of Predcel stayed above 1 pfu/mL and below 1e8 pfu/mL. Graph of level 3 Predcel model
At least the two higher levels probably only work in python, but maybe an interactive version of what happens during one iteration is possible. A final more comfortable version of the script was started.

Eugenie
The application was designed by Tiffany Chen, Casey Grote, Catherine Guo, Evan Segreto, and Sravanti Tekumalla with input from Consuelo Valdes, Diana Eastman, and our advisor; Orit Shaer. Members of the BU iGem team and their advisor, Traci Haddock, provided input and advice during the design process. Ernst Oberortner provided an introduction to Eugene and advice.
zTree
zTree was designed by Cassie Hoef and Daniel Worstell and was inspired by a photo representation of tree structured data from the Palo Alto Research Center. They were advised by Orit Shaer, Consuelo Valdes, and Robert Kincaid. Daniel imported the data sheets from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and Cassie designed much of the front end functionality, as well as the file IO. They were assisted by Yoav Segev, an intern.
Bac to the Future
Bac to the Future was primarily inspired by an experiment conducted by the Church Lab at Harvard Medical School, which used bacteria DNA to store encoded book citations. In addition, we drew inspiration from our participatory design session with the BU iGEM team , Robert Kincaid, and our lab experience with Professor Natalie Kuldell from MIT. The application was designed by Joanna Bi and Heather Petrow with input from Diana Eastman, Consuelo Valdes, and our advisor; Orit Shaer, and was implemented by Joanna Bi and Heather Petrow, with the help"
Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," (.79) is much higher than their share of final market businesses (.33). When including secondary products, these figures are .75 and .375, slightly closer. Clustered teams also comprise higher shares of businesses that produce goods (.75) than services (.67) and platforms (.5). When including secondary products, these figures are .78, .625, and .43, a more pronounced difference. One possible explanation for these differences would be if clustered teams had access to networks of contacts in industry (from being physically proximate to iGEM startups) that prompt them to take approaches that lead to founding businesses that create tangible goods and feed other industries.

Here we can see that while there is not much a discrepancy between the continents, the US, UK, and Canada tend to generate iGEM startups that sell to input markets, whereas Denmark and Holland generate iGEM startups that sell to final markets.
Our other taxonomy was based on how and where the company’s product is used. We chose six categories: industrial, clinical, scientific, environmental, educational, and health. Industrial means the firm has a place in the value chain of other goods and basically means the same as selling to input markets. Clinical means the product has medical applications. Scientific means the firm supports laboratory efforts or does research of its own. Environmental means it benefits the environment somehow. Educational means it can be used to educate. And health means it promotes well-being outside of conventional medicine. Three firms (Experiment.com, Benchling, Labster) are only in one category while four firms (Hyas"

Most of old minipreps were no good and the PpelA transformation failed. The Anderson promoter+T7 polymerase gel results looked good and were submitted for sequencing. Oh no, the PCR of pC13CV, pC13I and pC13L failed again--we suspect something is wrong with our reagents. Use the new dNTPs from now on!

We met at Flora Rose house to decide on an outline of the presentation and also decide a timeline.We met for the first time to discuss a preliminary outline for the presentation.  Hannah will be handling all the human practices elements, Eric will be explaining relevant biological background and strategies, and Arun will be presenting all of our characterization data (hopefully!). We made a detailed structure which will include an introduction about styrofoam pollution and ecovative. Then we will move on to a brief overview of our wetlab work. It was clear that the wetlab portion should be divided into 3 main components. The components would be fungal toolkit, carotenoid pathway, and antifungals. Finally, we will end with results, human practices, and acknowledgments to all our beautiful advisors and sponsors.

We did Q5 PCR to amplify pSB1C3 for Gibson with afp1 and Cht1_2. 3uL of PCR product was run on the gel, found to correct, and was cleaned. We ran a Gibson of pSB1C3 with both pC13CL and pC13BA. Both of these were transformed, Cht1_2 into DH5a (time constant 4.82) and afp1 into BL21 (time constant 4.84). We made glycerol stock of pC13BN. We ran a gel of pSB1C3 PCR from yesterday, which was successful, and performed a PCR clean up. We digested pSB1C3 and pC13CN with HindIII and BglII. We ligated these together to create pC13CO and transformed it into DH5a (time constant 4.82). We miniprepped pC13BN culture and did a double digest on pC13BN culture with"

Kinetic Model - The System
Figure 1 Schematic representation of our quorum sensing-based regulatory system.
The iGEM Manchester-Graz expression system is designed to regulate single and multi-gene pathways for intestinal expression. The expression system is designed in a flexible and modular manner to control a wide range of pathways. In addition, it can be used not only to regulate pathways in probiotics, but also for industrial protein expression.
The system consists of two quorum sensing (QS) systems: EsaR/I and CepR/I. The EsaR/I system is derived from the plant pathogen Pantoea stewartii [1]. In contrast to common QS-systems, EsaR/I uses a repressor rather than an activator. EsaR, the repressor, binds to its corresponding binding sites on the PesaRC promoter and represses the expression of the genes under the promoter’s control [2,3]. When a certain concentration of 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserinelactone (3OC6-HSL), produced by the EsaI-synthase, is reached, it leads to an allosteric conformational change in EsaR’s structure and inhibits its repressor function. When positioned in the -60 region of the PesaS-promoter EsaR can also work as an activator, by facilitating RNA-polymerase recruitment [2].
The second QS-System we are using, CepR/I, belongs to the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia. Similar to the LuxR/I system, CepR acts as an activator of its corresponding promoter PaidA when a certain level of octanoyl-homoserinelactone (C8-HSL), produced by CepI, is reached [4].
Our system is designed in such a way that EsaR, EsaI and CepR are constitutively expressed under"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," all over the world asked us if they could join. We were quite surprised but loved the idea of a worldwide postcard campaign. In total, 28 teams took part in the campaign. Each team designed their own postcard with an image relating to synthetic biology in general or even their own project. On the back of the postcards you could often find a little text explaining the front of the card.
As we were the ones that started and organized this campaign, all teams sent us their postcards. So in the time it took all the cards to arrive our room was transformed into a post office and we became a regular at the actual post office to collect all the little presents we received. Each time a package of postcards arrived it felt like opening a present as we were all excited about how the different postcards would look. Oftentimes there even was a little treat for us, like sweets or a letter, contained in the boxes. These really made our days.
A few teams wanted to participate but couldn’t afford printing and sending the postcards, so we offered to print their designs from our own funds so they could be a part of this campaign.
After a few weeks the time finally came when all postcards had arrived. So we transformed our room into a Christmas workshop and started packing boxes, including all the different postcards we received, and sent them to all participating teams.
Afterwards all the postcards could be shared at public events. We distributed them in the Old town of Duesseldorf and at our synthetic biology meetup in the house of the university.
We want to thank all participating teams for making this postcard campaign as great as it is. We really appreciate all of your work and are proud that all these teams joined forces to bring synthetic biology closer to the public! If you are curious what all the different postcards look like come visit our poster  in Zone 5, 268 and see all of them.

SynBio Day
The synbio community is growing fast in Germany."
Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#project#gene transfer_-_-_TEXT.html," selected for this project. Both are type II T-A systems, meaning that antitoxin protein prevents the toxin protein from functioning by binding.
Figure 1. Mode of action of the double interdependent plasmid system that prevents horizontal gene transfer between BananaGuard (green bacteria) and native bacteria in the soil (yellow bacteria). In case one of the plasmids would be transfered to soil bacteria, it would kill the recipient due to expression of one of the toxins.
Epsilon and Zeta
The Epsilon (antitoxin) and Zeta (toxin) were first found on pSM19035, a plasmid originating from Streptococcus pyogenes [3]. The T-A cassettes in plasmids such as pSM19035 have the biological function to stabilize plasmids, maintaining the plasmid in non-selective conditions. The Zeta toxin converts an essential building block of the bacterial cell wall into a form that prevents normal cell wall growth. Due to the distorted cell wall the bacterial cell becomes prone to hydrostatic pressure, leading to cell lysis with comparable effects to penicillin [4]. Epsilon antitoxin forms a complex with the Zeta toxin disabling the toxins function, with an expected ratio of 1:1 [4]. Zeta toxin has been proven to be bactericidal for gram-positive Bacillus subtillis and bacteriostatic for gram-positive E. coli [3]. Nonetheless, more recent works show that Zeta toxins are also bactericidal for E. coli [4].
Kis and Kid
Kis (antitoxin) and Kid (toxin) are part of the parD stability system of plasmid R1 acting as a pre-segregation mechanism to ensure plasmid proliferation. Kid breaks down single stranded messenger RNAs. By degradation of something as vital as messenger RNA, this toxin does not differ in function with gram positive and gram negative bacteria. In nature, Kid causes cells to divide slower to ensure that every daughter cell receives the R1 plasmid. In our system an excess of Kid will result in a bactericidal effect. Additionally, the Kis-Kid interaction has proven to be a 1:2 ratio [5, 6].
Final design and system specifications
The T-A system is intertwined with both the Kill-Switch and our host Pseudomonas putida. The toxins were designed to be part of the Kill-Switch, making use of the required balance between toxins and antitoxins. The activation of the Kill-Switch after induction and subsequent"

This is the fourth year Raul involves in iGEM, yet his second year as an advisor. Being the most experienced advisor, he contributes most of his spare time to assisting our project works despite his heavy burden from his final year project. He is very popular in the sense that we always flock to him whenever we get our results failed. Besides, He is the most noticeable person in the lab, his distinct scent of cologne always catches your nerves at the very first moment he walks in.
Name: Eric Ming Fung Cheung
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
The lab psychopath. Eric is the team leader of last year’s iGEM team and a first-time advisor this year. He would always question us on our interpretation of our lab results, regardless of if they are positive or not, but that’s just because he wants us to think critically. He may seem difficult to get along with at first due to his constant poker face. However, he does show a quirky side once in a (long) while. His advice is generally helpful and often helps add onto our knowledge. He is crazy in the way that he will only have lunch if his experiments fail, what a lab maniac!

Plasmid pong - we asked visitors to try and throw table tennis balls into plastic cups on a table to demonstrate the difficulty in bacterial transformation - underneath each cup was a fun fact about synthetic biology
Project video (see above) - this was developed as an easy, fun way to describe our project concept to people without a background in science
Product design survey - we asked museum guests to vote on their preferred probiotic administration ideas via coloured stickers corresponding to their age group
Probiotic information leaflets (see above) - these were distributed to visitors at the event and were intended to explain the science behind probiotics in a simplistic manner
We also created a display using a variety of pictures showcasing fundamental topics in biology and biochemistry such as convergent evolution, fluorescence imaging and artificial selection. Discussing these concepts with visitors was a great way to engage with the general public about a wide range of interesting scientific ideas.
New Scientist Live
In September, we teamed up with Imperial iGEM to host an exhibition at New Scientist Live at the ExCel Centre, London. In addition to explaining our individual projects, we made an educational leaflet to improve understanding about synthetic biology, including common laboratory techniques, to distribute to the general public at the event. We also conducted a survey to gauge views on the safety and necessity of different types of genetic modification: somatic cell gene therapy, genetically modified probiotics, and germline cell gene therapy. Visitors were shown a sliding scale and asked to vote on the extent to which they agreed/disagreed with these techniques for therapeutic purposes. The results of our survey, grouped by age category, are as follows:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Model expansions
3-D
All the programs we have written have been created for easy transfer from the 2-D model to a 3-D model. We have made the adjustments needed in order for it to become 3-D, unfortunately we have not had time to check it for errors and to gain some results.
A flagella row on the other wall
In our model we settled for placing bacteria on one wall. During the real-life application, flagella would most likely be placed on both walls. This is not something we have tried to implement in our model, although doing so should just be a matter of creating an extra grid and adapting the existing model to this. If this was done, it would improve the usability of the model.
A better double-wall approximation
The double-wall approximation we made is a very rough approximation based on what you do when you have a single wall. The model could be improved a lot by making a better approximation, though aside from simply creating more mirror-points, we have not investigated how this could be done, but it would most likely be quite difficult.

Experiment:
30/09/16: To further analyze the success of the transformation    four colonies were grown as overnight cultures (started on 29/09/16)    in LB and 50 µg/ml chloramphenicol. On the next day plasmid isolation was performed and plasmids were digested using the enzymes EcoRI and PstI according to the following restriction digestion protocol .
DNA electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see following protocol .
Conclusion:
Two out of the four digested samples showed bands of the expected    sizes 2,029 bps for the vector and 1184 for the gene could be seen.
Validation
Experiment:
The two samples that showed the correct digestion pattern in the restriction digestion control were sent for sequencing with the primers VF2 and VR, see primer list . These two samples showed the correct sequence (Figure 5.1-5.4, 5.1 mutant 1 forward, 5.2: mutant 2 forward, 5.3: mutant 1 reverse, 5.4: mutant 2 reverse ).

Lethbridge_Entrepreneurs,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html," Biochemistry student Erin Kelly – have developed a new method of detecting hormones, and are in the process of patenting their idea.
Their proposed biomedical device technology is expected to bring next-generation hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.
Their idea and business plan recently landed them $10,000 as the first-place winners in the 2013 South Venture Business Plan Competition, and they are now looking to the next phase of the challenge – a trip to Edmonton in April to face off in the provincial arena, with even more money and networking opportunities on the table.
While he has to be a bit cautious about revealing details because of the patent process – an expected six to eight-month timeline -- Ward said their idea will significantly improve the way in which hormones are detected.
“Hormones – and hormone imbalances -- play very important roles in understanding behaviour and mental health, pregnancy as well as development and aging of all populations,” Ward said.
“We are pursuing new technology for the detection of hormones that provides rapid results that are 93 per cent more cost effective than traditional antibody technology.”
The team’s market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of this device will occur this summer at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience in collaboration with neuroscience researcher Dr. Gerlinde Metz.
Ward said the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
“The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,” Ward said.
“iGEM is run out of a student-operated lab provided by the department of Chemistry and Biochemistry here at the University of Lethbridge and coordinated by Dr. HJ Wieden. We have been encouraged at every turn by our professors and others to move this idea forward, especially by the people at Alberta Innovates -- Technology Futures (AITF) who promote entrepreneurial engagement from scientific innovation.”
Ward said the group will not just run off into the biomedical business world once the ink is dry on their patent documents -- they need to finish school first.
“Education is one of the team’s top values and we will be working on this business while we complete our degrees. This is a learning process that will, we hope, carry us far beyond the classroom, and we are very pleased to have received the South Venture prize, because otherwise it would not be possible for our company to pursue funding opportunities and further develop our project.”
