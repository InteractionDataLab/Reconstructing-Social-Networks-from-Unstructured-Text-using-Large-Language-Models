This part aims at investigating an important issue regarding the creation of vesicles:
What is the link between Tol/Pal expression and vesicle formation?
Or, more precisely, can we explain vesicle formation solely by the diffusion of the doubly anchored Tol/Pal complex in the membrane ?  Understanding this connection is instrumental, since our project relies on the hypothesis that an increased rate of vesicle formation can be obtained simply by destabilization of the Tol/Pal complexes.
To answer this question, we developed a biophysical model of the cellular membranes and Tol/Pal complexes, that incorporates outer membrane deformation and Tol/Pal diffusion in membranes by Brownian motion.
Our initial simulation results suggested a three-stage process for vesicle formation.   Thus, in what follows, we decomposed the original main question in three parts:

SMS_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SMS Shenzhen#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," appreciate our works and are willing to share these articles.
Most importantly, our subscription account recently became a Verified Original Subscription Account in Science, an honor title which is hard to get, indicating that our account provides high-quality-original popular science articles.
Here are some examples of our functions and articles (titles are translated into English) :
2. Open-Lab Day for Teens in Shenzhen
a) Why did we hold the Open-lab Day?
We believe that this activity would let more junior high school students know about Synthetic Biology and iGEM competition. We hope that they will grow an interest in Life science and become passionate on it after our introduction.
b) How does it relate to the public?
More than 200 students visited our lab and listened to our introduction to our project. We also taught them about some of the knowledge in synthetic biology which they would understand.
Additionally, we even taught them some basic experimental skills like how to use pipettes.
3. Popularization of Synthetic Biology & Our Project in Lianhua Mountain Park
a) What did we do at Lianhua Mountain Park?
We put two big exhibition boards and a table along one of the largest trails in the Lihua Mountain Park. We informed the citizens about synthetic biology, iGEM competition, and the harms of scale insects. We also encouraged citizens - with the incentive free succulent plants - to follow our WeChat Subscription Account for more information
b) Why did we choose Lianhua Mountain Park?
Lianhua Mountain locates on the Center of Shenzhen. About 35000 people visit the park every day, and it’s convenient for all of our group members to arrive there. We stayed in the Lianhua Mountain Park for two days and informed many people about our project.
c) How does it relate to the public?
Many citizens were pleased about learning these biology knowledge, as well as how to prevent and kill scale insects on succulent plants. Many people also subscribed to our WeChat Subscription Account, encouraged us to explore more, and gave supports to us.
4. A Synthetic Biology Popularization Forum to middle school students
a) Why did we hold the Popularization Forum?
We can teach about Synthetic Biology in detail to these Shenzhen Middle School talented students. Because these junior high school students are from an honor program called 3+2, they are talented enough to perceive these advanced subjects systematically. It is also a good chance to for us collaborate with the team SIAT-SCIE.
b) How does it relate to the public?
It would let more students know about Synthetic Biology and grow interests in life science"

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
The iGEM 2018 Calgary team focused our outreach and education efforts on targeting three tiers of stakeholders                 involved in the project: researchers, students, and the general public.
Researchers
Faculty Talk
In May of 2018, our team held a informational presentation outlining our preliminary ideas and plans for researchers, doctors,                 and general interest groups at the University of Calgary. Our team used this time as an opportunity to connect                 with the individuals who are most likely to utilize our system in the future and listen to feedback surrounding                 our project. More about the feedback we received during this meeting can be found in our Integrated Human Practices page. One of our other dominant purposes of holding this information session                 was to educate researchers and professionals about our future plans regarding this system. We held this talk                 early in the summer to increase awareness and relevance of our project. A common theme we encountered in                 our early human practices discussions included concerns about the ethics and connotations surrounding a “gene                 therapy” project. We wanted to make sure that we had reached out properly to the target users of our system                 and addressed these concerns directly.
Students
International Baccalaureate Curriculum
In an effort to engage with aspiring scientists worldwide, our team sought to create a new synthetic biology                 addition to the International Baccalaureate Organization program. The IB Biology Higher Level curriculum                 contains a variety of “optional studies,” where students are able to choose which topic to write on for their                 exam. Our team planned to create a novel “synthetic biology” option for high school IB students. We drafted                 a rough outline of the contents of a synthetic biology option, which we brought to discuss with IB teachers                 at Father Lacombe High School and Western Canada High School.
However, after meeting with Mr. Norman Hounjet (IB Coordinator), Mrs. Marija Susnjar (IB Coordinator), and Ms.                 Anna Majczak (IB Biology teacher) at Father Lacombe High School and Susan Rivers (IB Coordinator) at Western                 Canada High School, we were informed that the IB Organization had already passed their period of public corroboration                 for their upcoming curriculum change"

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Emilie#enjoy_-_-_TEXT.html," a public debate between different parties.
A few final words
It seems very difficult for us to give any definite answer to the questions we asked about communication, interaction and responsibility in Science. Therefore, we decided to describe our general feeling after having met the experts and discussed the above-mentioned topics. It now appears essential to us that future scientists should be taught how to discuss their work, how to share it with other experts as well as the general public in an interactive way. Also, some form of self-questioning should always be entertained by the scientist as he/she is working, as captivating as his/her work can be. This should also include an open mindedness to criticism coming from experts in other fields such as humanities. From our point of view, the scientist should not be the only one able to foresee the consequences of his/her research. Though “ignorance of the law is no excuse”, setting up courses about the current state of legislation in the fields of research that young scientists will be exploring could help them put things into perspective. In a few words, it is all about making Science a little less about technicalities and a little more about social awareness.

Highschool students' visit
Start of the day
Since iGEM is encouraging young students to get into the lab and engage in innovative ideas using synthetic biology, our aim for this day was to get this mindset across to highschool students. In order to do so, we contacted three different schools in our region. The Gymnase d’Yverdon, Collège de Candolle and Gymnase du Bugnon keenly sent us students interested in biology and eager to find out about synthetic biology.
In fact, we found out that, even though the students had advanced biology courses, the material"

Since the Government of Canada operates on the precautionary principle, the use of synthetic biology, in this case Sensomonas nastytoxins, within closed industrial facilities (i.e. not physically released to the environment) may continue simultaneously to its impact assessment, so long as a compelling preliminary assessment and competitive cost can be established.

In the course of our project, we were collaborating with several other iGEM teams from around the world.
Tec-Chihuahua
We had several Skype calls with Tec-Chihuahua and one of their team members, Alejandra Ogaz Ramoz, visited us 26.7.2017 at Aalto University, Finland. Since Alejandra is a law student, we discussed about the European Union’s strict GMO legislation in hopes that it would help team Tec-Chihuahua to create transgenic food legislation ideas for Mexico. We also provided the Mexican team with useful links from the EU’s websites and the Tec-Chihuahua team’s law students helped us to investigate the legal issues on patents for the usage of the antimicrobial peptide dermcidin especially for skin care. Tec-Chihuahua researched the regulation of the European Union patents, as well as their durations and effects.
During the visit in Finland we put Alejandra and three of our own team members (a Finn, a Pole and a Turk) to a Finnish sauna in order to get sweat samples from different nationalities to see if there might be some differences in the dermcidin levels. We did a BCA assay of the samples that showed that there were proteins in the samples and their amount matched the amounts in literature, but could not dig deeper since we only had a very small amount of the expensive, synthetic dermcidin to use as a standard and had to therefore decide between ELISA and antimicrobial activity assay. Thus, we could not measure DCD from sweat since we deemed it to be the less important of the two.
Collecting sweat samples from Alejandra
The most interesting observation from our sauna evening with Tec-Chihuahua member Alejandra from Mexico is that the Finnish sauna is simply not nearly enough to make a Mexican or a Turk to even break a sweat since it took a while to make them sweat. The same can not be said of the Pole or the"

Public Engagement
Club activity
We organized a club dedicated to iGEM in our home school, The High School Affiliated To The Renmin University, called the Genehack Club, and it soon became the base for our public activities. Many team members were selected from this club, and we give lectures that taught various basic knowledge of life sciences. Besides, we launched a series of meetings in which our members shared their knowledge of forefront topics related to iGEM competition with other students in RDFZ, not necessarily restricted to our club members.
Forum of community development
Public engagement should not stop at school. Beyond this arena, on 21st June, we co-organized a forum of Biology Olympians and high school iGEMers from all over China, and discussed ways to promote the development of Chinese high school biology communities. We reached several conclusions:
(1) Current development of high school biology communities often suffer from a lack of resources and attractions, and a “club and competition” model such as Genehack is probably a good attempt to alleviate this problem.
(2) A single campus is inevitably limited in human resources and capital-intensive establishments. Therefore communities, even if spatially and temporally seperated, should actively seek to help each other to promote the development of all of them.
Forum of biosafety
Biosafety is our project’s foremost theme. To better understand the current situation, we participated in a forum of biosafety on 4th October. We obtained a few important informations from Peking and Tsinghua iGEMers. We found that we are now in a very precarious situation, and the Internet poses new problems for monitoring the sale and distribution of biological products that are still not well solved, and DIYbio is rapidly developing with a considerable population base in China that creates novel safety and security concerns. But much progress was made in the field of college laboratory safety and regulations went from nonexistent to systematized with classes, test and zonation in lab. Yet Chinese universities still have a long way to go compared with top-level US colleges.
After iGEM
As our experiments progressed, we took significant consideration in biosafety, one of the major global issues related to synthetic biology. According"
SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT#Biosensor_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration is put into the system, the expression level of cjBlue almost keep repressed. However, according to Figure 13, although the expression level of cjBlue reaches the maximum, the expression level of RFP is much more higher than cjBlue’s. Therefore, it is very difficult to see the color change from blue to red when cadmium ion is put into the system at the beginning of incubation.
Under the guidance of this model, the time when the cadmium ion is put into the system should be delayed. Figure 14 shows the cadmium ion is put into the system after the E.coli is incubated for 48h. The color change from blue red is so obvious.

Vanderbilt,2014,Team:Vanderbilt#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in our microbes, and by starting with gene extractions from plants, there is left open the possibility to use techniques like degenerate primers or sequences conserved across terpene classes to identify terpene genes from rare or endangered species that may not have genome sequences readily available.
The best example of this idea behind our project can be seen in the gene for santalene synthase. The only species know to have genes to produce this terpene are found in remote regions of India and Australia, and one of them is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. The trees can live for hundreds of years, but are the target of widespread over-exploitation, to the point that, for example, the Indian government has banned the export of sandalwood. Synthetic biology can produce the exact same active ingredients of sandalwood oil in a way that is both more economically and environmentally sound.
In order for our idea to truly be applicable to exotic and endangered species of plant, we had to take an approach that was quite different from the one most iGEM teams have historically taken. What we were looking for was a quick, inexpensive method of cloning genes that was also compatible with species that have not had their entire genomes sequenced. Often, iGEM teams resort to synthesizing their genes through third parties. However, this can be fairly costly especially given the moderately large size of many of these synthase genes, may take several weeks or even a month to finish synthesizing, and cannot be done unless the gene's sequence is known in its entirety.  By going back to basics and taking raw plants as our source material, we were able to avoid these issues and demonstrated how our approach was a practically viable one.

SAFETY ORGANISMS
Our experiment is entirely safe, involving no pathogenic materials, environmental release and animal/human testing. We use Escherichia coli DH5 alpha as our chassis organism. From a recent study, E. coli DH5 alpha has been determined that it lacks several genes for known E. coli pathogenicity factors. We also use Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in our experiment and it has been also shown no harmful effect to human nor the environment in the literature. Both bacteria are grouped under the risk group 1.
HUMAN PRACTICES RESEARCH
Our team had collected surveys from the public in regards to their concerns and opinions when using renewable energy. The only personal information we have collected in the survey are the age group expressed in range, and educational levels. There are no record of individual identity that one can trace. These information collected wile solely help us to analyse how the view point varies according to the different age groups. All interviewees are notified that the results from this survey will be used for us to see how we can modify our MFC according to the public's needs. All information we have collected will be destroyed after the duration of iGEM 2018.
TRAINING AND ENFORCEMENT
Training: All team members who work in the wet lab must have completed the safety training organized by Health, Safety, and Environment Office (HSEO) at the HKUST by completing a theoretical test regarding the safety concern.
The safety training we learnt:
-  Biological Safety
-  Chemical Safety I – Chemical Safety for Laboratory Users
-  Chemical Safety II – Hazardous Waste Management
More information about the safety training can be found here
University Safety: Laboratory safety in HKUST is regulated by the Health, Safety, and Environment Office (HSEO).

How dire is the water crisis?
Is there a detection mechanism already available? Is it specific? Is it inexpensive?
Impact of drinking water from contaminated sources.
Several Lambert iGEM alumni and current members traveled to the Dominican Republic, specifically the city of Hato Mayor, to work on a water filtration project.
We met with Dr. Rainyer from the Ministry of Health; Dr. Rainyer emphasized the lack of practical mechanisms available to detect waterborne diseases in contaminated water sources. According to Dr. Rainyer, there is no proactive treatment mechanism available for waterborne diseases in the city of Hato Mayor. After informing him about our project, Dr. Rainyer stated that having an efficient, inexpensive detection tool would be extremely useful for field testing. As a result, we decided to focus on using frugal science as a means to address the funding issues for non-government organizations.
A majority of the residents living in Hato Mayor did not have access to clean, drinking water and buying bottled water was a financial burden. While installing water filters, iGEM members had the opportunity to speak to the residents living in Hato Mayor.
Buying bottled water cost on average 60% of a families annual income, a financial burden. Since many of the residents did not have access to transportation, they would have to pay for the costly trip.
Megan Hong, Lambert iGEM member describes her experience: When we traveled to the village by Hato Mayor, we were instantly surprised by the amount of trash filling the streets, homes, and water sources. Without direct access to clean drinking water, the residents of the village had to travel about 20 miles out of their way to the city in order to obtain bottled water. We installed 12 water filters throughout the area, which would help to serve over 50 people. While we implemented these systems and taught the locals how to use and clean the filter, the residents talked about how much the clean water would impact their lives in a positive way.

The Tel- Hai iGEM team aims for a new way of targeting the CRISPR components to access and fix a specific mutation to take a step forward to successfully treat Cystic fibrosis. To arouse awareness they collected pictures of people holding roses for their #sixtyfiveroses campaign. To support their honorable goal, we posed for a good cause.  Another great idea from their team was to set up a trivia game, to unite different iGEM teams and their projects. This game is a perfect opportunity to excite people for the field of synthetic biology and easy way to learn about novel topics.

Nanjing_China_Bio,2012,Team:Nanjing China Bio#background_-_-_TEXT.html," from a long time ago (over 150 years).  However, due to uncontrollable toxic effects to normal tissues, this method has been disregarded for decades.
Thanks to the development of molecular biology technologies, we can modify bacteria as we wish, thus tumor therapy undergoes a spectacular renaissance.  In order to eliminate the toxic effects of bacteria upon normal tissues, we need to screen some promoters that express specifically only in tumor areas.  As stated above, the central parts of tumor are highly hypoxic areas.  Therefore if we screen out the anaerobic promoters that only function under hypoxic circumstances, we could make the genes for cytotoxic drugs specifically express in tumor tissues to decrease the damage on normal tissues.  Through consulting on predecessors' work, we searched out several anaerobic promoters, ligating each of them to plasmid vectors with reporter using molecular techniques.  Promoters highly expressed in hypoxic circumstances could be screened after transferring Salmonella Typhimurium with modified combined plasmids.
In addition, the Salmonella Typhimurium we used are VNP20009 from the lab of Professor Zichun Hua, a bacteria knocked out of chromogenes purI and msbB.  The bacteria are also removed of antibiotic-resistance markers, becoming stable antibiotic sensitive strains.6

While traditional machining, such as milling and turning, would result in tighter tolerances and more accurate parts, we realized the cost of manufacturing parts in a machine shop were high. In fact, many of these parts only include clearance holes, which will serve its purpose as long as they meet a minimum dimension.
Material: Since our team chose to manufacture our system with 3D-printing, we chose to create our parts with ABS. The typical material for 3D-printing is resin, as it is inexpensive, but resin lacks the resolution needed to create the negative features on certain parts. ABS is stiffer and allows for more accurate parts and is more durable than resin.
Motors: We chose to incorporate stepper motors to the XY-plane as it allowed for a minimum step resolution of 1.8 degrees, which translates to 0.20 mm per step. Stepper motors also allow for microstepping, which allows us to further improve the resolution to 1/16 of a step, or 0.0125 mm.

Results :
Great transformation rate
New stock of Biobrick Miniprep :
DO checking, PCR cheking
Cloning (Standard Assembly Method) of every first steps of our construction :
11 clonings
We changed our strategy: clonings were performed with enzymes recommended by iGEM ().
One Petri Dish was free of colony. We performed PCRs on 5 colonies from each Petri Dish. According to PCR results, 5 constructions out of 11 seem to have the right size.
Cloning session :
Every 1st-step constructions that failed last time, so 6 constructions.
2 2nd-step constructions :
MerR-LuxR
TetR-LuxR
Only digestions were performed because of a lack of equipments. We decided to use the Standard Protocol for the first step constructions because the assembly combinates a short and a long gene. The long gene is inserted in the plasmid of the small gene. But the Second step constructions were performed with the 3A Assembly Protocol.
Modelling
Stochastic model done.
Models :
First results with the stochastic model. Our whole model does work like we expected it. But parameters are needed more than ever now.
Parameters :
We got incomplete sets of parameters from either litterature or iGem teams. Some very useful sets can be found in Aberdeen 09, Brown 10, ETHZ 07, BCCS Bristol 08.

This construct was transformed in the Bacillus subtilis strain we selected, which was the Bacillus subtilis 3610 ::comI strain. See figure 2 a & b

Top down approach for robustness
Apart from the bottom up approach, where individual biofilm genes were overexpressed, a top down method was also done. In this method the genetic pathways responsible for the behavioural decision making of Bacillus subtilis get engineered in such a way that biofilm behaviour is constantly on. The reason the biofilm formation is tightly regulated, is because the production of a biofilm requires high investment energetically. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor Spo0A is central to biofilm formation (Branda et al, 2001). The Spo0A transcription factor itself controls two parallel pathways which are responsible for expression of biofilm operons. It also has other functions like repressing"

CRISPR-Cas9 induced PEX10 knockout
The assembled CRISPRyl plasmid with PEX10 protospacers was transformed in competent E. coli DH5α cells.                                   Purification of assembled CRISPRyl plasmid with Pex10 protospacers.                                   The assembled CRISPRyl plasmid with PEX10 protospacers was digested with AvrII to test if the PEX10 protospacer was inserted. The digestion was successful and showed no cutting by AvrII indicating correct insertion of PEX10 protospacers.                                   First attempt of transformation with CRISPRyl plasmid with PEX10 protospacers in Yarowia lipolytica PO1f Δku70. The transformation was unsuccessful. There was growth all over the plates.

E. coli with BBa_K152005 could only grow without Ampicilin, so we suspect a problem with the AmpR backbone. We decided not to use this biobrick and instead only work with BBa_K530002, BBa_K530000 and BBa_K530001.

Team Meeting & aGEM presentation, handouts and posters
Today, we discussed the T-shirt meeting, iGEM registration, fundraising and flights to Boston, and addressed any other upcoming events or issues.
Then we moved on to aGEM discussions: we went through the posters, powerpoint and handouts of each group within iGEM. We discussed the changes that need to be made on posters and handouts and suggested modifications on the slides. All the handouts need to be edited and resubmitted by Monday.
Again, Emily and I will work on the Human Practices handouts. We need to do the following on the handout:
1) Try using a similar format to the lab one with 4 pages, allowing for more content and much more space 2) Fewer jagged lines! 3) Like the sideways titles for sections- maybe use for all of the sections 4) New content ideas: -Wht did we learn from the Campus Fair, what did we learn for the fututre in marketing? What are we going to do in the future for Marketing?, what ethical issues did we examine (just in general) 5) Add the grand total to the marketing Pie Chart! And fix up the text.
We also need to edit the Human Practices poster.

iGEM co-operation
When participating in this competition, each team is encouraged to cooperate with each other. We worked together with the iGEM team of Edinburgh on de-stiffening their model, a model which is beneficial for both teams. Furthermore, we made a short video to help the University of Copenhagen team in starting a new iGEM educational system. Last, but not least, we hosted a Jamboree preparing meetup for the danish iGEM teams. A further description can be found if you dig deeper under ‘Helping others’.
iGEM Human Outreach
Part of the iGEM competion is the mediation of knowledge. Besides the outreach done by sharing our wiki, we were contacted by a couple of newspapers that wanted to share our story. Moreover, we visited several schools and taught kids and youngsters about iGEM, the ideas of synthetic biology, and our project. See pictures and feedback, dig deeper under ‘Human Practices’.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," minutes with different starting values.
Ranging from 1-350 molecules per minute, the implemented expression rates of RelE and RelB in the model might seem too high, as the rates in the inherit system is effectively around 80-100 for RelB and 2-5 for RelE. However, the possibility of placing the relE and relB genes under regulation of controllable promoters makes the high total production values reasonable.
When the inherent toxin-antitoxin system is activated under starvation, 40-70 molecules of free RelE are found in each cell, making it reasonable to believe that the cells enter dormancy when a few tens of free RelE copies are present. This result obtained from the model is in agreement with literature Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297
For the full list of constants, see the attached Table 1 at the bottom of this page.
Running the Model
To give a stochastic view of the system, the Gillespie algorithm was run in the computer programming language MATLAB, utilising an implementation made by MATLAB user Nezar.
For the runs simulating dormancy, deterministic initial values were used and the system was run for 30 minutes without activation of the inserted toxin promoter. This resulted in a stochastic distribution of initial values mimicking variations between cells. Analysis showed, that 30 minutes was enough for the model to find a stable distribution, which is realistic considering the growth cycle of an E. coli cell.
For the runs simulating activation, the data generated at the end of a dormancy run was used as initial value and deactivated expression of RelE. When the concentration of free RelE decreases to below 15 copies, a cell is considered active. This value was probably set too low, but tests displayed marginal difference between 15 and 45 copies, where the lower limit was chosen to decrease uncertainty of the cell state.
All runs simulated 1000 cells, which should be sufficient to get stable averages and the model assumed well-mixed conditions in every cell and considered each cell independently. Furthermore, the model has no cut-off for maximum values of RelE, as the exact relation between RelE concentration and dormancy state is unknown, yet a functional cut-off was found through activation times.

Using the steady-state and kinetic knowledge of the antibody, derive                         the relationship (9):
\begin{equation}\begin{split} [R_TA]=&Cexp[-(K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T])t]\\&+\frac{K_{d2}(K_{d2}[R_TA_0]+[R_T])-K_{a2}([P_0]-[R_TA_0]+[R_T])[R_T]}{K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T]}                         \end{split}\tag{9}\end{equation}
equal meaning between \([R_TA_0]\) and \([R_TA]_0\).
By simplification of relation (9) and combining relation (2) inside the grayscale model content,                         relations (10) and (11) can be obtained:
$$[R_TA]=Cexp[xt]+y\tag{10}$$
$$\mathrm{Grayscale \ value}=\frac{\sigma exp[xt]+ \Psi }{\beta+Cexp[xt]}\tag{11}$$
According to this relationship, a detection curve expressed by a fixed antigen-antibody                         concentration can be obtained. The relationship between the high-sensitivity detection curve and                         the low-sensitivity detection curve (slide detection sensitivity and positive correlation of                         antigen-antibody pairs) can also be obtained. Fig. 5(a)(b)(c) can be listed:
(a) Relationship between fixed antigen-antibody concentration and                                 detection time
(b) Relationship between different fixed antigen-antibody                                 concentration and detection time
(c) Gray value and detection time relationship diagram
Fig.5 Predictive graph during detection
From the analysis results, the detection time can be optimized to achieve the most effective                         time. At the same time, for a fixed antigen-antibody pair, this value is proportional to the                         initial reaction rate; the optimal time is approximately the same. Finally, there is a clear                         relationship between the detection time and the gray value relationship.

Simulations
We add the previous equations to the basic bistable model of the previous section and we define 3 events in the simulation. These events are:
Time=0, temp=0     IPTG=2e3. We start the simulation adding IPTG.
Time=70000, temp=1    IPTG=0. We remove all the IPTG and simulate the increasing of temperature making the degradation sontant get higher following an exponential rate.
Time=140000, temp=0    IPTG=2e3. We add IPTG and decrease the temperature.
The results showed by using Matlab's Symbiology are:
We can see how the behavior of the system is the expected one. The result shows the difference between one induction and the other. The change due to the temperature is harder than the IPTG induction. That is why the IPTG must ligand to repressor1 and this reaction might be slower than the other which attacks to a sensible property of the protein.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," been responsible for the large number of off-target effects caused by CRISPR/Cas9, a case not observed in the experiments using human adult cells or animal embryos.
A Community Divided: The Backlash
Some feel that the report, published in scientific journal Protein & Cell, has crossed an ethical line. ""No researcher has the moral warrant to flout the globally widespread policy agreement against altering the human germline,"" Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the non-profit Centre for Genetics and Society in Berkeley, California, wrote in a statement. Edward Lanphier, president of Sangamo BioSciences in Richmond, California believes that the low success of this investigation should be enough to prompt a ban on such research using human embryos; ""I think the paper itself actually provides all of the data that we kind of pointed to,"" he says.
However, many people have arguments to support Huang's research. George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, claims that the technology is not immature at all, and that the CRISPR/Cas9 ""kit"" used by Huang was not the most up to date version available. John Harris, a bioethicist at Manchester University believes ""It's no worse than what happens in IVF all the time, which is that non-viable embryos are discarded"". Harris sees no justification for a ban on research in this area, and argues that the technique could eventually be used in clinics, just so long as the potential harm of the treatment is outweighed by the downsides of having the genetic disease untreated; ""It's not as if the alternative is safe,"" he says. ""People with genetic diseases are going to go on reproducing.""
In My Opinion...
This report marks a positive step in gene-editing research. If more of this can be done (that is, using only non-viable embryos), the improvement on our understanding of early human development could increase dramatically, and could potentially lead to effective treatment of thalassaemia and many other genetic diseases such as Huntington's and cystic fibrosis, which currently have no cures. As of May 2015, four other teams in China are believed to be conducting experiments using non-viable embryos, and Huang's team aims to develop a technique to decrease the number of off-target mutations introduced by CRISPR/Cas9, this time going back to the use of adult human cells and/or animal models.
There is, however, a danger that Huang's paper could be the start of a slippery slope. His research comes as close to the ethical ""line"" as one can get; let us hope"

Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed.

Integrity of the Author's Source Code The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of ""patch files"" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.

Plate reader is still being repaired--we will have to wait to check the growth curves
Since plans A and B are not working well at the moment, we will go ahead and start preparing for plan C (using a plasmid). Ordered primers that will clone out the pSB4K5 (a biobrick vector with a kan cassette, http://partsregistry.org/Part:pSB4K5 ) backbone with homology to the ZFB-wp-his3-ura3 construct. We will then connect the two with Gibson assembly.
To this end, we need to use the biobrick DNA sent to us to transform chemically competent E coli.  Unfortunately the 384-well plates that they are stored in could not be found because Andrew is out of town--hopefully they will turn up tomorrow.
For the rest of the day, we joined team TolC for gel extraction, MAGE, and lambda red!

Result of OZ052 and OZ123 Transformation
Last Friday we plated out the transformed bacteria for the two OZ controls in 10 ul and 50 ul volumes.  They both yielded colonies, but the 10 ul plates only had a handful while the 50 ul plates had around 15-20 colonies each.  We picked four colonies from each plate and grew them in LB/spec so that tomorrow we can perform a miniprep and send them off for sequencing.  We should know the final verdict by Wednesday regarding which ones are good or bad.
Glycerol stockmaking
We got the sequencing results back from last Friday, and took the following colonies to make into glycerol stock solutions: 77.1, 79.2, 80.1, 81.1 (x2 for both FH bottom and Myc 198), 82.1, 83.4, 84.1, Z"
Cardiff_Wales,2016,Team:Cardiff Wales#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"constitution of luciferase activity constitutes a positive signal.
Luciferases catalyse bioluminescent reactions using ATP in the presence of molecular oxygen (O2) and luciferin (LH2), with in vivo and in vitro applications in imaging and detection. Wild-type luciferases are highly sensitive to pH and are thermolabile, undergoing inactivation and bathochromic shift at 25oC [7] . We fused the C- and N- terminal fragments of a thermostable pH-tolerant Photinus pyralis luciferase mutant to a dCas9 isoform optimized for expression in E. coli. dCas9 lacks catalytic activity, and as such targeted sequences do not undergo cleavage. sgRNA constructs target these chimeric proteins to adjacent sequences, resulting in the reconstitution of luciferase activity and bioluminescence in the prescence of luciferin. The reconstitution of bioluminesce significantly greater than background activity constitutes the positive signal for pathogen detection. The mechanism of this 'Cas-Find' system is demonstrated in Fig 2.
'Cas-Find' could provide adaptable, specific point-of-care diagnosis.
All constructs were expressed under the T7 promoter and the control of the lac operator. dCas9 chimeric constructs were expressed in both pET16b and pCOLADuet expression vectors (see Fig 2). sgRNA constructs targeted to the 16S rRNA locus of E. coli were expressed in MSCS2 of pCOLADuet, in addition to the pSBC13 expression vector. The design of sgRNA constructs is discussed in more detail below. With further characterisation 'Cas-Find' thus presents a potential novel solution to STI diagnosis, especially where resources are constrained. The adaptable design of sgRNA constructs ensures that the 'Cas-Find' system can be designed to detect specific pathogens, and the requirement for the binding of two sgRNA constructs with a defined distance between them imparts high specificity. Bioluminescence can be detected using low cost and minimal equipment, and could be conducted rapidly at the point-of-care, potentially alleviating some of the global health burden associated with STI.

Step #1: Data Management - Clotho
The key challenges in data management are: storing data, retrieving data, using data, and sharing data. These challenges in synthetic biology are made more difficult by the relative infancy of the field coupled with the vast number of differing interpretations regarding data organization and data relationships. As registries such as MIT's registry of standardized biological parts focus on storing data, we focus on making data retrieval, data usage, and data sharing easier.
In keeping with a the major achievement of Clotho (flexible database support), we continue to allow flexible database support. Now however, we have provided a much more consistent interface to designers. We have done this in part by using Java's hibernate for data persistence. This involves the standardization of two APIs:
Communication API - how tools talk to one another.
Data API - how data is retrieved and stored from databases.
The communication API provides a way for Clotho tools to ""talk"" to one another much more easily. In addition, all Clotho tools now all extend a basic ClothoTool object which essentially makes all tools ""plug-ins"" . With this extension and simplified API, even those unfamiliar with Clotho can write their own tools easily. We can't wait to see all the tools that users come up with!
The data API provides Clotho Tools a very simple way of looking up data. The API, combined with a ""keyword"" list allows tools to be written without complex queries or an understanding of how the underlying database is organized. Getting and saving data now simply relies on a basic datum object.
Step #2: Specification - Eugene
We have created a domain specific language named Eugene for the specification of biological constructs. Not only does this allow users to capture and share human readable specifications but also the specification is now a language which can be executed by Clotho tools as an executable specification for the creation of devices, the specification of rules, and a intermediate data exchange format between tools.
For example let's say you know that you want a basic device consisting of a promoter , ribosome binding site , an open-reading frame , and then a terminator . You can quickly specify this in Eugene. You can now share this high level design with others without actually specifying any low level details (e.g. the DNA sequence).
The next step would be to specify rules. You can specify that the promoter must have a specify strength, the binding site have a certain sequence, and the terminator be of a certain type. These rules will be triggered if a device is constructed with does"

Design Comments
In our attempt to design a system that regulates DNA messaging by controlling M13 particle production, we had the option of manipulating any of the 11 genes in the M13 genome. We chose to remove a gene from the helper plasmid and control viral particle production through complementation. Specifically, we chose to use gene VIII (see the Control section), which was advised my Monica Ortiz. Gene VIII is not a regulatory gene and is last in its operon, so it’s removal is unlikely to interfere with regulation of other genes. Most importantly, a similar approach was previously used to control production of phage ϕX174 [13].
The strong affinity of protein V for single-stranded IF DNA is a concern for our DNA message retransmission design, wherein the primary receiver cells have a helper plasmid with gene VIII knockout and the incoming message carries gene VIII under control of a switch. Since gene V is found on the knockout helper plasmid in the primary receiver, it may be present at very high levels in the primary receiver when the DNA message is delivered. The DNA message will be introduced as single stranded DNA, and protein V may bind it, sequester it, and prevent it from replicating, breaking our messaging system. Indeed, it is known that the presence of protein V alone in a cell renders it immune to subsequent infection by M13 bacteriophage."

Overview
In our project, not only do we like to develop a peptide delivery system “PEPDEX”, we also try to apply the system to solving medical problems since we are medical students. Though we have discussed a lot about the safety issues in our project, designed different ways of regulation (even suicide) to avoid spreading out of the lab or contaminating the environment, we would like to know what do medical doctors think about biosafety problems in synthetic biology. Therefore, before the interview with doctors,"
Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," collaborated with the Oxford iGEM team to test the toxicity of this molecule on the bacteria that already live in nature. This experience is useful to know the impact of Curdlan on other organisms. Another experience would have been interesting : a toxicity test on plant cells or animal cells. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the capacity to carry this test out in our laboratory. For now, we are still waiting for the results.
In food industry, the additive E424 (Curdlan) is used as a thickener, stabilizer, gelling and firming agent. This is reassuring because it is a common product in the food chain, and not reported as toxic.
We are not using the entire cell Another important theme is the spread of new organisms in nature. Indeed, this could alter biodiversity. If we want to directly use our synthetic organism on the plant, we must integrate death genes in their genomes to create organisms that are not be able to live in natural conditions. In the case of our project, we are not planning on directly applying our genetically engineered bacteria on the plant but only our purified molecule. In other words, we chose to spray on the vine only the cell product: Curdlan. In our project, the cell can’t evolve and in any manner alter the environment.
Economy
A bit of French Touch
The production of Bordeaux is 6.4 million hectoliters with only 14% for white wines. More than 850 million bottles are sold every year and  worth almost € 3.7 billion. Today, the red wines represent 86% of total volumes produced by the vineyards of Bordeaux, 89% of exports in volume and 92% in value.  The Bordeaux vineyard now covers 123,000 hectares for 270,000 hectares of farmland. The climate and the terroir is particulary favourable for a exceptionnal vineyard. Indeed, soils and Girondins basements are rather shallow. The Gironde, the Garonne and the Dordogne make the climate cool and provide the water needed by the vineyard. On the left side of the Gironde and Garonne, there is  gravelly, sandy, clay soil made by the erosion of the Pyrenees. On the other side, soils are likely limestone wich is suitable for vineyard. The warm ocean current of the Gulf Stream accentuates the temperate climate and the Landes forest forms a protective shield against the winds of the ocean.

Result overview
After one month of brainstorming and three months of hard lab working, the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team has successfully submitted 13 new parts, of which a large portion, such as the PfdhF promoter , MEF2-JeT promoter and CRE-JeT promoter , are new parts that are demonstrated capable of working as expected. Moreover, RNase barnase is an existing part in the Partsregistry, and we also have it characterized in order to provide more data.
Furthermore, we have built models which correspond to most of our experiment results, meaning they are highly simulative and thus capable of providing essential support for our design.
With the brilliant results of these main modules, our project, Synthetic-biological approaches to Osteoarthritis was proven to be highly feasible and has a great prospect to be further studied and applied. Now let us take a look at the experiment outcomes.

Rinsed PBAD-RLT  beads and transferred them into 20mL LB culture medium, adding 20uL Amp. 37°C shaker  50rpm incubated. After 2 hours, added 2mL Ara.
Put 5 PBAD-RLT  beads and 1mL culture fluid into an Eppendorf tube, storing at 4°C.
After  adding Ara and incubating for 7h, 8h, put 5 PBAD-RLT beads and 1mL  culture fluid into an Eppendorf tube.
Determined  each sample's fluorescence intensity.
Result:
0h  sample's fluorescence intensity was the least, 8h>7h.
The  fluorescence intensity is related to the amount of beads.
Because  some of the bacteria leaked into the medium, the background fluorescence  intensity brings a significant influence to the measuring.
Device  construction:
Modified  the device ( use double pipe inlets)
Time  Delay:
Goal: To  do the analysis of RBS0.01-luxITT, PBADRBS-luxITT, PBADRBS-luxRTT.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis was correct and clear.
Design:
We  continually worked on building Wiki. Discussion on the scheme of the team part  of the Wiki.

Augmented Reality App
We have created an augmented reality app to allow people to interact with our poster - to be presented at Latin America Jamboree (Chile). In that way they can, using our application, access our videos, charts, graphs, and our wiki page. We think the poster presentations events can be more interesting with this kind of resource and we never saw the use of such technology in academic poster before.
The application was created as a skin of the Aurasma system, in a partnership, and can be downloaded for Android in this website: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aurasma.skinned.ctit&hl=en
The video below is a demonstration of this app, note that some images of the poster trigger the content (video, image and a 3D model) in the tablet:

Today Esengul helped me in preparing the Basal minimal medium. Finally it will be available tomorrow. I ligated the ribo regulator plasmid and -ve cascade plasmid with lacI generator since I thought it was unnecessary in negative cascade since it was not glowing GFP. Now since controls have LacI generator I must ligate it to the other samples too which I did today and electro transformed.

(2)Cell’s influence keeps unchanged in subsequent iterations as long as the cell exists.
(3)Removal of a cell has inverse effects.
    According to assumption III, concentrations of AHL and nutrient will decline in each iteration if their generative sources are removed.  Different types of cells affecting different kinds of substances are illustrated below:
(1) When a farmer is placed, it will eject nutrient to the surrounding 5×5 grids, and the amount of nutrient in each grid will increase by 1. Then the amount of nutrient will hold on until the farmer is killed. When the farmer is removed, the amount decrease by 1.
(2) When placed on grids, warriors eject AHL molecule to the surrounding 3×3 grids, and the amount in each grid increases by 1; Then the amount of AHL molecule will hold on until the farmer is removed. When warriors is removed, the amount decreases by 1.
VI Iteration rules
    In the ik-th iteration, our program traverses the whole mesh grid and checks for two missions: death penalty and probabilistic growth based on states of the i(k-1)-th iteration. We may call the grid which the program is checking ‘present grid’ for convenience.
VII Death penalty
    There are two and only two cases which cause cell death: nutrient in present grid is depleted; or there are enemy AHLs in the present grid. It is noted that farmers cannot die of case I because they create aliments themselves. As for case II, when AHL-I and AHL-II are in adjacent grid and the colony inside the grid is warrior, one of them will be killed.
VIII Probabilistic growth
    Another mission during iteration is to simulate bacterial growth. Concentration of AHL is excluded in this section, because it only functions in Death Penalty part. Since nutrient contributes to cell growth, a natural idea is to set a probabilistic model of any empty grid, described by a linear equation:
    Pk (x,y)=α∙Ck (x,y)
    Where (x,y) are coordinates of present grid, Pk (x,y) is the probability an adjacent cell can grow into present grid in ik-th iteration, Ck (x,y) is concentration of nutrient in present grid in ikth iteration, α is a coefficient that remains unchanged during simulation.
    This equation helps our program to judge whether or not an adjacent cell can grow into present grid in ik-th iteration; after this judgement is settled, we choose randomly from surrounding grids that have cells in them,"

Meeting up with younger iGEMers
Time:2017.5.28
Place:Scientific and Technological Business Incubator
Since synthetic biology is known by more people and iGEM is increasingly popular, the number of high school participants grows. They’ve learned biology for not a very long time, and some of them are members of the first iGEM team in his or her school’s history. Thus, the guidance and instruction becomes important. On May, most teams started their work, and we gave a speech to some iGEM high school participants from different cities nearby.
We started the speech by briefly introducing synthetic biology and iGEM, and gave examples of former teams’ projects. Then we talked about the whole process and gave useful suggestions. The high school students concentrated on our speech and hoped to get further connection with us.
Apart from that, we had a deep collaboration with HFLS H2S high school team.Click the button below for more information.

""What is this?"" ""How shall I use this device?"" ""So you do experiments there everyday ?"" On a sunny day during the summer vacation, we welcomed a group of high school students, who were members of the science camp, to our lab.
Being a sub activity of their ""Biology Laboratory Day"", we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM to them, and then invited them as well as the guidance teacher to visit our lab. The campers were curious to the facilities in our lab and admired us for our enthusiasm in scientific research. We hope that this activity can let them know what is synthetic biology, how we engineered the microorganisms, and why we are interested in it. Maybe some of them were impressed by this"

FimE recognizes IRL and IRR, then catalyze the inversion of J23119. The weak acid would be generated at that time. For the environment, due to the production of the weak acid, it would turn neutral gradually.
Basic circuits model
○ Overview of Basic model
Modeling of basic circuits is divided into two parts: resistance subsystem model and regulation subsystem model. The main processes analyzed in models include promoter induction, transcription, translation, catalytic process of enzymes and the effects of products on environmental. Differential equations are applied to simulate the concentration change of all substances. Factors considered in our model are reversible reaction and materials production and degradation.
○ Resistance Model
In resistance subsystem, the constitutive promoter J23119 is applied, and we focused on the efficiency of three functional genes (Fig.1). GlsA encodes glutaminase which can catalyze the transformation from glutamine to glutamate and ammonia. Ammonia will neutralize the intracellular H+. The alkali-resistance functional genes NhaA and NhaB encode two types of Na+/H+ antiporters. These antiporters catalyze the exchange of sodium ions for protons and therefore maintain the homeostasis of bacteria.
Fig.1 Basic resistance circuit of pH Controller.
In resistance subsystem model, three key processes considered are the transcription and translation of two functional genes and the degradation of their products.
Three resistance devices’ models were constructed separately. To prove the function of these devices, we set up initial intracellular pH to 3.0 in program to examine the function of GlsA, while the initial pH was set to 9.0 to examine the function of NhaA and NhaB antiporters.
Results show that resistance subsystem can regulate intracellular pH to a suitable range (Fig.2, 3, 4).
Fig.2 Intracellular pH is regulated by acid resistance device. To prove the function of this device, initial pH is set up to 3.0 in program. pH can effect activity of GlsA, while GlsA conducts gaseous ammonia production. With the enzyme activity changing, pH will be finally stabilized to a suitable level.

TAS_Taipei,2017,Team:TAS Taipei#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," NP removal. The director of Boswell’s WWTP told us that most sedimentation tanks use devices called surface skimmers, which constantly rotate around a central axle, to remove oils; we envision attaching our prototype to the same central axle. In WWTPs that do not have a central rotor in the sedimentation tank, a motor and rod could be easily installed. The slow rotation would keep biofilm structure intact while at the same time, increase the amount of NPs that come into contact with our biofilm.
Applying Biofilm in a WWTP Model
After we experimentally demonstrated that biofilms trap NPs, we wanted to test biofilms under conditions similar to a WWTP sedimentation tank. Based on Boswell’s circular tank design, we built our own “sedimentation tanks” using clear plastic tubes, and attached biocarriers to a central spinning rotor. Three cylinders were set up: biofilm + distilled water, biofilm + AuNP, and AuNP solution alone. Here, we decided to grow biofilm directly onto biocarriers in the cylinders to minimize any disturbances. Finally, we turned on the rotor—set at a slow rotation speed—to simulate the mild movement of water in sedimentation tanks.
In this simulation, we expected to see biofilms first attach and grow on the biocarriers, and then begin trapping NPs in the tanks. After about 30 hours of mixing, the color of the AuNP solution started to change from purple to clear in the cylinder containing biofilm (figure 5-8). This suggested that enough biofilm had adhered onto the biocarrier and began removing AuNPs in the solution. In contrast, the cylinder containing only AuNP solution did not change at all (video 5-2). As the biofilm-coated biocarrier removed AuNPs from solution, we also observed more purple aggregates of AuNP sticking to the rotating biofilm biocarrier. Here, we have demonstrated that our biofilm approach effectively removes NPs in a WWTP sedimentation tank model.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this process as the graph shows below.
As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C"
Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". This allows us to follow a strategy that will                         make our project to benefit society, economy and                         environment to the greatest extent.
Types of Impact assessment
Nutritional Impact Assessment
According to our purpose, it was mandatory to study the                         influence that a project has in a healthy and correct                         nutrition. Improvements should be translated in better                         data regarding child development, aging and incidence                         rates of diseases directly related to proper nutrition.                         Nevertheless, diet issues differ relying on the country                         or even between regions. This is the reason why it is                         important to identify nutritional necessities before                         analyzing the impact, as there is not a concrete global                         solution for all contexts.
Environmental Impact Assessment
Resources required and environmental consequences of a                         project are technical issues which determine its                         success. The goal is using natural resources in a safe                         and optimum manner, without compromising autochthonous                         flora, fauna and health of population. The                         identification, prediction and evaluation of                         environmental consequences linked to a project, must                         conceal environmental expertise, project stakeholders                         and other representative affected nucleus. Thus,                         analyzing the sustainability and acceptation of proper                         practices will condition the project viability, as both                         characteristics will delimit tasks execution.
Socioeconomic Impact Assessment
Activities performed because of a project, are expected                         to affect the economic and social context wherever they                         are located. The scale at which the economic study is                         carried through, can be from families to small and                         middle enterprises, or even to the national stock                         market. Microeconomy will play a role in the                         macroeconomics evolution, and vice versa, making it                         necessary to analyze both dimensions.
Three indicators widely used to evaluate this impact                         are:
Direct impact. It corresponds to the production                             (gross added product) and employment generated in                             those fields which are direct beneficiaries of the                             project.
Indirect impact. It involves providers of                             sectors who are direct beneficiaries of the                             project.
Induced impact. It is related to changes                             affecting the society as a collective, due to the                             new services and products offered.
Economic context affects health, education and                             expansion expectations of a society. The study of                             shifts induced in social trends, can help to                             reinforce or redesign the strategy and mission of a                             project, trying to contribute to individual and                             collective development.

Doctor Jim Spain
Jim is a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA. Jim was able to talk to us about the need for our project in America. In Europe it would not be possible to release our modified E. coli at present due to strict regulations. However, in the USA the law surrounding synthetic biology is much more relaxed, hence the practical potential for our project to be used is much higher. Jim was able to inform us on the aspects of our project that would be essential for the practical success of our bioremediation solution.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," science does not end at providing a barrier-free lab. When getting into contact with  Victor Kratz one of the topics we discussed was accessibility in the digital space. In the past years globalization and digitalization have shaped the world as we know it. Globalization is accelerated by digitalization and the internet is more important than ever before. The web has the ability to work for all people regardless of language, location, gender, age, income or ability. It removes barriers in communication and interaction that many people with disabilities face in the physical world. Yet, badly designed websites and applications can create barriers which lead to the exclusion of possible users. At this point in time e.g. a lot people with visual impairment need to adjust web pages to make them accessible to them. Barrier-free web design provides accessibility to all people regardless of ability or interface. In our conversation with Victor Kratz he mentioned that a lot of websites still are not suited to be accessed via a screen reader.
As scientist, we use the web a lot basically everyday nowadays. We’re having access to scientific publication, are doing bioinformatic analysis and can order e.g. oligos through online shops from science companies. It generally plays a huge role. Because of this, it is crucial to provide access to all those applications to everyone regardless of their abilities. A huge part of iGEM is the presentation of our work. We hold presentations, make posters and design a wiki. Habitually, we should always ask ourselves this one question: Is everyone able to access the data I’m presenting? We decided to design our wiki in an accessible manner to tackle this question. Through this, we aim to make the results of the iGEM competition accessible to everyone. And by this taking a step towards a more inclusive scientific community.
But how do you design an accessible wiki? We did some research and put together a guide for you!
Accessible Wiki - The guide
Navigation
Many users rely on a keyboard for navigation. All elements of your wiki should be accessible when using only a keyboard as the navigation device. This means that you can focus on every relevant elements using the Tab key.
Colour and Contrast
A high contrast between background and e.g. text should be used. This is especially important for buttons and symbols since they can’t be modified by the user. Additionally, red and green should not be used as contrasting colours since people with colour blindness can’t distinguish between those two colours. Additionally, for symbols and buttons, use a combination of colour, shape and text instead of only using colour to distinguish

I joined iGEM to discover more about synthetic biology, and I have found that my interests are primarily in modelling and wet lab. After High school I plan on continuing my studies in math or science. Other than iGEM I enjoy playing the piano, going on airplanes and listening to classical music!
Karen He
grade 12
Hi, my name is Karen! I’m in grade 12 at Chinook High School. I joined iGEM because science is my favourite! iGEM has provided me with a wonderful amount of scientific knowledge-- but also other important things, such as Human Practices, presentation-making, and public speaking. For the future, my plan is to go into the biological sciences at university. Other than science, I love cats, cereal, and walking in nature.
Wade Zhang
Grade 12
Hello! My name is Wade Zhang, and I am 17 years old, having just finished my 11th year at Winston Churchill High School.  I joined iGEM because of my interest in poking small things for science, but it has also been very interesting learning about all the bigger things related to biological applications such as human ethics.  After I graduate, I would really like to apply the skills I have learned in a field related to promoting human health.  I like making and listening to music, and also enjoy flossing.

Grade 11
Hello! I’m Logan and I’m a grade 11 student attending Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. This is my very first year of iGEM and it has been such a great season so far. I joined this year’s iGEM team as I wanted to expand my knowledge on the world of synthetic biology. So far, I’ve really enjoyed the coding and the human practices aspects iGEM! In my spare time I love playing hockey and hanging out with my friends!

Hey folks,
My name is Sören and the fact that I needed to write this little text more than four month might describe me quite well. I`m studying also ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" and as you might see, endless days of cloning, trying and mistaking have manifested on the top of my head. And doubtless, the thousand cloning attempts during iGem didn't make it better. Nevertheless, success was worth it I guess.

Hello, my name is Jonathan Rosenberg and I am studying Developmental, Neural and Behavioral Biology at the Georg-August-University Göttingen. For my Bachelor´s thesis, I specialized in developmental biology and worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, where I characterized a Drosophila mutant. Now I am working with my fellow ""soon-to-be-researchers"" of the iGEM-Team to make the world a little better place. With our project, we are likely to open up a whole new chapter of antibiotics-research, eventually saving the lives of many infected patients. So you better expect us at Boston!

Team member Julia introduces the Aptamer Purification components of the project
Introduction
An aptamer is a nucleic acid molecule that binds with  high specificity and affinity to a particular target. Aptamers have been likened to antibodies in their “lock-and-key” binding specificity. Currently there are hundreds of documented aptamers, some of which can be accessed and purchased through the Aptagen database [1]. As an example, one very well characterized example of an aptamer is the theophylline aptamer (pictured below, courtesy of the Aptagen website ).
Figure 1: Folded Theophylline RNA aptamer. This picture is from the Aptagen Database.
In our biosensing projects we utilized the fact that these aptamers tend to dramatically alter their 3-D shape upon binding their targets. In our more experimentally successful Fluorophore-Quencher system this conformational change displaced a quencher from a synthetically constructed fluorescent aptamer reporter -- read about that project here. In our secondary biosensing system, the conformational change restored the integrity of an intentionally compromised Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES), allowing for restored translation of a reporter gene -- read about that project here.
In addition to our biosensing projects using aptamers, we realized that aptamers could have applications in biomanufacturing. Specifically, if we could generate a novel aptamer against pABA (the constituent monomer in p-aramid), we could biotinylate it, attach it to a solid streptavidin surface, and use the resulting  surface to concentrate the"

Lastly, I did a ligation reaction of my BFP+Term parts with different RBS's (B0034, J61100, J61101, J61127).
8/23: After confirming the size of my composite plasmids, I had to make glycerol stocks of everything.  I did another round of overnight culutres, minipreps, restriction digest, and gel electrophoresis to make sure the cell cultures I was making glycerol stocks of were correct.  I made stocks of pCat+TetR+pTet+RFPc/GFPc/YFPc, pTet+B0034+GFP/RFP, BFP+Term, and pCat/J23101+TetR.  All of these parts will be submitted to the Registry.  Today, I also ligated K156026 with pTet and pCat and transformed all of my BFP ligaitons (RBS's+BFP+Term and K156026+pTet/pCat).
8/24:  Today I did a restriction mapping of J23101+TetR, cutting with X,P, and made overnight cultures for K156026 and a part containing the backbone, pSB1C3, which we need all of our submitted parts in.  The rest of the day was spent updating my notebook.
8/25: This afternoon I did miniprep's on all of the overnight cultures of my BFP transformations.  In order to check all of the parts, I set up a restriction digest cutting all of the parts with X,P.  This will both serve as a check to the size of the inserts and allow us to ligate the part with our desired backbone, pSB1C3.  In anticipation of everything working, I made glycerol stocks of K156026, B0034+RFP/GFP, J61127/J61101/J61100+BFP+Term, and pCat/pTet+K156026.

To amplify KanR cassette with (MEpKantME*) and without (pKant*) MEs (~1kb), high fidelity PCR was done using the following forward and reverse primers. 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol. The same preparation was done as on 7/9/2018, but now with a gradient of annealing temperatures.
Primer combination(s) and expected fragment(s) are identical to as on 7/9/2018. Based on previous experiments, it suspected that the usual pSB1K3 plasmid sample is contaminated, so it was decided to work with a different vial (isolated in 2010, by iGEM Team TU Delft).
The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 45sec and an annealing temperature range from 65°C to 72°C. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4 °C.

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
KanR cassette PCR fragments (with and without MEs) were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 5μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
This gel shows that the initial template used indeed did not contain pur pSB1K3. The 2010 isolate was a useful alternative to this, showing that the problematics was due to template contamination.
