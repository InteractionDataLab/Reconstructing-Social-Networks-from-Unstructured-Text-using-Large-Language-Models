More research on the Cre-lox system done. A means of     switching on and off may be required. Parts for the cre-lox system sought from     the parts registry.
Mammalian parts identified from 2011 DTU-Denmark iGEM team.     These are not standard assembly parts. Need to make a decision on how these     will be used, ie. do we go down the PlugnPlay assembly route. It may be     necessary as standard mammalian parts have not been located in the registry. Clarification     on using PlugnPlay has been sought from IGEM on assembly rules.

Day 1 was mutiny. Five students had met with a sponsor in the morning and when the two captains returned to the room, the students were milling around, whispering under their breath, and fidgeting. The problem was with motivation towards the project, as some students felt that it wasn’t novel enough. We had found a 1998 paper by Duport et al. that explained how their team developed yeast to produce pregnenolone and progesterone - the things we wanted to make. It turns out though that the paper didn’t lead to anything, the strain has been lost, and it was a good proof of concept for our idea. From the uprising we learned to communicate thoroughly.

Our yeast strain is going to have all the genes to make progesterone, as well as the lactase enzyme so that we can feed it lactose and it break it down to glucose and galactose. We figured out after much deliberation how we could have our friends in developing nations get the accurate dose of progesterone. We learned from our mentor that we could use a technique to measure the weight of an object using a coat hanger, and depending on weight, calculate the amount of lactose inside that container. This would be the dairy that the people have on hand. Depending on weight, we will have a chart that says how much lact"

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," that targeting Bfr to the sphereactor would concentrate iron in large particles in the cytoplasm.
We also designed a new part, but didn’t complete it yet, based on BBa_K562002 that produces a fusion between the Pdu40 tag and the HybA 16-Fe ferredoxin from Escherichia coli. The Pdu40-HybA fusion was designed so that the native Tat signal peptide and C-terminal transmembrane helix from HybA were removed . The construct also carries a C-terminal HA tag and is currently in the pT7.5 vector awaiting transfer into pSB1C3. It is hypothesised that the co-expression of PduD40-BfrHA and PduD40-HybAHA would fill the sphereactor with ferric oxide- and iron sulfide-containing proteins. Finally, in order to make an inorganic metal particle within the sphereactor it was planned to target a temperature-sensitive protease into the microcompartment with a view to destroying the protein backbone holding the iron compounds. The protease chosen was DegP from Escherichia coli, which is a chaperone at 30 C and a protease at 37 C. We designed a new part, but again did not complete it in time, based on BBa_K562002 that produces a fusion between the Pdu40 tag and the DegP protease lacking its N-terminal Sec signal peptide and carrying a C-terminal HA tag. The PduD40-DegPHA construct has been assembled in pT7.5 but has not been moved into pSB1C3 yet.
What could a magnetic bacterium be used for? We imagine that engineering magnetic particles in bacteria could be coupled to other bioremediation processes. For example, iGEM teams working on environmental or medical problems may want to recover the engineered organisms at the end of the treatment. Being able to recover all engineered bacteria by use of a magnet may be one solution.

The Pattern-Formation Game
TOP
Overview
To generate Turing pattern using synthetic biology, we thought quite a few systems. We analyzed some of them and checked if they can generate a pattern and how the pattern can be. We used some differential equations and multi-agent simulation for this. From modeling, it was suggested that it is difficult to find the parameters that certainly satisfies the condition on pattern formation. However, some trends on parameters were observed.
The aim of the modeling
Turing mechanism is based on a mathematical model ( mathematics page). We modeled our system in order to understand it mathematically as well as to find the parameter that satisfies the condition for forming a pattern.
Background
In order to understand our system and analysis, some basic knowledge for Turing pattern is needed. We’d like to introduce some mathematical basics of Turing Pattern to make it easier to understand our project in the mathematics page.
The flow of whole modeling project
Analysis and explanation of pattern generation
We first showed that the first system cannot form a pattern. To solve this problem, we decided to use colicin. Why we choosed to use colicin is qualitatively explained here.
System Analysis
As we saw above, it is difficult to satisfy the conditions for forming Turing pattern. Thus, at first we tried to weaken this conditions, to find the paramerer range which would form the pattern.
We succeeded in determining the range, however, due to the fructuations, it turnd out that they no longer certainly generate Turnig pattern.
How the pattern will be in the last
In this part, we simulated how the pattern wil be. we constructed a mathematical model which describe our system, and applied the sets of parameters found in the previous analysis.
we did simulation on on dimension and two dimension case.
one dimension:
The analysis on one dimension. Assuming that E. coli are in a long and thin container. Stripe pattern would appear, if the optimization of part 1 is well conducted. We also checked how long it would take to form the pattern, and whether a periodical pattern would appear.
two dimension:
Generally, the model showed various patterns: spot, stripe, competition,... etc. in two dimension case.
We used the set of parameters obtained in the first analysis.

2012 Taiwan iGEMer Fest
Synthetic biology is a new research area which has been  developing at an amazing speed in recent years. One of the important events  that contribute to its development is the International Genetically Engineered  Machine (iGEM) competition. Students that participate in iGEM share their ideas  with top students all around the world by building their own biological systems  using standard, interchangeable parts.
Students from Taiwan began to participate in this event from  2007. The number of teams from Taiwan has increased to 4 from only 1 at the  beginning. Considering that Taiwan is a small island on the Earth and lack of source  to let all students do their best on international event, a platform for  communication and cooperation between students from Taiwan are really needed.  So, a  meeting for Taiwan iGEMers -- 2012 Taiwan  iGEMer fest -- held at National Yang Ming University  (NYMU) on August 15th (Wed).
The  theme of this meeting is “iGEM – let the crazy idea come true"". During the meeting, students made subjective  reports and reviews. iGEM teams display the current progress of their projects,  and share their experiences with meeting participants.
The meeting will open to all undergraduates, graduate  students and researchers who are interested in iGEM and synthetic biology. We  encourage the participants to interact with each participant during this time  meetup. The meetup is supported by Institute of Biomedical informatics, NYMU.
Feedback
I’m so  glad to have the opportunity to  participate in the 2012 Taiwan iGEMer fest because this is the first time that  iGEM teams from Taiwan got together to share our interest in Synthetic biology  and iGEM. As a freshman in NYMU-Taipei iGEM team and just coming to NYMU nearly  a year ago, the happy in my mind cannot be described with words.
At the beginning  of the fest, the leaders of three teams introduced each team members to  everyone. Although we had probably communicate with each other before on the  facebook where offers the client a way to  build up clubs, I  made a lot of friends who study in NTU or"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," project. With this is mind, George went back to Hornsey UTI clinic to speak with Dr. Sheela Swamy and Professor Malone-Lee, the consultant clinician as well as the principal investigator of the laboratory associated with the clinic. The Professor’s feedback on our project was extremely positive. “Biofilms have a profound effect on antibiotic resistance and so bacteria that can penetrate through biofilms strikes me as a very sensible project direction.”
Dr. Sheela Swamy, Hornsey UTI clinic, said:
“We get through so many buckets of antibiotics here, if your product could prevent infections or reduce our reliance on those antibiotics that is hugely appealing as a practitioner.”
“It will be really great if we actually have bacteria engineered to achieve biofilm and cellular penetration and a bactericidal effect will be a total seller. That may be the answer to the Chronic UTI if we can get it to work.”
The doctors at the UTI clinic left us with a few points to bear in mind as we are currently focused on only killing Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa :
The bladder biome is complex with many culturable and nonculturable pathogens. What role each of these have and what concentration they need to be in to cause UTI symptoms is unknown.
Uropathogens listed in literature are not the only organisms responsible for UTI as they are also present in normal controls yet don't cause symptoms.
Bacteria are opportunistic and a skin commensal if in the bladder can cause symptoms, and we have had many women with pyuric UTIs even though they only grew a Staphylococcus so you may have to try develop something that works on a wide spectrum of bacteria.
Speaking with Patients
During his time meeting with Dr. Sheela Swamy and Prof. Malone-Lee, George was invited to attend a pair of clinic sessions in which chronic urinary infection patients came to see doctors and change their treatment plan or give samples for urinalysis. During these sessions George sat in on 8 consultations and interviewed 6 urinalysis patients to gain an understanding of their symptoms and the way their infection is currently managed. George was also given the chance to interview each of these patients and learn what they thought about antibiotic regimes, catheter-based delivery and our synthetic biology solution to their infections.

Cultivations of the Different PtNTT2 Variants
Given that Zhang et al., 2017 reported some kind of toxicity resulting from the N-terminal sequence of PtNTT2, we first investigated if we could also observe the same toxicity associated with the N-terminal sequence. We also tested whether our own versions of the transporter results in better growth and reduced toxicity compared to the native transporter. Therefore, after cloning the plasmids in E. coli DH5α and verifying the correct assembly via sequencing, all plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The presence of the correct plasmids was again verified by colony PCR.   The first cultivations were carried out in shake flasks in LB media. A total cultivation volume of 50 mL was used. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 180 rpm in 500 mL shake flasks. All cultures were inoculated with an OD600 of 0.01. OD600 was measured every hour during lag and stationary phase and every 30 minutes during the exponential phase. The optical density was measured using an Eppendorf Photometer and standard cuvettes. E. coli BL21(DE3) without a plasmid and E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were used as negative controls. Two biological replicates of each strain were tested and three technical replicates were measured for each timepoint.

... is the future
The nowadays production methods of antibodies are not only time-consuming and costly but are at the expense of animal lives. Antibodies have many applications in research, diagnostics, and show great promise in treatment of cancer. But the advancement is held back due to the expensive and tiresome production. Therefore we propose an alternative to antibodies; peptide aptamers – produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The variable loop of the peptide aptamer is generated through a random nucleotide library and held together by an enzymatic inactive version of human Thioredoxin (hTrx) as a scaffold protein. We are using the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen for functioning peptide aptamers that are able to bind our chosen target proteins (‘antigens’). In this model bacteria expressing a functioning peptide aptamer will express Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which enables us to isolate them. To challenge the antibody tradition, we are also proposing a production model.

We’ll all go over this paper again in preparation for Friday so we can order the reagents that we will need for this.
5/9/13
Today the primers designed for dspB, AmyA, and Savinase were received in the mail. Cholera overnights #1 were seeded and left in the 30 degree incubator. Overnights were made by adding: 4 mL SSW LB + 0.5 mL previous cholera overnight.
5/10/13
We started a new V. cholerae culture and seeded it from the cultures started on 5/3/2013. The biofilm growth continues to be really good when using our SLB media. We also got our primers back so we will start our pcr and cloning for AmyA and Savinase on Monday.
We also compiled the following list of necessary reagents for our enzyme assay. We sent the list to Dr.  Grose to see what is available here and what needs to be ordered. We will alter the protocol on Monday to fit our specific needs.
Enzyme Assay:
Equipment:
96-well microtiter plate
96-pin replicator to seed the plates
Nunc-Immuno wash 8 channel device (they used to rinse the plates, I don't know if we need this or can use something else)
BioTek FL600 plate reader to measure absorbance
Reagents:
Crystal violet stain
CTC stain (5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride)
95% ethanol
For baselines they used urea and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) with Na2S203 as a neutralizing agent

Workshop ""Drugs in the Environment"" in Berlin
Figure 1: Description
At the end of May we joined the ""Drugs in the environment"" conference that was organized by the RCDS (which is the youth organisation of the CDU, the  currently governing political party in Germany) and the German Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies .
During this discussion meeting we had the possibility to meet and discuss with several experts in the field such as xxx and xx as well as with representatives of leading German pharmacy companies such as Bayer and Novartis.
Participation on the 4 th Water Research Horizon Conference “Water Scarcity and Global change” in Berlin
Figure 2: 4th Water Research Horizon Conference “Water Scarcity and Global change” in Berlin
The main goal of the participation on the 4th Water Research Horizon Conference “Water Scarcity and Global change”  in Berlin on the 25th of June 2013 [ Water Research Horizon Conference ] was to inform ourselves about worldwide water scarcity and global change to get inspirations in for our outreach and human practice effort. Moreover we were interested in the worldwide practical realization of minimization of “the water problem” in different countries in diverse ways of use and transformation (see Figure 2) to see how our project fits into this scope. In addition to the main speeches of ambassadors from different communities and companies we participated on a workshop session with speeches and discussion called “Water and Soils for Food and Energy - A Question of Technological Development?”.
We realised that it is quite difficult to give a straight answer to this question. J. Bouma (formerly Wageningen University, The Netherlands) answered it with “No, not alone, but start with existing technology"

ZJU-China,2010,Team:ZJU-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," that few other scientific concepts could match the simplicity and scope of this concept. Synthetic biology poses a brilliant example of giving the public a big picture so that they can quickly understand. Then the communication between scientists and the public is possible. Yet the space between researchers and public is appropriately far enough, so the scientific research won't expose to the public opinion. However, only the comfortable public relationship is not enough, the development of synthetic biology still needs a solid foundation in a philosophical perspective to cope with the men intoxicated with the prospect of unlimited power and also with apathy with the powerless. That is what our human practice project aims to do at the beginning stage of synthetic biology.
The Implication of Our Project- Gene Composer, Bach
    Our project is named after a well-known Composer, Johann Sebastian Bach, whose bravura works brought Baroque period to its ultimate maturity. In the realm of music, composers can enrich the music styles by controlling of harmonics and adaptation of rhythms and forms. Likewise, in our project, our gene composer is able to recompose the input coding sequence by synonymous substitution, optimization and RIPS (ribosome initiation per sec) design so that the discordant tunes of codon bias in versatile biobricks could be synchronized. And by controlling the information flowing rate which represents as the RIPS, the recomposing process will significantly improve the compatibility of the biobricks and the stability of the biological machine. Additionally, our project of gene composer leaps forward to the goal of standardization. By synonymous substitution and RIPS design, researchers will be able to set up a universal language of coding sequences to characterize and standardize versatile biobricks. In might future, changing a biobrick in a biological machine will be as easy as changing a hard drives in a laptop. Plug a new one in, off you go. And that will be the plug-and-play mentality of synthetic biology world.
Philosophical Enquiry of Synthetic Biology
    Synthetic biology, combines the element of engineering, chemistry, computer science and molecular biology, seeks to assemble the biological tools necessary to redesign the living world. It is such similar as the physics applies in the electronic engineering and chemistry applies in the chemical engineering. But synthetic biology has a distinctive difference with the above two. It brings the engineering concept to the living organisms rather than to the lifeless substance. Moreover, in the might future, the distinctions between vivid biosphere and lifeless mechanical world are no longer such apparent, because synthetic biology may blurs the dividing line of these two. Considering the peculiar character of synthetic biology, we believe the philosophical enquiry of synthetic biology is"

Our team made an effort to spread the idea of synthetic biology to the community in a somewhat traditional manner as well. We conducted talks and workshop for undergraduate students. In addition to that, we also held similar activities to reach out to high school students, who will be entering university in a near future.
Talks
Presentations are one of the most common and effective ways to share information and convey messages. This year, HKUST iGEM Team held two sessions of presentations for the freshmen. One session was conducted on the 26th of September for freshmen from School of Science, and another one was conducted on 13th of October for freshmen from School of Engineering. Through the presentations, we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM, explained briefly about our main project, shared our experiences joining the iGEM competition and encouraged the freshmen to join iGEM in the future. It was good to see students with different intended majors equally participate in the talk, and moreover show their enthusiastic attitude on synthetic biology and iGEM competition.
Fig 1. Science talk
Workshop
Fig 2. Workshop for college undergraduate science students
To help HKUST students become more familiar with iGEM research activity, we felt that a hands-on laboratory experience would be a very interactive method for them to have a better understanding of synthetic biology. It would be an effective way to get those students introduced to the practical aspect of iGEM research.  Therefore, our team organized a workshop on the 7th of October for a group of 15 interested freshmen. This three-hour workshop was divided into two sessions - talk and wet lab. For the talk, our team first explained about the basics of synthetic biology and iGEM, as well as the rough idea of building constructs. We also introduced them to some common experiments in a synthetic biology laboratory. For the wet lab session, the participants were divided into smaller"
Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," majority component of PHA produced but rather PHB. Recalling the dubious results we observed from the aforementioned experiment where we tested different amounts of starting substrate, the errors observed here suggest that there is a fundamental inaccuracy in the formulated system of ODEs that biases PHV biosynthesis through bktB.
Exploring the impact of phaA and bktB enzyme levels on final PHBV composition
Measured melting temperatures and inferred molar composition of PHBV
In the lab, we measured the melting temperatures of PHBV produced from strains expressed phaA and/or bktB. From the melting curves of the material, we may infer an approximate range of the molar composition of the PHBV polymer (table below). Comparing the inferred molar ratio based on literature (Anjum et al., 2016) with the surface plot (right) showing the PHBV composition from various enzyme levels, we can make a number of observations.
First, the maximal percentage of PHV in the co-polymer is approximately 30%. Compared to the significantly higher ratios predicted from our previous experiment with different propionate substrate levels, we may speculate that the enzyme level does not act as a great contributing factor to the %PHV as the amount of fatty acid supplied. Of course, this should be a tentative remark given the skeptical nature of the model.
Second, we may be able to optimize our model with the experimental data. From what we observe along the surface plot, the physiologically relevant range of PHV content (~20% max; Anjum et al., 2016) is achieved at as low as an enzyme concentration of bktB of 0.5 nM. It is worth noting that it may be due to the fact that the concentrations of other enzymes in the system (phaB, phaC are set at a “high” level of 0.1 μM, and perhaps these values should be adjusted were we able to obtain any new information on physiological conditions of the enzymes. On the other hand, the phaA enzyme level does not influence the end composition. This shows that it is imperative to refine our model to account for the phaA and bktB enzymes’ ability to react with common substrates. That is, phaA may be able to compete for propionyl-CoA from bktB.
Exploring the impact of different turnover rates for phaA and bktB on final PHBV composition
If we were to experiment with other parameters, we would also observe similar feats to the aforementioned. For instance, we may choose to"

pETblue
Since a critical part of our project was the overexpression, chosing the correct vector was crucial. Of particular importance are of course the quality of the promotor and the RBS, as well as a His-Tag for purification. All these parts are available in the parts-registry, but even with the convenient cloning of BioBricks, we thought a more conventional approach would suit our needs better. We chose a pET-vector, which we could easily modify by ligating it with annealed oligo nucleotides. The vector pETBlue-1 already came equipped with a T7-promotor and a LacZ site (see figure 1).
Figure 1: Plasmid map of pETBlue-1 [1] . XbaI and XmaI were used to insert the annealed oligo nucleotides to create an easily accessible vector for overexpression.
Figure 2: Product of olio nucleotide annealing for insertion in pETBlue-1.
Using the oligo nucleotides depicted in figure 2, we were able to create a convenient vector for IPTG-inducible overexpression of genes in the RFC25 standard. The aligned oligo nucleotides had sticky ends to ligate with XbaI and EcoRI sites, creating a scar.
The DNA fragment from annealed oligos was to introduce:
very strong RBS
6xHis-Tag
Thromin-cleavage-site
NgoMIV-compatible restriction site for in-frame insertion
The last point proved to be somewhat tricky. Unfortunately, as figure 1 shows, pETBlue-1 is not optimal for"

The next stop, Xiamen INNOVAX Biotech Co., Ltd. The same, it is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Wan-Thai Bio-Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which is committed to providing high quality and affordable innovative vaccines to the public for human disease prevention. Since its inception in 2005, the corporation has successfully listed the world's first vaccine to against HEV.
Visiting Mr. Minglue Su, founder and chairman of Xiamen Kymem Membrane Technology Ltd.
On September 30th 2018, we visited Mr. Su, founder and chairman of Xiamen Kymem Membrane Technology Ltd, to have a deep discussion about information related to enterprises. He shared with us his experience of setting-up a new company, and rendered us prepared for drawing up business plans.
In the view of Mr. Su, having a sufficient knowledge about not only your company, but your competitors' on the basis of market analysis was the premise of drawing up a good business plan. The business plan should involve some basic parts, namely the company's technology introduction, market potential demand, market actual demand, team composition and competitive team analysis. We introduced our project, which joined competition this year, to Mr. Su, and highlighted the hardware products which we independently developed. Mr. Su expressed his expectation for the potential of our hardware equipment in the medical field. But on the other hand, given that starting a new business is tough, Mr. Su believed that our team would encounter five “new” threats in the initial stage, that is, new team, new cooperation partners, new capital, new technologies and new customers.
He also mentioned that at the initial period of our business, not only the company's internal developing problems, but also the constrictions of the external environment would be the obstacle. Referring to his personal accumulated experience, Mr. Su further gave us some suggestions targeting on starting a new business: considering that China's current intellectual property law system was still imperfect, innovative companies, like ours, who were known for their technological advantages must emphasize the patent-protection. What's more, when our brand was still not so influential compared to those prestigious companies, we should put seeking target customers and broadening sales channels on the front burner, and carefully prevent our technology property right from being infringed. On top of that, he proposed that since our hardware product was based on the ""government + grassroots"

Gibson Assembly
Modified from Gibson et al. (2009)
Gibson Assembly
This assembly method is an isothermal, single-reaction method for assembling multiple overlapping DNA molecules. By coordinating the activity of a 5‘ exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase two adjacent DNA fragments with complementary terminal sequence overlaps can be joined into a covalently sealed molecule, without the use of any restriction endonuclease.
Preparation of DNA molecules for in vitro recombination
Generate the complementary sequence overlaps by PCR using the Phusion DNA-polymerase . If necessary add 5 M Betain in the reaction mix by reducing the amount of H2O to decrease the number of false PCR products.
Identify the PCR products of interest by gel electrophoresis with known DNA standards.
Extract the PCR products from the gel by cutting out the DNA fragments and clean them up by using a commercial PCR clean-up kit .

Part 2 - Keratinases
Keratinases are  promising enzymes that find their applicability in agro-industrial, pharmaceutical and biomedicals fields.            We want to profit from them by applying them on clugged pipes full of hair that is a common issue in lots of households.            Keratinases are enzymes that are capable of degrading hair.            Hair mostly consists of alpha-Keratin. Many different keratinases produced by different Bacilli, Actinobacteria and fungi have been reported.            All of them vary by having their specific biochemical and biophysical properties e.g. temperature and pH activity range.            Using their proteolytic capability that destroys hair we want to use them to avoid chemical compounds that are recently mainly applied to cleanse tubes.            By hydrolization of disulfide bonds keratin degrades. This is due to confirmation changes which leads to an exposure of more sites for keratinase action (Satyanarayana et al. 2013, Vignardes et al. 1999). Previous projects from iGEM Teams such as Sheffield 2014, Team Canmore 2015 and Team Canmore 2016 helped us to tackle this problem as they were regarding similar problems.
KerP
The Keratinase KerP is a 33 kDa monomeric protein. KerP is a serine protease. Serine proteases are                         protelytic enzymes, charaterizised by a reactive serine side chain (Kraut 1977). The family                         contains many diffrent enzymes with wide spread functions. Most of keratinases are serine                         proteases capable to degrade recalcitrant protein like nails, hair, feathers (Sharma and Gupta                         2010b). KS-1 has his optimal activity at pH = 9 and 60°C.
KerA
Keratinase gene from Bacillus licheniformis is also a serinetype protease. The mature keratinase secreted by Bacillus licheniformis had a molecular mass of 33 kDa (Lin"

Human Practice
Project
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we attempt to apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically.

[Intro]    [User Interface]    [MoDeL]    [Algorithm]    [Resources]
MoDeL
A new language called MoDeL (Standard Biological Parts Modeling Database Language) is proposed for automatic modeling of biological systems. Due to introducing of novel concepts of species and reaction templates, which are two main components in MoDeL, interactions between species need not to be completely provided and thus making automation possible.

My major is biochemical engineering and the field of my research is                                                 metabolic engineering and synthetic biology,                                                 so iGEM is a rare chance for me to use my major strength to solve practical problems.
After year-long preparation, I have been head over                                                 heels in love with our program and harvested a lot. I really appreciate iGEM.
Beijia Han
My name is Beijia Han, I’m a master student in School of Life Science,                                                 Beijing Institute of Technology. My major is Biology and my research is                                                 focus on enzyme modification. Luckily, I join in the 2016 iGEM competition as                                                 an adviser in BIT-China, and there is a four-year history of our                                                 team (BIT-China) representing our school to attend this prestigious                                                 competition to show our research projects. This year our team project                                                 is mainly about population quality control. As an adviser, my mission                                                 is to help the undergraduate students to solve the problems in this                                                 research and give proper suggestions. It is a challenging task,                                                 but I love this feeling that we fight together.
Anqi Zhou
Hi. I’m Ariel, an enthusiastic and motivated student with great interest                                         in synthetic biology. I’m currently doing my master in Biochemical                                         Engineering. iGEM offers me an excellent opportunity to explore                                         mystery and fun of biology, and I really enjoy the process of                                         scientific research .The most amazing part of iGEM which attracts                                         me is to use knowledge and experience I have by doing the things                                         I love to create things that can make the world a better place.                                         Besides experiments, I have a real passion for traveling around the world and                                         tasting delicious food, because i believe either your body or soul must be on the way.

Hi, I am Liang Zhang and from Beijing Institute of Technology.                                                 As an advisor of BIT-China, I gave a lot of proposals to our program and our program is just                                                 like our baby. We devote ourselves to the research and to make it better is our biggest wish.
My major is biology and the field of research is enzyme engineering, so for me,                                                 this is the first time to touch the synthetic biology. After a yearlong preparation,                                                 I am head over heels in love with it and I harvested a lot. Thanks to iGEM.

Media for Testing Parts
We don't need to buy raffinose if we do tests of pGAL1 as either ON (galactose carbon source) or OFF (glucose).  Because the response is basically all or nothing anyway, this would make a lot of sense.  It will also simplify our testing greatly.
Galactose media is about $175 less expensive than raffinose

1)putting 1 in W303a and one in W303alpha and mating (Selection may require putting repressors on another vector [cut out of pRS304* with Eco and Spe, cut pRS303 with the same, gel purify & ligate] or
2) putting 2 copies of the repressor construct on one vector
B) put the activator under constituative promoter and the repressor under pGAL (too hard & lacks utility)

SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour52_-_-_TEXT.html," and, as part of the experiment, we tested the ability to suppress expression prior to induction. The assay was carried out by measuring protein levels of Dxs fused to GFP using FACS. FACSFluorescence Activated Cell Sorting
A LacI:LVA basic part was available at Parts Registry, and we added a promotor and a terminator, producing a device. The GFP fusion devices with and without the LacI:LVA device were assayed to check for expression control. One triplicate of MG1655 and two triplicates of each MG1655 strains carrying either pSB1C3-Plac-dxs (B. subtilits)-GFP or pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI:LVA-term-Plac-dxs (B. subtilits)-GFP were grown from OD600=0.005 to approximately OD600=0.2. At this OD the MG1655 triplicate and one triplicate of each strain carrying constructs were induced with 1 mM IPTG at time 0 min. FACS measurements were done at times: -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min, thus showing the expression of GFP in each strain - both when induced and when not induced (Fig. 1).
The results show that strains lacking LacI:LVA do not repress expression from the lactose promoter. Even without induction, there is clear expression of GFP. Conversely, strains expressing LacI:LVA repress the promoter until induction. Approximately 90 min after induction of the strain expressing LacI:LVA, protein level is at its maximum. Still, maximum protein level is lower than that of the strain lacking LacI:LVA. Also, the fraction of flourescent cells is lower in the samples of pSB1C3-lacI:LVA-Plac-dxs (B. subtilits)-GFP compared to pSB1C3-Plac-dxs (B. subtilits)-GFP, indicating that expression of GFP is somewhat repressed, despite induction.
This experience has been added to the experience of the part encoding the LacI:LVA basic part on Parts Registry
Figure 1.
Although LacI:LVA was shown to be functional, we found the prolonged and delayed response time together with lowered maximum protein level after induction to be less than optimal. In summary the performance of LacI:LVA as a repressor did not live up to our expectations when comparing it to the constitutively active strains, nor when comparing it to the wildtype"

We picked blue colonies and let them grow overnight. On the other day, we ran minipreps and made glycerol stocks for them.
Besides the struggle with DVs, we proceeded with the PCR of the parts to add MoClo and Restriction sites to them. We ran PCR of J23100 to J23109 primers with circular pSB1C3 template. Ran gel to confirm, but none showed correct bands.
We ran PCR of J23105-J3108 primers with cut 1C3 backbone hoping that would improve the result and we ran a gel to confirm. Again, no success
Then, we performed PCR with J23112 primer on uncut 1C3 backbone. We extended the annealing time from 15 seconds to 30 seconds and also decreased the annealing temperature 4 degrees celsius below the indicated temperature on the IDT sheet as an attempt to improve the primers performance. Again, no success.

Week 1
We ran a restriction digest of all the DVL1 and DVL0 miniprep samples (42 in total!!) cut with BsaI, and ran them  in gel with their uncut counterparts to check sizes before sending them for sequencing.
We proceeded our troubleshooting PCR of the J and B series using sewing/ligation PCR, a 10 cycle PCR reaction amplifying pSB1C3  and transforming it directly. For more details, check the Methodology section for PCR strategies and troubleshooting. In the beginning, the ligation PCR didn`t work, so we tried a gradient temperature. It showed faint bands but enough to move on and improve it.    /li>
We realized that non specific bands may be due to excess of DNA template. We ran the PCR again with the decreased amount of template and they worked. Finally :) :) Currently we have J23100-J23112 and J23110-J23118BA-BE,  except for J23113 BA. The gel pictures for the amplification can be seen below.

For the DVs we submitted for sequencing last week, we checked the sequences by blasting them against the expected fragment. All of them worked, except for the DVL0s: CFDR, DFER, FFBR and GFBR that showed the wrong MoClo sites. We had to begin again the process of making these DVL0s :we redid the PCR for them, performed a restriction"

It is a is a biennial, international meeting that has previously been hosted in Germany, Canada, China, France, Korea, New Zealand, Argentina, USA and South Africa. It aims to bring together bring together academics, technology developers, regulatory authorities, non-government organisations and other stakeholders involved in all aspects of biosafety. The goal is to shape the way GM technology is regulated. (http://isbr.info/ISBGMO14 ).This was the second time that the Symposium has been held in a Latin American country.
Three of our members presented their perspectives regarding our country’s regulation system and proposed new possible ways to improve them. We also talked to the organizers about the importance of youth participation at these events. They said they felt the same and even agreed to give out several scholarships for young scientists to attend.

Risk Analysis Certification
June 2017
Conscious on how crucial it is to protect the biological integrity of our ecosystems, especially when working with genetically modified organisms we helped to organize a Risk Analysis course in which we got certified ourselves by the Mexican Association of Biosafety. We learned the three steps of a Risk Analysis: Risk Assessment, Risk management and Risk communication. We also reviewed the concept of “One Health” that emphasizes the interrelationship between animal, human and plant health. All of these concepts were taken into account when we designed and carried out our project. We also developed a risk analysis ourselves that can be found in our Biosafety section.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html,".  This week we continued to get more familiar with the Arduino Uno microcontroller. We built simple circuits to make an LED light blink in different patterns and how to change the brightness of the light in response to being stimulated (LED will dim in a brightly lit room, and will increase brightness in a poorly lit room).  We were additionally able to contact an electrical engineering lab technician that has had experience working with Arduino and our colour sensor to ensure our circuits and code for the programs we are planning on writing next week are the most efficient and effective they can be. Additionally, we continued with Maya tutorials to ensure our skill levels are ready for animation and the use of the Simbiology toolbox for Matlab.
Week 10:  July 7th - July 11th
We began this week receiving our first purchase order that consisted of 2 Arduino Uno microcontrollers, graphic LCD display, colour and temperature sensors, LED’s, and a soldering station.  Using the Arduino Uno microcontroller and the breadboard we were able to construct the circuit and program the Arduino to calculate temperature and ensure that temperature sensor was accurately operable.  Additionally we received our Arduino kit and have begun experimenting with various components previous to starting our formal experiment. As part of the learning experience, we constructed a circuit with Piezo Elements to play “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” and “Happy Birthday"", and a circuit with the photocell that would shine the LED light brighter when the lights were turned off. After learning how to work with Arduino, our goal was to get the sensors operable with Arduino circuit and programming.  We were able to measure temperatures and determine colour using the temperature and colour sensors respectively. The program and the circuit for the temperature sensor was taken from the manual coming with the Arduino Kit. The program and the circuit for the colour - light sensor was taken from the Parallax official website.
Once the colour sensor was working, we started testing it using red, blue and green colours of different intensities. However, first we had to calibrate it with black and white. In theory, the black measurements are supposed to be 0 0 0 for each of the red, green, and blue components, respectively, but we get measurements around 20 for each of the components. So the numbers we get for black need to be subtracted from the measurements of colours other than black and white. When white is measured, the number for each of the component can be used to determine coefficients that are necessary to convert the input values to colours by going 255/component reading for white colour. When a colour is measured by the sensor,"

Designing our system
A novel biosensor for the detection of microplastics was realized using a top-down black-box approach. Microplastics were identified as the target input and a reporter protein was designated as the output, as depicted in fig. 1. Due to their unreactive nature and varied composition, microplastics were quickly deemed a difficult set of molecules to identify using biological sensing elements, calling for an indirect method of identification if tools of synthetic biology were to be utilized. As discussed in the project description , successfully developing such a device would offer a rapid and cost-effective solution in contrast to the arduous filtration processes that are used today.
Expanding on the groundwork put forward by the UCL’12 iGEM team, establishing the presence of molecules associated with water-bound microplastics was determined to be a viable approach [9]. Two classes of molecules were identified as being commonly associated with microplastics – plasticizers and organic pollutants. They are both lipophilic compounds, allowing trans-membrane diffusion and subsequent intracellular recognition. Escherichia coli was chosen as a functional chassis for the biosensor; not only due to its compatibility with previously developed parts and devices but also as facilitated transmembrane transport of phthalates and organic pollutants has been reported through the FadL and subsequent FadD channels [33] [34]. The system updates are reflected in fig. 2.
Homology analysis of the two nominated compounds and natural ligands to existing sensory elements generated two transcriptional regulators – NahR with affinity for the most common moieties found in organic pollutants and the human estrogen receptor alpha with noted antagonistic interaction with plasticizers [9] [24]. Both NahR and hER-α serve as transactivators in presence of respective cofactors [15] [27]. Both the full-length hER-α and truncated versions have been successfully transformed into E. coli with adequate expression rates, even if the former has shown toxicity at higher expression rates, and NahR has been utilized as an inducible transcriptional factor in multiple iGEM projects [9] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]. Thus, they were chosen as the sensory elements of our circuit, as shown in fig."
Yale,2015,Team:Yale#results_-_-_TEXT.html," amino acid that was incorporated using a genetically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.
Biofilm formation on surfaces is an issue in the medical field, naval industry, and other areas. We developed an anti-fouling peptide with two modular components: a mussel adhesion protein (MAP) anchor and LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide. MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-3,5-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genetically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.

The standard calibration graph for diclofenac concentrations of 10-5 to 104 µg/L we performed is shown in figure 4. The samples of diclofenac incubated with either transgenic moss or recombinant produced and purified laccase did not show any evaluable results. Possibly the used primary antibody shows cross reactivity with the created product of the degradation reaction, so that the assay is not suitable to quantify the degradation product. This has to be checked via LC MS.
The PhyscoFilter for Microcystin
Besides our own approaches to prove the opportunity of cell surface immobilized effectors for the bioaccumulation of those pollutants which cannot be degraded enzymatically so far, we took part in a collaboration with this year’s iGEM team from Dundee and expressed their Protein Phosphatase 1 in our moss. Due to the high amount of free cysteine residues of this protein it is necessary to express it as a secreted or cell surface immobilized protein. For a sustainable removal of PP1’s substrate microcystein we decided to express PP1 membrane-anchored. The naturally occurring membrane turn-over could lead to a degradation of the receptor-bound microcystein through the intra cellular degradation machinery. This way the idea of a self-regenerating biological filter could be realized for non-enzymatically degradable substances, too.
Figure 5: Successfully selected moss with membrane-anchored Protein Phosphatase 1. BUT GFP is mainly localized in aggregates in the cytosolic or endoplasmatic environment. Upper images: GFP-fluorescence; lower images: in each case on the left: brightfield and on the right: GFP-fluorescence plus chloroplast autofluorescence.
In the upper part of Figure 5 fluorescence images of the transgenic moss transformed with membrane-bound PP1 are shown. Conspicuously the fluorescence only occurs in small locally restricted dots which are widespread distributed over the whole cell. Anyway the images give strong indications that the receptor fusion proteins are not membrane associated due to aggregation, assumedly in the endoplasmic reticulum. Probably even the protein folding machinery of our moss cannot handle the correct folding of this construct. Therefore from our point of view protein engineering with subsequent deletion of free cysteine residues could be a suitable next step to decrease the aggregation tendency and thereby increase the amount of membrane localized PP1 with correct folding.

Project Overview
According to an nddb survey, 77% of milk spoilage is due to gram positive bacteria. Loss of milk due to wastage during delivery to markets is mainly in the form of bacterial spoilage due to lack of cooling facilities and long distances to collection centres. The usable life of milk is extended for several days by its refrigeration. But this too depends heavily on a constant supply of electricity. Lactoperoxidase method for preserving milk can be done. But ""leucocytes may activate LP-s through production of hydrogen peroxide, although their presence is obviously undesirable, reflecting mastitic infection. Hydrogen peroxide residues from disinfectant solutions following cleaning of milk containers may also activate the system.""-Report of an FAO/WHO technical meeting. Post pasteurization contamination of milk, particularly with Pseudomonas and some gram-positive psychrophiles can occur.(Seema Rawat,2015).    We have developed a novel system that produces cationic anti microbial peptides(cAMPs) to prolong the shelf life of milk by preventing bacterial contamination. And we make this possible without the hassle of huge equipments and machinery!
Studies which were conducted by Wenzel et al on a hexapeptide containing alternating arginine and tryptophan showed:
  Their peptide was effective against gram-positive bacteria including Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
  It was moderately effective against gram-negative bacteria.
  It had low haemolytic activity and very low toxicity towards human cells.

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," welcomed the new idea of synthetic biology, and want to help the students to expand their horizon. The high school student were curious about what synthetic biology can do, and want to know more about the details. And the kids’ curiosity for synthetic biology was sparked(though they may not know the whole meaning).
 
    We carefully explained the safety problem synthetic biology concerned to the old, and realized it is the first problem that synthetic biology should settled down, in order to apply it to reality. However, some problems of biosafety are easy to settle, while others are hard to make it clear. But what we can do is to improve the safety of our biological machine. And we decided to use less proper nouns while talking to the old and emphasis on the success that synthetic biology have achieved, in order to make them feel freer and easier to accept the idea. And we are very pleased to know that the idea of synthetic biology is valued by most of the public from the dialogue.
 
    What’s more, we found that our methods of attracting attention were useful, but it seemed that we need some other methods to help us to explain the project and synthetic biology. So we designed a software version and a mechanical version (using circuit board) of the biological cipher machine and use it to introduce our project to the public. And a series of postcards with codes that could be deciphered with the software came out, too.
 
 
Advanced activities
    In addition to what we have done to meet the requirements of the silver medal, we attended a national famous experience sharing activity in China, ONEYOUTH Talk. This activity was organized by a local youth organization, Huyou tower in Chongqing, China, and it is a part of the weekly activities there. We were invited there as one of the lecturers, and one of the team members gave an interesting speech about synthetic biology and our project.
 
 
    In order to confirm the effect of the activity, we started to get contact with people of that organization one month and a half before the activity was held. It was a very long and tiring process, since we had to communicate with the organizers from time to time, and give the speech in advance. However, we got many useful feedback from them, which we never thought about before. And when the presentation was over, many people talked to us, and gave some valuable feedbacks, which inspired us to improve the design and execution of our project.
 
    There was also a fair in the location of the Talk for people to sell some interesting made by themselves, and local people would"

As a Beginner, Be a Learner.
    As the first time to participate in iGEM, we lack experience.             In order to be more effective in preparing for the competition,             we actively contacted with other excellent team, visited their             school to ask how to prepare for iGEM. These teams include: Peking, HZAU-China, HUST-China, FAFU-CHINA, WHU-China (2015).
We took photos with Peking team for memorial after the visit.
     In addition, we also participated in the 2016CCiC (Central China             iGEM Consortium), and exchanged ideas with the participants of             the 30 other teams, receiving a lot of valuable experience and advice.
All the participants took a group photo after the closing ceremony
In view of the overall design and experimental design of the project,             we contacted with Jiang Huifeng, a researcher of Tianjin Institute             of Industrial Biotechnology and Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Kang             Peng, a Proffessor of Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry CAS.             And we went to the laboratory to study the related mature theories and             experimental techniques of Blue Leaf.
As a Beginner, Be a Communicator.
    Because it is             the first time for us to participate in this competition, the             students around and teachers from other schools of our university             do not know much about synthetic biology and iGEM. In order to             promote iGEM and synthetic biology, we conducted three preach             activities. On the one hand, it attracted students from other             schools look down upon biology. On the one hand, it also letted             the teachers and students around us know that we are participating             in a very meaningful competition.
     At present, the high advancement of the Internet makes             information dissemination and exchange become fast and             convenient. In recent years, the rise of the network             video broadcast, makes three-dimensional exchange become             vivid, more time-sensitive. This year iGEM also called             on each iGEMor to ""Be Social"". As the sponsor and the main             planner, we jointly organized ""Talk with LanZhou, Talk about             iGEM"" online live sharing activities with LanZhou i"

Overview
    We design a complete and high precision microfluidic device. After our calculation and simulation, this microfluidic device reaches a balance of the actual experimental results and dimensional accuracy. This device plays a crucial role In the course of specific experiments. On the one hand, the structure design and the size layout of the device can greatly accelerate the flow of the AHL substance and also allow the cells at the edges of the expanded colony to be washed away by the high flow of the main channel, which allow for continuous exponential growth of bacteria in the chamber. On the other hand, through ingenious circuit design, we have designed a light source system, which can quickly convert two different light sources to meet the needs of light control experiments. In order to reduce the interference of external light , we design a drawer-style shell structure on the basis of micro-fluid plate, which can not only ensure the bacteria to accept light uniformly conducive to micro-fluid plate in the bacteria evenly accept light, but also achieve light-control system and oscillation System coupling.
Microfludic Chip
    Although we have constructed a sophisticated oscillatory system in E.coli, alternating quorum sensing molecules will be retained in the bacterial solution, and the increasing AHL, DPD concentration will affect the stability of the following oscillation. So we also need a microfluidic system to keep away the molecules induced by bacteria and some metabolic wastes. According to the literature of Jeff Hasty et al., We redesigned the devices in the literature to improve the production process, and eventually forming our own microfluidic chip.
    The process begins with closing the media inlet, opening the waste outlet, and slowly injecting the treated bacteria from the cell inlet, during this time, we change the feeding speeds continuously so that"

I am Trista. I was born in HK. I am a year 3 student studying Biotechnology and Microbiology. I like watching movies and reading leisure books. It is a special experience to participate in the iGEM competition. In my team, I am responsible for the investigation of the project and what I have to do are the practical parts. My team members and I are actually having a great time in the lab. I enjoy the time when we are working together. It is a valuable chance to work with them. I am so happy working with my nice partners.
Salma Jalal
Hi, I am going into my second year of undergraduate studies majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I applied to iGEM in an attempt to broaden my knowledge of not only theoretical but also practical Biochemistry, since previously I have only enrolled in one elementary course in the subject. Having had no previous lab experience, I have made my share of mistakes in the lab, but it is all worth the relief and pride you feel when an experiment finally gives you the result you want. I am really happy to have been given the chance to be a private investigator and to work with the most wonderful teammates.
Tse Kung Ki, Quatre
Hi! This is Quatre. I am a Year 3 undergraduate student at HKU doing Chemistry and Finance. iGEM provides me a valuable experience in synthetic biology, which I have never heard of before. I pretty enjoy the time I spent on iGEM, the laboratory work, the human practices and video shooting. iGEM is indeed a very nice competition and I am looking forward to seeing you guys at MIT this November!!

Motivation
    Communication between the scientific community and the public has been a problem. Though synthetic biology won’t “save the world”, we do not want to have its potential wasted by the misunderstanding of the public. So we organized some educational activities for the public to bridge the gap. And we also get our own perception adjusted according to their feedback.
     But as for the current solution for this problem, there are not many typical modes that can be built upon. We realized the hardness caused by this, and would like to establish a new mode for better public engagement.
 
A stall for education
    We consider that it is easier for people to understand a new idea if it is presented in a more familiar scene for them.  So we integrated our activities into local activities that people choose to participate in the weekends. We want to convey a concept that “science can be a part of their life, and their engagement do matters”.    In that way, we need to prepare some funny things to attract people’s attention. Various creative educational tools are designed by team members. We think about using a stall that integrates these tools to introduce synthetic biology and our project to the public. The stalls were put up in different places, such as the exhibition hall of STEM festival and the information hall of a science & technology museum. And we adjusted the types of the tools and the way to communicate with people in the process of activities conducting.

Second, vector dissociation and either degradation or nuclear target complex binding takes place in either dissociated or complexed form, as given by equations 8, 9 and 10.
$$\frac{d[plasmid]}{dt} = k_{unpack}[complex\,intracell]-k_{bind \,plasmid}[plasmid]-k_{deg}[plasmid]\tag{8}$$
$$\frac{d[plasmid\,bound]}{dt} = k_{bind \,plasmid}[plasmid]-k_{NPC}[plasmid\,bound] \tag{9}$$
$$\frac{d[complex\,bound]}{dt} = k_{bind \,vector}[complex\,intracell]-k_{NPC}[complex\,bound] \tag{10}$$
Subsequently, transport to the inner part of the nucleus is believed to take place through first binding to a nuclear pore complex (NPC) and finally inside the nucleus dissociation of the nuclear target complex takes place. This is represented by equations 11 till 16.

Changing Direction
After public survey and discussions with experts, we came to the conclusion that the project on Trichophyton rubrum study was almost infeasible. Meanwhile, through the investigation and communication, we found that skin cancer needed more public attentions. So we decided to shift the focus of our project from Trichophyton rubrum to skin cancer.

KaiB interacts with phosphorylated KaiC, thereby decreasing the positive role of KaiA on KaiC and promoting dephosphorylation of KaiC.
Non-phosphorylated KaiC is bound by KaiA and the cycle begins again.
Aim 2: Measuring the output of the phosphorylation status of KaiC through pPhoB, pOmpC and pOmpF.
Although the direct target of RpaA is still unknown, there still some predicted targets.
Since SasA and RpaA is highly homologous to EnvZ and OmpR, respectively, we predicted that RpaA may also bind to the targets of OmpR.
Besides,PhoB and OmpR are response regulators in the same subfamily and are highly homologous. Thus. PhoB may be a predicted target. Response  regulators  is composed of an  N-terminal  phosphorylation  domain  and  a C-terminal DNA binding effector domain connected by a ﬂexible interdomain linker.
Aim 3: Tuning the period of oscillation by regulating the amount of KaiA.
KaiA and KaiBC proteins is under the control of the inducible promoter in order to tune the period of oscillation by regulating the amount of KaiA

Caltech,2008,Team:Caltech#Project#Phage Pathogen Defense_-_-_TEXT.html," AHL inducible switch under three different RBSs.  The data show induction efficiency is directly correlated with strength of rcsA overexpression (Figure 5, columns 2-4). In each of the constructs, there is a 3 to 5 fold increase in phage levels after induction with 10 nM AHL. This increase does not accurately reflect the dynamic range of the AHL inducible promoter, because it does not take into account the background phage levels without the promoter. In the weaker RBSs (B0032 and B0033), the phage concentration from the uninduced supernatant is comparable to the background level from the promoter-less construct (Figure 5, columns 1-3). Thus, in these inducible promoter systems, there is high dynamic range and negligible background compared to basal phage concentrations. However, in the strongest RBS (B0034), the uninduced phage level is an order of magnitude higher than the promoter-less background level. This high basal level expression suggests that the higher expression levels due to the strong RBS is leading to leaky rcsA activation of the phage lytic cycle.
Figure 5 - rscA induction of phage production. In this figure, each construct was infected with λ phage and lysogens were selected. Lysogens were grown to OD600=0.1 and rcsA was induced with 10 nM of AHL. 1.5 hours after induction, the supernatant was used to titer wildtype stock of E. coli. Plaques were counted to calculate the phage concentration inside the supernatant after induction. For more information see induction protocol.
cI reduces rcsA induction
The high level of background phage induction in the strongest AHL inducible rcsA switch was not optimal. If the high basal phage levels could be reduced, then the dynamic range of the inducible switch can be greatly increased. cI, the λ repressor, has been shown to directly inhibit UV induction of lysogens [13], and RcsA seems to competitively interact with cI in λ induction [7]. Both of these properties suggest that increased concentration of the λ repressor should lead to lower phage induction levels. cI was constitutively expressed downstream of the strongest AHL inducible switch. As expected, expression of cI reduces the phage release and rcsA induction in both the off-state as well as the induced state. Phage concentration was reduced by more than 1.5x106 pf"

Interlab study
Overview
As this is the first time we participate as a High School team, it was also the first time we participated in the second edition of the InterLab Study, where we were requested to measure the relative fluorescence of three devices containing a GFP as an expression marker and three different promoters of the same family.
In this section of our wiki, we will present our results, as well as the protocols we used and how we determined the device was actually assembled.
The devices were constructed with promoters from a family of constitutive promoters described by Chris Anderson (iGEM Berkeley Team, 2006). There are 20 promoters that have different efficiencies. This time we reported the relative efficiency of the following promoters:
1) Promoter BBa_K823005 in pSB1C3
2) Promoter BBa_K823008 in pSB1C3
3) Promoter BBa_K823013 in pSB1C3
We then assembled each one of them with a GFP cassette (BBa_I13504 in pSB1A2). The efficiency of the promoters is measured using a GFP because this is one of the most used expression markers, making it easy to compare relative fluorescence and test which promoters is being more efficient.
We measured the fluorescence in RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) with the Microplate Fluorescence and Luminiscence Reader Fluoroscan Ascent FL from Labsystems.

Week 9. (29/08-04/09)
More mealworms were dissected. BBMVs from both mealworms and varroa mites were made. Vesicles were tested whether they would break in the presence of SDS. They did. An SDS-PAGE of all vesicles and protein extracts from different  strains Bacillus, kindly provided by Lisa, was performed. Transformation was performed with new competent cells and ligation mix made a week earlier. This resulted in colonies.
Week 10. (05/09-11/09)
A colony PCR with verification primers was performed on seven colonies. 6 colonies did not have an insert. One colony had two bands: one with the length that correspondents for no insert and one that correspondents for the right insert. The bacteria used for this PCR were streaked out on a plate and again a colony PCR was performed with verification primers on 6 colonies. 4 Colonies had an insert with the right length and 2 contained an empty plasmid. An overnight measurement of vesicles breaking of BMMVs from mealworms and varroa mites was performed in the presence and absence of SDS. Kinetic values were calculated for standard breaking. Addition the protein extracts from different Bacillus strains (including the Cry3Aa strain) did not change the values. Cry3Aa was dissolved under alkaline conditions out of the protein extract. This was analyzed with SDS-PAGE.
Week 11. (12/09-18/09)
More BBMVs out of varroa mites were made. These were analyzed with DLS. A glycerol stock of E. coliDH5alpha with the Cry Gene was made. The plasmid was miniprepped. More solution buffer was made. Negative controls for fluorophore leaking experiments were made. Experiments with Cry3Aa (obtained by dissolving the protein extract under alkaline conditions) were performed and showed positive results. However, graphs start looking weird after a certain time. Bacteria from Delft were inoculated. Later from these bacteria, samples were prepared for fluorescence measurement and this measurement was performed.
Week 12. (19/09-25/09)

project
The website ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"" promotes the development of synthetic biology through providing genetic parts. To expand its influence in data exchange, we found it necessary to build an app client for it. In order to save time in searching BioBrick, simplify the process of selecting classifications, and facilitate changing selected category, we will dedicate ourselves to adjust database structure so that we can change the interface of BioBrick searching into spinner-formed .(need a tour)

Brief Answers to Safety Questions
Welcome to our Safety Page. We will first answer the safety questions asked by iGEM headquarters briefly, and then discuss safety issues associated with our project in detail. In addition, we will provide our ideas and practice on guaranteeing and developing biosafety.
Q1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: Researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety? No. Our design is based on the commonly used nonpathogenic E. coli K.12 strain and genes we manipulated are original genes in E. coli. The protein products, at least from current understanding, will"
Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Theoryold_-_-_TEXT.html,"R-P. This then diffuses away from the red light sensor, and can bind to a specialised OmpF promoter sequence which is upstream of the HO-pcyA gene which codes for cyan pigment and stop codon. This is then transcribed and cyan pigment is produced.
When Cph8 is exposed to red light, the phosphorylation of OmpR ceases. The OmpR is not capable of diffusing away from the red light sensor, so does not bind to the OmpF promoter before the cyan pigment gene. This means that the cyan pigment can not be generated.  Cyan pigment in this system will be repressed, whereas magenta and yellow pigments will still be produced, which when mixed create a red pigment.
Green light pathway
The green light module works differently to the red and blue light modules but it still uses a light sensor (CcaS), intermediate protein (CcaR) and a specialised promoter. However, when the system is exposed to green light, CcaR is phosphorylated and CcaR-P is generated, allowing the synthesis of the magenta pigment to be up regulated instead of prevented. To make an overall green colour, we only want the yellow and cyan pigments to be transcribed, so production of the magenta pigment is problematic.
To overcome this issue, we will introduce an inverter system. CcaR-P will be produced when the bacteria are exposed to green light, but instead of binding to a promoter placed before the gene coding for magenta pigment, it will bind to a cI repressor system.  The subsequent transcription of the cI repressor protein will prevent the synthesis of the magenta pigment, as it will bind to a cI promoter. Binding of cI to this promoter ceases transcription of any following genes, therefore magenta will not be produced.
Blue light pathway
The YtvA/FixL blue light sensor phosphorylates FixJ to FixJ-p in the absence of blue light.  FixJ-p then binds to the promoter for the yellow pigment gene and stop codon.  In the absence of blue light the Yellow pigment is produced.
The blue light module works in much the same way as the red light module; absence of blue light allows the phosphorylation of an intermediate protein (FixJ) by the blue light sensor (YF1). FixJ can then bind to its specialised promoter which controls the transcription of the yellow pigment (amilGFP). Exposure to blue light leads to the suppression in production of the yellow pigment.
The remaining pigments, magenta and cyan, will combine to form a"

Furthermore, it is important to take the photo in a dark environment. Therefore, we designed a black case in which the test strip can be placed. This black case enables a suitable positioning of smartphone, filters and test strip. The black case can be 3D printed and is therefor cheap and easily customizable.
In short: We provide an easy method for fluorescence detection and analysis.

During the initial screening it was observable that the read lengths do not approach the expected              length of the phage genomes in the 50-70 kbp range for T7 and 100 kbp range for the remaining phages.              Smaller reads generally lead to more ambiguity and but are inevitable due to experimental limitations.
The usual assembly algorithms require the reference genome. As bacteriophage genomes can be highly mosaic,              i.e. the genome of many phage species appear to be composed of numerous individual modules, we could not use              the reference from the database. Consequently, we were forced to perform a de novo assembly, a method of              creating the original sequence by aligning and merging fragments without the aid of a reference genome.
There are several tools available for de novo genome assembly. Unfortunately, most approaches have been              developed for short-read genome assembly (2nd generation sequencing, Illumina) and employ a de bruijn graph              approach.
Here we have 3rd generation sequencing data which must be handled totally different from old short-read              sequencing data: the reads are less perfect in terms of sequencing errors. While short-reads nowadays have              error-rates of about 1% (e.g. 1 base out of 100 is reported incorrectly), this error is up to 15% for              nanopore sequencing data using newest sequencing chemistry (R9.4 at the time of wiki-freeze).
Assemblers suitable for 3rd generation sequencing data are nominal, canu and miniasm being the              most prevalent ones. Both rely on a overlap-layout-consensus approach, which, historically, can be seen              as the father of all assemblers (see celera assembler).
We first used canu to assemble our genomes. The main limitation to any approach in 3rd generation              sequencing data analysis is contamination. Particularly for assembly, contamination is disastrous              because it can lead the assembler into faulty assemblies – depending on the phylogenetic distance of              the original sample and the contamination. In the worst case, the assembler is the collapses all              organism sequences or gives no output sequence at all.
We thus developed sequ-into to first detect              the contamination and also get rid of contamination-originated              reads. More on the performance and finding while using sequ-into can be found at              our Software page.
After eliminating contamination we noticed non-uniform coverage"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," (2006) .   BM3 normally catalyzes the hydroxylation of long chain fatty acids Narhi et al. (1986) , which in our case could inhibit the conversion of valencene. For that reason we used a mutated version of BM3, which is called AIPLF. This variant is an enhanced version of the BM3 AIP version, which has a ten times better substrate oxidation rate for valencene than the wildtype BM3 and produces less byproduct when valencene concentration is saturated. Additionally to previous named benefits the AIPLF variant with 5 point mutations in the active side has a significantly lower binding affinity towards long chain fatty acids and therefore increase the transposition rate of valencene. Schulz et al. (2015) , Lehmann (2016) .

The alcohol dehydrogenase from Pichia pastoris subsequently converts nootkatol into nootkatone by oxidation. It uses NAD+ as a cofactor which is reduced in the reaction. The regeneration of this cofactor is facilitated by the BM3, which oxidizes NADH Schulz et al. (2015) .
Figure 7.6: ADH lvl.1 PTS1 plasmid
Figure 7.7: structure Nootkatone
The first milestone to achieve our goal is the separate integration of each of our three enzymes ValS, BM3 and ADH into level 1 vectors (Dueber Toolbox) in yeast and to verify their expression by Western Blot analysis. Therefore, a 3xFlag/6xHis-tag was added to the N-terminus of each of the proteins.  It enables us to use an anti-His antibody followed by an anti-mouse-antibody to make protein abundances visible. Subsequently, the two enzymes ADH and ValS were combined in a  level 2 cassette plasmid.  BM3 is designed as a level 1 plasmid and will be co-expressed with the level 2 plasmid to achieve a nootkatone production. The expression of the enzymes in the cytoplasm is again verified by Western Blot analysis.   The further approach aims to provide the enzymes with C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signals type one, which finally converts the nootkatone pathway into our artificial compartment.
Since the production of nootkatone does not lead to a change of colour we"

How did we limit risk-taking actions during our project?
E. coli is a relatively safe organism to work with, but we are still engineering genes into our E. coli that confer a number of dangerous properties, such as antibiotic resistance and the ability to create and secrete proteins that are not innate to E. coli. We reduce the risk of allowing our E. coli to grow and reproduce outside of our experiments by wearing gloves, sterilising our biowaste before throwing it away, and spraying down surfaces with ethanol.
How do we envision our project being used in the real world?
We envision our project as a biologically-created weather balloon for exploration on Earth, Venus, Mars, Titan, or other planetary bodies.
What risks might our project pose in the ""real world""? What future work are we doing to reduce these risks?""
Our latex production project could result in the collapse of the southeast asian latex farming industry. Our human practices project focuses around the work that might need to be done in the future for responsibly introducing this production method into the greater community. Other risks that our project may pose is that the balloon may introduce (biodegradable but still foreign) waste onto non-Earth planets, and we can work in the future to increase the degradability of our project as well as develop safe recovery mechanisms for our balloon in space.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," GMOs in the environment. Also we contacted one of the main institutes in the Netherlands involved in sustainable development of amongst others agriculture.
Dr. ir. F. van der Wilk – Executive director of COGEM, the Dutch institute that assesses applications for the usage of GMOs
Goal: Learn more about potential obstacles in the use of GMOs in the environment.
Approach: We talked to Dr. Van der Wilk, who works at COGEM (an institute involved in the assessment of GMO-applications). By posing questions we tried to get an understanding of what aspects of a design are important in the evaluation of the risk of GMO-usage.
Result: Dr. Van der Wilk could tell us more about specific requirements related to our application, since most of the forms that need to be adhered and filled out are quite standard and unspecific.   Dr. Van der Wilk told us that environmental-risk analysis basically involves judging the impact factor. In other words: The chance of occurrence of an event times the environmental effect of this event.  One of the aspects they value in their assessment is the strain of the bacteria that is used. Since we are making use of E. coli K12, this wouldn’t bring much of a hassle, as it is considered save.  Another aspect is the specifity of the modification made: Is the effect of the modification specific for the target, or could it also interfere with other systems?
Furthermore it is of interest if the bacteria spreads. If so, you would need to consider the potential harm of the bacteria in the new environment. Thereby not only physical spreading of the bacteria is considered, but also the exchange of plasmids if modifications are not made in the main DNA-strand. And how long the bacteria can survive in the environment. It could therefore be interesting to look at safety-mechanisms to contain our bacteria, like the beads. However when we consider this solution we should also look at the potential risk of the bead being swallowed by some animal.  Dr. Van der Wilk could not come up with research that overlaps ours. Thereby he assured that there is no fixed measure to assess the potential risk of  GMO-applications. But certain consequences need to be considered and one needs to weigh the potential benefits against risks."

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Checked plates of the cells transformed on June 11 by Ting-Chia and started 3 mL cultures for miniprepping.  Only the DH5a pIJ790 and EPI300 pIJ790 transformed with the 14C and 7C biobricks, respectively, did not seem show any growth upon the first check.  It was unclear as to whether there were actually any 7C (EPI300 pIJ790) colonies growing, so both plates were returned to the 37ºC room to incubate.  For the other plates that did show growth, single colonies were picked and inoculated in 3 mL starter cultures for miniprep.
QIAprep Miniprep kit from Qiagen was used to miniprep 4-3I, 2-3C, and 3-22A.  The cells used were previously inoculated cultures that were stored at 4ºC.  DNA product was stored in sterile dH2O and frozen in the -20ºC freezer.
We received plates of Rhodococcus sp. strain JVH1, Rhodococcus rhodochrous IGTS8 (ATCC 53968), and Baillus sphaericus IGTS9 (ATCC 53969).  Single colonies were picked and inoculated in 3 mL LB at 37ºC at first.  Plates were then parafilm-sealed and stored at 4ºC.
After 20 hours at 37ºC, the plates with 14C and 7C (EPI300 pIJ790) had colonies.  14C only had one colony, while 7C had a couple of small colonies.  The origins of the colonies were uncertain, so the plates were discarded and the cells will be transformed in K12 the next day.  Also, 13M biobrick (RFP gene), which has been verified, will be transformed into EPI300 pIJ790 and DH5a IJ790 to check if the competent cells are working properly or if they are to blame for the failed 14C and 7C plates.
