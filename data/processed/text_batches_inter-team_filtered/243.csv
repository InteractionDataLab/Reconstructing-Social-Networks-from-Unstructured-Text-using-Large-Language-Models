The two equations related to cell      densities contain logistic growth terms of the form $\gamma X(1-\frac{X}{k_x})$, which model the cell growth during      simulation time. Finally the second equation describing the moving cells comes with a variable coefficient Poisson term      $\bigtriangledown (P \bigtriangledown X)$ which describes the cell movement. Last but not least,       we have the two bottom equations. These two model concentrations.      Both contain linear production and degradation terms, which look       like $kX$. It is important to keep in mind that even though the degradation terms  appear as linear terms in the       differential equation the solution will be exponential decay.
To generate the video file, the system has been discretized using a finite volume approach in conjunction,      with an explicit Euler scheme. For finite volume methods to work, we rewrote our equations as conservation laws. Then each       grid point is assigned the area around it, such that flux of cells or molecules leaving one cell enters another one. From      discretizing the integrated conservation law the following expression is obtained in one dimension:

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung"

It is not the big pharma companies that will develop the desperately needed new generation of antibiotics that can even cope with multi-resistant bacteria such as MRSA. Instead, some smaller companies who never gave up researching this field are now future market leaders. As the German business news magazine Wirtschaftswoche reported this June, it is companies like the British-Swedish Astra Zeneca or Hoffmann-La Roche spin off Basilea that are now in a leading position.

Picture by NIAID.
In their article Noneffective Antibiotics published in June, the German business news magazine Wirtschaftswoche explains it as follows: Antibiotics are the natural weapon of molds or soil microbes against competing bacterial growth. These bacteria under siege in turn counterattack with resistances: attack and defense – the natural course of evolution. Thus it was only natural, too, that since the first human use of penicillin and co., pathogens have developed strategies in order to escape the antibiotics’ effect albeit these drugs are quite insidious weapons.

Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Design#PC Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," Results showed that the PC Reporter system worked with a preference for spacer length of about 21 bp when two fusion proteins bind at the same side of the DNA double helix. As the spacer length increased, the luminescence intensity decreased. At the distance of 28 bp where two fusion proteins bind at the opposite side of the DNA double helix, the reconstitution was unstable, thus producing a lower luminescence. However, the luminescence went stronger again when two fusion proteins bind at the same side at the length of 33 bp. And finally it was too far for split luciferase to reconstitute again.
Figure 6. The effect of spacer length variation on the performance of PC Reporter system. Spacer is defined as the sequence between the sgRNA pairs. The spacer length varies from 5 bp to 107 bp. Note that the effect of spacer length exhibits a period of 10-11bp, which is consistent with the structure of DNA double helix.
Taking all the above together, the final design of our PC Reporter system was determined: both fragments of split luciferase fused to N-terminus of dCas9, PAM-out sgRNA orientation, and spacer length of 21 bp. Next we set out to validate whether PC reporter can read out the sequence-specific information using crude PCR product instead of well-purified DNA samples.
Applying PC reporter to crude NAD product
We first carried out specificity test using PC reporter system to distinguish the target plasmid ( BBa_K909009 ) from different kinds of non-specific controls (Figure 7a,b,c). The results showed that the luminescence intensity using the positive target is significantly higher than that of non-specific controls (Figure 7d).

(b) Control with only one site recognized by ""half pair"". (c) Negative control with no site to be recognized. (d) Experimental data. Error bars denote s.d.; n=3.
Also, we need to test the sensitivity of PC Reporter system. As shown in Figure 8, PC reporter can still work at the concentration of ~0.1nM target for both plasmid (Figure 8a) and crude PCR product (Figure 8b).

Modeling
The Illinois - Tools team can model any pathway, whose starting and ending compounds are stored in the Kegg database.  The algorithm developed by the team takes information from the Kegg database and finds the most optimum pathway, based on the weights selected by the user.  Examples include the pathway with the least number of steps, or the pathway that uses the least amount of ATP.
The Illinois-Tools team also wishes to use this algorithm to help other IGEM teams in modeling their own desired pathways.  For example, the our program can help the Illinois wetlab team in modeling their pathway.  The wetlab team's project is about a binary decoder in the organism E. coli, that senses 2 inputs, such as 2 sugars, and produces one of four possible outputs, which are fluorescent proteins, based on the combination of inputs.
Go to Illinois
A possible future expansion of their project would be to model these pathways computationally, and see if it would be experimentally feasible. Furthermore, once the protein output is obtained, they want to check if it can be used to produce useful compounds like biofuels.
To help this team reach its goals, our program, IMPtools, was able to model a pathway from D-Arabinose to Ethanol in E. coli.  The result can be seen below.  It has been optimized for E.coli, and can be further optimized when the wetlab team is ready to work on it.  The labels on the reaction are the Kegg IDs for compounds.
The Algorithm
In modeling for other teams, a few things should be considered. The algorithm requires interactivity. It is can only optimize if you set the parameters to specify what you mean by ""optimal"". In that light, the user of IMPtools when modeling for a practical design application should consider how important removing excess reactants or creating biproducts could be, as well as the implications of ATP consumption. Sometimes the algorithm can return intermediate compounds that are truly only cofactors of a main reaction (these can generally be avoided by weighting against high order nodes, but also by specifically removing certain nodes). With IMPtools and a small amount of manipulation, a reasonable pathway can be returned using IMP's pathfinding algorithm. Using these results, actual experimentation is necessary to validate the pathway - perhaps, given future"

Construction of the regulator plasmids
Thursday, July 5th
Construction of the lasR regulator plasmid (piG0040)
Competent cells were transformed with piG0028 (K553003, lasR) and selected on chloramphenicol-LB-plates. Plasmid DNA was extracted by performing a miniprep. The relevant plasmid sequence was sequenced by Microsynth using the primers oiG0001 and oiG0002. Amplification of lasR by PCR using oiG0003 and oiG0004 resulted in the fragment fiG0004 (1.0 kb). The vector piG0034 (pSEVA 181) was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and PacI to fiG0001 (3.0 kb). The two fragments, fiG0001 and fiG0004, were assembled using Gibbson assembly. Thus we used the plasmid backbone of piG0034 and lasR of piG0028 to construct the lasR regulator plasmid piG0040. Competent cells were transformed with piG0040 and selected on ampicillin-LB-plates. Colony PCR using the primers oiG0035 and oiG0036 was conducted to check the size of the inserted fragment (expected bands at 1.0 and 1.2 kb). The sequence was verified by Microsynth using the same primers.

Now, we are a team made of people from very different backgrounds working together to create our amazing Sexy Plant. We love what we are doing and we are going to rock this contest.
After a team meeting in July the students went to have lunch together near the engineer’s headquarters at the end of our university campus. It was around 3 pm, close to 40 Celsius degrees outside and extremely humid atmosphere when we finished having lunch and we realized that we didn’t want to sweat to dead. The biotechnologist of the team had to go back to the laboratory, which is about 20 minutes walking away from the restaurant, too long for walking in the sun in that weather. So we made our way to the laboratory crossing all the buildings with air conditioning we could find in our way, and resting in them for some minutes so we could cool down a little bit. So we turned a 20 minutes walk into a 1 hour expedition through buildings we had never been in during all these years studying in our university.

OUR PROJECT
Although UCSF & UCB’s iGEM team has students from a variety of backgrounds and schools, we bonded very quickly and have had many fun and unexpected team bonding experiences. Some instances of team bonding occur during late night data collection, as team members stay until 11:00PM to collect and analyze data, even when they have to come in to lab early the next day, leading to impromptu conversations as they wait to collect data. One day, when we learned that one of us had never had In-n-Out (a popular Californian hamburger fast food restaurant) before, we decided to order some for what turned out to be a crazy but unforgettable lunch. An interesting fact is that many of our team have dietary restrictions or allergies: when we tried to bring snacks for the rest of the team, such as chocolate or banana bread, there would always be one or two people who would say, “I’m sorry, I can’t eat that.” Fortunately, we’ve been able to overcome minor difficulties like these and find snacks we can all enjoy, such as popcorn, pretzels"

Basic Flip Flop
Overview
Basic Flip Flop. Overview
The basic electronic part in a computer is the flip-flop, a circuit that can have only two possible states: 0 and 1. These states don’t change unless a new input comes, making this device a good inspiration for a new expression system. In this system the addition of a chemical substance or a change in the environment would result in a response that would be maintained even if the stimulus is retired. But, how is this synthetic regulation pathway made? The structure is composed by two repressors and their correspondent promoters.  Each repressor inhibits the expression of the other one and the expression of the repressor is coupled with different fluorescent proteins. In this case we used the promoter PL and its repressor cI with the Plac and lacI system. As reporters for each of the states, we have GFP and RFP. An example in nature is the regulation of lambda phague, when it infects a bacterium and has to decide between lytic or lysogenic cycle.
The repressor cI is a mutant version that doesn’t work at 42ºC. Then, the system responds to two different signals: change of temperature (expression of RFP) and addition of IPTG (expression of GFP). For this device to work properly we need a strain deficient in LacI, in our experiments we use MC4100.
These devices has been done and tested before (Gardner, 2000) but the objective of our project is to find a way to improve its performance, either through mathematical modelling or an experimental approach. The basic flip-flop has some flaws in its behaviour such as the long time induction by IPTG and the duration of the change of state. Describing how the bistable works would help the other subteams to see if their genetics constructions actually work as they expected"

2.2     Interpretation
A great GFP signal was detected which confirms the expression of our portein of interest Cpxr.
The increasing standard deviation for the cells with arabinose can be explained as some chambers did not have a lot of cells and so there was a low intensity thus increasing the deviation. As it can be seen in the following picture :
Figure 4. These are chambers with arabinose in the medium, you can see that there are different cell density and thus different intensity in the chambers. Inducing a high standard deviation

Protocols
1. Bacteria and culture media
Bacteria  strains used in this study are NZ9000 (L.  lactis) and DH5α (E. coli). DH5α was  used as the cloning host. E. coli were  cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (agar or broth) at 37 °C. L. lactis was cultured in M17GS (M17 broth  supplemented with 0.5 % (wt/vol) glucose, 0.55 % (wt/vol) sucrose) medium at 30  °C (agar or broth). Ampicillin was used at the concentration of 100 μg/mL for E. coli. Erythromycin was used at the concentration  of 250 μg/mL for E. coli and 20 μg/mL  for L. lactis, respectively. X-Gal was  used at the concentration of 40 μg/mL and nisin was used at the concentration 0.1  μg/mL if needed.
2. Polymerase Chain Reaction
All  PCR reactions were done with Fast Taq Mix DNA polymerase from Novoprotein Scientific Inc (Shanghai, China) and Primerstar Max DNA polymerase from Takara Bio Inc. (Dalian, China).

For this reason, we decided to use a trick that is more than a hundred years old: pasteurisation! The alginate solution was rapidly heated to its boiling point using a microwave and then immediately cooled down using a water bath. Like this, the amount of microorganisms was reduced while maintaining the alginate functional. Finally, antibiotics were added to all our samples to kill all bacteria which do not contain our antibiotic resistance.

Failures
Although dissolving hydrogel beads is described in literature as straightforward (J.A.Rowley et al., 1999), we experienced significant problems with dissolving our hydrogel samples to obtain the biofilm only product after 3D printing. In literature, the addition of 10 mL 2% (w/v) sodium citrate is described as sufficient to completely dissolve the hydrogel within 20-30 minutes. Unfortunately it turns out this does not hold true for larger hydrogel fragments as we were experimenting with, but works only efficiently on a very small scale ( < 400 µm).
Trying to regain the in the hydrogel entrapped cells, we incubated 100 µL of hydrogel bioink containing cells constitutively expressing RFP in 1 mL of 2% (w/v) sodium citrate at 37°C for 36 hours. While we were able to show that the cells did survive this procedure by inoculating them in fresh LB and regrowing dark red cells, the hydrogel however had to our big disappointment barely dissolved.
Trying to force its dissolution, we incubated 100 µL of hydrogel in 1 mL of 2% (w/v) sodium citrate at 50°C, 300 rpm over 48 hours. To our large disappointment, not even these conditions were capable of dissolving the hydrogel.
Repetition of the above experiments with low concentration sodium alginate (1% w/v instead of 2%) lead to the exact same results.
To this point, we have not been able to entirely dissolve and remove the supporting alginate hydrogel. In the future, more effort will have to be put either into developing and optimizing conditions capable of both fully dissolving the hydrogel and keeping the cells alive, or reorientation towards a different compound that can be used as a stabilising scaffold for the bacterial cells in the printing process.

Ran a gel of the questionable PCRs from yesterday. Plasmids pC13AY number 1, pC13AU number 5, pC13I number 5, pAK13BC number 5, and pC13AF number 3.2 looked good, but the gel was smeary so will re-run tomorrow. From the digest screens, pK13AL numbers 1-3, pAK13AP numbers 1-3 and 5, and pAK13AC number 1 looked good on a gel. The site-directed mutagenesis of pCh13V was continued, with a PCR of pCh13V run to mutate the EcoRI site. Sample number 2 of the non-GC samples appeared to have worked when run on a gel, so a DpnI digest and transformation were performed. Miniprepped pA13AM and ran a colony PCR, revealing that it was not"

Lastly, we finally manage to make up and freeze our stocks of bacillus. At eight fifteen, Tom and Oli finally exited the building after a ten hour protocol . At least we won't have to do it again for a while.
Just how competent our attempts at competency were will be tested tomorrow.
Thursday
The UEA team visited today. See pictures of their visit in the gallery. Hopefully we should be able to collaborate as soon as they manage to create their biosensor for nitrate.
Andreas and Oli tried transforming the bacillus stock we made up yesterday. The plasmid used was Tag RFP-T which gives choramphenicol resistance and should turn the colonies pink. We will have to wait overnight to see if the week has been wasted.
We've also started designing the primers we need for the various steps in the procedures. Jolyon made some potentially effective ones for extracting the fluoride riboswitch region from the bacillus genome. Using Gibson assembly, it should then be possible to insert this upstream of our reporter, i.e the mOrange/luciferase fusion. See our project page for how we imagine this should turn out in the end.
Friday
Our transformants actually seem to have worked! See the lab book for a lovely image of our pink colonies.
Stuart took an inventory of the large quantity of freezer stocks left over from last year. Lots of molecular biology stuff - enzymes, buffers, DNA ladders, loading dyes etc. etc. Plus many helpfully unlabeled tubes from years before 2011. We probably won't be risking those.
Emmy and Paul worked with the old lux operons from 2010, inserting the plasmids into the bacillus made up two days ago, as well as into some e.coli. Hopefully we should have some bioluminescence to test by the end of the weekend - useful for the Arduino kit which is becoming ever more developed as the hours go by.
Cake days were instituted today, with the inaugural sample being Emmy's banana bread. They may also act as excellent bargaining chips for enlisting the aid of reticent PhD students.
Andreas has managed to find some optical filters, which he later tested in the spectrophotometer. The data was plotted in MATLAB by Oli. Andreas has also discovered that he hates the odour of e.coli. How fortunate that we are working mostly with bacillus instead, which has the delightful aroma of unwashed feet.
Saturday
Emmy came in today to check on the e.coli and bacillus plates she and Paul made up"

4c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
We have no intention of releasing any bacteria into the human body or the environment at any point in the iGEM competition. Even if it did ""escape' from our lab, the bacteria is effectively harmless; as stated above, neither our plasmids nor our insert genes will affect the virulence, infectivity, or host range.
4d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
The bacteria is effectively harmless, neither our plasmids nor our insert genes will affect the virulence, infectivity, or the host range.
5. If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise7 (Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a-d of the previous question.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
Our aim of this project is to use engineered bacteria to remove excess phosphate from water. It holds hope for utilization in sewage treatment or controlling phosphate levels in aquarium. Reaching that stage, we need to carefully control the engineered bacteria population. Overpopulation of the engineered bacteria might disturb the homeostasis in aquatic system by over-uptaking phosphate.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks? (For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis, etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups, choose to include them.
We have not yet included any safety features in our project. But we will certainly include these in the future when we are moving in the next step of the project.
7. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)?  Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution's safety training requirements, if available.
Members of our IGEM team members were required to attend a pre-lab training offered by the Department of Biochemistry, the University of Hong Kong before gaining access to the labs. The training was divided into 2 sessions, including safety talk md laboratory inspection, which rise awareness of any potential dangers in the lab to our team members The Department of Biochemistry has provided and maintained a safe environment, in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Regulations for every team member. http://www.biochem.hku.hk/about/safety.html

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Daily Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". G5.4 has slow insertion time GFP (correct. Should be sequenced again). All reactions with R2 primer failed. This primer anneals in the terminator and probably has too much secondary structure. It will be moved downstream and re-ordered. Plasmid prep on G2.3 and G3.3 yields good concentration. Rescue PCR on G1,3,5, appears successful. G1,3,5 digested along with pFTV overnight.

Spent time today working on all of the necessary materials for the ScienceU presentation that will be on Tuesday of next week. Start to put together different activities that would introduce the high schoolers to genetic engineering, our project, and current ethical issues in synthetic biology. Cleanup of digestion product from yesterday, ligation, purification, transformation of cells with G1,3,5. 30 Minute incubation, plating.

The ""Central Dogma Relay"" was put together and cut out so that we could use it as a way to check and see if the kids were able to understand transcription and translation. PENN STATE and SCIENCE were used as examples that the kids will need to transcribe so that they can keep their cell ""alive"". Transformation from yesterday yields very few colonies, cells re-transformed using yesterday's ligation product, plated. Samples G2.3 and G3.3 sent for sequencing using primers common R1 and F2 and fast F2 and R1 (these primers all anneal in the CDS). Four colonies picked from re-transformation of G5, used to inoculate cultures. Culture inoculated from streak of G5.3 cells (plated 7/18). Six colonies picked from G1 re-transformation.

Assumptions
The model presented below is based on the following assumptions:
(1) Each bacterium, regardless of the phenotype, can be infected with only one phage at a time.
(2) Both lytic and lysogenic bacteria can be either reinfected with the same phage or superinfected by any other phage.
(3) Reinfection or superinfection has no impact on the bacterial life cycle.
(4) The latency time is constant for every phage-bacterial interaction.
(5) The burst size is constant for each lysis for both phages.
(6) The specific growth rate of the bacteria is described with the Monod equation, which also depends on the concentration of the growth limiting substrate.
(7) The induction rate of lysogenic bacteria is constant.
(8) CRISPR-Cas9 system encoded by a temperate phage is 100% efficient and upon infection irreversibly renders susceptible cells immune to lytic infection without a time delay.
Model of a continuous process
Here we present a new model describing interactions of one species of bacteria and two phages: temperate and lytic. The list of interactions is described as follows: the initial population of susceptible bacteria (XS) are   infected with a population of temperate phage (PT) at time t=0. Bacteria that are get infected with this phage form a new population of lysogenic bacteria (XL). These bacteria obtain protection   from a lytic phage (P) and can pass it to their daughter cells upon division. Upon induction at rate q lysogenic bacteria enter the lytic cycle, which leads to the production of viral particles and cell burst after the time latency (T)   has passed. After some time (ε), the lytic phage is added into the system. Lytic phage can also infect susceptible bacteria and form a new population of infected bacteria (XI). After the time latency has   passed, infected bacteria burst open releasing b phage particles that can then repeat the cycle. Lytic phage can also infect a population of lysogenic bacteria, however upon entering the cell,"

Cultured Hela cells after electroporation were then placed under differential interference contrast(DIC) microscope for bacterial entrance verification. Wild type E.coli K12 MG1655 expressing GFP could be seen inside the hela cells clearly. Most entered bacteria tended to cluster around the nucleus, a phenomena we reasoned that could optimize the bacterial distribution into daughter hela cells. Also, we observed a significantly higher GFP intensity given by the bacteria within hela cells, compared to bacteria stayed on the outside(data not shown), which indicate that the plasma may be a more favorable place for this facultative anaerobe to live in.

Visible E.coli K12 MG1655 could be seen traveling from one hela cell to another via nanotubes, indicating a non-seletivity among the transporting cargo of these nanotubule highways. However, due to the viscosity of plasma and the retardance of the cytoskeleton, E.coli K12 MG1655 within hela cells did not exhibit the mobility that we desired. In addition, the relationship between E.coli K12 MG1655 and hela cells appeared to be rather intense as usually only one of these two parties can survive after a few days of incubation of this temperal man-made endosymbiotic system.
''In our project of Bacto-Trafficking, we successfully achieved nanotube induction between Hela cells and bacterial introduction into eukaryotic cells using modified electroporation. Due to the limited time, we were not able to realize our original goal, that was to obtain distribution pattern of the bacteria within the Hela cells. But we've already observed bacteria travelling from one cell to another via nanotubes, which was very close to our expectation. Thus we believe, with a little more time, our ultimate goal of Bacto-Trafficking could be achieved.''

Figure 1.2 | Figure1.2 It separately describes how the proportion of substrate “PB” and product “LR” in total DNA varies within 10 hours. The red line represents the concentration proportion of the product, “LR”. More calculation details about this graph are attached to the back.
Then, we improve the origin model by adding gene expressing and other biochemical reaction to predict the theoretical efficiency of the integrase in vivo.
We are not sure whether the integrase is effective as we expect in the coli, even if it prefers well in vitro, so we try to build a more integrated model. Considering that the factors in the coli are so complicated, we merely select the fairly significant factors as the component of our model, including the gene expression, the change of the promoter’s activity and the dilution and the digestion of the protein.
Finally, we get the exciting results of the model shown in the figure3. The transformation rate can reach to nearly 100 percent in 5 hours. The mathematical demonstration will explain how the factors in vivo help to shift the equilibrium forward.

Second part [ Details ]
In this part, we use the diffusion model to solve an experimental problem.
Although the models above can describe the whole process of our system in general, the experimental data still do not perform so well as our expectation because all the promoters are leaked. According to this case, we come up with an assumption that the diffusion of the repressor results in the lower concentration around the promoter than the one in center of the gene site where the repressor protein produced. Therefore, the lower concentration of repressor causes the high probability of separation between the repressor and promoter. That explains why the promoters are leaked seriously.
In order to describe the change of the concentration with the distance in cell, we build a diffusion model. We find that the concentration of the repressor will decline rapidly due to the diffusion. However, when there is a source in the center, for example the translation of mRNA causes a steady flow of repressor produced, the concentration distribution will get constant in the end. The results are shown in figure3.2.

Ehime-Japan team challenged to three projects, which would finally lead us to create “E.colingual”, a tool through which we can know E. coli feelings. It consists of three parts: Main, Connection, and Screen.
To realize our project, we used the light sensor genes from Synechocystis, the Lon protease and the ssrA tag from Mesoplasma florum. Also, a cell-cell signaling system and the heat shock and cold shock promoters were used so as to construct a foundational system of E.colingual.
“E.co-mail” is a communication tool with E. coli and an optical fiber. We would be able to transfer digital information depicted in E.coli through a distance, and probably could send e-mails with this tool.

We tried to reconstruct toppling dominoes with E. coli,       and we would be able to draw a movie of firework on LB plate!
See more…
Main is comprised of two different kinds of E. coli transformants.       One is that feels heat and cold and respond differently, producing different      signaling molecules. The other catches the signaling molecules and convert       the signal into the form of light. As a result, we can see a temperature change      around the E. coli. The light signals could be transferred through a distance       and be displayed if the Connection and Screen systems work.

It consists of three parts:Main, Connection, and Screen. E.colingual is a tool through which       we can know E. coli feelings:“hot”,“cold”, “happy” ,or “dying” etc…       Also, by an optical fiber, the information of those feelings is transmitted       to someone in a distant place from a lab. Actually, we focused on E. coli feelings, “hot” and “cold”.

The iGEM team UPO-Sevilla wanted to be the first in spreading the basis of Synthetic Biology based on parts in High Schools of Spain, mainly in Andalucía. The BSIES program (Synthetic Biology in High Schools; an acronym of Biología Sintética en Institutos de Educación Secundaria) consists of a series of talks given by the student members of the team in high schools. During these talks the young students catch a first glimpse of Synthetic Biology and and its applications and we set up a discussion about the fast advance of science and the ethics behind it. We did not want to ask them about their thoughts about SB, as many other teams did. Instead, we wanted them to ask us in order to fill their gaps and make them understand this new field of science better and know the moral concerns lying between our society and the way SB develops.
Below you can see a summary of each talk, including photos, some of the students questions and our answers.

Gene is the basic unit of life. The essence of artificial life is to artificially design and                         synthesize                         the genome                         of a living body. Then, as for the synthesis of genes, what do we use as raw materials? And how                         to                         synthesize?                         These                         are a technical background that is closely related to our project. In other words, where is the                         source                         of                         artificial                         life? With this kind of philosophy question, which is also the core issue of life sciences, we                         paid                         a                         visit to                         TSINGKE BIOTECH in Beijing to conduct a project survey and expand our “Bigger Picture” layout                         with                         the                         introduction                         of TACG BioTech.
Mr. Chen Yuntao, Director of the Primer Synthesis Workshop of TSINGKE BIOTECH, and Mr. Hao Yun,                         Marketing Manager,                         warmly received us.
Ir. Chen first introduced the synthesis of primers, which every student who has done molecular                         cloning                         has been                         exposed to. On the alkali-treated silicon-based surface, the protecting group-modified                         deoxyribonucleotides                         underwent a controlled addition of chemical ""protection and deprotection"" cycles, ultimately                         forming                         Oligos with a                         length of 15 bp to 250 bp. Ir. Chen then led us to visit their standard primer synthesis                         workshop,                         where more than                         20 different models of the Oligos synthesizer in the gigantic workshop kept writing the book of                         life                         like a printer                         --- Oligos. He took us to one of their independently developed Oligos synthesizer with 192                         flux,                         picking up a                         bottle                         containing oligonucleotide monomers and proudly said to us, ""This is the answer to your                         research.""                         Before our                         departure, we took a photo with Ir. Chen with the four monomers A, T, C, and G that can be used                         to                         write the book                         of life. It is conceivable that in the following 24 hours, these raw materials will be synthesized                         into                         primers and                         sent to researchers all over the country to write a grand blueprint for workers devoted into                         life                         sciences.                         Whenever                         we think of this scene, it is difficult for us to hide our excitement and ecstasy.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

FLOWER LOCUS T is derived from Arabidopsis thaliana and other all genes expect for iGEM Parts Kit are derived from E.coli. All experiments are conducted under the Biosafety level 1 control. All of rubbish containing recombinant E.coli is not carried out of our Lab before being sterilized. We always take care to lock the door of our Lab when there is no person so that the possibility that someone goes into our Lab and takes away recombinant cells is very low.
We are trained in applicable lab safety to ensure researcher safety and environmental safety. The researchers have also been trained in proper usage of chemicals and equipment. Some of the biological reagents and experiments necessary for the project needed safety measures. They were; Ethidium Bromide (EtBr), phenol, chloroform, 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, gas burner, ultra violet LED, polyacrylamide, 2-mercaptoethanol, PFA. Therefore, all researchers keep following rules when we use the chemicals or equipment above.
EtBr (Ethidium bromide): EtBr is regarded as a mutagen, carcinogen or teratogen. Lab members were briefed on the possible effects of EtBr. During the experiments, we wore gloves. After use, the gloves and gel were separately disposed.
Phenol and 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic Acid: Phenol and its vapors are corrosive to eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid can cause serious irritation to eyes. These were handled under the draft chamber.
Chloroform: Chloroform is a possible carcinogen. To avoid unnecessary exposure, this was also handled under the draft chamber.
Gas Burner: We used gas burners and heated the air around the workspace to raise the temperature, thereby reducing contamination. Although the gas burner is a common combustion apparatus we are all"

The use of restriction enzymes is no option for cloning if functional nucleic acids contain the recognition sites for enzymes used in standard restriction cloning, as described in RFC 10, or other suitable restriction enzymes. Although techniques using Type IIs restriction enzymes like Golden Gate assembly do not leave scars after cloning, a Type IIs recognition site within the functional RNA sequence may greatly reduce the efficiency and fidelity of a Golden Gate based cloning attempt.                                              Therefore, the method of choice for reliable assembly of the sequences into a standardized vector has to be based on homology at the interfaces of the parts to be fused. As the DNA templates for functional RNA are commonly synthesized de novo, the addition of overhangs upstream and downstream the functional sequence does not appear to be challenging. Equally those extensions can be added during PCR with primer overhangs.

The term “functional RNA” covers a wide range of noncoding natural and synthetic RNA. These RNAs do not need to be translated into protein and are able to fulfil their function either by simple Watson-Crick basepairing interactions or by a more complex formation of secondary structures. Noteworthy classes of functional RNA relevant to the synthetic biologist include:

Science Popularization: Make A Change
Origin of Our Work
With the progress of the project in the laboratory, we have also learned that the public do not have sufficient knowledge of cancer, cancer treatment and new cancer therapy. Therefore, we believe that we should go into the society to cover the blind spots in the public's knowledge, and eliminate their misunderstanding of science and technology rather than limit the project in the laboratory.
Society Cognition
We investigated the public in the streets to understand the public's awareness of scientific knowledge. The interviews took place in three places, Xinjiekou Commercial District, called China's first business district, Nanjing South Railway Station, the largest railway station in Asia, and Xiamafang Heritage Park, a century-old scenic spot. These three locations have great traffic and a complete demographic structure.
Interview at Xinjiekou Commercial District
Interview at Nanjing South Railway Station
Interview at Xiamafang Heritage Park
Public cancer knowledge has been known through interview and questionnaire survey. We found out some points as follows:
1. People have a low level of scientific knowledge about cancer, and almost no knowledge of new cancer therapies.
2. As people grow older, their knowledge of cancer will grow. One reason for this is that there are more and more cancer patients around them.
3. Middle-aged and elderly people pay attention to health knowledge. They perform better than young people in keeping health, and they have a more correct concept of health.
General public lacks scientific knowledge, and has long been misled by pseudoscience. This is a common phenomenon in today's society.
(Detailed results of questionnaire see in this PDF document .)
Access to Knowledge
In order to gain authoritative scientific knowledge about cancer, which will be used for publicity, we interviewed several researchers who have made great achievements in the field of cancer treatment working in SIBS. They gave us authoritative knowledge about cancer and latest cancer treatment. Their words made us feel the social responsibility on the shoulders.

Preparation of agar plates with kanamycin + chloroamphenol.
A) LB agar: requires 37 g/L of the commercial ready mix. We measured 14.8 g for 400 mL water, then autoclaved. (LB agar needs to be cool enough to touch - so not too hot - around 45-55°C)
B) Addition of antibiotics: we added the required antibiotic to the liquid agar once it was cool enough to touch. Working concentration of the antibiotic was a 1000X dilution of stock concentrations, i.e."

description
Vitamin and mineral deficiency is a serious health concern that affects a vast amount of the world’s population. Surprisingly, this deficiency is not always due to a lack of nutrients in the diet but rather due to the low bioavailability (and thus poor absorption) of those nutrients. Specifically, according to the World Health Organization, iron deficiency affects over 30% of the world’s population and affects more people than any other condition in the world.  Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, general ill-health, and  premature death. Click here to access the World Health Organization page on iron deficiency.
Iron and other nutrients are not available in the food we eat due to molecules known as chelators. Chelators bind to nutrients rendering them unavailable for the body to use. Our project focuses on breaking down the strongest and most prevalent chelator of iron in foods: phytic acid (phytate). Phytic acid is naturally broken down by enzymes known as phytases.
We aim to build a system to directly deliver phytase to the digestive system in order to increase the bioavailability of iron.

Collaboration with 2014 iGEM Teams
This year, we collaborated with three iGEM teams and aided in development of the policy and practices aspect of their projects. We helped iGEM Warwick 2014 by giving insight into the public opinion on synthetic biology and how it affects society. In addition, we collaborated with iGEM Macquarie 2014 by participating in their ""So you think you can synthesize"" competition where each week their members would host an online Q and A about synthetic biology and contestants would move on in the competition based on the quality of their answer. We also aided iGEM Valencia 2014 by giving feedback on the intellectual and industrial property in the frame of synthetic biology.
Public Outreach: University of Lethbridge Synthetic Biology Mural
In order to spread awareness about synthetic biology at the University of Lethbridge, the iGEM team painted a mural in one of the main tunnel passageways. This tunnel experiences high student traffic and serves as a conversation starter about synthetic biology. The mural was mostly designed by one of the team’s supervisors, Will Smith. We have received a lot of positive feedback about our mural from the University of Lethbridge community, and we hope our mural will inspire others to pursue synthetic biology for years to come.
Public Outreach: 4th Annual Brick by Brick Charity Dinner and Silent Auction
Our iGEM team is hosting the 4th annual Brick by Brick event aimed at giving back to the community that has supported us throughout the iGEM season. Brick by Brick is a silent auction and charity dinner that will be held on November 15, 2014 at the James Foster Penny building in Lethbridge, AB. All proceeds will be donated to 5th on 5th Youth Services, a local non-profit organization that has been in the news recently due to a funding crisis.
5th on 5th Youth Services is a non-profit organization that offers a variety of programs free of charge to youths aged 15 to 30. 5th on 5th is one of Southern Alberta’s most prominent organizations in aiding youth to become productive members of the community. In general, they support youth in the areas of academic, career, and social development as well as gaining employment.

Overheating of the PCB
As the PCB has a cold and a hot zone, it is necessary to evacuate the heat generated. The hot zone can achieve more than 80º degrees and can be a potential danger. A resisitance is responsible of heating and a peltier plate is responsible of chilling. Peltier effect is based in a semiconductor metal where you apply a potential difference. Then, you create a hot part and a cold one in that semiconductor. We use the cold part to extract the energy and stabilize the temperature via conduction of the PCB's hot zone.
Ventilation
The peltier plate is responsible of chilling the PCB but ¿How do we evacuate all the energy generated? Well, the answer is simple, Printeria just needed ventilation holes and watercooling to do it. Watercooling is based in the higher thermal capacity of fluids (water in this case) to absorb energy. Water is pumped through microfluidic tubes to reach the peltier and chill it.
Electroporator
This device is capable to reach high voltages, so if you require one of these in your design first of all, ensure no one can harm himself/herself. This is the reason why we designed our own electroporator in a dedicated and compacted printed circuit to isolate it from any exposure. It can reach until 1600V, which is not a joke.
Tips
Tips which go in the revolver wheel are disposable to ensure the purity of each reaction.

MGEC: Modeling Genetically Engineered Circuits
Contents

4 Features
5 Further improvements
Objective
To make the generating of models for engineered gene circuits easier for biologists.
Background
Many software tools (such as Copasi and SimBiology) are available for simulation and analysis of biological circuits using mathematical models. However, most tools require the users to convert a designed circuit into a set of reaction equations for modelling. For a biologist who has no experience in modelling, this process is not straightforward. Therefore we developed a web tool called MGEC (Modeling Genetically Engineered Circuits) to address this issue. Through MGEC, one only needs to tell which genes and promoters are assembled in order to form their gene circuit - a preliminary model in SBML format will be automatically generated for the circuit. This model can then be analyzed in other software such as Copasi for further improvement.
Design of MGEC
Database
A key technology used for engineering gene circuit in Synthetic Biology research and the iGEM competition is the recombination of genes with different promoters. Therefore the focus of MGEC is also on the promoters which link the signal, transcription factor (TF) with the regulated genes. We developed a database for E. coli promoters which includes information on:  TF binding to the promoter, cofactors or other signals which activate or deactivate the TF, corresponding MIT registry ID (if any) or other database ID, kinetic information from published papers about the promoter, etc.
Web Interface
A web interface was designed which allows the users to type in the promoter name and the name of the gene assembled with the promoter. Many promoter-gene pairs can be input one by one for generating a complex circuit. Alternatively, if a promoter is not in the database, the users can directly enter the name of the TF binding to the promoter.
Model generation
For each promoter-gene pair, two reaction equations will be generated for the model (In the future version, users will have options to generate models with different sets of reactions). One is for the production of the gene product where the corresponding TF is the modifier. Another is for the degradation of the gene product. The Hill equation is"

\quad(5)
From reference [12] , toxins are relatively stae bases and antitoxins are instable acids; they can produce a stable TA complex by neutralization to block the function of the toxin. In mathematical form, the numerical relation is:
{{\rm{k}}_{{\rm{pt}}}} \ll {{\rm{k}}_{{\rm{pa}}}}
{{\rm{k}}_{dt}} \ll {k_{da}}
{{\rm{k}}_1} \gg {k_{ - 1}}
{{\rm{k}}_2} \gg {k_{pt}}
So, we can assume that the existing toxin molecules are either in binding with target molecules, or in the toxin-antitoxin complex. The antitoxin is produced to neutralize toxin and the excessive part is degraded. The accurate solution of equation set (5) is not necessary because the expression of toxin only affect the terminal concentration of tetracycline degradation.
We do a series of experiments to understand the coupling of toxin and antitoxins. Bacteria with genes of aTc induced toxin 134, 136, 1204, 6249 and their corresponding IPTG induced antitoxin are prepared.
Firstly, we add aTc in gradient concentration and excessive IPTG(8mmol/L) at the same initial time and measure their growth, as is shown in Fig. 6.

Construct for non-inducible expression of integrase driven from a constitutive promoter and associated RBS for both PhiC31 and Bxb1 integrase (B.) Construct for non-inducible simultaneous expression of integrase and RDF from a constitutive promoter. Both genes have an associated RBS. All constructs are flanked with iGEM Prefix and Suffix (as indicated by the boxes labeled as “P” and “S”).
1.  Experimental design for demonstrating the functionality of Bxb1 Invertible Promoter switch (Promoter J23119: PB state)
To demonstrate the functionality of the Bxb1 invertible promoter switch in its PB state, ~500 ng of the test construct was co-transformed into a competent E. coli strain (DH5α) with its corresponding constitutive Bxb1 integrase-expressing construct (~500 ng). For our negative control, ~500 ng of the Bxb1 test construct was transformed into E. coli in the absence of the integrase expressing construct The cells were subsequently plated on LB agar (with appropriate antibiotics to maintain both plasmids) and allowed to grow for two days at 37 degrees (~36h).The growth period was chosen to allow adequate expression of the integrase which would consequently mediate a recombination event resulting in the reversed orientation of the promoter (RL state) within each switch and thereby drive the expression of RFP.
Figure 4. Testing PhiC31 and Bxb1 Invertible promoter switches (PB state): To test the invertible promoter switches in their PB state (flanked by attP and attB), they were independently co-transformed with their corresponding non-inducible integrase-expressing constructs and consequently plated on LB agar with appropriate antibiotics to select for both plasmids. The resulting bacterial colonies were then analyzed for RFP expression.
2.  Flow cytometry to demonstrate functionality of “inverted” GFP
The Bxb1 invertible promoter switch in its PB state drives the expression of GFP. A single GFP-expressing colony (from the Bxb1 invertible promoter switch test construct transformation plate) was selected and inoculated in 5mL of LB (with appropriate antibiotics) and grown overnight at 37°C. Since a modified version of GFP (ORF was modified to be in the opposite orientation with respect to convention) was used for these constructs, bacterial cells producing GFP (BBa_I"

Collaborations
Our team truly believes that collaboration is what makes iGEM a unique competition, we met many of the iGEM teams during events or Skype calls and helped as much as we could for other teams to succeed in their project. It was awesome getting to know each one of them ! Thank you for this great summer ! We were happy to help out :
iGEM Evry by sharing widely their survey and characterising a BioBrick for them.
iGEM EPFL by being interviewed for their blog.
iGEM IONIS Paris and iGEM Evry by taking part to the European Experience where we met so many European teams.
iGEM LMU-TUM Munich by filling and sharing their survey.
iGEM Pasteur Paris and iGEM Paris Saclay by taking part to the Mini-Jamboree, where we presented our project and bonded with Parisian iGEM teams.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html,".5 billion market by 2015. And it will continue to grow, due to the wide range of applications; for example many companies and academic groups are working on the energy aspects.
He expects that everyone will be affected in their lives by what biotechnology and synthetic biology will do.
Yassen explained our attempts to improve cellulose degradation, and spoke about how this could ultimately lead to the creation of a biorefinery that took waste and produced useful products.
Nicolas said this was a very good choice of project. There are a number of initiatives around the world involving biorefineries, and he suggests they could be good for Scotland. The degradation of cellulose is being pursued by a lot of groups; it is a hot topic. Any progress would be helpful to industry. As for the economic viability of it, further studies are required; what is the starting feedstock; what are the end products? It would be a significant investment.
Logistics would also need to be considered; e.g. where feedstocks come from. They might come from Scotland, the UK as a whole, or even be brought in from abroad.
But he sees it as an exciting topic.
Fionn said (based on our own projections) a lot of feedstock would be required; he mentioned the concept of a biomass based economy. Yassen mentioned Eric Hoffman's concerns about sustainable sources of feedstock.
Nicolas said waste of some sort would obviously be a good source, but would there be sufficient biomass to feed the biorefinery? It's important to consider all the options. Globally, many things have been considered. Some crops, such as switchgrass, have been specifically developed with biorefineries in mind. He mentioned a project using modified corn to make ethanol.
Fionn asked how an investment analyst looks at the potential of synthetic biology.
Nicolas said there are two things to consider: technology and applications. Sometimes you know that if a technology is successful, it will replace existing technologies and open up new opportunities. If you want economic projections, you must look at current markets. One must make assuptions about how quickly technology improves, and how the market will grow.
For example, consider the current consumption of fuel. If a new technology came in with cheap biofuels, we could make predictions about how the market would be affected.
Fionn asked about the future of synthetic biology in Scotland specifically.
Scotland is strong in this area. Nicolas described it as a leading centres in Europe for research. He noted that Scotland has a high number of iGEM teams for its size [five this year"

Low Budget iGEM Challenge
We did some extraordinary intercountry collaboration with ETH Zürich team . Together we participated in the Low Budget iGEM Challenge arranged by Colombia's iGEM team. With ETH Zürich we planned, carried out and reported our experiments regarding an accessible, easy and low cost PCR method. You can find our entry from here . Furthermore, we made a video describing our method in more detail. You can find the video featuring Oskari from Aalto-Helsinki and Sumana from ETH Zürich below:

Complexity Survey
ETH Zürich team investigated the emergence of complex patterns. We helped their human practice part by filling out their survey about how we perceive complexity in everyday life as in biology and its emergence and how we react to it. We shared the survey for our friends and collected responses on our Facebook page. As a result, we reached over 20 entries and received this awesome badge as a reward!
Here's the badge we earned for getting more than 20 entries for ETH-Zürich's complexity survey!
Colombia
We Skyped with Daniela from Colombia iGEM team and agreed on participating their human practices project, the Low Budget iGEM Challenge. We also discussed about her previous experiences and how they have done mathematical modeling in the previous years. This way, we could validate whether our approach to modeling was on the right track. It was very interesting to discuss about the differences in research and how it affects iGEM in Colombia. For example, ordering primers, kits or other materials takes a lot longer and it really limits the way of working there.

Frequently asked questions:
Q: How can you control the regulation range of pH?
A: The regulation range of pH is decided by three factors, the responsive range of pH-induced promoters, the efficiency of recombinase system and the strength of functional acid and alkali. The responsive range of pH-induced promoters is a rough range. Different efficiency of recombinase system combined with the responsive range of pH-induced promoters can result in various expression level of functional genes and thus we can get different amount of acid or alkali. Different functional acid has different pKa value. Considering all these three factors, we can control the regulation range of pH.
Q: Will the system function influence the bacteria normal division?
A: The gene in our system is harmless to our engineering bacteria. And most of our regulation products are endogenous, such as lactate, GABA and others. There may be another question that the acid we employed is from the citric acid cycle, so it might influence the growth of bacteria. But according to our experiment and some references, it has less effect on the cell division.
Q: Temperature regulation is also an important step in fermentation, have you ever considered the bad effects of heat which generated by neutralization if you use acid and alkali to regulate the pH?
A: Firstly, the neutralization process is not quick or violent here, especially the functional acid and alkali we used are medium. Therefore the heat generated by this process will dissipate quickly. Second, the growth of strains will also higher the temperature of fermentation liquor. Companies now already developed modern technology to keep the fermenter at a proper temperature. Last but not least, our project in 2013 is Intelligent Heat Regulation Engine which successfully solved the problems caused by heat. We can integrate this engine with pH Controller.
Q: How long does pH Controller takes to react with the environmental pH changes?
A: The reaction time mainly depends on the pH-responsive promoters. The reaction time of two promoters used in our basic circuits is half an hour, according to our experiments. More importantly, by error-prone PCR, we selected"

As Outreach has been one of the main driving forces behind our project, it is a shame that during the last two weeks there hasn’t been much progress. However we should have the Outreach team back to full strength next week meaning we can begin to make some serious progress - including getting our video filmed.
Week Twelve   17/8 - 21/8
Our trigger RNA arrived this week just in time for us to discover that it is the wrong sequence! We eventually figured out that this was because the software we used automatically deletes uracil bases so we ended up with a much shorter sequence than expected. We ordered the RNA again, but it will take approximately three weeks to get to us! This holdback has resulted in a change of plans for the lab team who have been focusing their efforts on the characterisation of chromoproteins as well as continuing the Interlab study. Wednesday was a particularly exciting day because we got the chance to use our shiny new FLUOstar plate reader, courtesy of BMG labtech.
Exeposé, our university newspaper, asked us if we’d be happy to be the focus of the science & tech section and join them for an interview - of course, we said yes. The interview went pretty well and gave us the opportunity to reflect on the past two months and to realise how much we’ve learnt in such a short time.
Our wiki is still building improvements including a carousel of images for our home page. Beyond the Bench team have been busy preparing for our meeting with George Eustice MP, Minister of State at DEFRA.
Week Thirteen   24/8 - 28/8
Monday morning began with a long drive to the Penryn campus in Cornwall. We had our meeting with George Eustice, which was informative and enlightening. If our project goes well, he will let the appropriate people know. This week in the lab we successfully expressed 3 different chromoproteins cell free; the repeats were consistent with initial testing. It was nice to see something go right in the lab. We also finished up experiments and data analysis of the Interlab study constructs to submit the data to iGEM before the deadline later in the week.
The modelling team decided to restrict our system simulation to a cylindrical shape to more accurately reflect the lab work. We also began designing the banner and poster for the UK meetup next week. We had a frantic late night session at Todd’s house to finish off the"

Results
We produced software which implemented the algorithms described in our novel approach on specially cleaned input files and ran them through a typical version control system. We performed experimentation on transformations between iterations 3-6 of our wetware team's yeast plasmids. As a control, we compared darwin's output running through the git version control system to simple processing with git (vanilla_git). We expected darwin to run faster and show fewer changed lines in the diff output than vanilla_git.
Speed of file processing in darwin vs. vanilla_git
Line changes in darwin vs. vanilla_git
As expected, darwin's preprocessing produced a significantly faster diff, with an average speed of 5.763 seconds per file, as opposed to 10.640 seconds for the vanilla_git. However, against our assumptions, that performance did not seem to rely upon the reduction of changed lines reported by git, since darwin actually produced more changed lines. More research is required to find the correlation between the number of changed lines reported by git and the number of lines actually changed in the file.

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter3_-_-_TEXT.html," What sort of impact would such lab-grown food have on the market? If we can modify bacteria to create artwork, could we consider moving on to multicellular organisms? These are just a few questions we could ask ourselves. We have several methods to spread our message. As we are in the Art and Design track, we sought the help of artists, such as Lia Giraud (www.liagiraud.com), Marion Laval-Jeantet, and Christina Agapakis (agapakis.com). We will also participate in CURIOSITas (www.curiositas. fr), an art and science festival held annually at Université Paris-Sud. We will soon conduct surveys on BioArt: we wish to ask iGEM teams, artists, scientists, and anyone in between. Let’s move on to the technical aspects of the project. We will replace E. coli’s foul odor with lemon fragrance and express yellow or green chromoproteins to evoke the ripening process of the fruit. In order to express the smell we will first remove the gene responsible for E. coli’s stench with homemade BioBricks that will synthesize limonene, citral and β-pinene, which are three essential molecules that are part of the fragrance of a lemon. We use blue and yellow chromoproteins in our lemon: both will be expressed in presence of salicylate, and thus the lemon will give off a green hue. When the concentration of salicylate decreases, the blue chromoprotein will no longer be expressed and the lemon will be yellow. So far we have two BioBricks (actually two-in-one): NAHR sup D which suppress the expression of the blue chromoprotein. We are currently working on the lemon scent BioBricks (i.e. limonene, β-pinene, citral).

We are the Guangdong Experimental High School iGEM team from China. Our team consists of 14 members, and all of us will be attending the jamboree in Boston. This is our first year participating in the iGEM competition as representatives from our school.
STUDENTS
Zeng Zirong
I’m a student in Guangdong Experimental High School. I love biology and chemistry very much. I also want to do some experiment to create some new things, so I joined iGEM. In this competition, I can improve myself. Besides, the experiment for the competition brings me a lot of happiness, although it sometimes makes me feel sinking. We failed many times, but we never give up and keep on doing, finally we create our own yeast. As the leader of the team, I’m proud of our team.
Fu Yao
I’m a senior from Guangdong Experimental High School in China. Biology, especially genetics, is my favorite subject. I spent lots of my spare time participating in the biology activities in-and-out campus. For instance, last summer I secured an opportunity to work as an assistant to medical postgraduates at a hospital for a month. Also, I attending a genetic engineering camp last winter and I felt a thrill in my heart when I successfully made fluorescent E. coli on my own.
Wang Ruiting
I’m from Guangzhou, China. I’m 16 years old and I am a student from Guangdong Experimental High School. I like reading. In my room, there are many different kinds of books. Although some knowledge about Synthetic Biology is difficult for me to understand, I will still try my best to understand. In all the subjects, I am interested in Biology and Chemistry, so when I saw this competition, I soon entered for it. I believe our team can have a very nice idea and we can have an excellent work because we have support from our teachers and parents.

#36 - Shared NYC Property
I arrived on location to enter a rustic looking house in the middle of renovation. Three friends bought it together.  This the only way in NYC to buy property with skyrocketing prices, one of them explains. The backyard is mostly concrete with some vegetation along the sides.  It looks like an abandoned playground with different broken toys left from a previous owner.
#39 - Farthest Destination
After a long ride to Bay Ridge in a what felt like 90 degree weather, I finally make it to the farthest destination on our Soiled map. I am immediately offered a tall cold glass of water, which gives me a quick break to recuperate before proceeding to sampling. The garden is small but the participant has been working on it forever. So the soil has been altered from the original state to properly feed the plant life. We discuss how the dead reminiscence of the chopped tree could contribute over time to soil health. I carefully document all the details and moving on.
#40 - Prime Williamsburg Location
I was very excited to visit a yard in the prime location of Williamsburg. The participant works in one of very established restaurants in Lower East Side of Manhattan and brings different herbs to his small raised garden. He was very interested in getting the sample results since he wanted to expand his collection of herbs. Among others I got little samples of anise, miso and unusual basil to take home with me.
#43 - Only edibles
Some of the people we spoke to were not native to New York or even America.  The backyard of a Chinese born designer in Queens is a lush space full of a variety of vegetables.  Intricate and well thought out, this garden has only edibles and no decorative plants.  This garden is used therapeutically and also functions as a supply of fresh vegetable for the owner.
#53 - Polluted Creek
Newtown Creek is the natural border of northern Brooklyn and western Queens. This was once a great and ancient estuary and wetlands are. Newtown Creek is now a walled-in industrial river and was declared a Superfund site in 2009. Masbeth Creek, branching into Queens, is one of Newtown Creek’s tributaries. This soil sample was taken from the bulkhead bluff that overlooks the Combined Sewer Overflow of Masbeth Creek and borders a parking lot. Questions persist as to whether a wider contamination occurred from the polluted Creek.

GOLD MEDAL REQUIREMENTS
In addition to the bronze and gold requirements we met we also met two gold metal requirements:
We achieved the goal standard of integrated human practice; by connecting with different industries that could be affected by our construct and using their input to positively affect our project and help us to develop. For example we spoke with wastewater treatment facilities and this is how we originally came up with the idea for out bioreactor implementation. For more information visit our integrated human practices page.
Over the past two years we have improved upon the work of two other teams for our two constructs; KERA and KERUS. Keratinase A (KERA), an enzyme optimized to degrade hair was originally developed by the university of Sheffield in 2014, and the second Keratinase US (KERUS) which specialized and was originally developed in 2013 by the University of Chicago. We improved upon both of these projects by optimizing each part (see design and biobrick pages) in order to avoid encountering the same problems as the two other teams had in the past.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," solar panels can be increased by using an encapsulation layer of microlenses which result in more light capturing. We focused on this application to develop an business plan. Our plan was based on an extensive customer analysis, which helped us identifying customers’ special needs and requests.
Analysis about iGEM
We believe that iGEM has proven its added value to the synthetic biology world. However, we also think that there are always ways to optimize the potential of iGEM even more. Therefore, we have written an analysis about iGEM with many recommendations about, for example, new medal requirements and possibilities to increase the scientific impact of iGEM further.
Toolbox page
Based on the analysis we concluded that it would be useful to have a webpage that lists a selection of interesting tools that could be useful for the iGEM community, such as educational card games and tools that can be used in the lab. Our site can be used as a starting point to build an extensive Toolbox iGEM page.
Outreach and Conferences
It is crucial to communicate the public about the potential benefits and risks of our project, especially in our case about the importance of improving imaging techniques. Also we wanted to learn about our projects’ public perception. Here we compile different efforts to reach out to the public, visiting multiple event and congresses, as well as organizing workshops.
Product analysis
The goal of our project was in the first place to improve imaging techniques and in that way improve the microscope. For this we have used microlenses, which make it possible to capture the light more efficiently. However, there are a lot of other applications where light capturing also appears to be a limiting factor. In this section we will give a summary of three of the potential applications in which our microlenses also could be used.
Solar panels
Solar panel with a microlens array (Xie et.al., 2015)
Most people agree that to curb global warming and to prevent shortage, a variety of measures needs to be taken. Probably the best response to the growing energy problem is to switch to renewable energy sources. Renewable energy is collected from resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Since in less than an hour, the theoretical potential of the sun represents more energy striking the earth’s surface than worldwide energy consumption in one year, this is considered to be the most promising renewable energy source (Crabtree, 2006) . Solar panels would therefore be a perfect solution to solve the energy problem. However, the efficiency"

spoVA and Fast Germination
Germination is a time consuming event. The sooner germination and outgrowth is completed, the quicker the biosensing capability of the system can be implemented, which is the primary goal of sporduino.
We came across several works in the literature in modifying aspects of germination. Many referred  to the ‘ger’ and ‘spoVA’ operons, the latter or which we investigated further.
In an attempt to increase the rate of germination, we overexpressed the spoVA operon by placing it under the control of the promoter to the ‘B.subtilis’ ‘sspB’ gene (PsspB). PsspB is a germination specific promoter which is more active than the ordinary spoVA promoter.
The construct for this was designed by Peter Setlow’s group, University of Connecticut. It involves the sspB promoter upstream of the first 354bp of the spoVAA member of the spoVA operon. Since ‘B.subtilis’ exhibits accurate and efficient homologous recombination, a single crossover event occurs between the spoVAA 354bp fragment on the construct and the endogenous spoVAA gene in the ‘B.subtilis’ genome, the sspB promoter is inserted upstream of the spoVA operon on the chromosome.
Both the sspB promoter and spoVAA fragment were amplified from ‘B.subtilis’ genomic extracts.
We added the RFC10 standard prefix and suffix to the PsspB/spoVAA construct to make it into the Fast Germination biobrick: BBa_K911008.

The transformant colonies containing MZH+WK, O+P and D were cultured, the plasmids extracted, digested and checked on a gel.
3A assembly was used to make composite parts C+A (for operon 1). The digestion of C and A was checked on a gel. This was transformed into E. coli (both commercial and competent cells) and plated onto LB agar plates with the corresponding antibiotic to the antibiotic resistance in the backbone. Transformation appeared successful as colonies grew using commercial cells. No colonies grew using the competent cells indicating a low transformation efficiency for the competent cells.
Fig 2.Samples digested as a part of 3A assembly were run on an agarose gel against a DNA ladder to check whether the samples were digested correctly. From these digest results it was expected that for each sample there would be a band slightly above 2000 representative of the backbone that the Gblock was in and a band corresponding to the size of the Gblock. The digest of WK (614bp), MZH ( 541bp) and one sample of O (908bp) provided expected results. Results for P (727bp) did not match what was expected.
Lane 5 & 6 - C+A were digested with the intention of ligating, lane 8 & 9 - MZH+WK were ligated together to form a new biobrick (lane 8 sample kept), lane 10 & 11 - O+P were ligated together (lane 10 sample kept) and lane 12 & 13 - D was successfully ligated into an Amp backbone.
A reattempt to put the part TB into a Gblock into a plasmid was made. Transformation, culturing, plasmid extraction and digestion was conducted so that it could be checked on a gel in week 4.
Week 4

The transformant colonies from week 3 were cultured, the plasmids extracted, digested and checked on a gel.
Results of gel: C+A had not been successfully ligated, may have TB-Cut Test and TB-IDT successfully in plasmids (need to be sequenced) and MZH+WK in one plasmid.
Samples of ELJ, TB-CUT-test, MZH-WK were sent to be sequenced.

Clearance of cfDNA from the blood
Alegre et al. 2015
The EPO from the infected cells is released into the bloodstream. The EPO reaches the bone marrow where it stimulates red blood cell production through erythropoiesis. Red blood cells begin as stem cells and go through a series of cell differentiations before maturing into red blood cells (figure 12).
Figure 12. Cell stages in red blood cell production. Stage 1 is the BFU-E cell stage. Stage 2 is the CFU-E cell stage. The proliferation rate of CFU-E cells depends on the concentration of EPO. Stage 3 is the erythroblasts stage. Stage 4 is the marrow reticulocytes stage. The length of time cells stay in this stage is dependent on the concentration of EPO. Stage 5 is the circulating red blood cell (RBC) stage. Neocytolysis of RBCs is triggered when the concentration of EPO drops below a certain threshold. The red blood cell count acts as a feedback loop that determines the endogenous production of EPO.
EPO promotes the proliferation of CFU-E cells. Increases in EPO levels lead to faster proliferation rates of CFU-E cells. Increases in EPO levels reduces the marrow transit time of cells for marrow reticulocytes, releasing the cells into the blood in a shorter time frame. In the blood, the reticulocytes mature into red blood cells which increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. If the"

Combine theory and practice within structure
After deciding on what theoretical concepts can explain project aspects, they can be included within a chosen structure. The executive summary should be left for last, as it is an overview of all the essential aspects identified through analysis.               A business plan does not have to be rigid. It should be perfected as the iGEM project progresses.
Final thoughts
Finally, we stress the point that a business plan should be useful. It should help guide the project with respect to what is feasible or not from a business perspective. Moreover, it should be interesting to read for your audience, reflecting               ideas of how the project could develop into a business.

Biolink - Business Plan
Biolink was born from TU Delft’s team participating in iGEM 2015. Our aim is to develop a creative, yet simple solution solving a complex problem in the biofilm-related industries.
Executive Summary
Introduction. For testing biofilm removal products, it is essential to produce an artificial biofilm yielding reliable results. Biolink proposes a revolutionary way of 3D printing biofilms into a desired form,               adding control, replicability and automation over classical biofilm formation methods. The many fields of application (biofilm research, industrial and healthcare product testing), growing trends of 3D printing industry and Synthetic Biology,               and positive feedback received so far offer promise towards our success.
Biolink was born from TU Delft’s team participating in iGEM 2015. Our aim is to develop a creative, yet simple solution solving a complex problem in the biofilm-related industries. Certain biofilms, forming in or on our body,               pose serious threats to our health. Products, such as toothpaste or antibiotics, aim to remove these detrimental biofilms. To measure removal efficiency, products are tested on biofilms formed in laboratories. Because biofilm growth is difficult               to control, these artificial biofilms are unlike naturally occurring ones. This translates into unreliable product testing - a disadvantage to both companies and their clients.
Our solution can mitigate the disadvantage. On the one hand, safety and efficiency of biofilm removal products can be increased, if biofilms formed are closer to real conditions. On the other hand, increased automation and               control over biofilm formation yields a cost advantage for production processes. Biolink brings together more than just biofilms; it combines the novel fields of synthetic biology and 3D printing into"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Hielo by TEMPLATED
After the polyethylene plastic is decomposed by laccase, we plan to use bacteria to uptake the decomposed waste as a carbon source. As such, the second module of this project involves an alkane metabolism pathway, where the chassis organism is Shewanella Oniedensis MR-1, which can generate electricity for our project.
To generate the alkane metabolism pathway, the starting product (alkanes) must penetrate into the cytoplasm through the cell membrane. While short-chain alkanes (less than C12) are able to diffuse directly into the cell, medium to long-chain alkanes cannot due to their increased hydrophobic nature. Since the laccase fragmentizes PE into randomized lengths, it is in our interest to make sure that all ranges of alkane size can be efficiently metabolized within the cytoplasm. To this end, we have to use an outer membrane alkane channel protein to mediate the entry of the medium to long chains alkane.
According to the literature, an outer membrane channel protein called AlkL, encoded by alkL, from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 has been shown to enhance the diffusion efficiency of dodecane (C12) into the cell when expressed in Escherichia coli. It is also shown to be able to facilitate the transport of larger alkanes, which has high hydrophobicity, making it more difficult to pass through the lipopolysaccharide outer membrane of the bacteria. The mechanism behinds AlkL is that it penetrates through the lipopolysaccharide layer, where an extracellular domain with high affinity for hydrophobic molecules lies. After the alkane molecule is collected via this domain, it makes its way through the hydrophobic core of AlkL. This subsequently allows the alkane to makes its way to the cytoplasm via a small lateral opening of AlkL. From there, the alkane may make its way to the cytoplasm. The outer membrane alkane channel protein(AlkL) we plan to use"

During our research we also explored other functional proteins to fuse to the CBDs.
Laccases
Laccases are enzymes which can break down aromatic and phenolic compounds such as modified estrogens which can end up unfiltered in the water supply with unknown consequences (Auriol et al 2008). This method of treating estrogen in water was explored by Bielefeld 2012 iGEM team , and our system also has potential to address this.
Nanobodies
Nanobodies are fragments of camelid antibodies which can be generated against a variety of antigens and can be easily expressed by organisms such as E. coli . Nanobodies could be used to target viruses, which are often too small to be filtered by size exclusion. For example there are already nanobodies which can bind to Vaccinia virus, ricin, Cholera toxin, Stephylococcal enterotoxin B and H5N1 Influenza (Goldman et al 2006, Ibanez et al 2011) to name a few. Additionally, nanobodies are stable and can be selected to resist proteolytic attach (Harmsen et al 2006). Nanobodies can also be functional when as fusions or conjugates to other proteins for example to target enzymes to specific cells (Cortez-Retamozo 2004), so there is much potential for targeting a wide array of contaminants when fused to cellulose binding domains.
Results
The assay for strength of CBD binding utilised our sfGFP-CBD fusion proteins. Strength of binding was assayed between the CBDs by assuming it will be proportional to the level of fluorescence which remains after washing of cellulose coated plates(link to plates protocol)

4. Validation of audiogenetics
We designed both ultrasonic and audible sonic simulation hardware to quantitatively test stimulated cells.
Audible sonic stimulation
Buzzers, balanced amatures and speakers were used as sonic stimulators. Only buzzers induced obvious cell response in high frequency conditions (15kHz and 20kHz). A buzzer was attached to the bottom of a cell dish. When the buzzer was working, cells around the buzzer boundary was observed under microscope. Strong fluorescence intensity increased immediately after the buzzer was started. Cell fluorescence intensity increased greatly when stimulated by 15K and 20kHz sound. While no obvious fluorescence intensity change when GECO cells (without MS channel) were stimulated (Fig.8 ).

We conclude that the Aga2 cell surface tag received from NYU works; now it only remains to test the effect of the display on cellulase activity, by constructing the appropriate test device(s).
Cellulase quantitative assay by reducing sugar measurement
In basic solution, 3,5-dinitro salicylic acid, DNS, is reduced by reducing sugar.  We used this reaction to determinate the quantity of reducing sugar present in the medium which resulted from degradation of cellulose.
We characterized the C. fermi endoglucanase A part BBa_K118023 as part of a device including lac promoter, RBS and terminator. Transformants were incubated in liquid medium for ~10h, then this cell culture was added to solutions containing cellulose, CMC or ASC respectively. After reaction, DNS was added and absorbance measured to quantify the amount of sugar present versus a calibration curve.
Future work
We created many parts (yeast ENO2 promoter, ADH1 terminator, SUC2 secretion signal etc as well as various cellulases such as xylanase and mannase) but did not have time to evaluate them. Also, devices containing 2 or more cellulases should have been constructed and assayed.
