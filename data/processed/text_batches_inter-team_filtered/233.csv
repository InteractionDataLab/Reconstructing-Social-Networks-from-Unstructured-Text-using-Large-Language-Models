Harvard_BioDesign,2016,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ytic activity. With a system to break down PET into its byproducts, we were ready to use these byproducts to sense  the presence of PET so that we can feedback a signal to ocean plastic researchers.
The Microbial Fuel Cell
Motivation for a Microbial Fuel Cell
When designing our project, we realized that we could sense TPA, one of the products of PET degradation, by using a device called a Microbial Fuel Cell. In a microbial fuel cell, a bacteria that can survive on TPA as a carbon source would convert the TPA to electricity. We could sense the presence of TPA by the corresponding increase in voltage from the microbial fuel cell, and this signal could send feedback to ocean researchers.
Currently, Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology doesn’t yet produce enough electricity to power anything large, but fortunately our application allows a small amount of electricity to make a significant impact. Because oceanographers don’t currently have an efficient and mechanized way to track ocean plastic concentration, the ideal purpose for electricity produced by our MFC is sensing ocean plastic in a floating bioreactor.
Operating principle of a Microbial Fuel Cell
The answer to the pressing question of whether we can generate an electric signal, using terephthalic acid as the substrate, comes from a relatively novel device called a Microbial Fuel Cell. This device contains specific bacterial strains, located in its anode compartment, and produces electrons from the bacteria’s oxidation of the carbon source or electron donor. Then electrons are shuttled onto an anode either by an exogenous mediator or membrane protein.
What is the next step in the electron movement within the fuel cell? Once the electrons arrive at the anode, the potential difference between the anode (negative) and the cathode (positive), forces them to flow at the other side of the fuel cell, on the cathode compartment. This happens through an external resistance or load supplied from the outside of the fuel cell.
However, electrons are not the only charged atomic particles moving around. Protons go through the cation exchange membrane, separating the anode and the cathode chambers,  onto the cathode compartment, where they meet the electrons and oxygen (since the cathode side is usually left open to air), producing water as the final compound. The directed flow of electrons is what generates a current (electricity) in our device 8(Logan).
Operating Principle of a Microbial Fuel Cell based on Logan et al. “Microbial Fuel Cells: Methodology and Technology”

Synbio is just a S-Din away!
SYSU-Software 2017
Overview
During our project “S-Din”, we brainstormed many aspects concerning our project and took them into practices to confirm or to overturn our hypothesis. Then we tried to integrate them into our final project in order to improve the project functions and user experience.
At the beginning of our project, in order to get answers to questions about user needs, safety, software regulations and legal issues, we conducted numerous interviews with professionals working in related fields. They gave us useful and significant suggestions ( Silver page ). We have considered all comments from professionals and integrated them into our design of S-Din ( Gold Integrated page ). We conducted further user interviews and user needs analysis, promoted S-Din and synthetic biology to the public ( Public Engagement page ).
Please see our human practices highlights during the entire product development on our Gold and Integrated Human Practices page .
Silver
During the project, we brainstormed many aspects concerning our project. These aspects can be roughly divided into two basic problems:
What advantages will our project have to raise scientists’ ideas, which may lead to a wonderful genetic design? Or what to raise ordinary bio-lovers’ interest, which may attract them to learn more about synthetic biology?
What impacts will our project have in different fields of society?
Through discussions, interviews with professionals or scholars in different fields, and searching related policies, we had a better awareness of our project in the context of scientific inspiration, societal attention, safety and security, and legal considerations. These inspirations help us improve our S-Din a lot.
Interview with other iGEM teams and ordinary bio-lovers

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#team:amsterdam#collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Coli physiology, the glyoxylate shunt genes are already present, but repressed by a repressor encoded by the iclR gene (Waegeman et al. , 2011). Deleting this gene will make it possible to have an increased flux through the TCA cycle. Using this knockout with minimal mutations, we receive an E. Coli which follows the same metabolic engineering principles as the Synechocystis strain proposed by iGEM team Amsterdam, and is therefore expected to be stable in terms of production (Fig. 2).
This strain is previously made by Song et al. , (2013) and produced 1.45g/L fumaric acid from 15g/L glucose in 24h in flask culture under aerobic conditions. This strain can be further optimized for higher fumaric acid yields; however, this always comes at the risk of impairing other functions.
Figure 2. Central central metabolic pathways in E. coli after engineering E. coli for fumarate production. Thick arrows indicate increased flux by the overexpression of the corresponding gene. The X indicates that the deletion of the corresponding gene. Enzymes encoded by the genes shown are: fumA,  aerobic Class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumB, anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumC, fumaric acid hydratase (fumarase C); iclR, isocitrate lyase repressor. (Adapted from Song et al. (2013))
Fumarates effect on the microbiome of cattle
In theory, fumarate has the potential to decrease methane synthesis in cattle, as it can redirect the available hydrogen into propionate rather than into methane (Fig 3). Fumarate has been proven to reduce methane emission in both in vitro and in vivo studies (Mcginn et al. , 2004). However, a recent in vivo study found no effect of adding fumarate to cattle feed on methane emission. This finding contradicts earlier findings. It is possible that a higher level of supplementation than that used in the recent study would be needed to alter methane production in vivo. It is estimated that the level of supplementation in the recent study provided about 15 mM of fumaric acid (assuming a ruminal volume of 40 L; 116.07 g/mol), although these calculations do not account for fluid dilution rate and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro.

Modelling
 
Overview
Mathematical modelling is fundamental to synthetic biology, a tool that allows for deeper understanding of biological systems, acting as a link between the conception and the physical realisation of a biological circuit. Being able stimulate and understand our system behaviour before actual implementation saves both time and resources.
Through our modelling we tried to gain insight into our system so that we could improve it and make it realistically achievable.
We tried to describe the whole system with a mathematical system of linear ODEs which could characterizes the expression and secretion of all enzymes, the associated substrate – enzyme kinetics.
In order to realize the long term goal of developing a detergent biodegradation device for household and commercial use we tried to implement continuous culture modelling on our bioreactor design in order to estimate yearly cost of detergent biodegradation.

Single Cell Modelling
 
Single Cell Modelling allows to model our gene regulatory network (GRN) and the extracellular secretion of our enzyme alkyl sulfatase (SdsA1).
This model helped us gain insight into our system in order to understand dependence of rate of secretion of alkyl sulfatase in media under varying promoter strengths and secretion efficiencies due to the different secretion extracellular secretion tags PelB and OmpT.
Our model is based on overexpression of alkyl sulfatase under constitutive promoters from Anderson promoter collection in iGEM registry. The concentration of our enzyme SdsA1 is then predicted using the rates of transcription, translation and degradation (of both mRNA and protein) that are known in literature.
 
Since under a constitutive gene expression is unregulated, it is always on and its strength could be modelled through the transcription rate constant k1.
 
 
Using the law of mass action
 
 
1.    Transcription rate k1 is estimated from literature.
 
2.    Translation rate k2 is estimated from the literature
 
3.    mRNA degradation (d1) and Protein degradation rate (d2) are known for Ecoli through literature.

This year, in our project, we constructed a new expression vector working effectively in the fungus and transformed into Metarhizium anisopliae 128 to increase its adhesion, penetration and immune-avoidance capacity. Therefore, we performed experiment on three aspects and the experimental characterizations of our parts are shown as follows.
Adhesion：HsbA
In this part, a strong promoter, PgpdA allows the HsbA protein to be expressed without induction.
The HsbA( BBa_K2788000 ) from Beauveria bassiana encodes a kind of membrane surface hydrophobic protein which helps our spores adhere to the wax on the cockroach body surface[1]. With the overexpression of HsbA, our spores can adhere to the cockroach more effectively . Then it will be followed as spore  germination, formation of germinal tube and appressorium.
This part was insert into the expression vector by restriction sites EcoRI and PstI (Fig.1), and the correct construction of this recombinant plasmid was confirmed by PCR identification and sequencing of the PCR products.
Fig.1 Construction of expression vector HsbA-pBC. PgpdA and TtrpC come from parts of 2016_NYMU-Taipei: BBa_K2040101 and BBa_K2040102 , and HsbA comes from Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860. The PgpdA-HsbA-TtrpC part is connected to the pBC plasmid through the BioBrick site.

Last year, the LMU-Munich iGEM team designed a metal-sensing device. This device links metal sensing promoters to a visual output. However, it turned out that some of the promoters that respond to metal ions are negatively regulated. For this purpose, the LMU-Munich 2011 Team started a project to convert a positive input signal into a negative output or vice versa.
Since such a genetic part would be a very beneficial tool, Julia, who also participated in iGEM 2011, continued the work from last year and got some great results.
To get an explanation of how it works and see the results: Data and Results
How to compose your individual Inverter, by fusions PCRs and 3A assemblies is explained here: Construct your own Inverter
Theory and Results
The main component of the Inverter is the small RNA RyhB, which natively translationally inhibits the upstream fused region uofCGU of the fur gene by binding to it and therefore masking Shine Dalgarno sequence.

The sequence comprising nt −110 to +12 is enlarged. The putative SD sequences and start codons of uof and fur are boxed. The -GG- to -GGAGG- mutation in the putative SD of uof is indicated.
We aimed at using this system to build our inverter (Fig. 2). For a proof of principle,"

City Council Presentation
In order to accumulate funds and some media coverage, as a team we resolved to present our blood coagulation project to city council members. Our goal was to ask for $1000 in order to aid the funding of our prototype construction. Although the money was not granted, we gained an invaluable experience at presenting in city hall to twelve councillors and the mayor. Having the opportunity to answer questions and hear the council members perspectives was truly an enlightening experience. The councillors expressed their interest and belief in our project, as well as perceived the value in iGEM even though they denied our request. Our visit to city hall certainly was still beneficial, as media such as the Lethbridge Herald and Shaw interviewed a team member, and we got a chance to spread the word of our funding page and project idea. Overall, it was a rewarding experience.
Dictionary
In order to ensure that all team members were familiar with the basis of our blood clotting project at the beginning of the iGEM season, we designed this dictionary including basic terms relevant to our project. Every team member submitted a few terms related to our project, along with their definition, in order to create this dictionary. In addition to helping our team members mitigate their uncertainties in some aspects of the project, we hope that this dictionary will also allow the community to understand our project and its significance in a more in depth manner."

We met with Ignacio Ibarra, an undergraduate student of the group of Dr. Francisco Melo.  He is willing to advise us in the area of protein modeling. The problem is that spider silk proteins are semi-crystalline and is difficult to predict its structure. He recommended starting with a comparative protein analysis between our spider silk monomer of interest and other similar proteins that have its structure available in PDB.  The idea is that from the structure of those similar proteins we will have a reference of the most stable conformation of our monomer. Later we should be able to improve the self-assembling of the proteins or improve some mechanical properties, such as elasticity and tenacity. Nevertheless, we were warned: protein modeling is a complex and slow task.
Recommended software: -MOE: to add hydrogen atoms. -Autodock: a suite of automated docking tools. This should be useful to evaluate the self-assembly of our monomers. -Force Field: to calculate potentials between particles. Finally, something very important happened: Christopher A. Voigt, author of “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers” is going to help us with a valuable gift: a plasmid to secrete ADF-3 in salmonella. With this plasmid we can obtain the sequence of the spider silk protein ADF-3.

On 2015, May, 21st, Jean, Savandara and Lily made a presentation of biotechnologies at the school ""Lycée Montesquieu"" in Bordeaux, showing its interest by giving some interesting applications. We also presented our Cured Vine project by our introduction video to easily illustrate  what can we do synthetic biology.Students were very interested about the presentation of our project and ask us many questions on iGEM competition. We hope that this meeting, we inspire some students to go to scientific studies !
Our team also asked some students of ""Lycée Labruyère"" in Versailles and ""Lycée Joseph de Tivoli"" in Bordeaux to try out our board game for improving it. Even if Lab Life is for everyone, we think that this game will be a good tool of popularization of science for the ""S"" students and will be a funny way to learn scientific knowledge !
Ethical aspects of synthetic biology
Before analyzing the ethical aspects of synthetic biology, it seems important to clearly define this new area of biology.[1]
What is synthetic biology?
Synthetic biology is a new field of research in biology which mixes science and engineering. It focuses on the conception and the construction of new reliable functions through the creation of biological systems or the re-engineering of organisms which already exist. The singularity of synthetic biology compared to traditional biology is about engineering live beings to have a predictable behavior. In order to do so, scientists focus on optimizing existing biosynthetic pathways or creating new ones while bypassing or suppressing inefficient pathways in order to increase productivity.
Three different approaches exist in synthetic biology:
✵ The metabolic engineering of the living beings by using biobricks (DNA sequences whose functions and assembly conditions are known). The biobricks are free of access on the WEB and can be synthesized on request.
✵ The production of minimal genomes and simplified organisms where new functions can be added to realize a task. This approach is often used for the optimization of existing processes.
✵ The synthesis of a whole synthetic genome that will be inserted in existing cell hosts or in synthetic cells. This field of synthetic biology may help scientists to understand how living organisms are created.
The organisms which come from these approaches can be used in both industrial applications (for example to produce drugs, biofuels, biomass or biopesticides) and in basic research as tools like"

Cellulose degradation
Cellulose insert.
Background
Well over 200 million tonnes of cellulosic waste is left unused each year in the European Union alone. To elevate the microbially produced propane to a 2nd generation biofuel and avoid interfering with food production, we wanted to incorporate a plasmid for cellulose hydrolysis into the same bacteria that produces the propane. The plasmid contains three genes encoding the enzymes that hydrolyse cellulose polymers into glucose.
Outcome
Looked into modeling cellulose breakdown , but found that there was not enough information to model the breakdown sufficiently well to get any practical benefit from the model.
After trying Gibson assembly and ELIC twice, we were able to produce the Cellulose insert containing the genes encoding three enzymes required for cellulose hydrolysis with OE-PCR. However, due to its low concentration, we were unable to transfer it to a backbone and propagate it.
Amphiphilic protein
Background
Amphiphilic proteins are synthetic proteins consisting of a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic domain that have been shown to spontaneously form micellar and vesicular structures. We were interested whether these structures could be used as scaffolds to have subsequent enzymes of the propane pathway in close proximity. We wanted to model whether fusing enzymes to the proteins would disrupt micelle formation and whether our idea could enhance propane output.
Outcome
Figure 2: 2d simplification of the micelle structure
Built a stochastic synergy model in Python, simulating enzyme function in cases where two subsequent enzymes stay in close proximity to each other as opposed to moving around independently in a cell
The synergy model predicts a 200-400 % increase in product output if enzymes stay in close proximity to each other
Constructed a geometrical micelle model based on the sizes and structures of the micelle-forming proteins, indicating that it is indeed possible for micellar structures to form even as enzymes are fused to them
Submitted a BioBrick unlikely encoding the amphiphilic protein to the registry
Due to time restraints, we were unable to experimentally validate the idea by fusing either two subsequent enzymes of the propane pathway or components of the violacein pathway to the amphiphilic proteins

Methanosarcinales is the most important order of the methylotrophic methanogens with species like Methanosarcina barkeri. Representatives of both orders and both modes of methanogenesis can be found in the rumen of cattle, one of the most important biological methane sources [4].
Reduction cascade converting carbon dioxide to methane in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with the help of different cofactors (green, orange and blue).
In the hydrogenotrophic pathway, carbon dioxide is initially reduced with electrons taken from the oxidation of hydrogen or alternative electron donors. The resulting formyl group is then subsequently reduced. Involved in this process are several unique cofactors to which the groups of the different oxidation states - some of them cyclic - are being bound until methane is released. The reduction reactions are coupled to the export of sodium ions across the cell membrane.
The methylotrophic pathway, in which C1 compounds like methanol or methylamines can be utilized, joins the hydrogenotrophic pathway at a late stage. A total of four C1 molecules is needed here, one of which is oxidized to provide electrons for the reduction of the other three. In the acetoclastic pathway, the electrons required for reduction are taken from the oxidation of the carbonyl carbon of acetate [2,3].

Faulty parts
Even though the Registry constitutes the main repository for the iGEM competition, it contains a large number of parts that have a questionable status. Only 20% of all biobricks have been validated (Figure 1). This relates to 4.083 validated parts in a registry of 19.976 in total. A mere 5% of all biobricks have been sequenced (Figure 2) and only 35% of all biobricks are available (Figure 3). Data was collected from The Constructor Database . Users of biobricks have the responsibility to sequence used constructs and assess their validity, which they can describe in the experience tab of the registry page. Such initiatives improve the quality of the Registry and benefits all users.

Figure 4: BBa_J3901 cells grown on a LB plate. The RFP protein is constitutively expressed.
In our project, we aimed to load VLPs with iron, after which the iron could be detected using brick BBa_J3901 , which is an iron reporter. And so we ordered the brick and started experimenting with it. When grown on LB agar, the cells showed to express RFP constitutively (Figure 4). We imagined  that LB might contain iron in such high quantities, that the threshold of the iron inducable promotor was exceeded. In other words, the promotor would be  extremely sensitive to iron. It was decided to make iron-free medium. Unluckily, the cells did not grow on this medium.
In the meantime, this construct was sent for sequencing. Once we received the results, it showed that the biobrick was actually completely lacking its iron inducable promotor.
Another biobrick, BBa_I765010 , was then ordered. This iron reporter supposedly had an iron inducable promotor in front of a YFP gene. After receiving sequencing results for this construct, it became clear that this biobrick was also lacking its promotor.
We documented our findings extensively on the experience page of both parts [ 1 , 2 ].
Students should be encouraged to validate existing biobricks and document their results in a good manner. It is nice to produce new and original biobricks, but it is also of utmost"

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Moss_-_-_TEXT.html," the different cultivation methods after nine days of incubation at normal growth conditions.
All flasks were inoculated with 80 mg dry weight per litre moss. After nine days of incubation the biomass in the standing flask stayed approximately constant (82 mg per litre) compared to the beginning of the experiment. The biomasses in the shaken and in the aerated flasks increased in the same time to 118 and 168 mg per litre respectively. As all flaks were incubated under the same temperature and illumination conditions the internal mixing and especially linked to this the aeration seems to be of importance for biomass generation.  Normally at the Reski laboratory the bioreactors are aerated with 0,3 vvm at a light intensity of 55 μmol m-2 s-1 . So far unpublished results indicate that aeration with up to 6 volume percent carbon dioxide improves the growth rate if the light intensity is increased as well. Nevertheless an increased light intensity automatically requires a stronger cooling capacity of the bioreactor due to photons which are not absorbed by the photo systems. Therefore the development of illumination which only serves the wavelengths required by the photosystems in plants could be an interesting alternative. Moreover the addition of further carbon sources than carbon dioxide could boost the growth of the moss as well. So far the addition of glucose leads to a change of colour to brown of the moss plants if applied for longer than 14 days. An optimization of the media composition as well as the testing of different feeding strategies could help to solve this problem.
Tolerance to relevant environmental pollutants and toxins
To test whether and how the moss reacts to toxins and pollutants, which can occur in waste and surface water and which our PhyscoFilter should remove, wild type plants were incubated in serial dilutions of the toxic substances. As a negative control distilled water was used. After 4, 7, 10 and 19 days the plants were screened with a light microscope, where one could easily differentiate between alive and dead plants. The latter occurred in two different phenotypes, one appearing transparent (dead moss 1) because it lost its chlorophyll, the other black (dead moss 2).

Final consumer packaging or pre-packaged products containing GMOs should be labelled: ‘This product contains genetically modified organisms [or the names of the organisms]’. This does not apply to medical products.
United States
There are no requirements for labelling products that contain GMOs.
Australia
Under the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, it is a legal requirement for any food products derived from GMMs be labelled with the words “genetically modified” to ensure that consumers can make informed purchasing decisions. However, an exception to this is any foods produced by animals fed GM products which are not required to have this label.
Brazil
Currently, if the product is made of a GMMs plant/seed or if the final product contains any traces of a GMM used as an ingredient, the package must have a symbol “T” of transgenic (figure below) on its package and the words “This product contains [name of the organism] transgenic.” However, the Congress and the Senate are currently voting on a project that modifies this law to remove the “T” symbol and leave the words “This product contains [name of the organism] transgenic” only if 1% or more of the final product has been genetically modified.
Japan
There are no requirements for labeling products that do not contain modified gene or products do not contain protein made by a modified gene. There are requirements for labeling products of which the modified gene constitutes more than 5% of its materials or if the genetically modified ingredient is within the top 3 ingredients.
Chile
Any product made for human consumption that has different nutritional characteristics than conventional ones due to its genetic modifications must be clearly labeled as GMO.
Indonesia
The products must be clearly labeled they contain GMO if they do.
Korea
Any product containing more than 1% of genetically modified material, such as DNA and proteins, must be labeled as GM food.
India
India has supported the mandatory labeling of GM food by Codex.
Out of the two options under discussion by Codex i.e. Option 1 requires labeling when the products obtained through biotechnology differ significantly from the corresponding food as regards the composition, nutritional value or intended use. Option 2 requires the declaration of the method of production for food and ingredients composed of or containing genetically modified/engineered organisms and food or food ingredients produced from, but not containing, genetically modified/engineered organisms if they contain protein or DNA resulting from gene technology or differ significantly from the corresponding food.
The labeling of food derived from biotechnology is a major issue for India as its delegation at the CCFL has been seeking to achieve mandatory labeling"

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Hello! I am a recent graduate from the U of L, earning my B.Sc. in Biochemistry this past spring. For as long as I can remember, science has been a keen interest of mine, and iGEM seemed like the perfect opportunity to explore the many different aspects involved in scientific research and innovation. In my spare time, I enjoy knitting, reading, and doing crossword puzzles (and despite what you may think, I’m not an old lady). Cheesy romance movies and bad science films can keep me entertained for hours, as well as enjoying a sparkling cold beverage on the patio with good friends, while the sun sets in the background.

Through the volunteer experience I gained a wealth of knowledge (something I’m always hungry for), and a desire to continue exploring the opportunities at the university, for more learning experiences. Being on the University of Lethbridge’s iGEM team has been a gateway to the exciting world of synthetic biology. When I’m not in one of the labs (Ute Kothe’s, or iGEM), I enjoy reading, biking, scuba diving, snowboarding, and volunteering with St. John Ambulance.

GST-SR was detected by anti-GST antibody in Western blot analysis
As Figure 3 showed, SR protein fused with GST tag was detected by anti-GST antibody and visualized with DAB chromogen at the predicted size of 53 kDa in Lanes 2 and 4.  Moreover, in Lane 4, the shifted bands indicated the possible of various forms of phosphorylation modified SR proteins by SRPK1 kinase. Free forms of GST can be detected at  27 kDa in Lanes 1 and 3.
 
Figure 3. GST-SR was detected by anti-GST antibody.
Lane 1: Control: lysates of BL21 carrying pGEX-2T and pET-29b
Lane 2: SR:  lysates of BL21 carrying SR/pGEX-2T and pET-29b
Lane 3: SRPK:  lysates of BL21 carrying pGEX-2T and SRPK1/pET-29b
Lane 4: phosphorylated SR:  lysates of BL21 carrying SR/pGEX-2T and SRPK1/pET-29b
In summary, SR protein and SRPK protein can be expressed in E. coli BL21 carrying the corresponding plasmids, proving the successful protein induction by IPTG and gene expression by pGEX-2T and pET-29b vectors. Furthermore, SR protein modified by SRPK kinase can be clearly observed in the shifted bands, probably demonstrating the phosphorylation process.

Introduction
    Achieving long-term space resides and interstellar travel is a long-standing dream of mankind. For a closed system such as a spacecraft, how to maximize the recycling efficiency of material and energy in order to maintain the astronauts’ long-term space activities has become an inescapable but difficult problem for scientists to overcome.
    This year, we focus on the issue of carbon cycling in spaceships during long-term space travel. We hope to use E.coli to realize the re-use of carbon dioxide metabolized by astronauts, like green leaf, and to synthesize Glycogen which can be reused by astronauts,using formaldehyde as the sole carbon source. The device,which can maintain the carbon cycle in the long-term spacecraft,is what we call the Blue Leaf.
Background
    From the 1960s, the former Soviet Union, the United States, the European Union and other space organizations have tried to construct bio-regenerating life-support system under earth 's closed environment in order to simulate the material recycling process in space environment. However, the results are unsatisfactory. We need a new idea to solve this problem! Space synthesis biology, as a mysterious branch of synthetic biology, has brought possibility to solve such an interdisciplinary scientific frontier problem![1]
     Last year, the iGEM team AACHEN2015 used E.coli to design a pathway for Glycogen by methanol.[2]They used electric conversion to get methanol,which is the raw material. And then,they formed glycogen combined with methanol Condensation Cycle and Glycogen Metabolism. Though they aimed at using methanol to form glycogen, in fact,they overlooked one of the most important aspects! This pathway requires a five-carbon sugar and formaldehyde converted from methanol to form glycogen. However, the five carbon compound needs to be obtained by E. coli from other glycolytic pathways. In other words, E. coli must consume at least one molecule of six carbon sugar to synthesize a glycogen hexose sugar monomer. The route cannot synthesize Glycogen with only one carbon compound as the sole carbon source, and is not suitable for the closed-loop system of spacecraft.

For 226 it looks like either NcoI or NdeI would work - Probably go with NdeI for consistency with 224. Did them by hand in Genious for pBACe3.6 + 224. They do not form any hairpins and have Tms of 50 and 58 C
Because the only variation between pBace3.6 + 224, 226, both forwards and reversed is in the section we're trying to sequence, these two primers should be sufficient to sequence each strand.

UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," Institutional Review Board and Why Does It Matter?
While most of our genetically engineered machines are not ready for human testing, many iGEM teams have been conducting human experiments without following any regulatory protocols—through surveys! In iGEM, we are often attentive to the molecular bioethics of our projects, but we need to also consider the ethics of our social scientific research.
Human experimentation must be ethically regulated. One place where these sorts of interventions are unlawful is in the United States. [1] This is in response to a history of international [2] [3] and domestic human rights abuses in experimentation, and a desire for a better supervisory system for bioethics.
Some of the most well-known violations of human rights are related to physical experimentation, such as the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee, where the public health service specifically selected black Americans, then actively misinformed the participants of the nature of the study and prevented them from receiving treatment for the disease. [4] The study lasted for forty years. [5] People are very aware that this kind of research must be monitored for bioethics.
However, there are also protections for psychological research conducted on people, because there is a history of malfeasance in psychological research as well. One well known instance is the Milgram Experiment, where Yale University Psychologist Dr. Milgram tested to see whether average people would inflict pain on strangers under orders; though the pain was not actually inflicted, the participants believed that it was, and the consent to the experiment was incomplete. [6]
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) system is chartered under Federal law and requires that all institutions performing research that is funded in whole or in part by the government submit to IRB supervision. [7] Each University fulfilling this requirement has one of these boards, though their protocols vary from place to place. In this guide, we will include procedures for receiving an exemption determination from the University of California, Davis IRB and the University of California, Santa Cruz IRB, as one element of our human practices collaboration involved ensuring that both teams went through this process. Emphasis will be placed on the University of California, Davis practice, because UC Davis has a robust system and clear documentation provided at all stages so that researchers can see the underpinning rules, and we can follow my paperwork around our project from start to finish as an example.

Search for a single k-mer, finding the nearest neighbours, annotating frequencies or other properties to the points and search for groups of k-mers defined by regular expressions work. Embeddings of 3-mers and 4-mers in 50, 100 and 200 dimensions were calculated on whole swissprot and whole uniprot. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on a 100-dimensional embedding of 3-mers from swissprot and showed interesting properties. However, reduction of 100 dimensions to two or three may account for at least some of these.
Here the 3-mers marked darker are more frequent, those seem to cluster together.
For each amino acid all 3-mers containing it are marked in read. Some of those selection cluster together, others do not. This may also be due to the dimension reduction.
All 3-mers containing cysteine are marked in red.
All 3-mers containing lysine are marked in red.
All 3-mers containing proline are marked in red.
All 3-mers containing valine are marked in red.
Especially cysteine, proline and lysine containing 3-mers cluster together, while the ones containing valine appear to be more equally distributed.
Clustering of k-mers based on amino acid content is a first hint, embeddings can be useful for input of neural networks. However their performance can probably only be measured indirectly by comparing the performance of a single architecture on different inputs.
Dickinson-PACE 2.0:
Due to problems with the documentation in the awesome_sheet, we were using different strains for our PACE run. The results of two PCR reactions showed the abundance of a positive and a negative AP, which should not be a problem based on the findings of the properties of the MPs one week before. Follwing this further, we performed several days of PACE using this strain.
After seven days, plaque assays were performed and a plaque PCR was used for amplification of the N-terminal domain of the T7 RNAP. Even the sequencing of over 10 plaques did not yield any mutations in the essential domain. Due to this, we should go back to the old experimental design of Dickinson-PACE.
Dickinson-PACE:
We returned to the old experimental design, using MP1 instead of MP6 as well as the normal Dickinson strains without LuxAB behind gene III. For the organisation of our runs, we now use a better version of our google docs sheet. We are now"

Propane pathway
Background
Microbially produced propane holds enormous promise as a potential replacement of portable fossil fuels, but the propane yields with current biological pathways are low. Our pathway starts from acetyl-CoA and produces propane through 6 intermediates. To help concentrate engineering efforts on its critical parts, better quantitative understanding of the pathway is required. Our goals were to build a mathematical model of"

Yes, that’s one of the symptoms of the few numbers [of clinicians]. If somebody comes and the clinician is away. Now he has pased through many of the head of facilities. The clinical officers, general clinical officers but there is no one for ophthalmic clinical medicine. So thatˋs where the problem is. [...] We just talked to the chief and he seems to be very aware of the challenges he is facing. He has actually encouraged everyone to register, so perhaps you can prevent it. This is one of the challenges we have to deal with. Our staff are not adequate and therefore they can not serve the growing population.

We spoke with some Professors who are handling Chlamydia. They have a theory that transmissions over animals happen quite frequently. Have you looked into it yet? Is there any transmission possible?
Daniel C.:
It was theorized by one professor, who deals with Chlamydia in animals, that they might serve as a reservoir for the infection. It´s a mystery, why in some villages in Ethiopia infection always returns.
David Chinyanya:
Yes, even here, we are using it as a theory, because often when people are sleeping together in a house with animals, the incidence is high. So we think that one agent of chlamydia transmission is cow dung. That´s why I was showing you the cows. In areas, where people live in the same house with cows, that problem is high. We have tried to talk to the community that they have to improve on that, but they have got their own reasons why they keep the animals together with them in the same house. So here we are using the same theory, because"

Mass spectrometry
Cell preparation
For analysis by mass spectrometry, 3 ml of LB media containing chloramphenicol (1 micromolar) was inoculated with transformed bacterial cells (expression of the NRPS tested before by SDS-PAGE). Cultures were incubated at 37°C overnight until OD600 ~ 0.6. After centrifugation for 30 minutes at 3750 rpm and 4°C, supernatant was discarded and pellet washed with M9 minimal media. Again samples were centrifuged and resuspended in 50 ml M9 minimal media. Following an incubation time of 12 hours (OD600=0.6) cells were induced with IPTG (1 mM).
To assess product levels over time, 7.5 ml samples were taken at several time points (8.5 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs and 48 hrs). Each sample was spun down for 45 minutes at 3750 rpm and 4°C, and supernatant was separated from pellet.
Pellet was resolubilzed in 500 µl 1x PBS and lysed by ultra-sonification (3x20 seconds; on ice). Finally the sample has been centrifuged and supernatant decanted to 1.5 ml tubes. Frozen with nitrogen the sample was handed over for mass spectrometry.
Supernatant was frozen with nitrogen and lyophilized for 12 hours ( at ~-45°C and ~0,1 mbar) to remove liquid residues. The lyophilisate was resuspended in 500 microliters methanol and vortexed. Supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube, which was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The sample was then handed over to mass spectrometry for further analysis.
Data Acquisition
Sampling
Two empty 3.2 mm die-cut sheets were prepared from Whatman 903 filter paper. Afterwards, 5 µl of the sample were pipetted on the sheets and dried in the fridge overnight.
Sample preparation
The dried sheets were extracted for ca. 20 min with 100 μl solution 1. Then the polypropylen microtiter plates were centrifuged for ca. 2 minutes at 4000 rpm."
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Result_-_-_TEXT.html," affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these phages has allowed us to construct multiple peptide suggestions that may bind to our nematodes’ surface proteins.  This would allow the biosensor to aggregate at the detection sites and create a stronger signal.
In our project, phage display has been used in a whole new way. Performing phage display on a whole organism is an unconventional and unpublished procedure. By creating a working protocol for the purpose of finding a specific binder for strongyles we have applied this Nobel-prize winning method in a new way.
Figure 4: Flowchart representing the phage display outline.
3. Reporter System
After receiving the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, they need to be combined with a reported to get a functioning diagnostic tool (Worm Buster).  We have adapted and troubleshot the expression of a fluorescent chromoprotein, UnaG, to be able to detect our worms in both the intestines and in feces. This would enable a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect the worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!
In order to make this a viable reporter system, we wanted to make sure the original biobrick part was functional.  We show how we tweaked this part in order to study if it works properly so that it could be potentially used in future studies.
Figure 5: We would be able to detect the wormd in feces with this method.
4. Modeling
Optimization of the Time Between Treatments
To make sure the unnecessary use of anthelmintics is minimized we have created a model that compares regular and optimized usage of anthelmintics. When referring to the optimized use of anthelmintics, this means that the horse only receives treatment when the amount of parasites exceeds a certain threshold. Our model calculates given the initial amount of worms on the pasture and in the horse. Ideally, the information could be used with the worm buster to get a better overall result of our project. Our solution will not only be able to tell how large the treatments should be but also when they should be administered. This would guarantee the lowest amount of anthelmintics usage, and hopefully help combat the issue of growing resistance. Due to this fact, our model constitutes a large improvement on the potential implementation of our project since it directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"RNA Array Minimization Tool
The second software tool we made can be linked to the first one and also used independently. It is a gRNA generation tool with a unique functionality: it generates all possible gRNA’s at a single position, including all codon substituted versions (figure 6).
Figure 6. Principle of gRNA generation at a single position for all codon substitutions. A target region is identified on a DNA sequence. This sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence to identify regions with little codon substitutions possible. The region of least possible gRNAs is identified and the gRNA’s are generated.
This is very useful for catching gene dopers, since they might change the codons in their doping gene to avoid detection. It can also be useful for any other application that deals with high amounts of synonymous mutations in the gene they want to find.
For our application, this gRNA generation tool is an addition to the sequence classification tool discussed above. The sequence classification tool adds doping sequences to it’s database. The sequences have either an amino acid sequence which is already known by us, or a different amino acid sequence. If it is a protein sequence which is already known, the database improvement stops there. This is because gRNA’s have already been made for this protein sequence, so generating the gRNA’s again is not necessary.
However, if it is a new protein sequence, this sequence is fed into the gRNA generation tool. New gRNA’s are generated and added to a gRNA database. This databases consists of all gRNA’s which we have designed to catch gene doping athletes. The gRNA’s stored in the database are used to bind to our target with our fusion protein . By updating the database in this way, we increase the chance of catching gene doping users with every run.
Method
We have developed the gRNA generator tool in R, adapted from the gRNA model . The figure below guides you through the steps of the code. For a more detailed description of the tool, please click the dropdown below the figure.
Figure 7. Summary of the gRNA generation code. The inputs and output are shown in white, with a oval shape for file in and output and a diamond shape for (sets of) parameter settings. The code being executed is summarized in square blue boxes. The gene for which the gRNA’s should be generated is submitted as a .fasta file, a file format commonly used for genetic information. The DNA sequence it contains is translated into amino acids. Each amino acid has a certain number of DNA codons that encode the same amino acid. A vector containing these values"

TEM also confirmed the presence of spherical nanoparticles in the P22 protein sample (without added scaffolding proteins; SPs) and P22 + SP-Cas9 protein samples. In the absence of the scaffolding protein, P22 capsid proteins were capable of self-assembly but with a significant variation in size and stability (many collapsed structures were evident in the sample). The P22 + SP-Cas9 PNCs had a much more consistent architecture but had a diameter of 120 +/- 5nm, which is approximately twice that of typical P22 virus-like particles. The 1:1 capsid to cargo ratio may have caused overloading of the PNCs, which caused an increase in overall size.

For the evaluation of the raw data we used the ΔΔCP method [23] in which the crossing points (CP values) of a gene of interest and of a reference gene are compared and normalized with a constantly expressed HKG, to get an idea of the relative amounts of the mRNA of interest.
In the following you can see the results of our experiments. We compared the expression levels of T-REx cells which were transfected with our different receptor constructs and with non-transfected (NT) T-REx cells.
Media:Muc16_Primer_qPCR_002.png
Figure 12: Workflow and results of the RT-qPCR for the quantification of mRNA levels for cells expressing the eMA, scAvidin and BAP receptors.
As can be seen the ΔΔCP values of the mRNA of the eMA and scAvidin constructs are with a 1,2 x  106 fold increase for scAvidin and 1.5 x 103 fold increase for eMA, significantly higher than those of the BAP construct. The analysis of the different primer pairs in the two regions of the BAP construct also showed similar values and thus confirms the reliability of the measurement. A difference in CP value is tantamount to relative mRNA differences between cells.
Thus, we can conclude that the assumption that the missing RFP signal in cells expressing the BAP construct is caused by a reduced mRNA stability, is indeed correct.

The specific BPA degradation rate per cell qD is about 50 % higher when using the fusion protein compared to the polycistronic bisdAB gene. This results in an average 9 hours faster, complete BPA degradation by E. coli carrying <partinfo>K525517</partinfo> compared to <partinfo>K525512</partinfo> as observed during our cultivations . The fusion protein between BisdA and BisdB improves the BPA degradation by E. coli. Introducing a polycistronic ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase gene into these systems does not lead to a higher specific BPA degradation rate. The rates are a bit lower, though. The effect that the BisdA | BisdB fusion protein is more efficient than BisdB when expressed polycistronically with BisdA can still be observed in this setup. The cultivations with the expression of the fusion protein FNR | BisdA | BisdB differ from the expression of the other BPA degrading BioBricks. The BPA degradation rate is concentration dependent which is typical for enzymatic reactions but was not observed in the other cultivations. In addition, the growth was faster and not diauxic.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C"

Model Based on Cu(II) ion Concentration to Predict Fluoresence
 
 
Original Data
 
After we take the In of the fluorescence
 
Trying to predict the fluorescence of  Cu2+ under different concentration, we consider concentration of Cu2+ as independent variable x, and fluorescence(ln) as dependent variable y. We established models 1-6.
Model 1:   𝑦=𝛼+𝛽𝑥+𝜀 Model 2: 𝑦=𝛼+𝛽𝑥1/2+𝜀 Model 3;   𝑦=𝛼+𝛽𝑥1/3+𝜀 Model 4:   𝑦=𝛼+𝛽𝑥1/4+𝜀 Model 5:   𝑦=𝛼+𝛽𝑥1/5+𝜀 Model 6:   𝑦=𝛼+𝛽𝑥1/6+𝜀
 
Where 𝛼 is intercept term，𝜀 is residual, as 𝜀 follows white nose distribution. We did OLS regression for model 1-6, respectively. The result is shown in below
 
 
 
 
After we investigate the data, it shows that the Model 1 has least agreement, even after adjustment R2 is only 0.536, which means fluorescence(ln) has poor linear relationship with Cu2+ concentration.
As we taking more roots of Cu2+ concentration, agreement adj-R2 keep increasing. For example, Cu2+ concentration 1/2, agreement increased to 0.779; when Cu2+ concentration 1/5, agreement increased to 0.991; but when Cu2+ concentration 1/6, agreement decreased to 0.989, and F has decreased as well. Therefore, we consider that we might taken the power of 1/5.5, having
 
As a result, model is then for sure:y=7.972+3.385*x^(1/5.5)

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html,"ants of the meeting were mostly policymakers from various departments of the RIVM, involved in synbio legislation and related subjects such as biobased economy. The goal of the meeting was to inform the attendants about synbio and to start the discussion on if and how the current policy concerning synbio needs to be changed.
All four Dutch iGEM teams were invited to present their project and host a discussion about the policy&practice-aspects of their project. We were asked to use our project as a specific case study. This provided the attendants with an opportunity to discuss the specific problems concerning a real-life project, instead of the more common general, very non-specific discussion which is usually conducted. For us, this provided the opportunity to discuss real-life implementation of our ELECTRACE project with a large amount of specialists at once.  In this report, a summary of the discussion we hosted will be given.
At the start of the meeting, Tomek and Duco gave a presentation in which they explained what iGEM was and explained what our ELECTRACE project entails. The main focus of the presentation was to show that currently, lots of different synbio applications are developed, but that there are still no (consumer) products. They explained how, by enabling biosensor applications outside the lab, our ELECTRACE system is able to change this.  We described our end product, a cheap, generic biosensor on a chip, designed for use outside the lab, and asked the question “how do we get from a working prototype to a commercial end product?”
The ensuing discussion started off, as expected, with safety issues concerning the use of GMOs outside a safe lab environment. The question was raised how to prevent a release of GMOs in the environment and to what degree this would be harmful. After explaining the possible implementation of kill switches and the fact that our (and most other) GMOs are crippled versions of lab strains which will not be able to survive in nature and have an evolutionary disadvantage, a certain degree of consensus was reached: the possible release of GMOs in the environment is not as big a safety issue as it seems and should not stop the development of outside-the-lab-applications when the pros outweigh the cons. This viewpoint strongly contrasted with the current Dutch legislature, which forbids the (possible) release of GMOs in the environment, and would therefore render the application of the ELECTRACE system impossible. The call was made that the current GMO policy needs to be reconsidered, possibly by providing the opportunity for case-by-case approval decisions.
The point was raised that the legislative discussion is"

Cloning Guide
In November 1973, Stanley Cohen and Herb Boyer marked the start of biotechnology by describing a way to construct new functional bacterial plasmids in vitro, which we now call traditional cloning. In the forty years that followed, research efforts have led to a variation in available cloning methods. Currently available methods include methods independent of ligation, independent of restriction enzymes and even independent of the use of a chassis.
iGEM teams in particular have experimented and pioneered many of these cloning methods: Cambridge teams have pioneered Gibson Assembly, Freiburg introduced iGEM to the Golden Gate Standard and Lethbridge familiarized iGEM with Ligation Independent Cloning. Novel cloning methods have thus started to play a major role within the iGEM competition, and we think they will become even more important in the future. But as a new iGEM team, still unfamiliar with DNA Recombinant Technology, let alone newer cloning methods, we couldn’t see forest for the trees. To enable future iGEM teams to make a more informed choice on assembly standards and methods, we compiled this year's iGEM teams experiences in a cloning guide.
To be able to compile such a guide we relied heavily on collaborations with other teams. They are the ones who can guide you through the cloning methods, having hands-on experience with many of these methods.  Therefore, we have reached out to many other iGEM teams. An overview of the teams who have participated in our cloning guide is presented at the bottom of this page.
Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.

Beyond the lab
The main goal of our project is to employ affordable sensors that can detect level of gold in soil samples. Our target group was artisanal miners living in developing countries. To address the needs of our group, we investigated use of synthetic gold sensor circuits in order to provide an alternative prospecting tool and understand Malaria epidemiology. We researched soil levels and conditions to understand how current prospecting techniques are performed and means to employ our technology. We found that specificity of our device plays an important role as soil samples can contain variety of metal ions. In addition, since the gold concentration in soil samples can be low in the range of uM, we tested our circuits in concentrations less than 10uM. We performed a comparative functional assay to select the best circuit among BioBricks constructed and available in the registry. We selected BBa_K2048002 as it was highly specific to gold and showed minimum to no expression level in the presence of copper metal ions.
Additionally, we performed an analysis for resources available to artisanal miners and minimum amount of resources required to employ our technology. Due to low-setting resources presence in artisanal mining settings, we investigated use of a mobile lab and centralized community testing locations. Our analysis and interview conducted with experts in the field of malaria showed that centralized community testing locations are preferred for validated data analysis. In addition, we worked creating a cell-free testing platform that can be shipped to artisanal miners. Cell-free sensors are optimum for low resource settings as they do not require biological containment, activated with water and incubated with body heat.
In order to employ malaria diagnostics,  we conducted series of interviews with experts to understand root cause factors causing Malaria spread. Based on our research and discussions with experts, we optimized our tool to be cell-free paper based design, minimized the risk factors such as highly acidic and expensive reagents, and increased the sensitivity for gold at low concentration with visible output to enable functioning in low resource settings.

Although most of his friends couldn't name his hometown, neither could he, as his move to Purdue is only the latest in a long line worthy of its own Indiana Jones travel montage. If ever you were to catch Barrett when he is not hurriedly cycling from class-to-meeting, meeting-to-class, class-to-class, or meeting-to-meeting, you would probably see him playing his saxophone, learning guitar, mountain biking, listening to podcasts, or pondering about life around him (for instance why people do things ""on purpose"" rather than ""with purpose"").

pArs_mRFP (BBa_K1106003)
A promoter sensitive to the presence of the arsenite ion. It codes for mRFP to produce a red fluorescence when in presence of arsenite, working as a biosensor. This part is from Team: Buenos_Aires and was characterized in our lab as a collaboration between TecMonterrey and Buenos_Aires.
New parts we created
Hip-1 (BBa_K1166000)
Composed of the HIP-1 promoter with the FNR expression cassette upstream for a stronger hypoxic regulation, this promoter will start translation in coding sequences 3' downstream in a hypoxic environment.
His-TAT (BBa_K1166003)
A biobrick that includes the TAT signal peptide that can be fused to any protein for an easy internalization into mammal cells. It includes a 6x His-tag for easy purification.
TAT is a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) derived from the transactivator of transcription from HIV and has been used to internalize a range of large and small molecules from peptides, DNA and antibodies, to liposomes.
TRAIL (BBa_K1166004)
Contains the T7 expression cassette for the soluble part (aminoacids 98-281) of TRAIL with an N-terminal histidine tag (x6) to enhance its purification. It is known to cause apoptosis by binding a membrane receptor.
TAT-Apoptin (BBa_K1166005)
Codes for the T7 expression cassette for TAT-Apoptin composed of a N-terminal TAT translocation peptide, followed by a linker (GGGGS), a histidine tag (6x) and by the same linker fused to Apoptin. Apoptin is a protein from the Chicken Anemia Virus known to cause apoptosis in human cancer cell lines only using a pathway independent from P53 by a phosphorilation in the Threonine 108.

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," RL to PB is catalyzed by integrase in conjunction with RDF, and is irreversible in the presence of these proteins together. For more on the functioning of integrase and RDF in site-specific recombination of att sites, see the appendix on Serine Integrsaes.
Since the switch in the RAD module was demonstrated to be functional [1], we replicated its architecture exactly in our switches. Intervening spacer sequences between functional elements are also the same in our switches.
Figure 1. The invertible promoter switch flips from PB to RL state in the presence of integrase, and from RL to PB state in the presence of integrase and RDF. Difference genes are expressed depending on the state of the switch.
It is important to note that any genes added to the prefix side of the switch must be inverted relative to the BioBrick convention, i.e. they are transcribed from suffix to prefix, rather than prefix to suffix. These inverted genes are expressed when the switch is in PB state.
These switches may be used as a form of passive memory storage; it holds its state after the stimulus (Int or Int+RDF) has passed. It does not require active gene expression to hold state, in contrast to switches that function through regulation of transcription (eg a mutual inhibition toggle switch [4]).
It should be noted that modification of a DNA message was accomplished by Bonnet et al in their March publication [2]. We were not aware of this until our project was nearly complete. However, our work toward modification of a DNA message was key to our project and did allow us to contribute new BioBricks to the registry.
It should also be noted that our BioBrick switch constructs contain an NheI restriction site outside of the functional switch portion of the BioBrick close to the prefix. This NheI site is an artifact of a design idea we had early in our project’s design phase and does not have a functional role. It is not expected to affect the functioning of the switch.

Team Collaboration
Since we are a fairly new iGEM team, we are not familiar with the details about iGEM competition. Therefore we turned to NCTU_Formosa, who hosted this meetup on Aug 24th, during which we took turns presented our project, gave each other feedbacks and suggestions. NCTU_Formosa is especially very helpful on our wiki page. As almost all of our team members are in biology background, building wiki page is truly a huge challenge for us. In this meeting, NCTU_Formosa spent a lot of time teaching and troubleshooting our problem on building wiki pages, for which they prepared a 2-hour-course containing content list below. This is truly a very successful and helpful collaboration. After the meetup, NCTU_Formosa stayed in contact with us by messenger to further assist us with constructing wiki page. T
Team NCTU­_Formosa gave us a tutorial about html. During the tutorial, we learned:
1. Basic tags and elements for html
2. Image scale and website format adjustment
3. Styling html with CSS and JavaScript
4. Conversion of websites in PC and mobile version
Thanks to NCTU­_Formosa’s guide, discussion and their generosity to assist our problems through messages after the meetup. We both learned a lot from each other.
Since NCTU_Formosa is very interested in our project and we both would like to enhance our collaboration, we validated each other’s parts using in the experiments. NCTU-Formosa validated the DNA constructs we expressed in 293T cells in our experiments.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," short film to explain the dangers of the ‘azodumping’ […]”, followed by a stakeholder debate, a concept art competition and the creation of ‘textile-based BioArt’ leading up to a grand three-day exhibition (UCL iGEM 2014). The stakeholder debate can be seen as a form of ‘upstream engagement’, which is a way of showing responsiveness to the concerns that live in society in order to make suggestions to rethink scientific practice. Such dual-use engagement, then, can help to promote a process of democratisation which subsequently becomes a normative value for which to strive for in designing policy (Calvert and Martin 2009; Edwards and Kelle 2012).
Interdisciplinarity
In the process of regaining trust in order to mediate concerns of risk and uncertainty, questions are raised regarding the nature of the knowledge selected for the assessment of synthetic biology as an emerging technology. This implies that society engages in some reflexive action as a response to ongoing technological innovation. The reflexivity comes forth from the assumption that the shaping of knowledge will affect the way late-modern society will be conceived. Keeping the complex implications of this New Biology in mind, post-traditional science thus needs to look for a politics of knowledge that can account for uncertainty issues. From that perspective, the fragmentation of scientific disciplines, and the organisation of how these disciplines produce knowledge, hence does not appear to match broader concerns of dealing with the “misty real-world problems of our society” (Schmidt 2009: 1-2). Therefore, a knowledge politics of the potential synthetic biology controversy requires compatible and hence a diverse set of legitimate knowledge claims. Consequently, interdisciplinarity is considered to be key in late-modern society so that uncertainties that epitomise this time period can be dealt with through various interdisciplinary safety nets from which problematic issues can be approached.
Not only is synthetic biology inherently interdisciplinary, iGEM teams are also made out of students from very diverse academic backgrounds who now work together in a way that requires a considerable amount of knowledge exchange (Robbins 2009; Schmidt 2009). Furthermore, what is particularly reflexive about iGEM and synthetic biology in general, is the use of BioBricks because demonstrate this interdependence between disciplines. By bringing an engineering approach to biology, the construction of BioBricks for genetic circuits enables an operational linkage between engineers and biologists. Both have to work together constructively so that this new and hybrid technology can be developed and which would not have emerged within the constraints of autonomous scientific disciplines. The concept of BioBricks is"

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
From previous reaction, we saw that we were able to amplify some integration product, eventhough it was difficult to see whether or not it's specifically targetted. Therefore, we included more negative control in this reaction. Moreover, it was shown than performing PCR clean up prior to PCR leads no amplification of the integration product, perhaps due to the loss of products that might have been in very little amount during clean up process. Therefore, the following will be implemented in this reaction
The course of integration over time will be observed by stoping the integration reaction at 4 different time points, namely 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hour, and over night.
PCR clean up procedure will not be implemented prior or post PCR reaction.
Second round PCR will be not implemented.
More negative control will be implemented. This includes reaction without adapter (to see whether there will be integration), without EPO (to see whether there will still be amplification product), without sgRNA (to compare the supposedly targetted integration guided by sgRNA vs non targetted integration), reaction with Tn5 (to compare the supposedly targetted integration by our fusion protien vs random integration by Tn5)
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

Georgia_State,2017,Team:Georgia State#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the harvest of the horseshoe crab increased coastwide, with a peak of nearly six million pounds in 1997(Jay Odell, 2005). This sudden increase in harvesting leads to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission representing 15 states from Maine to Florida to develop a horseshoe crab management plan. The ASMFC plan met with vigorous opposition from commercial fishers, the program, supported by conservation groups, was implemented in 2001 (Focus, 2008). The project established state-by-state harvest quotas and establish a 1500-square mile federal horseshoe crab sanctuary in Delaware Bay (Office, 2006). Despite restrictive measures taken in recent years, populations are not showing immediate increases. Mainly, because horseshoe crabs do not breed until they reach nine or more years of age, so as of now there has been no measurably increased (Office, 2006).
Biomedical Threats
Horseshoe crabs do not only face the threat of being used for bait but instead, have a more financially driven predator in the form of the biomedical industry.  If you have ever had a flu shot, known someone with a pacemaker or joint replacement, or given your pet a rabies vaccination, you owe a debt of gratitude to the horseshoe crab. All of these devices are quality checked for safety using a test that comes from the blood of the horseshoe crab. The blood of the crab is very sensitive to endotoxins, the blood from the crab is used commercially to develop the LAL and TAL test. The Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL)test and was commercialized in the United States in the 1970s and Asia, there is a similar test called TAL which takes its name from an Asian species of crab, Tachypleus tridentatus (Jay Odell, 2005). The market for LAL is approximately $50 million (Focus, 2008). Each year,  half a million living horse crabs are harvested to develop these endotoxin tests- for these kits, companies take 30 percent or more of the horseshoe crabs blood. Experts estimate that 10-15% of 500,000 crabs harvested on the Atlantic coast do not survive the bleeding process (Focus, 2008). Currently, no synthetic substitute has the same accuracy as the LAL test, so crab blood must be used, and thus the threat persists (Focus, 2008).

The navigation bar was significantly revised four times in efforts to make it as easy to find the relevant pages as possible, and we've tried to avoid using hidden nested subpages. If you do want a full list of pages with subpages you can see our sitemap . We set up several redirects to make it easier to guess links, although we believe they shouldn’t be required with our navigation bar. In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.
We believe many teams don't take full advantage of the template system Mediawiki offers. By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.
We shared a lot of this knowledge with other teams, including Judd School, University of Westminster and Carroll High School. More information about this is available on our collaborations page .

A chassis, really?
If one accepts what has been developed in our two firsts parts, we believe that he must already be convinced that chassis isn’t a good metaphor for referring to non/human animal such as Xenopus tropicalis. However it is important to insist on  this part of our development we expect to do two separate things. Insist that the chassis metaphor isn’t an adequate term to refer to animals (and certainly living beings, but this goes beyond our project) from both epistemological and ethical point of view; and present an original work recalling the service done by frogs to science, as a special acknowledgment of our collaborator Xenopus.
Metaphors aren't innocent
We have to take keep in mind that there is a performative dimension of language, the words we use influence the ways we act, they tend to open some dimensions of our practice and close others. Cows, pigs and chickens do not require the same treatment than meat factories. It doesn’t deploy the same universe, the same images. And publicity understood the importance of the representation we have concerning what eat and do not eat. The awareness campaign campaigns showing animals mistreated emphasize on what is behind the cow you eat: the construction and demolition of meat factories. We can find many example through history in which reality is transformed by language in order to allow practices that couldn’t be done before. Richard Lewontin, insists on the limit of some metaphors that limit the possibilities opened to research.
In The Triple Helix (1998) the geneticist of development Richard Lewontin explains how different metaphors describing the development (word which is already a metaphor) of an organism influenced the ways we understood embryogenesis and the interaction between the organism and its environment across the XXth century bringing molecular biology to the dream that “decoding” the genome will be the key giving us the full understanding of life and a way to cure most of the diseases.
“While we cannot dispense with metaphors in thinking about nature, there is a great risk of confusing the metaphor with the thing of real interest. We cease to see the world as if it were like a machine and take it to be a machine. The result is that the properties we ascribe to our object of interest and the question we ask about it reinforce the original metaphorical image and we miss the aspects of the system that do not fit the metaphorical approximation. The price of metaphor is an eternal vigilance"

Samples 2, 9, 13 and 18 were pure! we decided to keep B1-13 (lane 8) to perform future ligations.
NOTE: we had a pure sample for B1 (i.e. B1-13)and three almost-pure sample for B2. Anyway, we decided to perform ligation reactions for these samples and the extra band of B2 will be eliminated during gel cut/purification. WE DECIDED TO KEEP B2-5. Next weeks we will think about purifying B2-5 itself.
We transformed 20 pg of B1-13 purified DNA (stored at -20°C) in TOP10 in order to prepare a glycerol stock for this construct. We incubated the plate at 37°C overnight.
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 10 ul of A14pg, A8pg and A9pg glycerol stocks.
We also infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with a single colony taken from B0030 native plate (stored at +4°C).
We incubated the inocula at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.

We picked a single colony from B1-13 plate to infect 1 ml of LB + Amp and incubated this inoculum for 5 hours and 1/2.
We prepared a glycerol stock for B1-13.
We aliquoted the remaining 250 ul of B1-13 bacterial culture in two different falcon tubes and re-filled them with 5 ml of LB + Amp.
We also infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 10 ul of B0015(X2) and B2-5(X2) glycerol stocks.

Figure 1, Pie Charts (1-6):
Pie charts that display data chosen from our online survey with a total set of 14 items and a total number of 82 (20%) participants from a total of 412 iGEM@home users. (1) More than 80% of users that filled out the survey were active members of the distributed computing community before joining iGEM@home. (2) Only 40% of the users paid active attention to the contents of the screensaver. (Please also see the bar chart below for more information). Still 70% of these users evaluated the screensaver as good or better. (3) The forum was evaluated by more than 55 % of the users of whose 60% gave positive reviews. (4) The computing tasks themselves (calculations) were positively rated by 65 % of the participants. Users point out a special need for improvements (in short: ‘work on!’) in the calculations (see comments in the text). (5) An overwhelming majority of about 80% of the participants liked the overall project and ranked it ‘good’ or even ‘perfect’ while none of the participant ranked the overall project as ‘bad’. (6) iGEM@home reached at least 52 persons that had no knowledge of iGEM before which is more than 60% of survey participants.
The review of the computational tasks/calculations in correspondence with direct feedback messages and posts of users via the comments field of the survey and the forum pages (see paragraph 3.) reveals a need for improvement of calculations concerning the way calculation processes are split into consumable subtasks. BOINC veterans reviewed the calculations (figure 1, (4)) as to be improved by introducing checkpoints to the calculations that allow an abandoned task to be continued instead of being recalculated from the very start. The overall reception of the project is very good. Not a single participant rated the project 'bad'. Only 5% of the participants did not know how to rank the BOINC project iGEM@home (figure 1, (5). One of the most imporatant results of the survey is the fact that more than 60% of the participants did not now of the existence of the iGEM competition before they downloaded and supported iGEM@home.

Project design:
In the course of designing the minimal mitochondrial genome, Dr. Jiang suggested that we use                         the                         existing gene                         annotation files combined with multi-genomic comparison and homologous evolution analysis to                         determine                         the                         importance of the genes in the wild-type S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome. He assigned Dr.                         Cheng                         Jian, who is                         responsible for the calculation of biological information in his research group, to guide us                         through                         the design of                         the entire genome. (see Design & Model for specific design).
Experiments:
During the process of genome synthesis, Dr. Jiang assigned his master student, Qi Jiangxing, to                         guide                         us on the                         extraction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial genome and the preparation of                         Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae rho0                         cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lost the mitochondrial genome). He gave us the access to                         their                         lab                         and                         provided                         us with some experimental reagent supplies.
Project progress and advice:
In the middle of the summer break, Dr. Jiang made a mid-term progress consultation for                         NKU-China                         and                         our team, and                         gave feedback and guidance on the progress and results of the mid-term experiment. There were                         some                         repetitive and                         polluting problems in our experiments at that time, thus Dr. Jiang suggested that we might as                         well                         “return to zero”                         for the lab, pay attention to the experimental operation and carry out a negative and positive                         control.

Reflections
We are currently concerned about the problems we have experience with cell competency, and have taken steps this week to reinvigorate our previous cell line, as well as creating a new more competent cell line. Once we have a competent cell line, we feel confident that the lab work will progress rapidly. We have also been tackling concerns with Human Practice this week, notably the issues regarding the safety of our DIYbio project. While these aspects of the project have been difficult, we are encouraged by all the packages from in-kind sponsorship we have received this week.
Success of the Week We had two articles published about our project this week - Smithsonian and DVICE
Fail of the Week The competency of our cells is extremely low, and we will need to create a new competent cell line

We have a Comsol simulation for diffusion experiments that explains why at 1mM AHL concentration in sender wells, all 4 wells glow at the same time irrespectively of channel length. On the other hand if we use μ , the wells should start glowing at different times. The channels are 1 to 4mm long. We used a Hill function to model activation of GFP in the receiver wells.

Our first diffusion try with highlighter ink !
Camera picture of our punched agar chip glowing highlighter ink
The design of punched agar doesn't seem to be the best but at least we can see something. Diffusion experiments with different designs are running now.
We have been fitting quorum sensing experiments at steady state to a Hill function and found some quorum sensing parameters.
Fitting quorum sensing Hill function parameters thanks to steady-state data from experiments. Check the corresponding article for more details.
We wrote a survey in English , in French and in German on complexity for our human practice project. We expect 500 responses.

The plasmids for quorum sensing experiments concerning the Lux system are made and operational to be used for experiments. We have three different plasmids:
Lux promoter folowed by GFP gene
Lux promoter followed by cisRNA and then by GFP
Lux promoter controlling the expression of taRNA and cisRNA. The cisRNA coding gene is followed by GFP.
The third plasmid corresponds to a riboregulating system. The second plasmid allowed us to validate the crucial role of taRNA in this riboregulating system.
On the modeling point of view, we only tried to fit the data coming from experiments done with plasmid one (with no riboregulating system) and plasmid three (with an effective riboregulating system). They were the only one to show an answer to a change of input that was not on the noise level.
The experimental setting was to inject different concentration of the signaling molecule AHL at the same time point into different bacterial colonies. The factor that we want to observe is the strength of the activation of the Lux promoter. The"

AHUT_China,2018,Team:AHUT China#HP FOR SILVER_-_-_TEXT.html," escaping into the environment and causing DNA contamination.
During exchange of project experience with each other, we learned that NEU-China-A had a little bit of a problem in one of the plasmid insertion experiments, so they asked us for help and wanted us to conduct the construction experiment of secreting the yebf-homoil10 plasmid.Our counterpart and we made it clear about what we were going to cooperate followed by three video meetings. NEU-China-A helped us carry out experiments on optimizing the conditions of prokaryotic expression of CSCA protein and purifying expression. In a similar way, we helped NEU-China-A perform fragment-linking experiment. NEU-China-A provided us with original plasmid of PCDF-Duet1 (dry powder tube), they taught us to overlap the secretion label Yebf (from BL21(DE3)DNA, GenBank: EF648003.1) with human-derived interleukin 10 (from BBa_K554004, Spring 2018 Distribution 21K 2018 Kit Plate 1), and required us to add the FLAG label at the N end of homoIL10 for subsequent protein detection. According to the requirements of our friend, we conducted the experiment on construction of secreting the plasmid Yebf-homoIL10. Having sequenced and verified the plasmid construction successfully, we mailed the no less than 100ng plasmid dry powder to them.
NEU-China-A helped us implement experiments on optimizing the conditions of prokaryotic expression of CSCA protein and purifying expression. Our friendship has thus been strengthened and the projects have also been pushed forward as the result of this collaboration, which is regarded as a successful cooperation by both of us.
    7. Biofilm Process Water Purification Laboratory
On September 8, 2018, our AHUT-China team visited the Biofilm Process Water Purification Laboratory of the College of Architecture and Engineering of Anhui University of Technology. The graduate student Xu Fan led us to visit the laboratory. The seniors introduced us to the principle of purifying sewage in the laboratory, which made us understand that relying on the microbial membrane fixed on the surface of the carrier to degrade organic matter has the characteristics of good effect and low technology and low cost.
Then we introduced our project to the seniors. The seniors said that many problems caused by CO2 also brought us many problems. Therefore, he has great hope for our project. At the same time, we have learned that the biomembrance process can not only treat sewage, but also can be applied to the treatment"
