Collaboration with iGEM Franconia · QR Code · Game app—Pathomon · Getting rid of virus One of the main goals of the International Genetically Engineered Machine foundation is to encourage collaboration between iGEM teams across the world. This year, we had the honor to collaborate with the iGEM Franconia team to help them further develop their game application, Pathomon, by placing a QR code on our poster. The moral of the game is to alleviate a virtual pathogen that has contaminated a large population of participants attending the Giant Jamboree. This game promotes direct social interaction between members to work together to eliminate the outbreak. By having a QR code on our poster, we are supporting iGEM’s goal of team collaboration and communication. To learn more about the Franconia collaboration, click here.

BIT-CHINA team of BIT gave a lesson to the pupil of Wanquan primary school on September 27, 2013. First of all, we toked something like life, environment protect, energy. Then we told the children what is the synthetic biology and how can they work use synthetic biology. Third we explain the importance of synthetic and iGEM. At last we let the kids to think about what can we do thought synthetic biology. Kids are very interested and excited, they came up with many ideas which came form children’s life and they experience. what made me happy is the pupil are seem interested to synthetic biology,. I believe somebody of them will make that more advanced.
On September 18, 2013, BIT - CHINA team came to Sunny Baby Kindergarten and spent a pleasant afternoon with children. While discussing with preschool children in biology frontier such as synthetic biology sounds funny, we are not constrained in the exchange form, We can also help these children remind of the interest of science. The communication of the kindergarten was one of the most successful one in all our activities. ""What are bacteria?"" ""You know what the biology is?"" ""Have you heard gene?"" ""The design of synthetic biology is just like the children building blocks, and what kind of synthetic biology building do you want to build?"" Here, we also felt their rich imagination and full of vitality, and we believe that they will exert their director to make a better future.

BIT,2017,Team:BIT#Model#Bioamplifer_-_-_TEXT.html," the amplification by mathematical model and detect the amount of material on . Therefore, we use the support of literature , use the model to verify the linear relationship between the GFP and RFP ratio, to verify that the dual fluorescence system can be used for our project detection link, which play a guiding experimental team successfully completed the role of the experiment.
Introduction
In this model, we made the following assumptions:
(1) having constructed lysine-deficient Escherichia coli and obtained accurate experimental data.
(2) the promoter sequence unchanged after the inhibition of protein binding to the promoter.
(3) the terminator can completely terminate the promoter.
(4) When the inhibitory protein is absent, the promoter can stably express red fluorescent protein (RFP).
(5) don’t consider the expression of the leakage of gene lines.
The first part
1.The gene line which produce green fluorescent
First, according to the gene line above, we can get the expression, transcription and degradation of the following genes. Among them, k1 is the producing rate of mRNAlacI, k-1 is the degrading rate of mRNAlacI, k2 is the producing rate of proteinlacI , k-2 is the degrading rate of proteinlacI :
The expression formula of promoter activity was constructed by Hill equation. β1 is the maximum starting ability of the promoter (generally set to 1), M1 is the amount of leakage of the promoter, SluxR is the amount of regulation factor, kd is the SluxR value when the model change trend is changed:
Finally, according to the differential equation to express the expression, transcription and degradation process of the whole gene line:
According to our gene line, it can be concluded that the amount of proteinlacI can be approximated as the amount of proteinGFP (green fluorescence).
Among them, according to the database in the official website of igem , we can know the value of some parameters: the maximum capacity of start-up promoterβ1 = 0.6; the amount of the leakage of promoter M1 = 0; n1 = 2. So we put these known parameters into the equation and get the value of kd at equal distances: 50,100,150,200, finally draw a rough image:
From these differential equations, combining the gene line of the whole expression group,we can get the model of green fluorescent protein expression and get the conclusion: the concentration of lysine from the upstream is higher , the rate of survival of lysine-deficient Escherichia coli is higher , the"

Generation of a GFP mouse cell line
For testing whether MuLV can stable transfer genes into cells, a stable mouse cell line using this virus was generated.
Therefore two 100mm plates were transduced with 3 ml virus supernatant (MuLV IRES EGFP) and splitted as usual. Cells were sorted with a cell sorter. Analysis via FACS happened before and after sorting. The analysis was repeated after several rounds of splitting.

Not sure if it's because of the code (which should work regardless of the number of frames) or if it's because of the SiftDev/Siftulator App that images are not appearing on the simulated cubes. When Kim tested the finalized animation on the actual cubes, they worked with an error coming up (which we still have to figure out). Hopefully we'll be able to figure this out by tomorrow because it'd be great if I could concentrate on getting the E. Coli cube to work (including the main functionality behind it which is have it interact with the colored cube and, if said cube is flipped, color will transfer onto the E. Coli cube).
Really hoping to get all this done by Friday since Demo session with high school students is on Wednesday. Devoting Monday and Tuesday to debugging any more (hopefully minor) problems with the demo.
Day 30: July 10, 2012
The latest version of the dripping animation for one of the BioBrick options
Kim and I were finally able to animate the finalized dripping images properly and the cubes appear with as they should when starting out. However, three main problems arose: one, when the E. Coli cube and the Colored cube are neighbors and the colored cube is tilted, the E. Coli cube runs the animation that should run on the Plasmid cube; two, after the dripping animation runs between the E. Coli and Plasmid cube, the Plasmid cube resets back to the original, blank image; and three, for some reason the order of the E. Coli images is wrong, so when the animation runs, the E. Coli looks like it's having a spasm attack. After speaking with Orit, I'm planning to start a major restructuring of the code then start working on the flipping functionality between the Plasmid and E. Coli cube.
Day 31: July 11, 2012
I was able to recode one of the major classes and figured out how to solve the interaction problems I had found out about yesterday as well as the dripping animation issue and to have the Plasmid cube remain the same color even after the Plasmid and Colored cubes are no longer neighbors. Now, I'm working on the flip functionality between the Plasmid cube and the E. Coli cube but am currently running into problems.

High School Workshop
Synthetic Biology 101
How do you start an iGEM Team?
La La LAMP
The NYUAD iGEM team invited high school students and teachers from Brighton College in Abu Dhabi, UAE, to experience an iGEM research environment. This one-day workshop provided the students with the opportunity to channel their interest in both biology and engineering. This is the first high school workshop that is tailored towards exposing talented high school students to iGEM in the UAE, and future NYU Abu Dhabi iGEM teams will continue hosting this workshop for students in and around Abu Dhabi. All of the materials we used are provided below.
Previous Next
The workshop was kicked off by a presentation on iGEM and emphasized how the students can get involved by potentially joining future NYUAD teams or by creating their own team. Throughout this presentation, the students also learned the important connection between biology and engineering in the context of iGEM and the field of synthetic biology. This presentation was followed by the first workshop of the day: GLO, Bacteria, GLO, which taught the students how to transform pGLO DNA into DH5α E. coli using the heat shock method. The NYUAD team walked them through basic laboratory techniques including, lab safety, basic pipetting techniques and bacterial transformation, which is integral to an iGEM team’s success. The students then experienced the engineering environment through the second workshop Arduino + LED, which taught the students how to integrate many elements to create a device that included interactive design, programming, and circuitry. The students learned the basics of programming and circuit design by creating their own simple circuit using LEDs and Arduino, an open source electronic platform. After completing the workshop, the students also received a copy of the NYUAD team’s magazine Synthetic Biology 101 as a source for further information about recent advances in synthetic biology.
The NYUAD team is proud to have pioneered the first iGEM-specific workshop for high school students in the UAE. The workshop achieved the original aim of propagating the impact of iGEM in the region and encouraging interest in scientific research among high school students. In the future, the NYUAD team envisions similar workshops that can reach a larger audience in the UAE.

Farmers
Katie Brandt, Michigan State University Student Organic Farm
Because the use of GMOs in the food supply is a hot topic of debate, we felt it was important to understand why people may be opposed to growing and consuming GMOs. If we hope that crops will be grown with our GM bacteria one day, we need to identify the reasons why people might feel uncomfortable using it. This way we can figure out if there's anything we can do now to make them more comfortable using our product in the future. Therefore, we chose to meet with a representative from the Michigan State University Student Organic Farm, a large farm on campus. The use of genetic engineering is prohibited in organic products, so the farmers at the MSU Student Organic Farm purposely avoid growing GM crops. In order to understand barriers to our project, we needed to understand the other side of the argument. Team members Jessica and Jordan conducted a 20 minute phone interview with the farm's Farmer Field School Program Manager, Katie Brandt. Katie Brandt has a MS in Biology.
Jessica and Jordan: What are your thoughts on GMOs?
Katie: I am neither for nor against. I know growers who feel that, economically, they must use GMOs to maintain acreage. I know a grower who inherited over 1000 acres for GM soybeans, but wanted to change to organic. However, a lot of growers have a hard time moving to organic. My biggest problem is seed sovereignty and other issues from huge corporations that have developed GMOs. I dislike that most of the modifications being made are often about herbicide tolerance and inclusion of pesticides that may cause pest resistance due to low dose constant available rate to the pests. BT corn is also common now, and used on the MSU Student Organic Farm. I worry that using BT corn might make pest resistance occur on organic farms, and it may be very difficult to get rid of pests in the future. I’ll admit however, that I still know very little about GMOs, and most of my education on them came from classes in graduate school"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With"

Starting with one of the last year’s finalist TU Delft’s 2010 iGEM project about the conversion of different hydrocarbon sources in aqueous environments, all attending teams presented their results and strategies. The team from the University of Southern Denmark, Odense , presented their 2010’s project Flow E. The aim was to develop a biological system, which is able to generate flow in a fluid-filled tube by inducing the flagella movement with light by the use of a photosensor. This year’s iGEM Team from the University of Edinburgh aims to use and convert plant biomass, especially cellulose, to fermentable sugars like glucose. Therefore several cellulases are fused to a coat protein of the M13 bacteriophage. Ultimately the team’s goal is to create a biorefinery system to convert complex glucans into higher value products. The last year’s medicine track winner Freiburg presented their virus construction kit for therapy use. They managed to create different BioBricks and devices for individual virus construction. Last year’s grand prize winner Slovenia gave the audience a brief historical overview of all Slovenian iGEM projects so far. The session closed with the talk of the Team Bielefeld dealing with their topics from 2010 – a modulated two component sensor system for detection of capsaicin – and a preview for 2011 – nanobiotechnolgical S-layer based Biosensor for bisphenol A.
Additionally, the students used the opportunity to share and exchange their iGEM experience and their ideas of Synthetic Biology at the symposium and at the social events provided by the iGEM Team Bielefeld. The symposium’s iGEM session was a success and hence indices that the iGEM idea reached the scientific community.

We then performed a test digest but concluded that samples were contaminated by each other when we observed two bands in each lane corresponding to both sizes of promoters ( Figure ).
We made new overnights of PrsaA and Pxyl transformation colonies as well as a colony transformed with BBa_K081005, then Miniprepped and PCR amplified them this time using VF2 and VR so that the fragments would be large enough to see on a gel.  We also used One Taq instead of Phusion polymerase and our gel shows a lot of mispriming and extra bands. However, the PCR was sufficient to confirm the sizes of all three promoters ( Figure ). We sent PrsaA and Pxyl for sequencing and the results show successful isolation.
We digested the three promoters with SpeI and PstI to be ligated with esp plus rsaA and transformed.
This week is incomplete ( Figure , Figure , and Figure )
Week 5 June 26- July 2
Transformation plates of PrsaA and Pxyl with esp plus rsaA combination insert had a lot of growth, too many colonies to count and were unusually small.  We PCR amplified  with VF2 and VR but the gel showed that only the promotor region was present in the vector ( Figure and Figure ).
We decided to run some tests to see where we were going wrong.  We tested the restriction enzymes and the test showed that they work fine ( Figure ).  We plated competent cells without DNA on all plates with all antibiotics and plain L-Broth on plates.  We found that only our carb plates were contaminated with E. coli so we made new carb plates.  We also made new competent cells in case they were also contaminated.
We tried inserting the promotors into the vector containing esp plus rsaA rather than the other way around to see if we could get better results and got similar looking plates.  We also realized after looking at the gel ( Figure , Figure , and Figure ) that the size of one of the samples appeared be about 700bp, which is a size we would expect for rsaA alone.  We went back and examined the original gel image that led us to believe that it was both esp and rsaA together only to find that we had read the ladder wrong and we had in fact been working only with rsaA.

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Statistic Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"2.All populations from samples have the same variances
The T-value (t) of eachpair is calculated by:$$t_{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}=\dfrac { \overline {x_{1}}-\overline {x_{2}}} {\sqrt {\dfrac {\left( n_{1}-1\right) s^{2}_{1}+\left( n_{2}-1\right) s^{2}_{2}} {\left( n_{1}-1\right) + \left( n_{2}-1\right) }\left( \dfrac {1}{n_{1}}+\dfrac {1}{n_{2}}\right) }}$$
When $ n_{1}=n_{2}=n=3 $ in this case, it can be simplify as: $$ t_{2\left( n-1\right) }=\dfrac {\overline {x_{1}}-\overline {x_{2}}}{\sqrt {\dfrac {s^{2}_{1}+s^{2}_{2}}{n}}} $$
By using two-tailed test, if p-value is lower than 0.05 or $ t > t_{4,0.05\left( two-tailed \right) }=2.776 $, we can say two mean have statistically significantly different.
Results
Levene’s test, gave us results that each group is homogeneity at P-value of 0.05, indicating we can assume they have equal variances.T-test for pooled data gave us following results:

However, as iPSCs is a newly emerged technique, people who are not major in biology may know little about it. Thus, we decided to do a popularization about iPSCs in the hospital to let patients get to know the concept of iPSCs and its prospect of clinical applications. We also listen to their opinions about application of iPSCs and discuss this issue with them.
The hospital we went to is the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In the hospital, we told the patients and medicine workers the concept of iPSCs, and asked them whether they support relating techniques to apply in clinic. One of the nurses we interviewed supported the application of iPSCs. She believed that only with the application of this technique can we cure some incurable diseases. On the other hand, many people show the concern about the potential risks of the application of the iPSCs in clinic, which is mainly about its safety.
In this activity, we find that the public know little about iPSCs technology and we really need to do some popularization to let the commons understand what scientists are doing and why iPSCs can change this world.
In order to know more about what people think about iPSCs, we did a survey after we came back from the hospital. This survey helped us get to know how well the public know about iPSCs and the concerns about the clinical application of iPSCs.
In this survey, we can see that more than half of the participants didn’t hear of iPSCs. Considering that many of the participants are students from school fo life science, if we eliminate people majored in biology, we can find that most of the participants know little about iPSCs. We also asked whether they will try iPSCs therapy themselves, and why or why not. Because we weren’t able to collect enough data till now, it’s not possible to draw a conclusion. We can still learn from the data that public concern about the potential risk of iPSCs applying in clinic.
Cooperation with GDILSF
Guangdong international life science foundation ( GDILSF ) , founded in 2011, is a nonprofit civil society organization, which support the Guangzhou institutes of biomedicine and health( GIBH )belonging to Chinese academy of science.
We cooperated with GDILSF in the following ways. We write several reports and articles about iPSCs or human health, which is ready to publish on a newspaer called Life Science. We are able to do"

Biochemical skills competition:
We tested our project in Guangdong Biochemical Skills Competition in advance. Our team extracted astaxanthin and tested its oxidation in this large scale competition. After extracting from the shrimp shell and gainning the highly purified astaxanthin, carotenoids, lycopene and other material, we compared these materail and found that the antioxidant level of astaxanthin is the highest.
In the competition, we basically identify that astaxanthin is easy to extract and have strong antioxidation material, which can be used in skin care production and has a certain huge advantage.
Mission statement
Our aim is to improve people's life with the help of science. We will stick to comply with the law on the prevention and control of biological industry rules, and respect for the law of intellectual property rights.
Current status
The aSTARice project has not entered the market yet. If the company was founded finally, our project will belong to instructor who provides us with all the money and the iGEMteam members who take part in the experiment.
In the current status, professor Zhu Qinglong has most of shares, other people who participate in this project have remainder shares.
Market analysis

Gel run, results not shown as gel was very 'messy'. Gel had probably already begun to set when poured and so had many artefacts when imaged. As a result each lane required different brightness and contrast settings to visualise and so the full gel was not clearly visible on the printout. However, all of the bands could be identified on the screen and were exactly as expected and very clear and pure.
Bands in correct places, indicating that expected plasmid was present in the cells. This indicates that, although they work at a very low efficiency, our electro-competent cells still work. It may be valuable to use these when trying to grow up plasmids that we already have at high concentration.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,"at running a preliminary experiment to calibrate parameters such as dilution rate and temperature of the heat block. 50 ml burettes used here to accurately measure effluent levels. 1 litre Duran bottles were used for effluent collection in the main experiment due to greater volumes of effluent.
Our own growth curve was performed to determine the maximum specific growth rate of E. coli BL21 (DE3) in our lab, but could not be conducted for a sufficient length of time to be accurate. A maximum specific growth rate value of 1.730 was used (Cox, 2004). The ministat must be set to a flow rate at which dilution rate is less than maximum specific growth rate. This prevents the culture being washed out of the growth chambers. The dilution rate of the culture was calculated by measuring flow rate at a setting of 7.5 rpm on the peristaltic pump. For practical reasons the pump could not be run faster than this due to the amount of media needed. The dilution rate was set at 0.2 which produced cultures that grew at an average OD of 3.47 for KillerRed samples, 3.64 for KillerOrange samples and 3.17 for lysozyme samples. The ministat must be set to flow rate at which dilution rate is below the maximum specific growth rate. This prevents the culture being washed out of the chamber. OD was measured daily with a Bug Lab OD scanner. When the same sample was measured in a tecan infinite 200 pro plate reader the Bug Lab showed reading approximately three times higher. The difference between the samples was consistent regardless of the method used to measure OD.
Ministat experiment
All samples from the ministat were tested using the KillerRed, KillerOrange protocol found here . Glycerol stocks were made from the samples taken at each time interval, testing was done using these glycerol stocks.
The following graphs show the average number of colonies of samples taken at 0 h, 24 h, 120 h and 168 h of continuous culture and then tested in the light box. Values were  averaged across three biological repeats. Colonies were not counted above 300 and so this is the maximum value given. All samples were induced to a final concentration of 0.2 nM IPTG. All samples were  diluted 1000 times in a final volume of 4.5 ml liquid broth (LB). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.

● The sales of anti-oxidant products are on the rise.
● More and more people are pursuing anti-oxidant and anti-aging products.
Therefore, we have more reasons to believe that our product has a good application prospect in                         the market.
Wehand-bio
A leading innovative pharmaceutical company in Beijing, communicated with us about what our                         product can do.
● Most medicines would use antioxidants to prevent oxidation of medicines. So, our product                             could also be applied in pharmaceutical production.
● In addition to detect the antioxidant capability of antioxidants, we also can test                             whether the natural antioxidant products will deteriorate in quality over time.
Now, more and more antioxidant products are on the market, consumers are confused about the                         antioxidant effect of products and we learned it by questionnaires. Hopefully our product can                         help them.
You know the most amazing thing is that countless excellent natural antioxidants are hidden in                         nature, just countless starts twinkling in the Milky Way. When I was young, I looked up at                         starry sky and asked, ""Are there aliens in the universe?"". Someone answer, ""The universe is                         big, bigger than you, bigger than anything. If it's just us, it is a waste of space."" Today I                         wonder if there are excellent antioxidants in the nature to solve the problem of aging. There                         are so many substances in nature beyond our imagination. If not, it is a waste of space.                         Hopefully, our product can detect excellent antioxidants, which is our original dream.
We would do our best to make the product more beneficial to the world.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this process as the graph shows below.
As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#build#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies. As iGEM UNL is working on E. Coli and iGEM Amsterdam on the production of  fumarate, we first define a strategy to make a fumarate producing E. Coli mutant. Then we assess the mechanism to reduce methane emissions with fumarate. Finally, we explore different ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system.
How E. Coli can produce fumarate
E. Coli can in theory produce fumarate by an oxidative (aerobic) or a reductive (anaerobic) route. In the latter case, the fumarate molecule itself is used as a final electron donor in this process, which is believed to be coupled with cell growth in anaerobic conditions (Iverson et al. , 1999). It is assumed that for this reason, it is not possible to genetically engineer E. Coli to produce fumarate in anaerobic conditions (Song et al. , 2013). This is problematic,as the cattle rumen is anaerobic.
Now if it would be possible to introduce E. Coli in aerobic conditions in the cow’s digestive system, we would be able to use aerobically producing fumarate E. coli strains. For this, we could imitate a genetic engineering strategy used by the iGEM Amsterdam project.
How team Amsterdam produces fumarate in Cyanobacteria
In the Cyanobacterial model organism Synechocystis PCC 6803 , iGEM team Amsterdam managed to produce fumarate in a genetically stable, growth-coupled way, by knocking out the fumarase encoding fumaric acid hydratase (fumC) gene.
How we can apply the Amsterdam genetic engineering strategy in E. Coli
To apply a similar approach in E. Coli and to end up with a respectable titer, multiple gene knock-outs are required. E. Coli has more fumarase encoding genes, then Synechoscystis,  namely anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumB) and aerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumA), which both need to be knocked out as well (Song et al. , 2013). Knocking out the Fumarase proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from fumarate. This impairs the"

In order to prove the function of this receptor in yeast cell, another plasmid with our reporter device, pRS42K-mRFP-CYC1t, was transformed into CEN.PK2-1C, More details about this part of work will be displayed in host website transduction and detection .
The sense device, BBa_2368007 and BBa_2368008, was expressed successfully in the host yeast. Once the receptor can respond the presence of sweeteners, the mRFP will be expressed as output. (Fig. 13)
Fig. 14  A simplified model of the αpheromone pathway with T1R2/T1R3
Following the above, we separately added a list of sweeteners like fructose, sucrose, glucose into the culture to detect the red fluorescence intensity based on whether its regulatory interaction with sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3.
So we selected two sweeteners, fructose and sucrose, for the first testing.
Firstly, we selected a single cell clone of CEN.PK2-1C with the circuits mentioned previously and cultured this clone in SD medium with 2% glucose and corresponding concentration of antibiotic G418 at 30℃ overnight.
After harvesting cells, we centrifuged the cells and added new SD medium with 2% galactose and antibiotic G418 for inducing the expression of T1R2 and T1R3. Incubated at 30℃ for 12 hours.
Then added sweeteners into culture according to Table 1

After adding sweeteners, we used plate reader to measure the fluorescence intensity and OD600, calculated the value of fluorescence intensity/ OD600 as the  mean fluorescence intensity at the single cell level. The mean fluorescence intensity is showed in Fig.15.

As the picture shows, the fructose group and sucrose group established obvious increase compared to control group from 12h to 16h.
The red fluorescence intensity at the single cell level all increased, but the sucrose group and fructose group increased faster than control group, which meant adding sweeteners indeed accelerated the fluorescence protein production in"

Current treatments are regarded by patients as unsatisfactory. From discussions with patients, we have identified three main problems with current treatments:
Side effects: sometimes so severe that treatment must be stopped
Price: these drugs are very expensive for the UK National Health Service
High dosage frequency: drugs must be taken daily and refrigerated
Our Cure aims to address these limitations.
Wilson's disease causes distinctive copper deposits in the cornea of some patients, causing brown rings around the iris called Kayser-Fleischer rings.
Probiotics
A probiotic is a microorganism that is introduced into the body for its beneficial properties. The concept of a probiotic, meaning “for life”, was introduced by Elie Metchnikoff in 1907, when he hypothesised that replacing or diminishing the populations of ‘putrefactive’ bacteria in the gut with lactic acid bacteria could positively affect bowel health.
Products that are commonly sold as probiotics include foodstuffs, such as yoghurts and cheeses.  However, recently there has been an increase in the amount of research going into the use of probiotics as therapeutics, with the genetic engineering of organisms to produce useful substances. Currently there is limited legislation regarding probiotics, as probiotics sold as dietary supplements do not require FDA approval. A genetically-engineered probiotic therapeutic would require more stringent legislation and FDA approval to ensure, through clinical trials, that it works as expected.
Although advancing rapidly, the field of probiotics still requires significant research particularly in areas such as safety. Although regarded as safe for relatively healthy humans to consume, there have been some reports of probiotic-related side effects in people with serious underlying medical conditions. We carried out a comprehensive safety review when completing our project.

Parts
In order to provide a long-term treatment for Wilson's disease we realised that we needed to design components of a bacterial system that could detect copper and produce a copper chelator to prevent its absorption by the body.
We investigated copper detection using promoter systems based upon the native E. coli copper regulator CueR and the CusS/CusR two component system. The two copper chelators we tested were Copper storage protein 1 (Csp1) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and mycobacterial metallothionein (MymT) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Today we looked at a paper describing efficient ways to propagate large phage.  They suggested agarose instead of agar, and at a concentration of 0.15% which is 1.5 g/L.  Dr. Grose explained to us that agarose is more stable and forms larger pores, requiring a smaller amount of powder to produce a solid, stable gel. LB Agarose top agar can be plated onto normal LB bottom agar.  We will make up some agarose top agar and see what size of plaques we get.
Wednesday we will need to start an overnight culture in a 250 mL flask (using 25 mL of LB broth). We will a piece of a small colony and put it in the flask along with 20 ug of adenine per mL. It will incubate on the shaker until class starts.
6/12/13
Results from 6/10/13 Unfortunately none of our agarose media set up, even in the jars that were left on the counter. This was unfortunate because it meant our seven plates were unreadable. We will need to make a higher concentration of agarose to learn what it takes for agarose top agar to solidify on LB agar plates.
Today we started an E. coli B culture in a 250 mL flask, 25 mL LB broth, and 100 uL of adenine (final concentration 20 ug/mL).  This grew from 9am until 3pm when we pelleted the bacteria at 3,000 rpm in a Sorvall centrifuge. The bacteria was resuspended in 25"

Lethbridge_HS,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#Prototype_-_-_TEXT.html," to pump the blood up from the container, so we will fill the syringe up with the blood before we attach it to the tubing. We also bought a plastic clear container that was $17.00 instead of cutting and assembling the plexiglass into a box.
Putting Our Prototype Together
For the assembly of our prototype we started off by drilling a hole in one of the sides and then we drilled another hole opposite of the first one so the tubing will go through the splash box. These holes were made into the shorter sides of the rectangular box. We cut the middle part of one of the longer sides so that the viewers can get a better view of the steak and our product being applied. We will fill the syringe up with blood from the blood container, then attach the medical tubing to the tip of the syringe. The medical tubing goes through the splash box and into our steak, then more medical tubing is attached to the other side of the steak and then out. At the end of the tubing there will be another container to collect the blood. Because we are not using a flow meter in our prototype to measure the pressure of the blood, we can qualitatively measure it by looking at the video that we took of our prototype in action, frame by frame.
Results
We have only done test runs of water and blood through our prototype, we haven’t tested our construct with it yet but we are planning to do that in the future. When we tested our prototype with water, we just filled a syringe full of water and attached it to the medical tubing that ran through our splash box. This was to see if the design of our prototype was successful or not. We ran it with the blood in our lab, for this we made a small incision in the medical tubing that was inside of our splash box. This simulated a wound site and this was successful as blood did gush out of the cut.
This video shows us using medical tubing with an incision in it to simulate a cut. Blood runs through the tubing and spurts out of the cut site. The end of the tubing is blocked with modelling clay and tape to prevent any blood from coming out of the end."

Aastha Mathur
Before she decided to come all the way from India to Germany to do her masters in Molecular Biosciences with majors in Systems Biology, Aastha had already a bachelor degree in Bioinformatics from there. Her bachelor thesis was about creating a web tool for calculation of protein interactions which she carried out at the Indian Institute of Science. For iGEM, she is a part of the modelling force. Working with systems and synthetic biology has been of prime interest to her and, of course, she thinks with this we can achieve our ultimate goal; Creating tiny pet dinosaurs.
Alejandro Macías Torre
After finishing his bachelor studies in Madrid Autónoma University with a bachelor thesis in directed evolution of dihydroxyacetone kinases, Alejandro spent a year working in the Biocatalysis department of a Japanese company with the program Vulcanus in Japan. Currently he pursues the master program on Molecular Biosciences with major in Systems Biology in Heidelberg University. One of his strongest reasons to join iGEM was the unique opportunity of combining science with creativity, something that does not happen very frequently. He thinks that synthetic biology can help mankind take steps forward at the same time it provides some insight about the basic principles of life.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," turnover rate. The trick is to find the “sweet spot” of the translation rates at which in some cells one protein takes the upper hand ,and in some cells the other protein. This sweet spot has been found with a mathematical model . Figure 7 shows the presence of two different subpopulations as computed by the model.
Figure 7. Two populations are visible and together they form a growing cell population. The right y-axis shows the volume of these populations. Volume oscillations correspond dividing cells. The total amount of RFP produced by the toxin is shown by the black line.
As an alternative to quorum sensing, we added a toggle switch to the system that allows BeeT to regulate toxin production even if the bacteria do not grow well in beehives. Slow growth is a limitation of the quorum sensing system: cells might not be able to grow to the density required for toxin production. Instead, the toggle switch system makes use of the earlier described riboswitch, which is not dependent on population density.
The toggle switch we created controls expression of the BeeT’s toxin between an off-state and an on-state. It is switched on by guanine or vitamin B12, and switched off by blue light. The latter is based on the optogenetic kill switch, explained later in more detail. Apart from combining multiple systems, the toggle switch ensures that the response to guanine or vitamin B12 is fast. To create this system, a new hybrid promoter was made. The hybrid promoter ensures that toxin production is only possible in the absence of light. Figure 8 shows the results of 5 different hybrid promoters controlling expression of RFP. From this we concluded that the hybrid promoter BBa_K1913025 is the most active. Although we did not have time to test the system as a whole, we expect it to work since both the riboswitches and the hybrid promoter are functional separately.
Figure 8. For five E. coli cultures, each with a different hybrid promoter and all with the reporter gene RFP, the fluorescence divided by OD 600 is shown. The cultures were grown overnight in the dark. As a negative control, the same E. coli with the corresponding hybrid promoter but lacking the light sensor was used.
BeeT is intended to use in beehives, where bee’s fly in and out continuously. This means BeeT can be spread by the bee’s throughout the environment. Since we cannot be sure about its effect on existing ecosystems, BeeT must be engineered to die if it leaves the beehive. To accomplish this we made use of an optogenetic kill"

Project description
While low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism.
In terms of fat storage, conversion of carbohydrates or protein into fat uses ten times more calories of energy than simply storing fat in a fat cell. This brought us attention to one method of burning calories - increase energy expenditure by converting fat into glucose. However, mammals cannot convert fatty acids into carbohydrate due to lack of glyoxylate enzymes, while plants and bacteria can. We envision to introduce glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells and create an artificial futile cycle.
While the consequence of introducing nonnative cycle unknown, Dean et al. at UCLA recently has introduced glyoxylate shunt into mammalian liver cell to investigate fatty acid metabolism (2009). They observed that although fatty acids could not be converted into glucose in normal mammalian cells, human hepatocytes expressing the glyoxylate shunt have increased fatty acid oxidation and mice expressing the shunt were resistance to diet-induced obesity.
In addition to introducing a constitutive glyoxylate shunt, our team plans to elaborate the UCLA study by introducing inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. This inducible system prevents the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while greater fatty acid uptake at high circulating concentrations can be facilitated. Fatty acids uptake will be quantified to compare the activities in wild type cells and cells expressing constitutive and inducible glyoxylate shunt.
We believe the introduction of an inducible glyoxylate shunt will serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cell that increases energy expenditure responding to high circulating fatty acid levels. This will help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers.

Kinetic Testing of Prussian Blue Ferritin
The next step in moving forward with using Prussian blue ferritin as a potential reporter was to determine the kinetic characteristics of the catalyst.  This analysis is necessary to understand how our reporter will react over time in relation to different substrate concentrations. Previous data (Zhang et al., 2013) had shown, that the catalytic activity can be fit to Michealis-Menten kinetic models, which gives us an opportunity to evaluate the Prussian blue ferritin as a reporter. Our analysis composed of varying both the chromogenic substrate (TMB or ABTS) concentration and the hydrogen peroxide concentration.
Our kinetic analysis also included a comparison of Prussian blue horse spleen ferritin to regular horse spleen ferritin for both TMB and ABTS (Figures 5 and 6). For both of the substrates we can see that normal ferritin has a very low catalytic activity. This is excellent news as it means that our Prussian blue modification is an effective method to create a strong catalyst. It also means that the presence of unmodified ferritin is not active enough to pose a significant risk for producing spurious results in our system.

North Carolina Mini Convention
In August we sent Emma and Adam to represent Duke iGEM at a mini convention held by Gaston Day High School. While at the convention we got to hear from several scientists about how they see synthetic biology developing in the upcoming years and how we can become better involved in the field. This list and more information about each of the speakers can be found below. After some additional team bonding and exchanging of ideas, we decided to collaborate with Gaston Day High School and East Chapel Hill High School on creating a subreddit for iGEM discussion of philosophy and ethics as well as creating a new curriculum for the Building with Bio Mosquito Forum.
The following speakers were in attendance:
Danielle Tullman-Ercek
Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University
Professor Tullman-Ercek discussed the way synthetic biology becomes part of a living system and redefines life. Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.
Connor McFadden
UNC - Chapel Hill
McFadden discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles
Duke Class 2018; Duke iGEM Team
Miles discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
So what did Adam and Emma think?!
""It was great meeting and collaborating with high school teams that were already so serious about iGEM. By the time these guys get to college they are going to be so advanced in synthetic biology!""
""I really enjoyed bonding with the high"

Bidirectional Promoters
Scientists are frequently confounded by wayward promoters; that is, promoters which do not produce   the expected proteins. Some bidirectional promoters are known to exist, but which way they promote   and the degree of expression has not been quantified. This project will test the directionality of   several BioBrick promoters to answer these questions.
Bidirectional Promoters
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
Background
Before we can make a protein, we need an mRNA to carry the information about the order of the amino acids.  But before we can make mRNA we need to know where the genes are in the DNA of a cell. Before RNA polymerase can  make a copy it needs to bind to the DNA. This is assisted by a variety of factors, other proteins, that look for  a specific sequence in the DNA. This sequence is called a promoter because it promotes the transcription of the  DNA into RNA by the RNA polymerase. These sequences are generally upstream, or ahead, of a gene's coding sequence.
The Problem
Not all promoters cause RNA polymerase to transcribe downstream in the expected ""forward direction"". Some promoters can cause RNA polymerase to go in the opposite direction from what is expected, or go in both directions. This is what we are trying to find out; do different promoters go in different directions, and what is the directional preference of different promoters.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Characterisation_-_-_TEXT.html," (2). We selected this mutant especially since it does not have any phenotype under a wide range of conditions as described in the Micado database. Since pMutin4 has the lacI gene, we were able to get LacI expressed in the cells. We successfully transformed the mutant with pGFP-rrnb carrying out kinA based sporulation rate tuning brick . amyE homologous regions in the integration vector mediated a double crossover into amyE in the chromosome. As a result of this crossover, cells lose the amyE gene and cannot break down starch. When transformed colonies are plated into starch plates, the transformed colonies that have successfully inetgrated the plasmid can be seen without any halos around them when we expose the plates to iodine.
We then selected two transformed colonies from the starch plate and used them to induce sporulation by adding IPTG.
To select the transformed colonies we prepared our plates with LB + Erythromycin + Chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol was used to select pGFP-rrnb based transformations and Erythromycin  was used to select the colonies with pMutin4 intgrated. Hence, by adding these two antibiotics we made sure that we were using BFS867 mutants transformed with pgfp-rrnb integration vector containing our biobrick as an insert.
Concentrations used to characterize our device:
IPTG : 1mM Erythromycin :0.3ug/ml Chloramphenicol: 5ug/ml
Experiment Overview
Each 10ml of overnight cultures was split into two flasks with 60ml of LB+Em+CHL. Every half an hour we measured the optical density of the cells to plot the growth curve of the cells. We also stored samples on ice at each time point. We added 1mM IPTG after one hour to one set of the cultures but not the other. We also used wild type B. subtilis and wild type cells transformed with pGFP-rrnb (vector only) as the negative and positive controls respectively.
After time point 5, before the cells reached stationary phase, we used the samples from time point 1 and time point 5 and prepared them for microscopy by resuspending the cells in SMM medium and absorbing them on to agarose slabs on microscope slides.
Growth Curves
The growth curves below show that growth of the strain with BBa_K174011 integrated grows more slowly that the wild type, presumably because of increased sporulation rates. The addition of IPTG slows the"

Chromoproteins
As an example output plugin we transformed into Marchantia polymorpha a selection of the chromoproteins brought to iGEM by Uppsala 2011. This was to test whether a simple change in colour would work as an easily visible reporter.
Five chromoproteins were selected for expression: eforred (BBa_K592012), tspurple (BBa_K1033906),  aspink (BBa_K1033927), aeblue (BBa_K1033929) and amilCP(BBa_K1033930, a deep blue colour). The N7 nuclear localisation tag (BBa_K1484104) was added to tspurple, aspink and amilCP. Each was put into a binary vector called pGreen and transformed first into agrobacterium, then transferred to marchantia.
The transformation procedure yielded a large number of transformants, approximately 100 per construct, which were confirmed via PCR using homogenised plants as a template and chromoprotein-specific primers for each tDNA added.
Left: A PCR of the transformed plants showing successful transformation. Right: A plate of transformants growing happily on hygromycin
For each chromoprotein construct, the transformation yielded approximately 100 transformed sporelings (7-days old plants). The petri dish to the right contains hygromycin as a selective marker. The gel confirms the transformation in three plants each from two other plates.  The forward and reverse primers used in the PCR anneal to 35S and N7 respectively, and the template was homogenised plant material.
After approximately four weeks of growth, sparsely distributed bright red cells became apparent under the microscope in the plants transformed with the tsPurple gene. Although similar cells were not found in wild type plants, diffuse red regions were found and are probably due to release of anth"

Metabolic pathway engineering was used to modify Lactobacillus johnsonii for increased fructose metabolism. Those modifications aim to increase fructose uptake, while reducing glucose consumption, because both carbohydrates display the main energy sources of L. johnsonii ATCC33200. To search for targets in both metabolic pathways the Patric database was used. L. johnsonii’s genome was documented and analyzed in course of the Human Microbiome Project in 2009. Glucose and fructose metabolism in wild type L. johnsonii (FIGURE 1) differs from our engineered bacterium in following points:
Schematic illustration of sugar metabolism in L. johnsonii.
To downregulate the glucose metabolism, a gene knockout via CRISPR/Cas9 system was planned. Carbohydrates are taken up into the cell via transporters of the ABC-superfamily, getting phosphorylated in this process, but for glucose no specific transporter was annotated. Therefore, the two main enzymes for glucose-6-phosphate metabolism were targeted:  Glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase is part of glycolysis, converting glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and reverse, as well as glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase which converts glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone, being the starting point for the pentose phosphate pathway. These two knockouts should result in an accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate which in turn causes decreased glucose uptake by product inhibition of glucose ingesting transporters. On the other hand, fructose metabolism should be enhanced by upregulation of endogenous enzymes: Fructose enters the cell as monosaccharide or, in conjunction with glucose, as sucrose. Both carbohydrates are taken up by substrate specific PTS transporters and get phosphorylated in this process. Therefore, both transporters were identified as possible targets for pathway enhancement.
Besides, the phosphofructokinase was chosen for elevated fructose turnover: This enzyme catal"

SensiGEM is the iGEM Biosensor database generated by the teams Paris Bettencourt 2013 and Calgary 2013. In this database you can find fast and easy what biosensor projects were already done by past iGEM Teams. Up to now, SensiGEM is a searchable database for all biosensors in iGEM, but we hope that many other project categories will follow soon.  To be able to select the projects that fit into the database, we composed a joint definition of what is a biosensor according to the Calgary-Paris collaboration, after reading and discussing.
Together with our collaborate the iGEM Team Calgary 2013 we identified all the different biosensors in the registry, added them
into our database and categorized them by years. To adapt the database to needs of the user, we integrated an interface that allows an easy search through the database after different criteria that can be selected. It is possible to search after teams, years, tracks, inputs/outputs, awards and much more. But also a keyword search is integrated.
With this work we hope to help future teams as well as others interested in biosensors to get an overview of what has been done in iGEM so far. It might also be a helo for future iGEM teams to select a new biosensor project. Have a look how to use SensiGEM!

PCR-touchUp
Example of the method of touch up PCR
Touch up PCR is a method of amplifying a PCR-product that have bad primers or are troublesome in other ways. This is an example:
98°C for 2:00 - Denaturing and warm up
98°C for 0:10 - Denaturing after each cycle
50°C for 0:30 - Annealing
Temperature increment of 1°C/cycle
72°C for 2:00 - Elongation
Go to number 2 - repeat 10 times
Go to number 2 - repeat 5 times
72°C for 5:00 - Final extension
End

Competent DH5α cells were prepared (see protocol ).
Purified plasmids were transformed into competent DH5α cells (see protocol ).
 
Culture measurements:
We used cell culture tubes (10 mL) containing 2 mL LB medium (with 0.5% NaCl) and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol for each strain. To each of the tubes, we inoculated cells from a single colony with a sterile inoculation loop and left it overnight at 37°C, shaking at 350 rpm.
The wells of the sterile BioLector plate (48 well FlowerPlate) was prepared with 1450 μL (1500μL for controls) of LB (0.5% NaCl) containing 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol. The following day we transferred 10 μL of each culture into an Eppendorf tube with 990 μL of sterile physiological salt water (creating a 100-fold dilution). We inoculated the individual BioLector wells with 10 μL of the dilution (creating an additional 150-fold dilution). Each strain was grown in triplicates to make sure we had 3 independent measurements and a more precise result. We incubated the plate in the BioLector at 37°C and 1000 rpm for 12.5 hours (stationary phase was reached). During the growth experiment we measured biomass and GFP fluorescence every 5 minutes. Biomass was measured by light scatter at 620 nm, while fluorescence was measured at 520 nm, with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm.
 
Single cell measurements:
2 mL LB (0.5% NaCl) was inoculated with cells from a plate and grown overnight.
The cultures were washed and resuspended in PBS.
The cell suspensions were diluted in PBS to a concentration where the flow cytometer could detect 1000-1500 events per second.
 
 
What sort of instrument did you use to acquire measurements?
What is the model and manufacturer?
Instrument: BioLector (Basic) - Microbioreactor System; Manufacturer: m2p-laps.
Instrument: FACSCalibur Cell Analyzer; Manufacturer: BD Biosciences
 
How is it configured for your measurements?
The BioLector is fitted with filters for measuring biomass (scatter at 620 nm) and GFP (emission at 520 nm, excitation with 488 nm). Settings: Gain: GFP: 80; Biomass: 30; Humidity: controlled at 95"
SYSU-CHINA,2018,Team:SYSU-CHINA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and the        other containing the activation domain of CD3zeta. When adding small molecule Rapalog, the heterodimerization of 2 chains        reconstitutes a full CAR receptor and therefore can generate full activation signals. Similarly, Juillerat et al. (Juillerat et al., 2016) modified the hinge domain to include a FKBP/FRB dimerization pair,        which separate the scFv from the cell membrane. When AP21967 (a rapamycin analog) is added, the interaction of FKBP and FRB fold the        extracellular domain into an optimal conformation for activation.
However, modification of receptors may be troublesome that it may alter the structure and conformation of the receptors, which in        turns may interfere with CARs' function. Such notion is exemplified in the research of Wu et al., that different split methods        resulted in different signaling outcomes, with most of the receptor pairs failing to fully activate in the presence of drugs (Wu et al., 2015) . Considering a lack of conclusive information on mechanisms of CAR T cell        activation(Harris and Kranz, 2016) and the diversity of existing CARs in clinical        research(June et al., 2018) , a method must be developed for each type of CAR to ensure it        works as expected, which can be labor-intensive.
Furthermore, such methods are limited to CAR Ts alone, which have synthetic receptors. In contrast, TCR Ts rely on the endogenous T        cell receptor complex to function properly, and TCRs, as part of the complex, requires native conformation to function, leaving        little, if any, space for modification.

Fankang Meng from NKU: I am interested in Gene Relationship network. However, the names of genes on this map can be put at more reasonable positions, so the network will be more beautiful. To further improve the software, I think they can refer to software in Wikipedia, which has similar functions. And the database of Gene Relationship should be expanded.
        recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that are retrieved.
        For example for text search on a set of documents recall is the number of correct results divided by the number of results that should have been returned In binary classification, recall is called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query. It is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision. we trained a markov model to recommand DNA ceil on our platform and these recall rate values show the sensitivity of the markov model when it return different length of the DNA chain."
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"'m going to do with this degree, but I have lofty aspirations to go into dentistry in the long term. More likely, I will end up pursuing higher education in biochemistry. iGEM is my first genuine (non-class based) lab experience and has imbued me with the wondrous powers of science. I am very excited to gain some useful and practical knowledge of lab work. In what little spare time I enjoy, I like to draw pictures of things, write about other things, and lie around loudly lamenting how busy I usually am.
Stephanie Willatt
I am going into my third year of biological sciences specializing in Botany. This is my first summer working in a research lab and I am excited about this new experience.  I will mainly be working in the wet lab component. During the summer I hope to gain new knowledge about synthetic biology as well as learn new lab techniques.  Outside of school, I am interested in music, playing the bassoon, cycling and snowboarding.
Tsarina VanWieren
I am entering into my fourth year of Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary. Being involved in iGEM has been a very interesting and exciting experience for me and I have learned a great deal from it. Over the summer I have taken part in the wet lab portion of the research, in finding a means to decarboxylate napthenic acids via microbial modification. I am an active individual who enjoys getting involved in the community, and I am also fond of reading novels, swimming, hiking, travelling, and listening to music. Synthetic biology has always intrigued me, making iGEM a fascinating learning experience, and I have especially enjoyed the strong team aspect of the project.
Chris Wintersinger
I am a Biomedical Sciences major in the University of Calgary's Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I enjoy candlelit dinners, long walks on the beach, and balancing magnesium salt concentrations for creating PCR master mixes. When I'm not in the lab using glucose to repress transcription of S7 micrococcal nuclease, you will find me lusting after beat-up pickup trucks listed on the Internet, or using my Brownie Hawkeye box camera to take pictures that look like I smeared the lens with Vaseline. After I graduate from iGEM, I hope to pursue a career as a chimney sweep, door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, or failing those, perhaps a biomedical engineer.

Marie CAMMAN
She has a scientific high-school diploma. She spent two years in Joffre high-school in prepa classes ""Grandes Ecoles"": the first year was in MPSI prepa and the second year was in PSI prepa. She is now in the second year of engineering school at ESPCI. The equivalent of a bachelor degree in maths, physics and chemistry. Marie is the perfect example of what a young modern woman should be. This intelligent and hard-working girl is always there in the lab, welcoming you with a warm smile and kindness. Her classy style and elegance make her the Grace Kelly of women in science. She is also our master of labock, always ready to write in the notebook conscientiously and methodically.
Lisa DEHOVE
After obtaining a scientific high school diploma, she had two years of preparatory class in applied arts. she is currently finishing a 4 years course at Ensci – Les Ateliers, an industrial design school. Lisa is a colourful person... quite literally. Indeed, she always wears very rainbow colored clothes, which sure brighten everyone's day. Her flat is covered with only two things: her drawings, and her plants (step on them and you are in big trouble!). Lisa is always up for good laughs, but she can also be a very calm and serious girl, which I believe makes her the perfect iGEM team member. Finally, her patience will always surprise us, especially when she has to help biologist, chemists and lawer students, with doing ridiculously basic things on the Adobe suite (she must be a Jedi or something!).
Audrey DELOT
After getting her school-leaving certificate, she did a Bachelor of Biology and Chemistry in Tours. During this time, she discovered her passion for chemistry and last year she joined the ESPCI in Paris. Audrey is a generous girl, enterprising and involved in the project design. Interesting element for the group, Audrey has conducted surveys in New Caledonia regarding the public about synthetic biology, and was ubiquitous at the beginning of the project. Shy and reserved, Audrey is tiny but has many scientific qualities!

WITS-CSIR_SA,2011,Team:WITS-CSIR SA#Project#Concept_-_-_TEXT.html," a theophylline-sensitive riboswitch which is capable of regulating CheZ (motility factor) translation.
Using a high-throughput screen (Lynch et al., 2007) and a high-throughput selection (Topp and Gallivan, 2008) in E.coli, the Gallivan lab (Emory, USA) has been able to develop powerful theophylline-dependent riboswitches. It is worth noting that the motility-based screen (Topp and Gallivan, 2008) made use of a theophylline riboswitch library activating the expression of CheZ. Activation of the motility factor CheZ allows bacteria to move along the theophylline gradient. The best riboswitch identified in these earlier screens was the theophylline riboswitch clone 8.1, which displays 36-fold expression activation ratio (Figure 6).
Figure 6. Theophylline responsive riboswitch (clone 8.1). We have referred to this riboswitch as theophylline riboswitch 1. (Click to enlarge)
In order to improve on their earlier riboswitches, Topp and Gallivan later developed an in vivo-based bacterial selection strategy based on fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) (Wieland et al., 2008; Lynch et al., 2009). By randomizing the sequence encoding the RBS (+ Shine Delgarno/SD), and by sorting a N12 library, clone 12.1 – which displays a 96-fold expression activation in the presence of theophylline (1 mM) – was identified (Figure 7). This is the largest activation ratio to date, for synthetic or natural riboswitches. This riboswitch contains a strong (and longer) UAAGG SD which is found in a tight (inaccessible) duplex in the “OFF” (i.e. no theophylline) state. Moreover, the UAAGG sequence is spaced optimally, with 6 nt separating the 5’ A of the anti-SD sequence and the start codon of the translation (AUG) (Figure 7).
Figure 7.Theophylline responsive riboswitch (clone 12.1). We have referred to this riboswitch as theophylline riboswitch 2. (Click to enlarge)
The atrazine riboswitch was developed recently by Sinha et al (2010). In order to make this riboswitch compatible with biobrick assembly, Pst1 site was removed"

Osaka,2009,Team:Osaka#SIGNAL_-_-_TEXT.html," of (Lux-signaling system AHL), which then activates/upregulates transcription downstream of this device
Las Receiver - receives signal from Las Sender
Rhl Receiver - receives signal from Rhl Sender
Cin Receiver - receives signal from Cin Sender
Test Constructs:
Lux Receiver with GFP attached downstream ("" X1 "") - a GFP coding device has been attached downstream of the Lux Receiver described above
Las Receiver with GFP attached downstream (""X2"")
Rhl Receiver with GFP attached downstream ("" X3 "")
Cin Receiver with GFP attached downstream (""X4"")
Of these parts, the receivers are thought to be the most generally useful as any protein coding region can theoretically be attached downstream of them to be triggered upon induction with the appropriate signal sender (or alternatively by addition of the corresponding AHL). Therefore, we tested those parts extensively, using both PCR sequencing to confirm their nucleotide sequences and fluorimetry measurements to check that the test constructs were functioning as planned.
Unfortunately, we did not have time to properly integrate our sensor modules with the color or motility modules to build the final devices that we initially devised. In future years hopefully we will be able to augment our sensors with further improvements as described under the 'Future Work' section below.
Tests
To test the effectiveness of our signaling system, we attached a GFP coding unit (rbs + protein coding region + terminator) behind each Receiver's AHL-activated promoter. (See ‘Test Constructs’ under Parts & Devices above), which theoretically enables us to measure the amount of transcription upregulation that occurs in the presence of AHL.
We then tested our parts in two ways. First we tested the Receivers indirectly by adding chemically-derived AHL into culture solutions of the Test Constructs and looking for GFP fluorescence, which will indicate that transcription has been activated. Following that, we tested the Senders by using the above Receivers. We hoped to determine the amount of AHL produced by the Senders by comparing transcription activity induced by the Senders in relation to AHL-induced transcription activity. However this year we only managed to qualitatively determine that our Senders were functioning.
Details of the tests are given below. For detailed descriptions of the protocols followed during these tests, please refer to the “Protocols” section on this page.
Sensor Experiment 1: Receivers vs AHL
Procedure:
1. Pre-culture cells transformed with parts to be tested in solution medium overnight.
2. Inoculate fresh medium with pre-cultured cells and culture till full growth.
3. Replace culture medium by ultracentrifuging and resuspending cells in fresh medium.
4. Add AHL to culture.

Nasal Mucus
Introduction
On the detection of nasal mucus our main protein of focus was the human odorant binding protein 2A (OBP2A). It is a 155 amino acid (excluding the signal peptide) lipocalin of relatively low molecular weight (19318 Daltons). Structurally it is an 8 sheet beta barrel flanked by a c-terminal alpha helix that that together forms an internal hydrophobic pore known as a calix. It is secreted by the olfactory epithelial cells of the nose where it lies in high abundance within nasal mucus. Its primary function in the human body is believed to be in the transport of hydrophobic odorant proteins across the otherwise impenetrable aqueous mucus layer to the olfactory receptors of the nose. Due to its high specificity and abundance within nasal mucus, OBP2A was selected as the protein for use in nasal mucus detection.
Figure 1 - Illustrations of the proposed crystal structure of OBP2A at 2.60 Angstroms. Image: Left shows the 8 strand antiparallel beta barrel in blue. Alpha helix are show in green. Interacting cysteine residues are colored red. Image: Right shows the two different areas of OBP2A that were separated to better understand their interaction, the larger beta barrel is shown in blue and the small c-terminal tail show in red.
In all other aspects of our FluID detector we have targeted a naturally occurring ligand interaction as the basis for subsequent nanobead attachment.  In the case of nasal mucus however we were unable to utilize such a pathway as our research suggested that there were no known interactions of high enough specificity for use in the strict detection of nasal mucus. What was our solution?  We aimed to separate the alpha helix c-terminal tail of OBP2A and use that as the substrate for fluorescent nanobead attachment. How would that detect the presence of nasal mucus? Through the use of PCR mutagenesis we aimed to improve the binding affinity that the separated c-terminal alpha helix would have for the rest of the OBP2A protein.  This in turn we hoped would displace the natively conformed c-terminal tail of OBP2A in exchange for our tighter binding synthetic tail. This synthetic tail could then be"

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#2 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," on closer inspection there are little clouds of flourescing material just below the second row of dark bands (caused by the colour bands)in the middle of the lanes. These could well be PCR products; another attempt at gel electrophoresis would clarify this. It is possible that the DNA gel electrophoresis has been left to run too long and additionally the voltage has been set too high. Of course, the white cloudy substance at the bottom of these wells are the primer-dimer complexes.
Second attempt at DNA gel electrophoresis
The result of the gel electrophoresis called for another attempt at running the PCR products on the 1.5% agarose gel. The samples were prepared in the following way:
5ul of the 4 PCR samples (C0, V1, V2, V3) were extracted and to each 1ul loading buffer was added
1ul of neat V1 (the control) was diluted in 8ul water - 1ul of loading buffer was added also
2 x 15ul of HindIII ladder
The voltage was cut down to 60mv and the gel was only allowed to run for 15-20 minutes - this was to ensure that the DNA was not run too fast through the gel. The result of this procedure can be seen below:
The samples displayed are as follows:
Lane 1 = blank
Lane 2 = 15ul of HindIII DNA ladder
Lane 3 = 6ul of C0
Lane 4 = 6ul of V1
Lane 5 = 6ul of V2
Lane 6 = 6ul of V3
Lane 7 = 6ul of neat V1
Lane 8 = 15ul of HindIII DNA ladder
This is certainly a better gel attempt than the previous one as 'bands' can be seen. However it is not clear whether the approx 100bp is excess template or the real product.
Conclusion: Repeat the PCR dropping the annealing temperature down to 45C and proceed with trying to clean up the products from lanes 3-6

Membrane Anchors: CPX and INPNC ( BBa K811005 )
In order to click molecules over the entire cell surface, a protein to anchor the desired coating to the cell is needed. This protein has to be modified in such a way that it contains an azide which is displayed on the outside of the cell, where it can react with a DBCO-conjugate. Check also our SPAAC Reaction Page for detailed information.
Membrane Anchor Protein CPX
CPX is a membrane protein designed for bacterial display. This membrane protein originates from OmpX. OmpX (Outer Membrane Protein x) is a small, monomeric β-barrel protein that is highly expressed and very useful for protein display applications in E. coli. CPX, or Circularly permutated OmpX, was developed as a bacterial display methodology for N- and C-terminal display. It is demonstrated to enable rapid screening"

Yeast A--xylose fermenting strain
Circuit construction
We used pYC230 provided by our PI, as the backbone and constructed xylosidase gene XYL1 and XYL2 by Gibson Assembly. Gene XYL1 encoding xylose reductase (XR) which reduces D-xylose into xylitol, and facilitates xylose assimilation in yeast. Gene XYL2 encoding xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH). Xylitol is oxidized to xylulose under the action of xylitol dehydrogenase, which relies on Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).
Selective Medium Assay
We transformed the pYC230nto S.  cerevisiae EBY100 and got the xylose-utilizing strain successfully. We measured the growth rate of both our engineered strain and the negative control. If there is an obvious superiority of our new strain in xylose utilization, we can prove that the circuit works as our design. As a result, the curve well demonstrates that the strain with xylose-utilizing circuit has a higher OD600 than the negative control strain during the entire cultivation period. The culture of engineered yeast (EBY100 with XDH-XR) reaches stationary phases after 40 hours cultivation with an OD600 of around 2.35. While the control strain(EBY100) has an almost horizontal OD curve.
Fig 1.4
Proof of function
We use HPLC to detect the concentration changing of xylose, getting extra data to support our idea directly that our engineered yeast can utilize the xylose as carbon sources and the concentration of xylose decrease with time in our culture system.
The following chart shows the dynamic curve of xylose content of both the recombinant strain and negative control.
Fig 1.5
It is obvious that for our xylose-utilize strain, xylose content decreases as time goes, by while for the negative strain, the xylose content stays steady, indicating the disability of using xylose.
For the final goal of our project, we ultimately detected the production of ethanol. Here, we choose to use the SBA-Biosensor. Because it can detect the reaction of substrate catalyzed by the immobilized enzyme as an electrochemical signal, which supports us to describe a curve reflecting the ethanol change in the culture condition, and is able to give the output instantly and conveniently.

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," built a framework software tool to allow fellow researchers the ability to redesign a binding site easily.
FlashLab - microfluidic chip
We successfully demonstrated a working concept of the FlashLab project - a chip (commercial ibidi chip) that serves as a detection tool based on the chemotaxis system of E. coli bacteria.
This chip is filled with a suspension of bacteria expressing a chromoprotein, enabling easy visualization of the bacteria, and a chemoreceptor engineered to respond to a specific ligand of your choice. Once a sample containing the ligand is inserted into the chip, the bacteria will respond accordingly leading a chemotactic movement towards or away from the sample. This movement causes the bacteria to form a visible cluster within the chip, due to the chromoprotein, which is seen as a darker shade of color.
This concept has been successfully proven for both PctA-Tar chimera and Histamine-Tar variant of the Rosetta software.
In video 2, the displacement of the bacteria can be clearly seen in the test chip (left chip, PctA-Tar with repellent), compared to the control chip (right chip, PctA-Tar with buffer).
Video 2: from left to right:           (1) PctA-Tar chimera with Tetrachloroethylene repellent added.          (2) PctA-Tar chimera with Motility buffer added (control).
In conclusion, we proved the concept of the FlashLab project, by demonstrating the color gradient being formed due to chemotaxis.
PctA-Tar chimera
We have successfully confirmed the functionality of the hybrid           PctA-Tar receptor using a swarming assay. From the results seen           below, figure 5, and compared to the negative control. it is clear that the chimera functions and controls the chemotactic ability of the bacteria and mediates to a swarming response. This is compared to the control where no swarming can be seen.

The d-AuNPs aggregated when salt was added from a final concentration of 1M*⅓=333 mM to 2M*⅓=666 mM NaCl. When ssDNAp (1 uM) were added, the concentrations at which the d-AuNPs aggregated increased. However, at 2 M NaCl, the d-AuNPs still aggregated although the aggregation was less intense compared to the salt aggregation without ssDNAp’s.
From the data, the spectrum of the mixtures with 0 mM, 1000 mM and 2000 mM NaCl were plotted from both samples: with and without ssDNAp. Additionally, the from all the samples either with or without ssDNAp addition, the ratio 620/520 was calculated and plotted over the salt concentration.

In order to generate dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles, first a gold chloride (HAuCl4.H2O) stock solution of 50 mL was prepared by dissolving 393.8 mg of HAuCl4.H2O in 50 mL of distilled sterile water. After preparation, this solution was stored at 4 °C covered in aluminium foil.
Secondly, a 10% sterile sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution was prepared by dissolving 4.985 g Na2CO3 in 50 mL MilliQ water, after which the solution was filter sterilized.
Then, 200 mL distilled sterile water was be adjusted to pH 9 by carefully adding 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) drops of 20 uL at a time, while keeping the solution sterile under a flame.
Subsequently, 25 mL of dextrin solution was prepared by dissolving 625 mg of dextrin powder in 25 mL of sterile MilliQ water to obtain a concentration of 25 g/L. This solution was then added to a sterile 250 mL flask.
Then, 5 mL of the gold chloride stock solution was added to the 250 mL flask and the pH was adjusted to 9 with the sterile 10% sodium carbonate solution, while working sterile.
Lastly, the reaction volume was completed to 50 mL by adding 20 mL distilled water (pH = 9).

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Human Practice#igemathome_-_-_TEXT.html," Three users supported the claim that the points earned for computations for the iGEM@home project are low in comparison to other projects. The users proposed a dynamic point and award system (badges) for long-term motivation of BOINC crunchers.
""You should ensure that the server does not run out of tasks very often."" Many users directly contacted us and asked for more tasks to calculate and commented that BOINC projects should not run out of tasks easily. We hope that due to the introduction of iGEM@home to the community, the servers will not run out of tasks easily during the summer.
Communication with the team and the overall organisation of the project was praised by many users:
""Great Project. Of course needs some time to get running, but definitely something worth supporting!""
""Very well done for a first BOINC project.""
""I wish every project were this organized & committed.""
""Feedback from the project administrators is excellent! Keep up the great work!!!!!""
Comments about iGEM and distributed computing:
""We need more distributed computing projects in biology and medical fields."":
""I did not know about synthetic biology until I participated on iGEM@home. Synthetic biology has great potential to benefit humanity that most people do not realize. Many people are still not aware of this new project. Time to spread the word out!""
Conclusions
We consider iGEM@home a great success. The elaborate evalution of the project showed that the product iGEM@home fulfiils all the requirements for a vivid distributed computing AND science communication plattform at the same time. Not just were we able to do calculations impossible without a huge server cluster, we also reached a lot of people who didn’t know about Synthetic Biology and iGEM before. At the moment the majority of iGEM@home users are experienced BOINC supporters and crunchers that also support additional projects. But we did not only show that we were able to recruit about 100 new BOINC supporters in a short time but that the content distributed via the screen saver slide show is accessed by many users and especially by the ones recruited directly for iGEM@home (80%).
We hereby have shown that it is feasible for an iGEM team to run an distributed computing project and it offers a great new approach to reach out to the society.
Future
Of course we think that iGEM@home is a great tool and needs to be continued after the end of this year’s iGEM competition. As it has an active and interested community and offers teams to do impressive computations, we hope to hand iGEM@home over to the"

A high sensitivity means that small changes in the parameter will cause large deviations in the resulting simulations. In figure 9 and 10 the magnitude of the curves for the sensitivity of the parameters inversely correlates with the size of the confidence intervals of the respective parameters. This perfectly matches our expectations.

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," is most familiar with? The expression of protein! Then we set about to translate the binary numbers into their “language”.     In our design, green stands for 0, and red stands for 1. When we use LEDs to light up the bacteria with green light, it means that 0 is input (similar for red light). And the bacteria will use the expression of red or green fluorescent protein to “tell” us the cipher text.     But how to realize this using gene circuit? We build a light control system in E.coli. After being irradiated by corresponding light, protein kinase which is combined with chromophore will phosphorylate the regulatory protein, then downstream promoter will be activated. In that way we realize the input. And there are two ways to realize the change of plain text, which are the expression of fluorescent protein in the same or the other color (green or red). Then another input to decide which way to take is needed. We use arabinose and IPTG to switch between the two ways, combining with the light control system, the AND gate gene circuits are constructed.     We have designed four types of AND gate circuits:                 (1)Red light controlled promoter + lactose promoter +GFP (output)                 (2)Red light controlled promoter + arabinose promoter + RFP (output)                 (3)Green light controlled promoter + lactose promoter + RFP (output)                 (4)Green light controlled promoter + arabinose promoter + GFP (output)
     The process of using this system is consist of three steps: input, encryption and output.
     The illustration below shows the whole process of the using of the first mode of biological Enigma.
Greater ambition
    Although using this method we could realize the encryption easily, its reliability is not high enough. By calculating the inversion frequency, crackers could speculate the encryption rule, and thus decrypt the cipher easily. A greater ambition is therefore inspired.     We are inspired by the design of one of the most famous cipher machine, Enigma. Enigma was invented by a German engineer, and used by the German Army during the World War Ⅱ.     The most amazing part for Enigma is that the codebook changes every time a new letter is inputted. If we are able to change the “codebook” within the bacteria according to time, which is shown in the following figure, then the difficulty of decrypting increase and the cipher machine’s safeness will increased"
Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Degradation Switch_-_-_TEXT.html," [6] consists of ribosome binding sites that have been characterized by their relative strengths in E. coli. We evaluated our model using RBS strengths 0.6, 0.3 and 0.07.
trlimm - Rate of Imm2 Translation - Translation proceeds at an average speed of 20 amino acids per second [2]. Imm2 is 83 amino acids in length [3] giving translation rate of 20/86.
degimm - Rate of Imm2 Degradation - in replicating E. coli effective halflife is the time taken for a generation approximately 20 minutes. In Maxicells halflife was determined using ProtParam Tool [7]. ProtParam uses the N-end rule to determine protein halflife, the estimates given for Imm2 are >10hrs in E. coli and 30hrs in reticulocytes hence an average 20hr halflife is used. degimm = ln(2)/halflife [4]
trlcol - Rate of Colicin E2 Translation - Translation proceeds at an average speed of 20 amino acids per second [2]. Colicin E2 is 581 amino acids in length [5] giving translation rate of 20/581.
degcol - Rate of Colicin E2 Degradation - in replicating E. coli effective halflife is the time taken for a generation approximately 20 minutes. In Maxicells halflife was determined using ProtParam Tool [7]. ProtParam uses the N-end rule to determine protein halflife, the estimates given for Colicin E2 are >10hrs in E. coli and 30hrs in reticulocytes hence an average 20hr halflife is used. degcol = ln(2)/halflife [4]
Results
Figure 2 demonstrates the results obtained from an initial non-screening run to investigate the plausibility of the killswitch design. Results indicate that free Colicin E2 will be present after 19.6 hours which is promising given the range of promoters and ribosome binding sites over which to screen. Quantities given of Imm2 mRNA, Colicin E2 mRNA, Imm2 and Colicin E2 are presented in relative units.
Figure 2 - Initial model results - free Colicin E2 is present after 19.6 hours with pimm ,pcol ,rbsimm and rbscol equal to 1.
The results from this initial run are characteristic of those obtained when screening over Anderson Promoters and Ribosome Binding Sites. With"
