Date: 7 February 2013
Today we had our first meeting. A number of ideas were discussed and 6 of the ideas were selected for further research.
 
First team meeting
Brainstorming session on possible project ideas:
Carbon monoxide detection
Pesticides Alternative
Organic waste degradation
Detection of allergies
Smoke Detector
Treating stomach bugs
The ideas were researched and discussed by the team over the week and a number were eliminated as they were not feasible.
 
 
Date: 13 February 2013
 
Teammate Zeljka Kalinic posts an idea about tackling bed bugs. We all like the idea and it has been added to the list of projects to research.
 
Date: 20 March 2013
 
Brainstorming continues and reviewing the previous possible project ideas. The team met again to review our progress.
 
 
Date: 27 March 2013
 
4th Workshop.
Team decides to focus on bedbug idea.
Sub-groups have been created for the research and team-member roles have been allocated.
 
Sub-groups
*Scale of the problem + Economic costs
*Bedbug life cycle
*Extermination methods
*Symbiotic relationships
*Chemicals secreted by the Bedbugs
 
Date: 29 March 2013
 
A PhD student, Andy Jenks, who has been helping us, identified Wolbachia as an symbiotic bacterium of bedbugs. The bedbugs need it for the synthesis of B vitamins. We are very excited by this discovery and see Wolbachia is a potential target.
http://www.pnas.org/content/107/2/769.long
 
The team has also been doing research on how we would culture the Wolbachia. It seems that they can be cultured in vitro, but it may be a bit tricky. The other option is to grow them in insect cells.
 
Date: 3 April 2013
 
 
 
This week we have been brainstorming fundraising ideas.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," can transform electric energy into ultrasonic radiant energy. There were four kinds of ultrasonic transducer tried. Pressure fields of 108kHz and 1.1MHz transducers were simulated for different power and distance. The pressure field distribution changes smoothly, while the pressure distribution was quite chaos in condition of 1.1MHz. Only strong cell response was observed in condition of 108kHz stimulation as shown in Fig9. No obvious cell response was observed for 1.1MHz stimulation.

Long-term Stimulation
NFAT part can start gene expression when triggered by Ca2+ influx. The NFAT+Piezo1 cell expresses GFP when its MS channels open inducing a Ca2+ influx. Long-term stimulation (21h, 108KHz, 4.1W ultrasonic stimulation) experiment on Piezo1+NFAT cells showed GFP express level increased after 21h stimulation. 108KHz ultrasonic device was programmed to stimulate cells for duty cycle of 5s on and 10s off.

Background
amilCP is a blue chromoprotein from the coral Acropora millepora.
Aims
To improve the part by producing darker blue and/or other coloured mutants, to be used as a reporter gene in our biosensor.
Results
Produced 3 colour mutants:
• Pink
• Purple
• Mint Green
BioBricks
• BBa_K1996003 - pink colour mutant of amilCP
• BBa_K1996004 - purple colour mutant of amilCP
• BBa_K1996005 - mint green colour mutant of amilCP
Introduction
amilCP is a chromoprotein, derived from the coral Acropora millepora, that has a strong blue colour that is visible to the naked eye, with an absorbance maximum at 588nm.  The original part was developed by Team Uppsala Sweden 2011 ( BBa_K592009 ).
Motivations and use in biosensor
amilCP was chosen as the reporter gene for our biosensor as it is easily visible to the naked eye. This allows it to be easily observed by consumers in a fruit sticker version of our biosensor, or to be detected by scanners in a plate or handheld versions, without the need for extra equipment. In contrast, fluorescent proteins such as GFP would need an additional component to shine UV light before the output can be observed.
There were several reasons for our choice to improve amilCP:
• To allow for more sensitivity in the detection of the output – by creating a darker blue mutant
• To decrease response time – by creating a mutant that would turn blue faster
• To add to the spectrum of chromoproteins – by creating different coloured mutants
Error Prone PCR
To create our mutant amilCP, we used error prone PCR (EP-PCR). EP-PCR involves the addition of Mn2+, which increases the error rate of Taq DNA polymerase. This creates random mutations within the"
Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Essays_-_-_TEXT.html," hope is that the jobs will be transferred to a different sector of work based around the new device. Although by making the technology open source and free from patents, profit will be hard to reach and no boost in the economy will occur in this way. Therefore some form of business strategy would need to be developed to ensure money is made. It could be seen that in keeping the prices low, by lack of patents and open source genes, will aid developing countries, solve worldwide problems and still have the ability to make money as it would be available to a wider audience [3] </sup>.
Synthetic Biology is a new and exciting technology with many useful applications that would be beneficial for society if it were to be embraced. There are ethical and economical  issues that come with this new field of research, which are not to be ignored but these can be overcome and the potential benefits outweigh the harms and disadvantages of the research.

What can Synthetic Biology do for neuroscience?
By Sabrina Knight
For most neurological and psychiatric disorders there are limited options for treatment with few or no cures [4] . Considering that 1 in 6 people suffer from a neurological disorder [4] , this may be the time to find alternative ways of researching and treating these disorders. Could the up and coming field of synthetic biology provide therapeutic contribution to the treatment of these diseases? Could it become a valuable tool for neuroscience research?
Synthetic biology, the ability to construct new biological parts or systems, has the potential to revolutionise neuroscience. The basis of synthetic biology is incorporating DNA into cells, such as neurons, for useful purposes.  One of the aims of"

UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," would give a discussion board to the SBiDer network where biologist can discuss topics regarding optimal genetic circuits, the potential to experimentally create new circuits from the existing network or a range of many other topics. As said before, genetic device building is not an easy task and provenance history provides useful backtracking to understand the development of genetic circuit networks and due to the ability of network sharing it becomes possible for the SBiDer network to exist in different versions with the purpose of displaying genetic circuit networks with specific functionalities. NDEx API functionality then provides the means to create tools with which SBiDer networks can be better analyzed.
Traversal
SBiDer’s three main pillars - database, search algorithm, and web application - intertwine effectively and make SBiDer a robust tool for the synthetic biology community. Furthermore, the database, search algorithm, and web application are modularly developed so that each component can be easily updated, extended, and optimized by the global synthetic biology community. In the development, there was a focus on minimizing the barrier of collaboration by using an open source platform and generating a comprehensive usage and implementation documents. SBiDer was developed on the consideration to encourage the synthetic biology community to collaborate and drive the field forward. In the course of the development, various tools that could further develop SBiDer were discovered. In future iterations of SBiDer, the following functionalities should be considered for extending SBiDer:
Web Ontology Language (OWL)
What OWL is
The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation languages or ontology languages for authoring ontologies or knowledge bases (W3C). The data described by an ontology in the OWL family is interpreted as a set of ""individuals"" and a set of ""property assertions"" which relate these individuals to each other. An ontology consists of a set of axioms which place constraints on sets of individuals (called ""classes"") and the types of relationships permitted between them. These axioms provide semantics by allowing systems to infer additional information based on the data explicitly provided.
Integration of OWL into SBiDer
SBiDer can describe all of the components in the database using OWL by creating a unique ontological hierarchy that suits the field of synthetic biology. Using OWL relationships, SBiDer can better connect its components through more complex fashion that better captures the biological reality underlying synthetic biology. For example, an ontology describing components used by SBiDer, or individuals in the semantics of ontology, might include axioms stating that a ""activatePromotor"" property is only present between two individuals when ""isBiochecmicalSpecies"

Inoculation of Tamura Colony
Plates were streaked a few weeks ago with transformed E-coli cells containing an alternating sequence of wild type silk and GFP, specifically: N-terminus-GFP-C-terminus. An isolated colony was picked and inoculated in Lysogeny Broth (commonly referred to as Luria broth, an excellent growth medium for bacteria) overnight for 16 hours. Three colonies were picked, hence three start-up cultures were prepared. This allows us to selectively choose the one with the most optimal OD to continue with our plans to grow up an entire Liter of Tamura.
Procedure
Colony picked with micropipet and inserted into a culture tube containing 10 mL of LB and 10 ul of Ampicillin."

Stochastic Modelling Tools
Matlab can be used for stochastic modelling. The Glasgow team used Matlab to implement the Gillespie algorithm for incorporating noise among cells. They also used deterministic modelling using ODEs and compared their results. When the number of cells increase two approaches become similar since the noise is cancelled out.
Stocks 2 is another stochastic simulation tool which also uses Gillespie’s direct method and supports SBML.
We used computational modelling in Matlab to try to determine how to make our system tuneable.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," representatives. In 2024, after 100 years, Paris will be hosting once again the Olympic games and Paralympic games. The city hall has 3 priorities toward this event. First, to create a more just society for everyone, where nobody is left aside. Second, a better participation and social integration of handicapped people. Third, to increase the spectator’s and partner’s interest for the Paralympic games.
Contact with Cyril Cartron and Marion Liard
Cyril Cartron and Marion Liard are two members of the Paris City Hall. Cyril Cartron works for the DICOM (Direction of Information and Communication) and deals with all events organized by the City Hall, especially sporting events. Marion Liard is a project manager in the Town Communication department. Her actions are particularly devoted to handicap.
Since NeuronArch is a project directly linked to handicap, we decided to get involved with the Mairie de Paris to make Paris a more accessible town for disabled people by creating new markings and signs in direct connection with the Paralympic games. For this, we contacted the Paris City Hall to make this project in collaboration, especially in preparation for 2024 Paralympics in Paris.
First, we contacted Cyril Cartron by phone. He was determined to help us. He gave us the contact of Marion Liard, in charge of handicap events. After some emails, she put us in contact with the cabinet of Nicolas Nordman, deputy mayor of the Paris City Hall, responsible for all issues concerning disabled people and their accessibility. This cabinet will contact us for a conciliation meeting, the December 3rd, to discuss with specialists during the International Handicap Day. Thus, we are eager to do this meeting with them!
Survey
Introduction
The project NeuronArch is also based on a survey that gives us information to orient, improve and integrate our ideas. This survey has three main goals. They concern both our project and synthetic biology in general:
- Vulgarize synthetic biology - Introduce our project to the general public -      Validate our project by health professionals
To achieve those goals, we had to think about the survey’s framework. For that, we decided to categorize two population types: the general public (children, students, parents…) and health professionals. Then, we conceived a map of our survey which is connected to our goals and our different target populations.
Figure 1: The framework of our survey
As shown by the map above, there are two common sections : the first part includes general questions, synthetic biology, and biofilms for all, and the second"

Evaluation
Colony 2 of the negative device did not grow, therefore no data is available for these replicates! Further evaluation is performed by the Marburg InterLab team. The data was sent to the Marburg iGEM               team is presented in the tables 2-4.

Unesp Brazil
The iGEM team Unesp Brazil works on a new framework to engineer and test probiotics. To analyze their circuit, they use modelling. A major concern was the production of insulin in the absence of glucose. We helped them to improve their model       and supported them throughout the develpment of their model. Our contribution in particular:
We helped to improve their ODE model by adding additional equations and restrictions to their model. Compare Figure 1 and Figure 2 to see how this influenced their model output. As you can see we were able to adjust their model so that it           predicts           reasonable concentrations. In Figure 1.2 the KD for sRNA/DNA binding is depcited and shows how important it is to optimize this paramter for their model in order to obtain the desired output.
We developed guidlines for the team to guide thier parameter estimation and helped them with the literature research for the parametres of their models.
The Unesp Brazil team is working on a booklet on modelling for further iGEM teams at their university. This booklet is meant to guide subsequent teams on their modelling approaches. We were happy to contribute by providing the Tips & Tricks section in this booklet.
We provided lecture material for stochastic modelling.

This year, the iGEM team from Utrecht is also working on modifying and improving the Tar receptor of E. coli. In their project they are evolving the natural receptor so that it can reliably detect pollutants in water. Furthermore, they are         planning to modify the receptor to increase the range of detectable molecules, making it more applicable in real life.          During the European iGEM Meetup in July, we realized that both of our teams were working on chemotaxis-based biosensors. Although our projects are"

From the BioBrick database also metaphoric samurai swords may be devised. Then it only takes a small step to consider deliberate misuse or BioTerror of the open source technology.
Also, biotechnology research or genetic engineering gets more and more easy to carry out. It is probably possible to conduct research in your own garage, without anyone knowing what you are doing. Moreover, companies that synthesize DNA can create any sequence one likes, currently possibly without any constraints.
These open source, dual use and DNA ordering freedom makes BioTerrrorism an issue to consider in the light of open source biotechnology or particularly, iGEM. That is probably why this issue is addressed in many papers on synthetic biology specifically.
3.3 Implications of terminology: a contradictio in terminis?
In synthetic biology many different technologies are converging. Some would say that it is just a modern, advanced version of metabolic engineering. In addition, one may recognize scientific approaches from nanotechnology and biotechnology, but also approaches from information technology are used in synthetic biology. The used laboratory practices rely on recombinant DNA techniques which are already used in genetic engineering. Yet still, biology has from a historical point of view probably always been perceived as a study of nature and natural events. A synthetic prefix results in a contradictio in terminis from a “naturalness” point of view.  But what then, is considered “natural”? What is considered natural  is the topic of much discussion, also in the Genetic Modification (GM) field. To elucidate this statement: Arno van ‘t Hoog, former chief editor of Bionieuws (news paper of the Dutch institute for Biology, NIBI), writes:
“Biologists are moralists. That righteous attitude can be found especially in the term naturalness. Think of natural balance, organic food, etc. Naturalness is an odd mix of ethics and science. Namely, naturalness isn’t a biological term, in nature you can’t see what is natural. You can go and find a certain situation or condition and call it natural. Naturalness always indicates a favored situation. Or the lack of it, and then we hear defying talk of an unnatural situation. And unnaturalness is about the worst sounding biological accusation one can make. It is therefore that the terms naturalness and unnaturalness are always heard in discussions on controversial subjects like biotechnology and nature conservancy. Biotechnology with animals, genetic modification of plants and the cloning of humans are, according to critics,"

High School Teach-ins  (Figs. 6 to 7)
As part of our project, we conducted project teach-ins in high schools. Introduction of synthetic biology and our project are included in the presentation. The most exciting part is the discussion about our project on improvements and potential problems with teen-aged students. Younger minds are full of curiosity and creativity, so we obtain various inspiration and suggestion to our project. Moreover it is of great pleasure to see that students are interested in biology and social concern of biological industry is rising. We hope the younger students would also be obliged to do the same jobs in future .

Online Promotion  (Fig. 8)
Online promotion is an interesting part of our project. As a social communication app, WeChat is quite popular in China. We established an official account for our team. This account serves as a communication platform between our project and the public. Regularly, latest progress of our project is uploaded and release to the followers. It is also available for them to leave their messages and suggestions to us. Moreover, information about the iGEM and relevant researches or projects is published sometimes. With attractive images and introductions, the public have a good access to synthetic biology. Last, using the convenient online platform, we host online survey and discussions on the significance of our project to the community.

Our Instagram account has included regular updates on what the team was getting up to inside and outside of the lab, helping to promote a more well-rounded image of scientists, and also participating in tags such as #femalesinstem to display the gender diversity in our team. We have a high level of engagement for our Instagram posts, regularly reaching a variety of accounts including Oxford colleges, scientific institutions, and the general public. Our Twitter account keeps abreast of the important instagram and facebook posts, and is also key to engaging with other iGEM teams. The Oxford iGEM Facebook page has the biggest following of all our accounts, with over 1000 followers, and displays a range of posts from ‘Meet the Team’ to information about our outreach events and human practices. We have made sure to advertise any outreach we have been involved in across all platforms, such as the Curiosity Carnival and the UNIQ summer schools. We are also careful to display best practice in all laboratory-based photos.

We completely understood their frustration and cloning difficulties, having struggled ourselves quite a bit. To help troubleshoot their issues, we suggested two alternative cloning approaches that seemed to work fairly well for us: (1) Gibson Assembly and (2) Ligation-Independent Cloning. Both of these methods had worked well for us in the path whenever we faced problems with traditional restriction enzyme and ligase cloining.
All in all, we had a great experience working with the RHIT team and getting to known their team members. We found our meet-up with them to be extremely intellectually-stimulating and fun. During the Giant Jamboree, we plan on finding time to meet them in-person and talking more about how our projects are going.
NAWI Graz 2018 iGEM Team
While looking through postings for Team Collaborations on the iGEM Website, we saw a listing from the NAWI Graz Team looking for “Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 support”. Since our entire Objective #3 revolves around engineering A. baylyi ADP1 to metabolize TPA, we immediately reached out to the NAWI Graz team. We also planned to send samples of A. baylyi ADP1 to them so that they would have a lot more flexibility working with the strain for future project directions. We are currently finishing up the paperwork and regulatory procedures required to mail biological samples internationally.
Since our projects utilize A. baylyi in completely different ways, we decided to host a virtual meet-up to discuss our projects and learn more about their team. Since we had not yet interacted with any iGEM teams outside of the United States, we were especially excited to experience the “i” for “international” in “iGEM” for the first time by collaborating with a European team.
Despite the six hour time difference that made scheduling a virtual meet-up a bit challenging, we were able to find a time for both our teams to talk. We began with a quick discussion about our respective projects. We learned about the innovative approaches that the NAWI Graz team was taking in order to produce palm oil using microorganisms. It turned out that the reason they were interested in using A. baylyi ADP1 was because A. baylyi ADP1 has some interesting metabolic pathways that could potentially help them optimize their production of palm oil. We found it incredibly cool that even though both of us were interested in utilizing the unique metabolic pathways found in A."

Since synthetic biology is known by more people and iGEM is increasingly popular, the number of high school participants grows. They’ve learned biology for not a very long time, and some of them are members of the first iGEM team in his or her school’s history. Thus, the guidance and instruction becomes important. On May, most teams started their work, and we gave a speech to some iGEM high school participants from different cities nearby.
We started the speech by briefly introducing synthetic biology and iGEM, and gave examples of former teams’ projects. Then we talked about the whole process and gave useful suggestions. The high school students concentrated on our speech and hoped to get further connection with us.
Apart from that, we had a deep collaboration with HFLS H2S high school team.Click for more information.

""What is this?"" ""How shall I use this device?"" ""So you do experiments there everyday ?"" On a sunny day during the summer vacation, we welcomed a group of high school students, who were members of the science camp, to our lab.
Being a sub activity of their ""Biology Laboratory Day"", we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM to them, and then invited them as well as the guidance teacher to visit our lab. The campers were curious to the facilities in our lab and admired us for our enthusiasm in scientific research. We hope that this activity can let them know what is synthetic biology, how we engineered the microorganisms, and why we are interested in it. Maybe some of them were impressed by this activity and choose to major science when they enter college.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," markers are selected and the circuit computes an AND gate  with these markers in order to perform a classification task. Since miRNAs are molecules exerting solely inhibitory effects on expression, a repressor is required to repress the output, “linking” the high miRNA-markers that inhibit (directly or indirectly) the production of the repressor and the low miRNA-markers that typically target the output gene. As a result, we needed to select the nature of the repressor, with options including a transcriptional one such as LacI, a post-transcriptional one like a synthetic miRNA or both, as well as the in-depth topology, by determining the layers of the circuit (two or more). More elaborate architectures can be employed by utilizing this basic architecture.
In conclusion, we set our “classification” task as follows:
Produce fluorescence or induce apoptosis when a specific miRNA expression profile* is found in colorectal cancer cells (Caco-2).
*The miRNA expression profile should be predetermined in order to discriminate Caco-2 cells from healthy cells.
Circuit topology optimization & miRNA Boolean expression selection
Εxperimental classiﬁers have been designed by trial-and-error, by tweaking the parameters of the network in order to identify the optimal architecture and Boolean expression, or in a semi-manual fashion, via ranking and manual selection of differentially expressed miRNAs retrieved from databases produced by large scale studies. [ 8 ] There are several constraints that dictated these approaches, for example the inadequacy of basic building blocks to better assemble and characterize various mammalian classifiers and the lack of powerful tools to automate logic circuit design based on miRNA molecular switches. Although daunting as a task, we set off to address both of these issues by:
-Creating pANDORRA (programmable AND OR RNAi Assembly) in order to produce a large number of mammalian parts, which can be used for a bottom-up construction of any conceivable logic circuit based on universal logic gates.
-Increasing the functionality and directionality of our assembly process by following a step-by-step cloning workflow and using standardized primers or overhangs after the integration of extensive technical feedback received by Stamatis Damalas. Click here to check it out.
-Employing a computational framework to facilitate the selection of circuit inputs (miRNAs), form the logic expression and simulate optimal circuit-performance in different topologies. Check out our model .

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

Kara and I spent the majority of the day debugging a lot of the problems that we ran into during the user study. The filters, in particular, take a very long time to load all the parts so we worked on optimizing that function of the program. We also modified some of the swipe and trash functionality so that it was more consistent along all workspaces.
Friday 27: MIT User Studies
Today, Consuelo, Kathy, and I headed out to MIT. These user studies were even more difficult that the Wellesley user studies. For some reason, MIT students love trying to break programs. They would often get distracted from the task at hand and look for flaws in planner. It was difficult to watch (but also helpful). At least we got some delicious pad thai for lunch. Transferring Uppi (our large table top surface) to MIT and back was pretty difficult.
August 1: Poster Session Prep
Preparing for the Science Center Poster Presentation.
We have spent the past 3 days balancing work on the MoClo planner and on our poster. The poster session is tomorrow so we have spent much of the past few days working on abstracts for all the different projects in the lab as well as working as our ""elevator speil"" for our particular projects. We have also have been working on a giant task list of problems with the MoClo planner that we created after the user studies.
August 2: Poster Session
I can't believe today is the last day of the summer! We spent the morning working with Orit on our presentations as well as how to answer different types of questions. The poster session went great although I felt that the science center was a little overcrowded with"

and grown in the dark and under blue light After three and six hours samples were taken. A plaque assay was
performed to check if the Opto phages can propagate, but due to a phage contamination of the S2208 cells the plaque assay failed. Three additional plaque assays failed, as the glycerol stock and pipettes were contaminated.
Protein_Interaction
Week 40: This week was mainly about checking the phages to have the right SP inserts, which came along with lots of troubleshooting. Test PCRs did not or not only show the expected band lengths. As a band appeared, which length matches phage backbone size without insert and as well PCR product of Dickinson phage, a phage construct used for validation of our PACE device, contamination of samples could not be excluded. Therefore at the beginning PCR was optimized and transformation was repeated. As problem could not be solved, transformation was repeated a second time and new primers were designed showing significant differences in product length. New PCR needed optimization as well, but finally worked well and robustly, so it became standard PCR for contamination detection of PI-constructs.
Software
GAIA
GAIA was expanded by allowing multiple mutations before selection takes place, a linear decay of the number of mutations before a round of selection is applied. Results look slightly better compared to one mutation before selection. With this mode epistatic mutations can be found, that means mutations that are beneficial together but decrease the score of a protein when occuring alone.

1. PREDCEL Another plaque assay was conducted with the samples of the firste passaging experiment to find out whether we are able to propagate phages over several passaging steps. The outcome showed that 3 passages have been conducted successfully. Subsequently, all triplicates of the last timepoint were screened in order to see if a significant difference between Theo100 and Theo1000 and no Theo can be detected (-> AP works, more phages when theophylline is added, but storing samples in the refigerator reults in lower phage titers).
As only three of five passages have been successfull, a next PREDCEL run was started where more pahges were transferred (1ml instead of 0.5 ml) to see whether this can lead to more successful passaging steps. This time Theo100 was tested along with different caffeine concetrations. The samples have again been checked by plaque assay. Unfortunately, there was a phage contamination in all applied"

PCRs of finger ultramers
We received the ultramers for fingers two and three of our 6 experimental expression plasmids. We performed an overlap PCR in order to join the two ultramer pieces and make a whole unit. Ultimately this unit with be assembled with the omega subunit and the spec backbone to make our final expression plasmids. We used the following recipe:
10 ul KAPA
13.5 ul water
0.75 ul forward ultramer
0.75 ul reverse ultramer
We had an annealing temperature of 58* and an extension time of 15 seconds.
Gel of our product from the ultramer PCR. Note that the first lane's PCR was done in a single tube, while all the others were done in a strip.
However, in addition to the expected band at approximately 300 bp, the bands for our ultramers was extremely streaky, indicating that there may be other contaminants. We decided to perform a PCR purification of these samples, using our protocols , and see if there was an improvement in the gel.
Gel of our product after PCR purification
Even after the gel purification, our bands were streaky. We decided to redo the PCR, placing all the reactions in single tubes, performing a touchdown PCR instead. Our annealing temperature started at 70*, repeated for 2 cycles, and then decreased "

Preparation of Top10 chemically competent cells
None of the clones streaked onto the Amp 100 plate (11/9) grew, indicating no AmpR contamination in cells. One of the ON cultures were therefore selected for preparation of competent cells.
Procedures according to protocol. Growth conditions changed to 25 °C, 220 rpm (OD600 reached after ≈6 h).
A 100 μl aliquot was divided and spread onto Amp 100, Cm 25 and Km 50 plates to verify that they were not contaminated.
Cloning of N-CPPs into pSB1C3
Sequencing results from 8/9 returned.

Blastn alignments against N-Tra10 , N-TAT and N-LMWP indicated successful cloning of N-Tra10 (clone 7) and N-TAT (clone 4).
Transformations
Since pSB1C3.N-TAT and pSB1C3.N-Tra10 colony samples were accidentally discarded, prepared plasmids were used to transform new cells in order to prepare glycerol stocks.
Standard transformation with 1 μl plasmid DNA.

Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.

The Cell-Free Interlab Study
Cell-free expression platforms allow the production of proteins from DNA without live cells by making use of modified cell lysates. Their application is increasingly popular in synthetic biology where they allow fast iteration of design-build-test cycles of genetic parts and gene circuits. Now is the time to prepare for the widespread adoption of cell-free methods by iGEM teams.
Following into the footsteps of the iGEM interlab study, we prepared a pilot-scale interlab study to test the variation of cell-free expression systems between labs. This was made possible by our generous sponsor Arbor Biosciences, who provided the myTXTL cell-free expression system to our team and others.
Results
Preparation of the cell-free interlab protocol
We selected a GFP expressing plasmid (BBa_I20270) from the iGEM 2018 distribution kit and used pTXTL-p70a-deGFP as an optimized plasmid for high cell-free expression of GFP. We prepared a standard protocol to distribute to participating teams. Our protocol makes use of fluorescein as a fluorescence standard, allowing measurements to be compared across labs.
Distribution of the cell-free interlab protocol
We recruited team GIFU iGEM from Japan to participate in this study with us. Thanks to GIFU iGEM for their patience and great work!
Interlab variation in cell-free expression yields
Figure 1. Comparison between cell-free expression of GFP between Paris_Bettencourt (A) and GIFU (B).GFP fluorescence measurements were made at 0 hour and 15 hours of cell-free expression. The values presented here are normalized to respective fluorescein calibration curves prepared by the teams.
As observed from figure 1 (A) and (B) the high expression plasmid (pTXTL-p70a-deGFP)  gives comparatively similar magnitude of fluorescence, indicating a low variability of the cell-free expression system. However we do see a difference in the magnitude of low expression GFP plasmid (BBa_I20270), which could be a result of difference in the way we cloned,"

It's smart to take part
Knowing how important it is to collaborate with other iGEM teams, sharing knowledge and helping improve each other, throughout the year we ""AFCM Egypt"" team filled in the surveys of many teams ,which helped the other teams get more accurate results, and had several video calls with three teams and we helped each other with different aspects of our projects exchanging ideas about the our proposals and discussing the hypotheses , study designs, the novelty of the ideas and most important of them all how to apply the idea in real life and how it impacts our communities. It was so fruitful. We enjoyed a lot, but the most funny part of our collaborations was the selfies we took every time by the end of our calls ^_^
First collaboration was with the Swedish team ""Lund "". As each team explained their project to the other. And we helped Lund with the methods of characterization as by providing suggestions on how they'll characterize the part they use in their project.
The second team we collaborated with was the French team "" iGEM IONIS "". It was a great team; as we know iGEM is not only about science, we had so much fun during our calls even while we were explaining our projects and the hard steps that faced us during our work and helping each other to find solutions for the problems. We also helped Franconia with their survey as our team members translated it into Arabic and also asked our colleagues at the college and other non-medical individuals from different educational institutions in Egypt to fill-in the translated survey for them. We're preparing to exchange online lectures as we will give a lecture via video conference to the students in their college speaking about our project and lab work in exchange with a lecture they give to our college students in the same way. They also sent us the name of an RNA modeling server which helped us modeling our protein parts.We really enjoyed our time with that team.
Last but not least was the German team ""iGEM Franconia"". The most innovative team we ever met. As usual we started our calls by explaining our projects. Then we discussed the modeling part as we offered them help"

Obviously, the subject of ""papaya and ringspot virus"" is beyond the ability of middle school students, we can only find another way. Finally, we decided to go out into the field and conduct a field survey. We consulted farmers and experts to find out ""what is the most prevalent pest in the local field?""

CHAPERONE PROTEIN
A misfolded protein may form from aggregation of primary structure of protein that is overexpressed in the cell. This aggregation may create inclusion body which will lower the bacteria metabolic efficiency. If this condition is continuously happened, the death of the cell may occur. Therefore, it is important to decrease the inclusion body in the cell to increase the lifespan of the cell.
If chaperone is introduced to the system, it will act as an agent to refold the misfolded protein. This chaperone will be integrated in bacteria genome. The inclusion body then will be refolded and restore the activity of the protein as it normally would. With this system, the efficiency and effectiveness of bacteria recombinant gene expression and metabolic load will be better.

He gave us some tips about the circumference of self-study and introduced two books on synthetic biology for us. He emphasized that HTML to program WIKI is an essential skill for us to master. In addition, he briefly described his team’s project and other teams. This is very useful for us during the progress of preparing the iGEM project.
He indicated that the biggest problem his team had, is the uneven distribution of task last year. He suggested us that we should prepare the knowledge for the project before carrying out any experiment. He also mentioned that each team member should be more proactive for high efficiently preparing iGEM project. He believed that iGME provides a great communicating platform for students with the common interest to make friends. It is possible to meet your new friends in the Jamboree next year. This lets us deeply understand how to do an iGEM project.
After the presentation, we had happy communication. Someone asked: What were some problems you had? He answered: The biggest problem he had is the resource and not enough time for the experiment. We discussed how to design the part and device, analyze the results of the experiment. We all harvest a lot of new knowledge, which is crucial for us to apply and practice. Bowen introduced a Wechat number for communication to students of iGEM teams. We can communicate with more members of iGEM teams.
Communication
On September 16th I have a meeting with the leader of RDFZ-China. We have a little presentation just to share the basic information about our project. Then I ask some question about Jamboree and got a very useful information. I believe that can give me a better understanding of whole iGEM competition. This may give our team a better result. All in all, great thanks to RDFZ-China which helps us a lot."

Procedure
Carry out the enzyme digestion operation after getting the target genes. According to  the design of PCR primers, both ends of target genes contain the Pst I and EcoR I -HF enzyme sites, while the plasmid also contains this two enzyme sites. Therefore, the enzyme digestion is implemented simultaneously on target genes and plasmid for 2 hours(the enzyme digestion system is as shown in Table 6).
Import the target genes into the plasmids, so under the same system, they connect for 12 hours( as shown in Table 7).
Add the plasmid to competent cells, namely, the plasmid assembled with fragments of different bp are put into different tubes, with 50 competent cells each at room temperature for 20min. Then incubate in water bath at 42℃ for 40s. On the super net work, coat the cells on the solid medium.

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.

Figure 25: Calculated specific enzyme activity of BPUL at different pH conditions. The highest specific enzyme activity for ABTS was under pH 4 and pH 5 conditions. The higher the pH, the less ABTS got oxidized. One unit is defined as the amount of laccase that oxidizes 1 μmol of ABTS substrate per minute.
Since Regionals: BPUL activity at different temperatures
Figure 26: Standard activity test for BPUL measured at 10 °C and 25 °C resulting in a comparable activity at the tested temperatures. As a negative control the impact of 0.4 mM CuCl2 in oxidizing ABTS at 10 °C and 25 °C was analyzed.
Figure 27: Deriving from the obtained values of oxidized ABTS in time at 10 °C and 25 °C the specific enzyme activity was calculated. For the temperatures only a difference of 1 U mg-1 could be detected. One unit is defined as the amount of laccase that oxidizes 1 μmol of ABTS substrate per minute.
To investigate the activity of BPUL at temperatures that will apply at a waste water treatment plant throughout the year, activity tests were performed at 10 °C and 25 °C as described above. The obtained results reveal a comparable activity of BPUL at high and low temperatures (see Fig. 26). The measurements were conducted for 30 minutes until saturation initiated. Both samples reached saturation after 15-20 minutes. The obtained results were used to calculate the specific enzyme activity which was in both cases at about 37 U mg-1 (see Fig. 27). The negative control without BPUL laccase but 0.4 mM CuCl2 at 10 °C and 25 °C show a negligible oxidation of ABTS. The observed activity at both conditions was good news for the possible application in waste water treatment plants where the temperature differs from 8.1 °C to 20.8 °C.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Integrated practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in endocrinology to further explore human (patient-related) issues in continued development of SMITe
Teaching:
This educational program based on different case studies gave our students the basic knowledge to understand important concepts and applications in synthetic biology.
In the final months we introduced the science underpinning SMITe- which we hoped was now accessible to their understanding - and asked them to reflect on how the problem of long term wounds and the need for repeated antibiotic prescriptions are affecting us all on a global scale.
This work culminated the in the task of generating a student designed antibiotic resistance warning campaign.
Evolving:
Bio Makers: Our first public presentation of the SMITe concept occurred early in the iGEM calendar. We communicated our idea to a biology-curious cohort of members of the public at the Swedish Bio-makers conference, and had the opportunity for a critique of our basic plans.  This was a test of how acceptable and understandable our concept really was and gave us the valuable opportunity to seek feedback on barriers to future implementation.
Questions we were presented with included:
Where does SMITe go once it has broken down the biofilm? Does it make the wound more wet or offensive to look at or smell bad? (or good?)
Are there actual spiders in the wound!? (This was a concerning issue for many people)
Can it be used for any wound and if not, why?
Does it hurt when it is put on open wounds?
Of course, for many of these questions we are still not far along enough in our research to be able to answer. However, it certainly gave us food for thought and made a big impact on how we communicated the concept more broadly... to avoid the worry of actual spiders being involved! We even incorporated this into our crowdfunding campaign video... to make the issue crystal clear!
Community
Primary school:  Through our workshop based education program, we introduced the concept of SMITe to young children at school (aged 9-11). Constituting another level of public engagement about the principles of this project, we set the task of thinking about what other purposes spider silk could serve in order to improve our daily lives. We challenged them to be as innovative and futuristic as possible... but as always when working with children, the results were surprising: several examples are shown below. (The final part of the web resource was a short video about a scientist who had trialed human skin samples reinforced with spider silk and demonstrated they could be bullet proof... I think this struck a cord with the students!)

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 14_-_-_TEXT.html,". While some of us concentrate on making the wiki presentable, Emmy and Oli (though mostly Emmy) set up 5 more biobricking restriction ligation reactions. Bands from the gels are beautifully pure, so we're hoping for at least one success.
Alas, the transformants only get plated out at 11 am.
Tuesday
Days have become a bit arbitrary now, haven't they? The last entry only finished at 11 o'clock.
Andreas tested the instrumentation for colour recognition. More details can be found in the Lab book.  Wiki dominates proceedings from now on, unfortunately (or fortunately? It's certainly easier to do than ligations). Emmy seems keen to sacrafice her own well being for the success of the wiki, having stayed up all night working on t-shirt designs and then staying until midnight to get some more design work done. She finally goes home after a 36 hour shift - I doubt any of the rest of us can really have reason to complain.
Unfortunately, we still haven't got any colonies on the ligation plates. On the bright side, there aren't any on the positive transformation control plate either, so perhaps not so desperate as we feared. We'll have to be patient and see what happens tomorrow.
And Jolyon sets out to try the Miller assay one last time. Even though it worked pretty well last time, we'd still like some more data to average out.
Wednesday
The final day is here, and we're dedicated to getting the wiki as presentable as possible. Thank God Emmy hasn't been stricken by some disease that strikes down the poorly rested.
Not that wet work has completely passed us by, on this, our final day. As I write, a plate reader assay is running to check if Ratiometrica works as expected. On top of this, Stuart is taking a time lapse series of photos to see if our promoter speeds up germination as expected. See our final characterization data on the results page , as well as the respective pages for each of our parts.
Plus, we finally got some colonies on the ligation plates! Unfortunately, colony PCR with the sequencing primers reveals that all we have is recircularized backbone. We don't even know how it managed to do this, because we treated the vector with alkaline phosphatase. It seems that the ligation fairy is simply not smiling on us.

The same is not true of vitamin A, though: most vitamin pills contain retinol, which is the form                     of vitamin A that is used by the human body, and which can be toxic at very high dose. The ß-carotene produced by our yeast though is not toxic, since the body only converts what it needs into retinol.
The vitamin B2 form that our micro-organism is producing is riboflavin, which can be toxic at very                     high dose. However it is very unlikely that the bacteria will produce a couple of orders of magnitude more than the daily requirement (about                     1.2mg/day), contrary to the vitamin pills that often contain a                     lot more, from 10 to 100 mg.
European and Indian Regulations
In order to evaluate the feasibility of our product’s implementation, we researched the european and indian regulations concerning the production and distribution of genetically engineered micro-organisms.
We found that the EU directive 90/219/EEC of the European Economic Community relative to the contained use of GMO would allow production of this product within the european market. This directive is enforced in each of the EU member’s national regulations.
In India, the FSSAI (Food Safety and Standard Authority in India) told us that the safety is needed to be established in order for our product to be authorized. Both Dr. A. K. Sharma from the FSSAI and Dr. Sunita Grover the Dairy Microbiology Division at the National Dairy Research Institute advised us to chose micro-organisms that were already present in the fermented foods we were targeting, which is what we did. These organisms are all in Risk Group 1 (Unlikely to cause human disease.), and have the GRAS status (Generally Considered As Safe).
We also found out that the Indian law currently doesn’t allow GM microorganisms because of the use of antibiotic markers that makes them unsafe to eat.
But according to Samir K. Brahmachari , former director of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in India, our product has a greater chance to be authorized if there is no more live bacteria in the final form of the dish, that is actually eaten. We checked this affirmation and found out this regulation:
‘...food stuffs...derived from Living Modified Organisms where the end product is NOT a Living Modified Organism are exempted from mandatory approval of the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee.’

Comments:
We picked blue colonies instead of white by mistake. We need to pick colonies again but this time make sure we pick white colonies.
For the repetition we must find another enzyme instead of BanII as we found out that it doesn't cut very well.
07/06/2014
We picked again 3 colonies for each construction, and we made sure that we picked the WHITE ones. We cultivated them in a ""double check"" (name invented by us)  liquid medium. Those tubes contain:
3.5 mL LB
7 μL Amp
7 μL X-Gal
3.5 μL IPTG (turns the tube blue if the colonies picked were blue)

We made minipreps of yesterday's culture. Thanks to our ""double check"" medium we found which colonies were well picked. Finally we had minipreps of tubes HarFAR 1, 2, 3; EaDAcT 3 and AtrΔ11 2, 3.
Once we had the minipreps, we perform the digestions to check which were correct and send them to sequencing. This time we selected RsaI instead of BanII. The in silico digestions were as follows.

Artificial life, cloning of animals Dolly in 1996, though far not applicable, still a brand fancy angle to explore the unknown world! Human Genome Project, the post-genome project is on the road, a brand-new age is coming to us! How thrill we are to explore the rest of our world and to discover the unknown!
As iGEMers, we also discussed when immigrating to Mars, how to live and settle down as a synthetic biologist instead of a botanist.
We also concerned about the freshness of our fruit (See ‘FRES(H)’, Fruit Ripeness Ethylene Sensor (Hopefully), USYD-2016). iGEM projects were and are making unprecedented possibilities to give out solutions aiming to different fields of dilemma. Combined with Synthetic Biology, ZJU-iGEM delivers the principles of biological and ethical criterion of iGEM competition to publics through OneYouthTalk. The considerations of biosafety and public engagement also invisibly lead our team to step further in our next activities for popular science!
Thanks for the active participants, we were really encouraged and will definitely enroll in the activity again next year!

Introduction: Gene Therapy
Definition
Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a drug to  treat disease by delivering therapeutic DNA into a patient’s cells. The most common form of gene therapy involves using DNA that encodes a functional,  therapeutic gene to replace a mutated  gene. Other forms involve directly correcting a  mutation, or using DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein drug (rather than a  natural human gene) to provide treatment (“Gene therapy”, Wikipedia).
Gene therapies can be categorized as somatic gene therapies and germline ones by target cell or virus-vectored or  non-virus-vectored by vector.
History
Genetic engineering techniques have invoked  people’s interest in DNA modifying for clinical use. Early in 1972, the idea of gene therapy was first put forward.
The first gene therapy case is in US in  1990. Then in the 1990s there are several successful cases, though partly, but  the death in a gene therapy clinical trial in 1999
In 2003 a team from UCLA inserted a gene into the brain, which is a great step in brain disease treatment.
In 2007 the first gene therapy operation was performed for a patient with inherited retina disease, yielding positive results.
In 2012,  Glybera  became the first gene therapy treatment to be approved for clinical use in  either  Europe  or  the United States after its endorsement by the European Commission.
By now in 2014 gene therapy is still more of an experimental approach than a clinical therapy.
Advantage and drawbacks
The advantages of gene therapies are quite obvious that they can cure treat some most difficult diseases under traditional therapies and previous experiments of gene therapies have shown some promising cases. The discovery of AAV with specific insertion site adds to people’s expectation.
However, there are a number of technological problems in front of gene therapy, including short-lived nature  of gene therapy, potential risk with viral vectors and misinsertion for cancer,  and weakness in multigene diseases, etc."
Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Application#Rollout_-_-_TEXT.html," million deaths between 1997-2004 were attributable to treatable conditions. Currently, the Democratic Republic of Congo is war-torn between the governmental military and rebel groups. Medical Entomologist Jeanine Loonen told us that negotiation with all the involved parties is necessary to maintain a functional healthcare system and infrastructure in these areas.
Dr. Philippe Büscher
Head of the Unit of Parasite Diagnostics, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp.
The main bottlenecks in eradicating tropical diseases is still the political status of countries, due to civil wars and governmental restrictions, the availability of healthcare facilities, and the price for treatments
To help, Médecines sans Frontières (MSF) set up a medical facility providing free health care and are asking the local population to help deliver medical supplies to healthcare facilities. The local population is thus an important partner in safe and effective transportation of the diagnostic here. More of these institutes, mainly based in Europe, provide free screening and medication to HAT patients.
Case: Zika in Brazil
In Brazil, accessibility of healthcare facilities poses a smaller problem compared to Congo. Brazilian citizens can go to the doctor's office for free. However, these doctors do not have the expensive equipment needed to diagnose viral diseases. We learned this by talking to the local iGEM team ( USP-Brazil ). With Mantis, these local doctors can now diagnose patients!

The lack of financial support for programs attempting to combat neglected tropical diseases is a major issue. All aspects involved in gaining control over infectious diseases, be it medical supplies, population screening or vector control measurements, are virtually impossible without the necessary funding.

It was discussed about using an odourless Ecoli however Gary Robinson suggested that it would be unnecessary. 
Zingiberene has been ordered and it should take 8-10 days to arrive.   
This   week had problems photographing our gels WFX suggested that we need to   save them as a JPEG not a TIFF and that if you alter the contrast then   should be able to see something.   
By next week:
-Have all components grown up for limonene  
-Attempt the double digests, for this need to find a digest protocol  
-Have a think about computational questions  
-Have made progress with the Wiki 
-Remember to keep growing up new transformed colonies, use single colonies.
12.08.2014
Deadline:
August 15th team roster and project proposal need to be submitted.  Draft of the proposal has been done and a few changes need to be made before submitting.
 
YSB sign up deadline has passed all of the team need to make sure they have signed up or need to tell wfx and he can email the organiser.
 
General:
 
Sequence delivery has been delayed because they could not make the sequence in a linear form and instead it now has to be made in a vector.  This is going to cost more than expected and consequently means we can now only order 2 sequences instead of 3.
 
Wiki is looking good and Taylor is making good progress, just need to start adding lab notes on and make team profiles.
 
Boston is still not booked but the University has all our details and should go through by the end of this week.
 
Presentation for YSB has been started and a draft shown today, feedback has been given and a second run through to be given in a few weeks' time.
 
A draft of the Poster for YSB needs to be given at the next meeting.

We have replied to Givaudan asking if we can arrange a meeting with them to ask questions about the fragrance industry and see an industrial take on our project.  We also asked if they would be willing to supply us with any fragrance compounds so that we can use it as a control to test against our own.
 
Computational questions- discussion about computational questions was held these are the suggested ideas that were put forward.

Human Practices Summary
Our team was motivated to examine problems of distributive justice in modern medicine and biotechnology. We wanted to find flaws in the current distribution scheme of medicine, especially in areas of the world lacking in infrastructure. At the same time we wanted to educate the public as well as figures with particular agency, about modern advances and issues in synthetic biology and biotechnology. To these ends we talked with experts in Mozambique health services, and offered a brief introductory class on genetic engineering and synthetic biology to Boston area high-school students.

NAU-CHINA,2017,Team:NAU-CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," two toxins’ (DON, ZEN) content and design a detecting method , we went to  Nanjing government where we visited two officers and a technician. We consulted about the content of the two toxins circulating in the food chain which involved wheat grain, wheat derived flour gislated on the criteria of two toxins.(GB 5009.111 for DON, GB 5009.209 for ZEN). Unfortunately, it is undeniable that, in the context of unfavorable climate condition,  the bottom will fall out of the quality as the content of toxins will be definitely above the stipulated value.
We also visited the quality-control laboratory of the government in which we found that it was such a both labor-consuming and time-consuming process to detect the two toxins. Basically, the government will need 3-4 days to finish a set of detection. Besides, the devices they utilize are expensive and inconvenient. All these issues have inspired us a brand new idea—a device serve the function of detecting!

1.Could you describe the tension arising from FHB, and its adverse consequences for farmers and our country?
——In China, although as a whole there is no significant decrease in the gross production of wheat, it still could be a cataclysm for some agriculture-oriented  provinces’ wheat production. It does trigger a serious economy descending  not only for big companies but also for individual farmers, so I believe FHB to be a tough and tricky disease for agricultural.
2.What do you think the public and the farmers would react to our genetically-modified yeast as a measure for precaution in the soil? Would they accept it?
——Well, in China it could arouse unrest. Because the public haven’t been exposed to this kind of genetically modified method before. Also, you know, the people may conjure up the fear of a former issue, a heatedly debated legislation through the last decade, whether we should allow genetically modified food circulating in the market. So, I guess it wouldn’t be very sought-after.
3.Is there any foreseeable problems that may come along with the utilization of genetically modified yeasts?
——Well, you should be very aware that perhaps this method which inoculate genetically modified yeasts into the soil may not work out… I know quite a few researches carried out by professors with great prestige. It took them years to isolate microorganisms that could to some extent control diseases of wheat, however when they inoculated them back in the soil the problem showed up—some plants got sick and then recovered, others didn’t… It’s complicated.

Progesterone's direct precursor, pregnenolone, also has many beneficial aspects. It is the precursor to all steroid hormones in the body, such as cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol and aldosterone are adrenal cortex steroid hormones. Cortisol regulates carbohydrate metabolism and has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body. Aldosterone plays a huge role in cardiovascular health, and helps maintain blood pressure and regulates the salt and water balance in the body. The pathway design we have created allows for the future creation of many beneficial steroid drugs by simply adding a few more genes.
Future optimizations for PoPPY-switch could include changing the location of our riboswitch so that high progesterone concentrations directly inhibit the progesterone production pathway creating an innate dosage-control mechanism. Another avenue of improve- ment would be to use the same riboswitch system, but with a constitutively inactive cleavage that shuts down the production of a survival-necessary gene upon binding to progesterone. The resulting system would then use senescence as an off-switch for progesterone production."

Design
The plasmid we get at last is as follows:
The whole construction process follows the same way. We get the main part  from part kit from iGEM and clone it into the constant expressing operon designed by ourselves, and then the whole operon is cloned into a pCDFDuet vector.
Others
During the designing process, we calculated that the light intensity needed to stimulate blue light controlled gene expression system was too small. Wondering the feasibility of this system, we contacted the corespondent author of the reference paper. Soon we got the reply, and unexpectedly, the author realized the published paper had a small mistake. The unit in that paper was wrong, it should be 1000 times larger. He also said that they would contact the journal and submit an erratum to the journal in due course.
Looking back we are very happy about this little story. First we can use this system since after another round of calculation, the result shows that it is a pretty good choice to use this system; Second is that we help discover a mistake in a published research incidentally, which will help other researchers use this light system more correctly.

GFP excitation with our LED panel. Microwell plate with an E.coli DH5α culture (middle left) and a GFP producing culture (middle, right) irradiated with light of 465 nm with the LED panel. The fluorescence was captured using an appropriate filter to reduce background signal.
Photoswitching of azobenzene‑phenylalanine (AzoF)
Phenylalanine‑4’‑azobenzene (AzoF) is a non-canonical amino acid that is present in its cis- or trans-conformation. Naturally, a solution with AzoF contains a mixture of both conformations with the more stable trans-conformation in excess. By irradiating the solution with our LED panel for 40 minutes and 100 % brightness, the amino acids can be switched to one of the distinct conformations by choosing either the 465 nm or the 367 nm LEDs. This way, different properties of proteins containing AzoF in their amino acid sequence can be mediated by illumination with our LED panel. This photoswitching process can be observed by differences in the absorption spectrum of the two AzoF conformations (Figure 2). We were able to switch AzoF to the trans‑conformation with blue light (465 nm) and to the cis‑conformation with UV-light (367 nm). The conformations are stable for several hours and can be switched back and forth until the amino acid degrades.
Photoswitching of AzoF with our LED panel. Changes in the absorption spectrum of AzoF when irradiated with light of 367 nm or 465 nm. Naturally, cis and trans conformations are mixed (black) but can be primed by irradiation to the cis‑conformation (red) if irradiated with UV‑light or to the trans‑conformation (blue) by irradiating with blue light. The cis‑primed AzoF can be primed to trans again (green) and then back to cis (purple) until the amino acid degrades.
Photochanging of 2‑nitrophenylalanine (2‑NPA)
The non‑canonical amino acid 2‑nitrophenylalanine (2‑NPA) changes its structure by performing a cyclization with itself when irradiated with UV‑light > 300 nm. We could proof the change of the structure of 2‑NPA when irradiated with our LED panel"

Brian Pfleger PhD.:
Brian Pfleger received his PhD after studying in the laboratory of Jay D. Keasling at Cal-Berkeley where he developed metabolic engineering methods to enhance the biosynthesis of pharmaceuticals. This experience trained him to design, construct and evaluate strains of Escherichia coli for the production of small molecules by integrating synthetic and systems biology. After graduating, he accepted a postdoctoral fellowship (NIH-GLRCE) in the laboratory of David H. Sherman at the University of Michigan, where he studied six Bacillus anthracis enzymes and how they assembled a complex natural product essential for iron acquisition and pathogenesis. Research in the Sherman lab exposed him to the combinatorial nature of natural product biosynthesis and taught him how to work with these novel enzymes. His current interest is engineering sustainable chemical production using synthetic biology.

Thereby making a plant directly produce n-butanol, an industrially relevant compound that can serve as a more efficient biofuel than ethanol. The project took on another goal when it was realized that an intermediary compound in the pathway could be used to produce (R)-Polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable plastic.
Vanillin Project
Vanillin is one of the major compounds in the vanilla flavor. A phenolic aldehyde, vanillin is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, beverages, as well as a fragrant compound in different products. The demand of Vanillin exceeded the natural production, so annually most vanillin is produced via chemical synthesis.  We intend to produce vanillin in different plants as a natural alternative for vanillin production.

Table 6. Transformation Results of Three Methods for Mutation Library Construction
The competent cell positive control was transformed with 20pg TRPC5 plasmid. The rest six were all transformed with 5μl products. Transformation operations were all the same.
2. Library Calculation
Competent Cell Efficiency
(1). Formula: \frac{\text{Colonies}}{\text{ng of DNA plated}}\times 1000 \text{ng}/\mu g
(2). Calculation: 237 / 0.02 x 1000=1.185x107 cfu/μg
(3). Actual meaning: 20pg,5640bp TRPC5 plasmid → 3.457x106 copies
3.457x106 / 237=14586,which means 1 of 14586 plasmids would actually grow on the plate.
Ligation Efficiency
(1). 62ng,4906bp plasmid → 1.232x1010 copies
(2). Efficiency= \frac{(1772-330)\times 20 \div 5}{1.232 \times 10^10 \times \frac{1}{14586}}\times 100\% = 0.68\%
Theoretical Mutation Library
(1). R.E.D and Ligation: (1772-330)x14586= 2.1x107
(2). Whole Plasmid Mutagenesis: (191-0)x14586= 2.8x106
(3). Gibson Assembly: (38-7)x14586= 4.5x105
All were calculated based on the transformation results of 5μl products transformed with 100ul competent cell.
(v). Discussion
We could see from the results above that, the theoretical mutation libraries for three methods were (1)>(2)>(3).
Still, we need to consider their effect on CHO-K1 cell if being directly transfected without transformation and plasmid construction. Since the ligation efficiency was 0.68%, we did an experiment comparing the survival rate of CHO-K1 cells after being transfected with linear DNA and circular DNA. After antibiotic screening, we luckily found that the former one were almost dead, while the latter one were good. Thus we could directly transfect the ligation products into cell without transformation, preventing"

His speech inspired us a lot. He not                                                 only introduced the ideas of super pollutants such as HFCs, CH4 and                                                 black carbon, but also proposed the solutions for tackling climate                                                 change.
After his speech, we briefly introduced our project to                                                 him. Although his work focuses on the impact of non-CO2 gases on climate change, he thinks that human beings need more                                                 alternatives to tackle carbon dioxide emission problem, and our project                                                 may be one of the solutions, which makes us have faith in our project.

Through this meetup, we realized that ‘everyone is                                                 responsible to make the world better, no one should be excluded.’ Unity                                                 of the entire society is the most effective way to mitigate climate                                                 change. Therefore, we put more effort in our human practice activities                                                 by engaging with government entities, local enterprise, institution and                                                 the public.

He introduced                                                 us to current carbon capture methods and technologies in Taiwan.

However, considering the active fault lines across Taiwan and the frequent                                                 occurrence of earthquakes,                                                 it may be risky to have largescale CCS project here. He was amazed by                                                 our project, as we developed                                                 a biological solution of capturing CO2 emission in industry. The                                                 highlight of this method is                                                 engineered E.coli could efficiently capture and utilize CO2 into                                                 products with great market                                                 potential. Shen pointed out that gaseous emitted from heavy industry                                                 contains a lot of toxic                                                 elements, which is not suitable to be recycled into esculent products.

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," induce apoptosis in HEK293 cells, as these are human kidney cells and not murine reactive astrocytes cell line, the real target of our system.  
Importance: In our project, one of our goals was to engineer a dCas9-VP64-gRNA system that could activate the pMLPm promoter to induce apoptotic death by the expression of exogenous reverse caspas3. Since we are using staphylococcus aureus dCas9-VP64-gRNA, we made changes in the pMLPm Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), and now we must verify pMLPm regulating activity trough the expression of an mCherry fluorophore. We will also verify the apoptotic triggering abilities of the exogenous reverse caspas3 that is used in our project.
Theoretical background:
The synthetic minimal adenovirus major late promoter (pMLPm) contains three repetitions of the ""a1"" sequence, which are complementary to the gRNA sequence, enabling dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex to target the pMLPm synthetic promoter1.When the transcription factor VP64 (an engineered tetramer of the herpes simplex VP16 transcriptional activator domain) is fused to dCas9 enzyme, it can be guided to a specific location in the genome, in this manner we can exploit it to promote downstream translation2.
The dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex will target the pMLPm synthetic promoter and promote the expression of exogenous reverse caspase3, that in contrast to the endogenous caspas3 will be activated after transcription due to its autocatalytic processing, meaning that this enzyme will trigger an apoptotic signal that will lead to apoptotic death  (caspase3 is responsible for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation)3.
The mCherry reporter protein is also expressed by the pMLPm promoter in our system, it is fused to the exogenous reverse caspase3 with Thoseaasigna virus 2A (T2A) peptide that is cleaved during translation4.
In order to activate pMLPm promoter and to induce apoptotic death we used 2 plasmids:
A Lenti viral plasmid: CMV dCas9 VP64 – in this plasmid CMV promoter express dCas9 enzyme which is fused to the transcription factor VP64.
pSynt CMV – in this plasmid CMV promoter express the gRNA. And pMLPm promoter regulate the downstream translation of exogenous reverse caspase"

Interdisciplinary Interviews
Although the Human Practices team primarily organized and reported on our interviews (which are detailed on our main Human Practices page), the execution of these meetings included all subteams. When possible, we sent at least one Wet Lab and Outreach member along with Human Practices members to conduct the interviews, since our interviewees often had interdisciplinary backgrounds themselves.
For example, Dr. Marc Ouellette has experience both as a microbiology researcher and as a director within the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); so when we interviewed him, we were sure to balance the team between Wet Lab and Human Practices members. Dr. Ouellette first justified the issue of antimicrobial resistance in Canada, including specific details about where he thought gaps in the diagnostic process of antimicrobial-resistant strains of C. difficile occurred. The Wet Lab members then had the opportunity to ask him where mGEM’s project could bridge those gaps. We received specific advice on targeting a bacterial cell’s crude extracellular mixture to improve the effectiveness of our DNAzyme. By establishing the Human Practices component of antimicrobial resistance first, the Wet Lab members could then guide a conversation about how their project could be changed to better address the needs of end-users.

We collaborated with two other teams ( Valencia UPV and Cambridge-JIC who had chosen to use a plant chassis and were interested in GoldenGate cloning to develop a new RFC for plants!! We also sent Team Valencia UPV chromoproteins (AmilCP and AmilGFP) and our Flipper parts (see above) for converting any of their GoldenGate parts to BioBricks for submission to the registry.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability,        social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least        one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the        team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).
After our initial Policy and Practices event,  we once again ventured out again to facilitate a more in-depth discussion in a ‘Science Café’ style debate on the topics surrounding our project, which included: genetic modification of plants and other organisms, crop disease, food security, the ethics behind scientific discovery, and the way scientists conduct themselves. We followed up this event with the ethics committee at our university initiate a process of ethical public consultation on these issues. More information on both of these studies are given on our Policy and Practices page. Contributions  are detailed on our Attributions page.

As the figure shows, we construct our overexpression vectors via Gibson assembly. However, because some of unknown problem occur in the reaction buffer, we did not get clear bands. It may result from long time storage of the assembly mix and the activity of three different enzyme in the mix altered, the activity of exonuclease may preponderate over other enzyme and digest the fragment into piece. Fortunately, we have screen out the positive colony after transformation.

The result of relatively quantitative PCR. We utilize two gene as reference in the PCR, one is rrsA which is a gene of 16s RNA and the other is dnaA which is a gene of DNA polymerase element. Generally speaking, the expression level of rrsA is very high, whereas the expression level of dnaA is relatively low. In this table, we presume that the discrepancy of dnaA’s and rrsA’s expression level are the same in BL21 and DH5a, which is 10^10 folds.
Figure3B
Figure3C
However, we found the discrepency of expression level of dnaA and rrsA are quite distinct between BL21(DE3) and DH5a. T-test indicates p<0.01 (table 1B). Thus, we take this factor that the expression level of rrsA is 100000 folds over expression level of dnaA in DH5a and 160000 folds in BL21(DE3) into account.
