The Radii parameter for non-polar solvation is mbondi in [14]. Before MD, the solvated complex was relaxed by 1000 steps for minimization, 50 ps for heating from 0K to 300K, 50 ps for density equilibrium at 300K, and 500 ps for constant pressure equilibrium. In the MD step, total time is 2 ns in RNA simulation. The MM minimization and MD simulations are run by using the pmemd.cuda program in AMBER 14. The unbounded cutoff of 999 Å is also used in the minimization process. Finally, we use the scripts of MMPBSA.pl, one of AmberTools, to calculate the binding energy of sRNA-target duplex.
According to Figures 8-10 shown as RyhB-sodB, Spot42-galK, and RprA-rpoS, we calculate the structure of sRNA-target RNA in the implicit solvent model first.(Generalized-Born solvation model, GB). After MD step, the large changes of molecular positions occur in the final structures of sRNA-target RNA complex. Moreover, both of the distortion in the two ends of RNA structure and the bending of RNA backbones also affect the binding energy. Finally, we will compare these pictures with the method of MMPBSA.

β-galoctisidase assay of the Inverter with lacZα
β-Galactosidase assay of Inverter with lacZα as reporter. The higher the arabinose concentration, the higher the translational repression of uofCGU-lacZα
The Inverter is composed of the pBAD promoter (lacking the repressor binding sites), which produces the short RNA RyhB. RyhB binds to uofCGU and masks the Shine Dalgarno sequence, thereby translationally repressing it. UofCGU is translationally fused to lacZα, and therefore also translationally repressed. UofCGU-lacZα is produced by an IPTG-inducible Promoter which is induced with 1mM IPTG. The PBAD is titrated with arabinose. The higher the arabinose concentration is, the higher the RyhB concentration and consequently the lacZα translational repression.

CODON OPTIMIZATION SOFTWARE
The time for implementation of sophisticated computational approaches into biology has finally come. The DTU Biobuilders team was well aware of this fact and therefore took a leap forward by developing TaiCO, a unique specialized yet user-friendly codon optimization tool based on species specific tAI calculation.
""There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.""

Overview
""There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.""
C.A.R. Hoare
The increased use of non-conventional organisms for conventional purposes increases the need for codon optimization of coding sequences that are used for heterologous protein production. Codon optimization is typically performed by replacing each codon with the most frequently used synonymous from the host genome. The assumption that the most frequent synonymous codon is also the most efficiently translated codon is not necessarily true when it is considered that a typical or average transcript is not one that is likely to have a higher than average translation efficiency. Highly translated transcripts often contain “reserved” codons that are not the most common. Instead, these transcripts contain codons that best match the tRNA pools in the cell. These tRNA pools can be estimated by the number of tRNA genes that have an anticodon  which corresponds to a given codon. This approach is known as the tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI) 1 when used to assess the translation efficiency of a coding sequence.
From Blackboard Calculations to Software
TaiCO (tAI Codon Optimaztion tool) constitutes a unique computational tool for answering  the common biological question: What coding DNA sequence will result in maximum protein expression? The DTU Biobuilders' proposal for solving this task is a stand-alone application that is based completely on species specific"

Collaborations with SZU-China
This year, we made a collaboration with SZU-China in Shenzhen University. We helped them make                         some new content of their WeChat-based Mini Program. We gave them detailed feedback after using                         it, and shared our familiar experience with them about how to promote it to more and more high                         schools. In return, they did much work to screen several compatible strains, which were used by                         us to screen the suitable strain to produce our “smart yogurts ” combined with our constructed                         L. lactis. They went to the supermarket, bought various bands and different conditions of                         yogurt for them, including Classy·Kiss and CHENGUANG DAIRY, finally isolated several local                         strains, which were mailed to us for our strain screening plan.

In the present project, since the oral table administration of GSH and SAM have some                         disadvantages, such as low stability and short life span, here we tried to develop a novel                         in-vivo strategy of produce and deliver them simultaneously by using NICE system. In the                         experiment, two-functional GSH synthetase gene (gshF) and SAM synthetase gene (metK) were in                         tandem inserted into the expression vector (pNZ8148), and the resulted plasmid (pNZ8148-SG) was                         employed to construct the target vector pNZ8148-SGC by introducing adhesion factor gene (cwaA).                         This target vector was transformed to get recombinant Lactococcus lacti, which was employed to                         produce our “smart yogurt”.
The project is outlined with two stages：
Demonstrate the function of SC-L7Ae-mRFP1 by H14Z1_Hangzhou
As team XMU-China’s HSFCM data shown, OmpA-ST inside OMVs could be detected. To validate the                         ST/SC conjugation inside OMVs, they linked BBa_K2623022/BBa_K2623024 with BBa_K2623025 (NG5) to                         form BBa_K2623028 and BBa_K2623030 respectively. Hence, they need to demonstrate the                         SC-L7Ae-mRFP1 inside E. coli BL21 to validate its presence inside E. coli BL21 and therefore                         OMVs.

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," 2017) (Christof K. Biebricher, 1984).    We used sensitivity analysis to check the effect that an inaccuracy in this value would have on the output of the model    and we concluded that it would not have a large effect on the output. Additionally, there may be a range of number of pili    per E. coli but due to the large number of E. coli considered in this model we can assume an average for this.    Another assumption made was that the metal ions will have the same binding rate to our modified pili as mannose have to the pili on the MG-1655 E. coli. With further time, however, it would be possible to alter the model to take this into account by comparing it to relevant experimental data.  Additionally, this model implicitly assumes that the metal binding reactor is a long, narrow pipe. As such, if this reactor was in the shape of a wide vat then the results of our model may be less accurate.
The Model's Evolution
The Interface
After receiving feedback on the user interface, changes were made to increase its user-friendliness. The first was enabling the user interface to produce a graph to provide the user with a visual representation of the models process and outputs. A further improvement made was including example values in the input boxes to provide the users with feasible values to input as, for example, typical concentrations of metal ions may not be known. Another alteration was enabling the interface to produce error messages to explain why certain input values were not feasible so that the user could alter the inputs accordingly.
The Outputs
Initially, the model produced the outputs ‘concentration left’ and ‘efficiency’ in addition to the current outputs of the model. It was decided that these were unnecessary as the concentration left would either be the same as desired concentration, if the volume of the reactor is large enough, or the desired concentration would never be reached therefore the error message would be displayed. Therefore, post this change in adding the error messages, this output became redundant. Furthermore, the efficiency of the system is merely based on the ratio of the input concentration to desired concentration, therefore, it was decided that this output was also not necessary for the user.
Curve Fitting
In order to increase the accuracy of the model, we performed experiments using a solution of mannose and unmodified MG-1655 E. coli in our metal binding reactor, similar to those detailed on the metal binding reactor page . By using a known initial concentration, recording the flowrate of the water and calculating the volume of the metal binding reactor, we were able"

Well-known cases are artemisinin, the drug with the most effective mechanism against malaria-causing P. falciparum, and taxol, a mitotic inhibitor used in chemotherapeutic cancer treatments. Both of them are produced in plants (a fern-like shrub and the bark of a tree, respectively), but their yields are usually low and the demand for their medical use is significantly high. Other examples include lycopene, the precursor in tomatoes for beta-carotene, and limonene, which is present in most cosmetic products distributed nowadays.
The biological pathway through which terpenoids are synthesized in eukaryotes is the mevalonate pathway, which includes a series of molecular transformations from Acetyl-CoA to isopentenyl-5-pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate. These isomeric molecules are the common precursors for all terpenoid molecules. A bioengineering approach for terpenoid production involves using the mevalonate pathway and the appropriate synthases in order to end up with the desired molecule. The yeast P. pastoris already uses the mevalonate pathway, but it has been reported that the HMG-CoA reductase involved in its rate-limiting step is heavily regulated. This can be bypassed by a reported N-terminus truncation that renders it still functional but increases the total yield of the process.
Applying the aforementioned modular biofactory design strategy to this model, it is possible to implement a biological platform for the synthesis of terpenoids. Using the production of lycopene as a proof of concept, the separate genes required include the truncated HMG-CoA reductase, GGPP synthase (CrtE), phytoene synthase (CrtB), and phytoene desaturase (CrtI), each with a transcription promoter, RBS and transcription terminator.
Additionally, another module may be implemented to further optimize the platform for terpenoid production. P. pastoris utilizes a great part of the molecules produced in the mevalonate pathway to feed its sterol pathway, starting with the production of squalene. Silencing the squalene synthase gene, ERG9, would enable the use of precursors for terpenoid production.
Although P. pastoris has no known RNAi mechanism, it has been shown that introducing genes for Dicer and Argonaute from Saccharomyces castellii successfully provides S. cerevisiae with the silencing mechanism. Introducing the AGO1 and DCR"

Mop simulations overview
Visualising the physical processes which occur within our bacterial Toximop was an important step in the conclusion of our project. By visualising the cell environment and allowing the manipulation of key properties such as binding probabilities, gate numbers, protein production rates etc., the effects of small changes to key properties of the mopping bacteria could be easily and immediately observed. Furthermore, by the visualisation of the bacterial cell in action, effects over time could be observed and concentrations of particles and proteins displayed in a plot.
The two visualisations created represent two transport mechanism for the transport of proteins from the cytoplasm of E. coli to the periplasm. These transport mechanisms are the Tat and Sec pathways (for more details on these pathways, see ToxiMop – What it is & how it works . Both the Tat and Sec pathways were tested as possible methods of transport for PP1 molecules into the periplasm and visualisation of such transports were created in an application called Netlogo[1].
Please be aware; the java applets within which these simulations are displayed can often take some time in loading. We ask for your patience when attempting to run these applets.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Design and Background_-_-_TEXT.html," prevents protein-protein interaction, forcing the backbone to extend itself. The extended conformation of the mucin enables a larger contact area for glycans to bind water, enabling the mucus to form a gel with both viscous and elastic properties. Removing glycans or part of the glycan could induce protein aggregation of the mucin backbone and thus loss of gelatinous attributes.
The sugar groups of the mucins often differ, making them heterogeneous constructs. The majority of the mucins found in the respiratory tract contain a large amount of sialic acid, a negatively charged monosaccharide. Sialic acids are located at the end of the mucins’ saccharide chains (figure 1) and give the mucin an overall negative surface charge, which increases the stability of the mucin through charge repulsion (Zanin, 2016).
Figure 1. Mucin schematic representation.
How will we degrade the mucus?
With the ultimate goal of degrading the mucins using a genetically engineered bacteria, a literature search was conducted, aiming to identify mucin degrading enzymes successfully expressed in E. coli by other researchers. We mainly researched enzymes that degrade the saccharides rather than the protein backbone. Considering our project aims to expose these enzymes to the human body, we decided to avoid proteases. Our objective was a controlled bacterial system that will only degrade the mucins and not harm the lungs. Several relevant enzymes were found in literature, but after the first trial experiments it was decided to further research two of them.
Firstly, the enzyme sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18) from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (Egebjerg, 2005). This enzyme hydrolyses glycosidic linkages of terminal sialic acid residues in glycoproteins (figure 2). In other words, it removes the sialic acids from the ends of the mucin constructs. Removal of sialic acids results in an exposure of other sugar groups on the mucins to other enzymes. Thus, the removal of sialic acids may result in even further mucus degradation by bacteria using different enzymes (Derrien, 2010).
Figure 2. Sialidase reaction mechanism.
Secondly, we studied a specific Endo-β-galactosidase (EBG) from Clostridium perfringens. This enzyme has been shown, in literature, to release saccharide chains from glycans expressed in gastric mucus (Ashida, 2002). Therefore, we assumed it"
TU_Darmstadt,2018,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Upscaling_-_-_TEXT.html," fed-batch cultures. Currently, ε-caprolactone is already produced on an industrial scale in its oligomerized form with a yield of up to 20 g/L, by using the lipase CAL-A [7] .
In addition to strain and cultivation approaches, product extraction is still one of the most challenging issues. We performed analytic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in order to isolate the desired monomers glycolic acid and ε-caprolactone. However, for purification on a large scale, techniques like preparative HPLC need to be used. Possible approaches may also involve coupling of in situ extraction with fermentation.
Just as poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL), PLA and its copolymers PLGA and PLGC are currently industrially produced by companies like Evonik Industries. The reaction vessels are designed to be batch reactors that are emptied after the reaction time. If the conversion of the monomers is close to 100 %, purification is no longer necessary and the melt of the product can be directly transferred into an extruder for following processing.
Therefore, we are full of confidence that the successful implementation of the underlying biological approaches into industrial production is a promising possibility and will act on a large scale as a more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

The pictures from that will be posted to facebook, and a new twitter and flicker will be created for iGEM to broadcast our work. During the summer, we will also have a blog on the iGEM website, spearheaded by Divya and Cara. Divya will also be creating a biography of our work, focusing on our opinions and perceptions of synbio before, during, and after the summer. Everyone is invited to the IGB Fellows, but previous members will be presenting the old E. Chiver poster. Everyone is registered though, so go grab a free lunch and listen to the talk! Cara – Let’s have a get together before finals! The tentative date is reading day. This will probably be our last meeting/get together before dispersing for finals and until May 15th. Agenda What’s our timeline? Proposed timeline: Next Tuesday – advisor’s meeting to present our more specific project proposals. Human practices and entrepreneurship should also prepare presentations. April 22 – presentations to update and further refine proposals. April 24- Advisor’s meeting: Human practices and entrepreneurship give formal presentations to advisors. May 1 – last advisor’s meeting to discuss final plans for the summer and for projects. This is the last meeting before dispersing! (In general, weekly meetings are updating and planning the projects. Advisor’s meetings are for presenting and getting critiques on these project ideas and plans). More specific plans: - Phat project: A solid plan will be developed by the last advisor’s meeting. So this project will lag behind the PUF project slightly. Phat group will physically meet Monday night at the UGL. - Human Practices: We will go ahead with the idea of standardizing the search for biobricks and past iGEM projects. - Entrepreneurship: Progress does depend on what the final project will be. At that point the entrepreneurship advisors will helps us make a decision about what plan of action is best for the entrepreneurship competition. Once the project is known and the option is chosen, the application will be a relatively simple execution. Major project should be made during the summer. - Wiki: Does a separate wiki need to be done for the entrepreneurship competition? The wiki template will be set up, so that during the summer our data will just be slotted in. This minimizes the work done during summer. - PUF"

Next Generation Focus
Isolating DNA from Strawberries
This year, Lambert iGEM continued our partnership with the ""Next Generation Focus"" program (NGF). NGF promotes the importance of education and specifically targets underprivileged children in the community. Through our partnership, Lambert iGEM focuses on providing engaging scientific enrichment activities for children traditionally underrepresented in the STEM fields. By exposing kids to interesting hands-on activities not offered in their classrooms, we present science as more than a series of facts to memorize and strive to spark a lifelong love of science. We spend a few Saturdays per semester at NGF hosting their ""Science Days"" to teach the fundamentals. Kids participate in activities such as cell diagramming, anatomy games, and even chromatography. Many of these young students would not have had the additional enrichment and scientific education without NGF. The high achieving, passionate science students that volunteer and drive this program serve as role models for the kids.
Keep Charlie Moving
Sharing our fundraising efforts
Enjoying our friendship
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disease that affects 1 in 3,600 boys.  We raised $600 for a local charity, “Keep Charlie Moving”, which helps to raise funds for a fellow Lambert student who has this disease.  Because of this donation, he was able to travel to another state and receive treatment from a specialist.  It is our hope that, someday, through techniques of synthetic biology, we will be able to cure genetic diseases.
Operation Christmas Child
Our shopping efforts
Our team also raised money for another local charity, Operation Christmas Child.  We went out and gathered donations to give to a family that we sponsored at Christmas.  In the package of gifts, we included a small educational microscope set - hopefully we will inspire a future scientist!
Lab Hacks:
Lab Hacks are little things we have found to help us as a high school team that doesn't have easy access to many expensive lab materials. They are very small changes to everyday lab procedures that produce just as effective results. Here are some we have used over the years, and we hope they help you as well!

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"8, subsidy-fueled US ethanol production from mexican corn pushed up prices, which in turn led to an increase in prices for staple foods like tortillas of 25%, increasing hunger in Mexico and causing tens of thousands of people to march the streets of Mexico City. Obviously, these solutions, although initially hailed for their potential for carbon neutral bioproduction, are ultimately unsustainable.
Bioeconomy 2.0
There are other ways to use biomass for sustainable production though. Ways in which biomass doesn’t function as the primary source of energy, but as a vehicle to capture and convert the most freely abundant source of energy available: sunlight. Algae and cyanobacteria are organisms that do exactly that. They use photosynthesis fix CO2 as their primary carbon source in order to grow and, if genetically engineered to do so, produce useful products. With oxygen as the only side-product, this sounds like the perfect solution to the problem of CO2-dependent climate change and sustainable bioproduction - a promise that was quickly acted upon by the second wave of bioeconomy startups like Photanol and Algenol. Yet there are still limits, not with regards to the availability of land, but regarding the technology itself. Simply put, production yields for many products, including biofuels, one the most important potential products derived from photosynthetic organisms, are too low to be cost-effective -- by far the most significant obstacle when it comes to widespread production. And although there are several commodity chemicals and products, like fragrances, that can already benefit from the sustainable production capacity of cyanobacteria, there is another, mostly unacknowledged problem that is preventing widespread implementation of photosynthesis-based biorefineries: genetic instability.
Genetic Instability
Microbes have been forged by four billion years of evolutionary pressure to grow and thrive in an extremely wide range of habitats. As any organism, mutations that reduce their fitness are quickly filtered out of a population. In this case, fitness refers to the capacity to grow and divide, which is a direct function of the amount of biomass a microbe can produce per unit of time. Needless to say, channeling valuable resources away from the production of biomass reduces growth, which is exactly what happens when we engineer microbes to produce valuable - in the eyes of the beholder, which is us - products. Often, the engineering of such production processes in cyanobacteria involves the insertion of novel genes and pathways. One can easily imagine how a mutation that would render foreign insertions inactive would increase the growth capacity of the sub-population with such mutations, allowing them to quickly overtake the entire"

What does the abbreviation RING stand for? Where did the HeLa cells come from? These and more science related questions were asked game participants. More than 50 people and 10 teams gathered to compete and show their comprehension not only of life sciences and biotechnology but also of critical thinking and excellence in thought. Mind fight was designed by dedicated science students, representing international synthetic biology competition team - Vilnius iGEM 2016.
Life Sciences Baltics
Life Sciences Baltics 2016 is the only international forum in the Baltic states for world-class biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical devices experts from all around the world. It provides a unique opportunity to explore the new horizons of partnerships, exchange ideas and seek progress through networking. It allows to discover enormous potential and passion in the field of life sciences in Lithuania and the Baltics – the gateway to emerging markets.
Our team made collaboration with the main organizer of this event ‘Enterprise Lithuania’ and was invited to participate. During the conference we presented our project to many people from life-sciences industry, attended meetings with representatives of various companies, made a few collaborations and also raised our knowledge about life sciences industry in Baltic states.
Human practices collaboration with Aachen iGEM team
We have organised a Human Practices collaboration with iGEM Aachen. We tried to find out the opinion and to define the current knowledge of the common public about genetic engineering in Lithuania. Our team managed to question 57 people of different educational background. Results revealed that the majority of people in Vilnius were poorly informed about genetic manipulations.
PKU patients association and summer camp
As we are designing a product meant for a particular public our most important task is to communicate with potential users: ascertain the necessity of our product and adjust it's design to their needs.It was important for us to get in touch with PKU patients in order to better understand how this condition influences their daily lives and the lives of their families. For this reason, we cooperated with association ’Dalia’ - an organisation, which brings together all the PKU patients from Lithuania and several families from Latvia and Estonia. This organisation was established in 2005. We have contacted Dalia Matuliauskiene, the administrator of this organisation, who kindly provided us with all the relevant information on the disease, the patients and the available treatment opportunities. She also explained us all the details about what a low-protein diet consists of and how difficult it might be to follow this regime.

DEMONSTRATE
COPPER BINDING ASSAY
To begin, our team determined the standard copper concentration curve by measuring the average absorbance of various copper concentration solutions, and determined that the standard curve is linear. We can then relate the absorbance to the amount of copper left in solution; therefore, we can determine how efficient the metal binding proteins are, how many ions can be removed, the protein activity, optimal concentration of binding and optimal time of binding.
Figure 4 - Graph of standard copper concentration curve. Measured standard concentrations of copper in solution to provide a frame of reference for future copper binding assay.
Figure 5 - Graph demonstrating the absorbance of the copper solution after CutA (copper binding protein) was introduced as a function of time.Measured absorbance over various time intervals and determined that the optimal time is 60 minutes, and the optimal concentration is 151mg/L.
We added the CutA protein to the copper solutions and left the samples for several time intervals. After the given time intervals, the process of salting out was used to aggregate the remaining proteins in the solution while they remained bound to the copper. Then, following centrifugation, we measured the absorbance of the remaining solution, making sure to minimize capturing protein from the sample.  At approximately an hour the absorbance was lowest in all samples demonstrating that the most copper was bound at that point. The concentration at 151mg/L seems to show the optimal amount of binding over time.  However, our data does not show a significant change in absorbance and therefore there is not a significant change in the amount of copper ions being bound by the protein . This is likely because there was not enough protein being introduced into the reaction during our assay. To validate this idea we created a model demonstrating the binding events in our assay. This model showed that insufficient amounts proteins were indeed the issue and is explained more in depth on the modelling page. (Click here to view modelling page)

The relationship between bacteriophage and bacteria is crucial to the implementation of our project. To demonstrate this relationship and help to improve our mathematical modelling, we completed a phage assay. We used a 96 well plate and filled various wells with a specific amounts of bacteria"

--------------------------------------------------
To Do:
Meeting at 9:30 am.
Make dropout plates and LB media
Buy more microcentrifuge tubes AND sterilize them
Purchase ingredients for yeast transformation if not done already
Acquire access to a roller drum
--------------------------------------------------
Need to make dropout plates as well as dropout media.  The plates will consist of dropout for LEU and URA and also URA and TRP.  This will allow us to select for yeast that have successfully integrated both a transcription factor construct (activator or repressor) and a reporter construct specific to each transcription factor.  We can also do a dropout for TRP, LEU, and URA in preparation for conducting Test #2, if we choose.  Media will have to have the same dropouts as the plates, with the addition of a methionine dropout.  This is so that different amounts of methionine can be added.
The scheme for making all of this is as follows:  Mix 27.26 g dropout media and 2 g histidine in 1 L of distilled water.  Then split this into half, adding 10 g bacto agar and 1 g methionine to one of the halves.  This will become the plates.  Each of these 0.5 L volumes will then be split into halves once more.  To one half of each, we will add 0.5 g tryptophan.  This will serve as the plates (A1) and media (A2) for the activator tests because it makes LEU and URA dropouts.  To the other halves, we will add 1 g leucine.  This will create the plates (B1"

Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Interviews#Policy Ethics Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," in the life sciences and his current research is on the ethics of dual-use research in  synthetic biology. He expressed that conducting good scientific work should be both balanced against and  driven by the concern of public health. Although he believed that the 2010 report by the Presidential  Commission was useful advice, he thought that certain ideas, such as periodic reassessment and prudent  stewardship, were not clear. Additionally, due to the structure of the Presidential Commission and their  relative lack of enforcing power, none of the recommendations were carried out. When asked about the  ideal system for enforcement of synthetic biology regulations, Dr. Evans preferred an international  organization funded by the government. This organization would be independent, serving the states, and  able to hire scientific experts to review technology. His recommendation is a standing body that has the  sole role of reviewing and regulating technology rather than a committee that meets to discuss a topic once  and generate recommendations based on a specific time point. Additionally, he believes that this type of  review can alter the behavior of scientists, who, currently, are not incentivized or paid to look at the larger  impacts of their research. The regulation of technology that may not fully be understood, in his opinion,  warrants policy that is responsive without being too particular: in other words, it must work decently in  most situations rather than excellently in only one situation. He believes that there should be an  international biocontainment standard of success that allows implementation of synthetic organisms into  the environment, because diseases and ill consequences aren’t restricted to borders. These insights truly  helped to shape our approach to generating the policy proposal .
Dr. Evans discussed the ethical concerns of biocontainment with us as well. The ideal system, in  his perspective, should be cheap, effective, and easy for labs in all countries to use. In his words, it is worse  to tell people that a faulty system works than it is to provide no system or be transparent about weaknesses.  Additionally, he spoke about the importance of considering vulnerable populations in implementation of  synthetic biology. Dr. Evans inspired and was the primary source for the “Ethics” page in our pamphlet .
With regards to our project, Dr. Evans prompted us to consider the consequences if our system  was hacked, how likely it would be for our system to be hacked, and the potentials for dual use. However,  he admitted that the potential for dual use of our project is not great. He also expressed that there was a  large market for an inexpensive reliable biocontainment method in the implementation of synthetic biology  products.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated human practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset by the additional correct diagnoses. Everyone with a positive test result would have a CT scan anyway to confirm the presence of their cancer.
The major drawback to a low specificity is the psychological impact of a patient being told they have cancer when in fact they do not. Again, through using multiple miRNA signatures in tandem - i.e. the levels of different miRNAs related to a single disease, and calculating a weighted score involving all of them, so that an abnormal level of just one miRNA does not necessarily lead to a false positive.
We can also alleviate the problem of false positives by ensuring doctors tell patients that the results our sensor provides just indicate the need for further testing, and are not a diagnosis.
Dr Desai also advised that the result from our test could be combined with a score from patient history to quantify their risk (e.g. Tammegami et al.’s probability score). This total score would then be used to increase accuracy of the test.
NICE Criteria for screening tools
To incorporate the feedback from doctors into the applications of our project, we have explained how our sensor meets (or would be applied so that it meets) the NICE criteria for a screening tool.
NICE Criteria
Our Sensor
The condition being screened should be a serious health problem in terms of frequency and/or severity
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2012. In the UK in 2014, there were 46,403 new cases and 35,895 deaths. [4] 80-85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC. [5]
The epidemiology, natural history and development of the condition from latent to declared states should be understood and/or there should be robust evidence about the association between the marker and the disease
Much is known about NSCLC, and although there are still a lot of research going into understanding cancer characteristics. The same is true for most other cancers. Although miRNAs are still being characterized, Hennessey et al. demonstrated a potential link between miR-15b and miR-27b to NSCLC. However, validation is still required with a large patient cohort for clinical use. Expert Dan Pregibon anticipates that the use of miRNAs as biomarkers is not far off.
All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable
Smoking cessation is the most effective"

The Turk beekeepers seem to be more affected on an economical level than French beekeepers, but they are unanimous on the fact that the preventive measures they can use are of a limited efficiency and that even the chemical treatments are sometimes not sufficient to eradicate the parasite.
It is clear from this survey in both countries that beekepers are in deep need of a solution that is more ecological and respectful of the bees.
TU Eindhoven team - Cloning guide
To help out future iGEM teams, the Eindhoven team decided to create a cloning guide where each current technique would be explained by an iGEM team. We chose to deal with the In-Fusion cloning technique because one of us, Alexandre, used this technique several times during a previous internship. Moreover, we used this technique to clone together genes used to express the light sensor for the circadian cycle.
You can find this cloning guide here, with our part at page 38:
Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.

P: That sounds legendary! I’ll hold the worldwide press conference as soon as possible!
Section 3: (on the press conference)
P: My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by task before us, the termite disaster. Thank God! Now ZJU-CHINA iGEM 2015 has created one such technique to curb the spread of these insect pests. Termite, known for its damage to buildings and other wooden structures, now comes its flourishing age. No valid modes have been found to automatically, efficiently and specifically kill this universal insect. But today, the task can be perfectly solved by TERMITES’ TERMINATOR!
That is how the Terminator to save the world. And, it is just a beginning…
Section 4:
Aiming at controlling and eliminating pests, ZJU-China’s TERMITES’ TERMINATOR uses modified bacterium to produce insecticide. In order to attract termites successfully, deliver the packed and carried by chemical agents. This novel way of insecticide delivery create an eco-friendly model to eliminate pests and can be directly applied to other pest control projects.
As our purpose is to control termites which do great harm to people’ houses, we can bring the result of the project into production. The business outlook is considerably broad because our project is environmentally friendly and closely associated with people’s daily life. Those who have suffered from termite invasion might accept the product easily for the dramatic insecticidal effect and non-ecological influence.
We take advantage of synthetic biology to improve the drug production, cut the industrial cost of the drug and even save the purification process, which will make it more convenient for utilization of the drugs. We offer not only a whole system for killing pests, but also a referable model that uses nano size chemicals to pack bacteria for biomedicine, food manufacturing and cosmetic industry.
Will the Termite Terminator finally win the war? For the ending, please focus on IGEM 2015 Jamboree! Thanks for your listening of tonight’s story. See you next time!
Gene machine and engineering are changing our life in a significant and better way. However, these modified things, from the subtle to the gigantic, can never hide their abruptness and artificiality in front of our mother nature.

Si l’on crée des systèmes biologiques comme l’on assemble des legos, ne risque-t-on pas de considérer tous les êtres vivants, dont les humains, comme de simples assemblages de ces pièces ? Et dans ce cas, le respect que l’on considère leur devoir pourrait en être altéré. Certes, on peut considérer que nos créations ne sont que des engins biologiques, des machines synthétiques bien distinctes des formes de vie « naturelles ».

Il faut cependant nuancer l’impact que la synthèse biologique pourrait avoir sur la façon avec laquelle on considère la vie : comme l’a rappelé François Le Fèvre, lorsque « l’on a synthétisé l’urée, première molécule organique synthétique, il y avait tout un débat pour savoir si on avait créé de la vie ou pas »; et, comme l’a souligné Lluis Mir, on aurait pu se poser les mêmes questions aux débuts de la chimie.

Testing the LabSurfing Platform
They asked us to test their “LabSurfing” platform. It is a social network for iGEMers, which allows the iGEM community to keep in touch and to ask for an available free “couch” when travelling around the world. We tested their platform both as a team and as individual users. We went through the test cases, including the creation of a profile and searching for other users in the different places of interest. We gave our feedback on the software, sharing opinions and suggestions with the TU_Darmstadt iGEM team.
Thanks guys for the visit, it was a pleasure to help you to testing your software... See you in Boston!

The building is named after the                     Swedish physicist Anders Ångström and is located a short distance from the                     centre of the university. The location as well as the placement on solid ground                     is to minimize disruption of the measurements. We learned a lot about the                     function and the applications of electron microscopy, but also how difficult it                     can be to receive trust-worthy data from measurements we use daily.

And sometimes we may not only want to regulate their maximal killing ability, but also want to regulate their killing ability in real time. (You can imagine that in a war, warrior II accumulate strength at a very fast speed and kill warrior I immediately, though their maximal strength is same. And what you want to do here is actually equivalent to regulate their speed of accumulating strength.)
Therefore, how could we do? Intuitively, we may think that if warrior II express less LuxI so that 3OC6HSL accumulate slower, so the speed of accumulating strength is slower. These hypothesis can both be demonstrated by our model.
3. Decrease the expression rate of LuxI inside warrior 2
(Figure 5: RFP level inside warrior I and warrior II beta(1AHL1 )=6e4,beta_const1=6)
By doing this, we can regulate the accumulating strength speed of warrior successfully! In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the constant promoter or RBS of LuxI in warrior II.
In conclusion, the core is that we can regulate the maximal killing ability by regulating amount of LacI (In this model, RFP) and regulate the speed of accumulating strength by regulating amount of AHL-production enzyme inside cell. All these can be regulated by change the promoter/RBS of the protein or adding LVA tag after the protein experimentally.
According to the results obtained from our model, it is clear what we should do in the experiment to achieve the goal.

On the third day after issuing the magazine, we selected randomly 50 readers and we let them do a questionnaire of which the title is “Knowing and Approving Degree Questionnaire of Synthetic Biology and iGEM”. We planned to keep in touch with them continuously and talked with them. After finishing reading the whole articles we issued, we would ask them to do the same questionnaire again to test the effect of our promotion.
Our team leader, Zhang Junjie and our head of HP, Wang Zhizheng went to Wuhan to participate in the Central China iGEMers’ Meet-up held by HZAU iGEM team. This meeting attracts 16 teams from 17 different universities in total. Two days’meeting seems very short, and we all missed everyone so much. Two seniors coming from Peking University and Ocean University of China made two helpful and fantastic reports for us. And then each team make a presentation to show their project. We all learned, discussed and communicated a lot together.
What’s more, we made good friends with many iGEMers such as WHU, OUC, HZAU,LZU and so on. After meeting, we also visited HAZU team’s lab, the beautiful scenery of their campus and city, meanwhile we tasted many kinds of local delicious foods. What made us moved deeply was that we all gathered together in Wuhan for one dream, for better iGEM project. The experience was very precious and unforgettable to us!
On this day, we were honored to be invited to BGI to visit their synthetic biology labs. We met their head of synthetic biology department, Gong Jianhui. He showed us around the whole labs and other biology departments. We introduced our idea and project to him ,and he gave us many helpful suggestions. He also introduced what his labs did now, and how they promote their idea and products of synthetic biology.
We invited the same professors as those on Jun. 16th  to our meeting room. We repeated our project and the recent achievements to us. And then let them fill in the same approving degree questionnaire. We received more suggestions and more approval.

Gathering of iGEM teams in JAPAN
This year, 11 teams from Japan are participating the iGEM competition:Biwako_Nagahama, Osaka, Kyoto, Tokyo_Tech, UT-Tokyo, Chiba, KIT-Kyoto, TMU-Tokyo, HokkaidoU_Japan, KAIT_Kapan, Tokyo-NoKoGen. Since we have many teams within the country, it is a pity we do not use this opportunity to get together and have a discussion on each other's project and if possible, make collaboration to make an even better project! So this year, we participated at a festival in May held at Tokyo University and an event in August held at Tokyo Metropolitan University.
日本から今年、11のチームがiGEMに参加しています：Biwako_Nagahama, Osaka, Kyoto, Tokyo_Tech, UT-Tokyo, Chiba, KIT-Kyoto, TMU-Tokyo, HokkaidoU_Japan, KAIT_Kapan, Tokyo-NoKoGenです。こんなに多くのチームが日本国内にいるのに、集まらないでいるのはとてももったいないことです。私達は今年も、５月には東京大学の五月祭でポスター発表を、8月には東京首都大学で開催された交流会に参加しました。その時の様子を写真でお見せします。
Helping our friend Sumbawagen on their wiki
Dr. Arief Budi Witarto  Julmansyah, the team instructor of Sumbawagen 2013 team, has been our good friend working in the same laboratory for many years. He is a very gentl and kind man, who we enjoyed working with. This year, he went back to his homeland"

Imperial iGEM team on Oct 14, 2016
We helped Imperial's 2016 iGEM team from British with the searching for optimal growth conditions for microbial monocultures to provide an effective start-point to co-cultures. After handing in our absorbance results of E.coli growth curve, we received their bright and satisfied smiles of Imperial's iGEMers.
Protocol:
Grow cells in a shaking incubator with 225 rpm for 12 hours in 4 liter of LB medium.
Do a 1 / 100 dilution of cells into fresh media.
Add 200 μl into each well of 96 well plate with triplicate of each condition.
Incubate the plate at 37°C over 12 hr, taking an absorbance reading every 15 min.
Shake the plate reader before every absorbance measurement with reading temperature at 27°C

Virginia iGEM team on Oct 6, 2016
We have interacted with Virginia iGEM team from America through Skype. We first helped them to fill in their questionnaire, and they gave us a badge as gratitude for assistance. After that, we contacted them to invite them to share each other's project. Their project is to build up a genetically-modified E.coli that will only survive in cultivation with Leusine. As a result, they worked on the system that hinders bio contamination from happening. We thought that's a really creative idea and probably a useful approach for microbial experiment. They even mentioned it is Jurassic World that occurs to them this concept. On the other hand, Virginia iGEM team can comprehensively listened to our Leijuvant project with Leishmania of its actual advantage, T cell stimulation. To sum up, we had fun communicating with Virginia iGEM team!
EPFL iGEM team on Aug 22, 2016
We had a good conversation with EPFL iGEM team in Switzerland. And they said if Leishmania immume system is proven by scientists and doctors, they are willing to use our ""Lejuvant"" to protect themselves from infection. And we turned out the targets of their reports in their Wiki page, they asked us few questions like ""Can you describe your project in 30 seconds?"" Or ""What is the first thing that pops into your mind when we talk about iGEM?"" and what we answered can be seen at http://igem.today/2016/08/31/cgu-on-vaccines-alternative-with-the-help-of-leishmania/

Characterization
pucB/A
pucB/A are the genes that code for the beta and alpha subunits of the light harvesting complex LH2.  Here, we measured the expression level of pucB/A from the puc promoter in the genome vs. on a low copy plasmid, pRKCBC3.  This data allows us to utilize pucB/A as a reporter gene for expression from promoters, in complement to its role in cellular growth.
Method
Relative LH2 expression in R. sphaeroides 2.4.1, R. sphaeroides DBCΩ and R. sphaeroides DBCΩ pRKCBC3 grown anaerobically in the dark

Customizing Silk
Background
Spider silk is an exceptional natural material.  It exhibits remarkable strength and has the potential to be a very useful medium for a variety of applications. The properties of spider silk come primarily from the structure and amino acid sequence of the silk protein. One spider silk protein is comprised of repetitive units, referred to as monomers.  Repeats of identical monomers make up one spider silk protein, and these proteins come together to form a silk fiber.  The monomer is therefore the basic unit of the silk polypeptide, and changing the sequence alters the physical properties of the spider silk. [1]
Fig 1: This image illustrates the amino acid motifs that compose various spider silk monomers.  Different types of silk protein contain different motifs.  These motifs define the physical characteristics of each monomer and the overall silk protein. [6]
In fact, the sequence of the spider silk monomer differs slightly from species to species. Therefore, silk produced by different species have different physical properties.  Some monomer sequences result in silks with greater strength, while other sequences result in silks with greater flexibility.  Furthermore, individual spiders can produce multiple types of silk such as dragline and flagelliform silk, each with very different properties. [2]
Much research has been done on the production of spider silk from recombinant bacteria. [3] We want to build on this work and take it a step further.  Using the wide range of spider silk monomers as our building blocks, we want to be able to create hybrid silk proteins with specified physical properties.  By mixing and matching these different monomer sequences within one polypeptide, we hope to be able to fine tune the properties of our produced silk.  If this system could be standardized, it could be exceedingly useful for quickly producing silk to fit different a variety of different needs and purposes.
Project Goals
For our project, we have chosen to start out with two different silk monomers, Major Ampullate Spidroin 1 (MaSp1) and 2 (MaSp2). "

Sequence Verification from plasmid
For verification of insertion of lacZ gRNA into pACYCdxCas9Tn5, primers IV003 and IV004 were used for sequencing. Only plasmid isolates from colony 1 and 2 were sent for sequencing. The sequencing starts from the homology flanks, in the direction of the lacZ gRNA. The 10µL sequencing sample was prepared in a 1.5 mL tube as follows:
Component
Volume (uL)
Final concentration
Plasmid DNA (500ng)

Within 7 days, the sequence was retrievable online and alignment with the in silico designed molecule showed 100% match of the 1050 bp downstream of the sequencing primer binding site. This was only the case for the plasmid isolate from colony 1. This means the pACYC-dxCas9-LinkerTn5-lacZgRNA construct is sequence verified.

Looking at public engagement is important because it is the process that brings people from different backgrounds to address and attempt to solve big issues and to bring about social change. Public engagement is important because it lets us know how much people are interested in the exhibit and if they are willing to take action or think more about social issues. For this project, we hope that users can become more interested in synthetic biology and realize the various benefits and flexibility of the field rather than viewing it as a dangerous or unethical field. We also hope that after interacting with the exhibit, users can realize the importance of creativity and tinkering when it comes to solve big problems such as sustaining life on Mars or the Deep Sea. With this exhibit, we also hope that users can understand that inventions or bio-design does not happen in a day. We convey this through the wet lab, which conveys a sense of scale, time, and the reality of syn-bio.
Perception Issues
Our project aims to break away from the misconceptions that many people have about synthetic biology and its practices. Many members of the general public have misinformed opinions about what synthetic biology entails, and the exhibit was designed with that in mind. We chose to work in extreme environments (Mars, Antarctica, and the Deep Sea) precisely because they offer an uncharted territory that does not carry the negative connotations of modifying features of everyday life. All three of these environments offer exciting new challenges to conquer and explore, and help present synthetic biology in a positive light because of that.
Visitors of the museum can approach the exhibit without any preconceived notions, and interact with it in a game-like manner. This allows us to introduce key concepts of biotinkering and biodesign in a playful way.

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Recommendations_-_-_TEXT.html," sample, time was lacking to optimize each method. The sonication protocol, although time consuming, seemed most reliable in our experiments. Still, this method is not optimal, as samples lysed with lysis buffer show a lot higher raw luciferase output, although it is not known what the total protein content of these samples is.
Temperature sensitivity - Results with sonication
Using sonication of our samples, we obtained our most reliable results. These indicated, as displayed here , that our strain K115035 shows the temperature induced switch-like behavior which was the aim of our project.
Color Pathway
It proved to be too much work to PCR 15 genes out of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in addition to making the temperature sensitive input system work (with only 2 wetlab guys). It was a good choice to split the project into two paths, as advised at the teachers workshop in Paris, as this allowed us to choose for the most promising path, should one of them not work out as expected. When it became obvious the actual color producing genes we aimed to get from the registry were of low quality (bad sequencing or did not grow at all) we gave priority to the temperature sensitive input system. In the end we did make some progress towards constructing our envisioned color pathway by PCR-ing three of the genes out of E. coli, which have been sent to the registry and to a sequencing company.
Modeling
Future work
In this project we worked towards a biothermometer, existing out of an RNA thermometer and a coupled pathway to produce color molecules. To measure the functioning of an RNA thermometer in general we used luciferase assays. In the end this provided us with unexpected problems as the lysis buffer provided with the luciferase assay kit interfered with our protein content measurements. Other lysis methods destroyed luciferase activity.
Continuing this part of the project we would suggest using a different enzyme. This would have to be a non Escherichia coli enzyme which is easily measured, preferably in whole cells. It is tempting to use the general protein expression indicator GFP for this analysis, but this is not reliably quantifiable. Quantification is very likely to be important for these thermometer RNAs, as expression as a function of temperature will likely be a sigmoid curve. These type of thermometers have been shown to function in previous research [1] [2] [3] and we are convinced that they can work in a biobrick environment as well. If the temperature dependent expression curves are not like an on-off switch, other systems in the registry such as"

This week, the incubator box was completed.  The fabrication and electrical groups came together to begin combining and testing.  Initial tests with the temperature sensor yielded very positive results.  We were able to successfully set and reach a target temperature with our sensor/feedback system.  Unfortunately, our humidity sensor malfunctioned while we were running tests, however, we were still able to gather some data.  Initial humidity tests indicate that our misting apparatus is able to produce a 12% increase in humidity over a time span of 8 minutes.  Using a hotter water supply, as well as allowing the misting apparatus to run for longer would certainly allow us to increase humidity even more.

We miniprepped the pC13AI cultures. We amplified with primers 45-52 and primers 48-51 and ran a gel (expected size at 1.5kb). Nothing appeared on the gel, not even the ladder. The EtBr should be replaced. There were too many transformants for pC13BV in the BL21 strain, so those cells were restreaked onto a new plate. Additionally, we transformed pC13BC into BL21 as well, and characterize that part as well.
The gel of pC13AI showed nothing - the EtBr (for gel staining) needs to be replaced. We also continued putting our T7+resistances constructs into E. coli for part characterization.

The sequencing of pC13CO came back as PtrpC + GFP. We are not sure why or how. We either miniprepped the wrong thing or put the wrong thing into sequencing. We continued to take measurements for growth assays. We put a lot of Aspergillus around the inoculating discs for gathering more data. We set up cultures of BL21, with no plasmid and with pC13BC and pC13BV, and then standardized the optical densities of the cells between the three cultures. We spread 50 μL aliquots onto LB, adding discs dipped in 10X, 1X, and 0X concentrations of geneticin and hygromycin.

NYC_Wetware,2011,Team:NYC Wetware#Tools#Bioremediation_-_-_TEXT.html," Pseudomonas putida, have been successfully created. These D. rad strains have been used to oxidize toluene, which is then metabolized and eventually forms insoluble polymers. These insoluble polymers precipitate out of and can then be easily removed from the waste solution.
Heavy metal remediation is used in the clean up of radioactive metals such as mercury, chromium and uranium. One way to achieve heavy metal remediation is to insert an enzyme into D. rad, giving D. rad the ability to reduce and diminish the toxicity of a particular metal. (merA), which coverts mercury to a less volatile and dangerous oxidation state, has been expressed in D. rad and used in such applications. PhoN, a nonspecific acid phospatase, has also been expressed in D. rad and has been used to precipitate radioactive uranium at nuclear weapon production sites1.
Recognizing D. rad as the greatest terrestrial organism for resistance to environmental stressors, our NYC iGEM team is looking to identify and add to the knowledge of key stress-resistance genes in D. rad. Ultimately, our goal is to create a bacteria with the capacity to withstand the harsh environment of Mars, enabling terraforming in order to sustain future human colonization.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," minimal but strong psicose inducible promoter [4]. With the help of databases and literature, we identified a 20 bp consensus sequence on which PsiR binds and replaced the LacO site of pTacI by the consensus sequence, hence creating a new promoter: pPsiTacI ( BBa_K2448016 ).
We also designed pPsiTac2 ( BBa_K2448050 ) which differs from pPsiTacI by having also a second binding site for PsiR upstream the -35 box. This year, Team Newcastle developed an innovative biosensor screening platform, Sensynova. Their system is aimed at characterizing biosensor-based screening systems and generating variants of reporter genes, promoters and sensitivity tuning. To test their platform, they needed to be provided with a functional biosensor based screening system. Therefore, we sent them this promoter along with all the data on our biosensor ( See details on our Collaboration page ).
Universal Biosensing Chassis
Since these Helix-Turn-Helix transcription factors and promoters were only predicted, we had to build the construct to test their behavior.  We talked about our plans with Dr. Fournier, from Sanofi-Aventis, during an interview. He advised us to standardize our building process and screening system with Golden Gate assembly [5]. This particular technique allows fast, efficient and reliable gene assembly, perfect for a high throughput process, to handle multiple cloning of multiple parts in a few steps.
Using Dr Fournier’s suggestions, and in order to speed up the assembly of all our biosensors, we designed the Universal Biosensing Chassis (UBC) [6] ( BBa_K2448023 or BBa_K2448024 ). This construct  aims to provide an answer to the lack of rapid and reliable building methods for transcription-factor based biosensors. Using this chassis, one will only need a suitable transcription factor, able to bind to the molecule of interest, and its related promoter. By its design (Figure 1), the UBC allows fast cloning: depending on what is to be inserted into the UBC and one’s mastery of the Golden Gate Assembly, a functional biosensor can be obtained in less than a week (for more information, see Our Best Composite Part page ).
Figure 1. Schematic design of the UBC.

Positive controls:
In our hardware, additional room was made for cuvettes containing purified protein controls. The software takes advantage of this by addressing that cuvette, labeling it as “positive” (red), and compares the other cuvettes, containing urine samples and the nitrocefin and inhibitor compounds, to that. By adjusting the protein concentration, the amplitude of the signal created by the purified protein can mimic that created by ESBL-producing bacteria. As a negative control, an additional slot is set out for urine, nitrocefin and inhibitors without any resistant bacteria or protein. In this way, we have created a harmless, but effective way of telling PhoneLab what a positive result looks like, and integrated it into our design.
Future aspects:
If we were to further advance our project, the imminent steps to be taken would be to realize our CRISPR/Cas9 system, optimize the set-up with clinically isolated ESBL-samples and purifying class B and C ESBL-proteins.
Silver
Our project has had several issues that we have had to consider, some of which were:
- Patient confidentiality and availability of our product to the general public
- Optimization of our assay to achieve a clinically relevant detection range
- Proving that our set-up safely tests for ESBL-producing bacteria
- Creating and testing positive controls for PhoneLab that do not involve actual dangerous pathogens
- Addressing antibiotic resistance potential on a genetic level in addition to phenotypic resistance
All of the above problems have been points of thought and investigation to us. Even though there was not enough time to come up with working solutions for all of them, several of them have been addressed, some of them even borderline solved and integrated into our final design. For the investigation part of said issues, see below. For integrative design of solved problems, see “Gold”.
Patient confidentiality:
Along with the birth of our idea, to create a product that would have access to peoples personal devices, and inform them as to whether resistant bacteria are present in them or not, came the realization that the eventual generation and storage of data would have to operate on a high level of security. To investigate this, we brainstormed around the issue, and reached out to Gissle Hannemyr, an expert"

Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also plan to show the topological structure of reactions in network. By connecting species with reactions, users can get a clear picture of the interconnections between species.
User-friendly input with fun
Powered by MoDeL, iGaME has already relieved users from inputting massive amount of data. However, we are still looking forward to make the input process more fun. Besides providing a graphical scene, we are planning to have more elements like story telling and character selecting. Moreover, result grading and multi-user interacting are to be added to make our software a real game.
Database Development Kit
Though we have presented the detail document of RFC 55 for MoDeL, modelers may still found it a tough job to construct a usable database. The Database Development Kit aims at aiding modelers with easy-to-use development tools. To achieve this, graphical tools for creating, removing, modifying data in database are needed. Parameter estimation tools and MoDeL syntax checking tools are also wanted. We are planning to have this kit in our future version, which will greatly reduce the difficulties for users to construct their own databases.
We believe the future of iGaME is bright !

BBa_F2620
Part:BBa_F2620 had been fully characterized with data in partsregistry BBa_F2620 page. It is a composite biobrick with three individual biobricks: pTetR (R0040), LuxR（C0062) and lux pR. Without AHL, transcriptional level of lux pR is extremal low because of lack of activator, LuxR-AHL dimer. If we add AHL into the system within a very short time, expression of mature GFP is expected to increase significantly. To measure behaviors of the system consisting of BBa_F2620 using our software tool, we construct a system using plasmid pSB3C5 and Part:BBa_F2620 as well as a reporter gene:
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate transfer function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :

Gram stain:
The bacterial smear was flooded with Crystal Violet for one minute before it was rinsed with distilled water.   It was then flooded with Lugol's Iodine for one minute before being rinsed again.  The smear was then decolourized using alternating applications of 95% ethanol for ten second and then distilled water until the water running off of the slide runs clear.  The smear was then counter-stained with Safrinin for one minute before one last rinse  with distilled water, and being blotted with Kim-wipes to dry the slide.
These stains were performed for each plate, after which it was evident from the naked eye that the smears with E. coli were pink, and the smears with B. subtilis were dark purple.  In order to analyze the smears  further they were analyzed under a high-tech photo-microscope, for this cover slips were placed on the smears to protect both the bacterial smears and the microscope.

Figure 7: E. coli Gram stain of regenerated spores.
Spore stain:
Two bacterial smears were performed for the B. subtilis spores, before the stains were done.  To collect  the spores for the smear the suspended spores were centrifuged for two minutes at 14,000 rpm, so that the spores  could be collected from the pellet.  After the bacteria were fixed on to the slide and the smear was dried, the  slides were placed onto a hot plate, at 150 °C, for the Malachite Green staining.  A piece of paper  towel was placed over the smear so that it could be completely flooded and steamed with Malachite Green for five  minutes.  The smear was continuously damped with the stain for the entire five minutes.  After the five minutes  and the paper towel was removed the smear was rinsed with distilled water.  The smear was then counter-stained with Safrinin for one minute before the final rinse and drying.  The stain was visualized in the photo-microscope and a photo was taken using a mobile device as the microscope itself could not take coloured photos which were necessary to show the spores as green and the cells as not green.

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," aimed to improve what Harvard did twelve years ago and push the utilization of circadian to a new level.
Figure 1. The schematic illustration of KaiABC system.
Abstract
Having considered the situation mentioned above, we turn our attention to the circadian rhythm system within the prokaryotic system. Finally, we choosed the Kai protein system as our project.
KaiABC system is the circadian system in Cyanobacteria. Oscillations are controlled by phosphorylation of the KaiC protein, which is modulated by the KaiA and KaiiB proteins. In 2015, Professor Silver of Harvard University first transplanted the circadian oscillators, KaiABC system and associated protein into noncircadian bacterium Escherichia. coli and successfully constructed a circadian rhythm. Realizing the potential application prosects of KaiABC system, we modified their design: we added RpaA, CikA and SasA into the genetic circuits. We aim to use such three proteins to connect the KaiC's oscillators with an output signal, which is supposed to be a 24-hour rhythmic fluorescence.
Figure 2. Timekeeping, entrainment and output signaling functions are highlighted within the oscillatory cycle of the cyanobacterial clock (imitate Swan J A, et al [1]).
Powered by ATPase activity of its CI domain, KaiC cycles through a series of phosphorylation states, which are interdependent on its quaternary structure. KaiA is bound to the CII domain of KaiC during the day and stimulates phosphorylation. This process is sensitive to the ATP/ADP ratio, which peaks at midday, providing an entrainment cue. At night, levels of oxidized quinones will rise in the cell, which entrains the clock as well. Around this time, KaiC reaches the pS/pT state, and SasA binds to the CI domain to activate RpaA. CI-bounding SasA is eventually competed away by KaiB. Binding of KaiB is slowed by its intrinsically unfavorable equilibrium that sequesters it in inactive states. Accumulation of KaiB in its KaiC-bound form recruits and inactivates KaiA. CikA also interacts with the fold-switched form of KaiB, which dephosphorylates RpaA and then inactivate it. [1]

The concern brought up with Mr.Kennedy, in his interview, regarded how the public would react to a new technology focused on creating single nucleotide base changes. He answered by saying that “fear of the unknown is something we cannot change.” Through our discussion with Zach we came to the conclusion that the only way to ensure that the public will accept our research as a viable treatment option is to educate them, not only about our system but about biology concepts in general.
Jonathan Gootenberg, Graduate Student at Harvard University
The interview with Mr.Gootenberg helped address our concerns regarding the importance of public understanding of biological principles in relation to our research. Together, the team and Mr.Gootenberg came up a simpler way to explain DNA and RNA to the public. We decided to tell people that DNA is like a blueprint for your body. Everything that has ever or will ever happen to your body is coded in your DNA just like everything that will happen to a construction site is written somewhere in the blueprint. From these blueprints come the formation of action plans. Action plans are the hour to hour plans of what should be happening based on what has previously happened. These can change due to unforeseen bumps in the road without changing the blueprint for the site. RNA is just like these action plans, it can be changed without altering the DNA. BY explaining the concept of DNA and RNA to people in this way we can help them better understand that the risks associated with our system editing RNA are not as big as the risks associated with systems that edit DNA.
Omar Abudayyeh, MIT Class of 2016
The importance of educating the community about biological concepts was also discussed with Omar Abudayyeh. He stressed the importance of educating both children and adults since biology has not been a part of the common core a long time. We achieved this goal of public education through participation in WPI’s TouchTomorrow and Women in Science camp!

Current Treatments
Generally the first step to treating a C. difficile infection is to stop taking the antibiotic that may have disrupted the gut microbiota initially, allowing C. difficile to colonise [6]. Another set of antibiotics more specific to C. difficile infections are then administered dependent on the severity of infection. The most common antibiotics used are: vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole.     A major repercussion of using antibiotics to treat C. difficile infections is the risk of further damaging other commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract provoking even more dysbiosis. This chain reaction can allow C. difficile to gain a stronger footing in the gut. Another undesirable outcome is the likelihood of antibiotic resistance being developed. For example, the antibiotic vancomycin is frequently prescribed to treat C. difficile. This antibiotic is a last resort antibiotic against many multidrug resistant pathogens, meaning its use increases the likelihood of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance to it, endangering our ability to treat other bacterial infections with this antibiotic [7].       Antibiotics are also not very suitable long term treatments against C. difficile infections as 1 in 5 patients experience recurrence of infection [8]. This could further promote the likelihood of C. difficile developing antibiotic resistance. The costs of treating C. difficile are also a burden to the economy, and it is estimated a total of 34,157  US dollars are spent on attributable C. difficile costs per case [3]. As such antibiotic treatment of C. difficile is not a viable long term solution.
Alternative Treatments
Fortunately, alternative treatments already exist, some of which are being employed and are showing efficacious results. Potential remedies can range from Faecal Microbial Transplants (FMT), to pro and prebiotics. In fact, it has been shown that FMT has at least 80% success rate for treating C. difficile infections. [9] However, there are drawbacks to these treatments. For example, due to the complexity of a person’s gut microbiota, exchanging faecal matter between hosts can have unwanted long term impacts on metabolism and other aspects of a patient’s physiology that are not yet well understood [10].
Probiotic and prebiotic treatments as a preventative measure against opportunistic pathogens like C. difficile, are also promising avenues. In 2017 a cost effectiveness study was carried out by Shen et al. to determine whether hospital patients receiving antibiotic treatment should take probiotics as a preventative measure against C. difficile infections. This study provided evidence of prob"
