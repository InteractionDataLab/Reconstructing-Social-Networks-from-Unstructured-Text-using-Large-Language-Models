Abstract: Melbourne 2008 team seeked to build a biological clock that can count up when  it is ""ticked"" by input light pulse signals. As the signal ""ticks"" the clock, the clock changes color and observer can use the color or combination of colors to tell what ""time"" it is. Their team built a linear clock which can be used to keep track on what metabolites are present and what are being produced in the biological system.
In their construct, ribolock 1(CR) prevents translation of gene Y and in the presence of ribokey1(TA), gene Y is translated to activate transcription of another ribokey2(TA) which can open up the loop of another ribolock2(CR). Although they claimed to design and construct some of the parts including key3C and lock3d, no characterisation result was found regarding these CR and TA.

Abstract: Peking 2007 project concerned with the ability for bacterial cells to differentiate out in homogeneous conditions. They aimed to build devices conferring host cells with the ability to form cooperating groups spontaneously and to take consecutive steps sequentially even when the genetic background and environmental inputs are identical . In order to achieve this,  they needed two devices responsible for temporal and spatial differentiation.
To meet the need of spatial differentiation in an assembly line, the system of hop-count conjugation for cell-cell communication was developed in E. coli.  The signals transferred are represented by DNA sequence, and record the times of transfer by losing tandem region at every conjugation event. To construct this system, tandem oriT pairs are inserted into signaling plasmid, and relaxase responsible for initiating conjugation events are removed from natural conjugation system and (attaching a terminator) inserted between these oriT pairs. At each single conjugation event, with the expression relaxase, the corresponding tandem oriT pair is lost with the"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". Furthermore, the government is faced with the problem of antibiotic resistance. Charged with the responsibility of finding a solution, the government would most likely welcome our alternative treatment of wound infections. Lastly, the treatment of infected wounds is an extremely expensive business due to repetitive, costly treatments. Since our patch would speed up wound healing and reduces costs, it would be beneficial for the government.
Manufacturers
For manufacturers different topics are relevant. To guarantee the safe production of the wound healing patch, it has to meet the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) every therapeutic has to meet: precise description of production from raw material to fully functional patch. This will establish a safe production process. However, an efficient production process is just as meaningful for manufacturers. The volume in which gel is produced, is scalable and the catalyst used for the gel production is reusable. This is all documented on the safe-by-design page. Unfortunately, in upscaled production, gels are more prone to errors. Testing the gels on the demanded properties is the manufacturers responsibility, but this should be straightforward. Besides being more prone to errors, our gel is not recyclable to make new gels, but the gels can however be stored efficiently using freeze-drying.
Environment
Low toxicity is of interest to the environment as well as to other stakeholders. The same applies to the prevention of bacterial escape from the gel. To reduce survival rates of potentially escaped bacteria, we use a kill switch. As explained under safe-by-design , this means that survival outside of the gel is not possible for our bacteria. Moreover, our bacteria can easily be killed using regular antibiotics. To conclude, Gelcatraz should not pose significant threats to the environments when it is used responsibly.

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," a problem in countries with poor sanitation. The bacteria will consequently be given safety features to prevent them from entering the environment. They will have auxotrophies, an environmental kill switch and a network of toxin-antitoxin systems to avoid bacteria or modified genes from leaving the gut.
Another issue is patients wishing to end their treatment. With all medical treatments, there is a risk of adverse side effects or unforeseen complications. The capacity to stop treatment at any point is preferred for any new technology. A reduction in the ability to reverse or stop treatment is one of the reasons why genetic engineering is distrusted as a treatment. We have accordingly designed an inducible kill switch which will provide the patient with the ability to selectively kill the GM probiotics at any point, and leaving the rest of microbiome intact.
Beneficence
Beneficence is the principle of acting in the best interests of the patient. Our design attempts to cure autoimmune diseases of the gut. It should have fewer side effects than the current drugs which are used for these conditions. The probiotics should, therefore, benefit the patient and be a better alternative to current treatments.
Justice
The principle of justice involves distributing healthcare fairly. It is fairly cheap and easy to culture the bacteria for use as probiotics. Production costs are not too expensive like many gene therapies, which means that the treatment could be utilised in the developing world. The inducible kill switch is also designed to be cheap and easy to use across the world. We were considering using a deadman switch, which would require regular intake of a supplement to keep the bacteria alive. This was decided to be too inconvenient, especially in areas where it is difficult to get medical supplies.
Non-maleficence
It is important that any treatments do not harm patients unless there is no alternative. Current treatments for many autoimmune diseases have side effects such as weight gain, diarrhoea and nausea. Probiotic treatments should have fewer side effects, and if there are any we can eliminate the bacteria from the immune system with the inducible kill switch. The kill switch was created as an alternative to using antibiotics. It has been shown that antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the microbiome and they can lead to AAD (antibiotic-associated diarrhoea). Our kill switch is a better alternative which does less harm to the patient.
Ethical theories
In philosophy, there are three main ethical theories: consequentialism, deontology and virtue ethics. While these ideas are very different, they all agree with the use of our technology as a moral act.

Part:BBa_K1315001 (pqsA)
This is a promoter from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is positively regulated when the transcription factor PqsR (BBa_K1157001) is activated by PQS (Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal).
Usage and Biology
The Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) is imperative in modulating mechanisms that enable Pseudomonas aeruginosa to survive at times of stress. P. aeruginosa is the main pathogen responsible for severe deterioration in the Cystic Fibrosis lungs. The production of this signal relies on the pqsA operon. The transcriptional factor PqsR (BBa_K1315000) positively regulates this operon.

Expression of the mmo-construct
5 ml 2xYT overnight cultures of cells expressing the MMO were inoculated from Glycerinstocks. After 24 h a main culture of 50 ml 2xYT-Ca-arabinose (4 mg/mL)-Medium was inoculated to a starting OD600 of 0,1 and cultivated at 37 °C and 250 rpm. Induction to a concentration of 100μM IPTG between OD 0,4-0,6. After induction, the cultures were cultivated at 30°C. 1mL of an arabinose solution (200 mg/mL) was added after 2 h and 4 h. The complete culture was harvested after 6 h.
Isolation of the soluble and inclusion fraction
The pellets harvested after 24 hours after induction with IPTG was resuspended in 5 ml PBS each. The cells were disrupted by sonification for 1 min and afterwards centrifuged for 15 min (800 g, 4 °C). The supernatant was transferred into a new 15 ml falcon and centrifuged for 30 min (6000 g, 4°C).  The obtained supernatant contains MMO-subunits which are solubly produced. The pellet obtained after the first centrifugation step was resuspended in 10 ml PBS and again centrifuged for 15 min (6000 g, 4 °C). After the supernatant has been discarded this step has been repeated (resuspension in 10 ml PBS and centrifugation step). After the supernatant has been discarded the pellet was then resuspended in 2 ml PBS 8 M Urea added.

From our system of equations we know that the expression of GFP is dependant on the levels of BCAM0228[P]. We hypothesised that one possible mechanism by which our cell could be expressing GFP in the absence of signal was by the presence of BCAM0228[P] independent of BDSF-binding mediated phosphorylation. This suggests that an unknown compound could be phosphorylating BCAM0228 in our engineered cells.
Comparing Fig 2 to Fig 1, it is clear that the model predicts that the expression of GFP is higher when BCAM0228 is being constitutively phosphorylated than in the “normal” case. Moreover, we are also able to conclude that the model predicts that the presence of BDSF has very little effect on the overall expression of GFP when the constitutive phosphorylation process is operating.
Conclusions
Our models predict that an as yet unknown agent phosphorylates BCAM0228 in the absence of a BDSF signal and that in fact the level of the BDSF signal has little quantifiable effect on GFP expression in our engineered cells.

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect."

THE IDEA
We have developed a simple and fast method of determining ""the comfort"" of the bacterial culture by asking them four questions related with their metabolic state which are replied in the form of voice answers. Moreover, we have engineered another genetic construction to order them to produce a protein.  Here is an overview of how our bacteria work. For more information look the molecular mechanisms below.

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Idea#Pre study_-_-_TEXT.html,"ohan.nordholm.se/Skola/igem/Z.pdf Interesting information about the Z domain of Protein A, text from the doctoral thesis ""Interaction-Engineered Three-Helix Bundle Domains for Protein Recovery and Detection"" by Tove Alm from 2010 at KTH

Andreas: How will we prevent protein A from entering the blood stream? If it is able to penetrate the skin cells to the spot where antibodies are present, it is also likely to ”exit” the skin into the blood stream. If this happens, protein A will not only cause a severe immune shock, it will also interfere with any type of antibody in the blood, not just the ones targeting vitiligo. This is especially true if Protein A is proteolytically very stable, as stated in (e) above.
Are there any examples mammalian in vivo Protein A studies? It would be a great leap forward if there are any such examples, showing how Protein A interacts with the mammalian immune system.  - I found a website at the US National Cancer Insitute, where they mention two clinical trials aiming at using Staphylococcus aureus Protein A as a cancer treatment. The clinical trials made it to phase 2 (out of the usual 4, if I remember correctly), but were then closed. I haven’t been able to find any statements, links or articles on why they were closed, but here is a link to the NCI website: http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI%20Thesaurus&code=C17166 - Now I found an article from the mid-80s on Protein A. Not sure if it is connected to the clinical trials at NCI, but here’s a PubMed link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6379115 - There are also several articles mentioning ex vivo methods with Protein A for cancer treatments.
Nina: Size of protein A with Z domain: 7 kDA
IgG protease
IgG antibodies are enriched in vitiligo patients. IgG proteases could partially solve this problem. Also, IgG protease could be fused with Protein A to get more activity from the protease.

BGU_ISRAEL,2016,Team:BGU ISRAEL#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," project.
First, we met with Prof. Ute Deichmann, an expert in History and Philosophy of Science. Prof.  Deichmann gave us an initial                                 overview of bioethical issues in research. We learned that ethics issues are reviewed and examined as soon as a new                                  scientific method or technology is being developed and becoming useful for different applications. Furthermore, ethic                                  issues might arise during the research process. For instance,  researchers confronts ethical questions regarding integrity,                                 objectivity and authenticity during the research process. Therefore, researchers should ask  themselves what the motivation                                 that fuels my research is. The researcher's desire for knowledge and achievements should not overcome the obligation for                                  ethical values such as dignity, integrity and candor. Thus, we learned that ethical issues need to be considered in many                                  aspects.
Second, we learned that our designed product is encountered with a relativity new term called genetically modified organism                                  (GMO). GMO is an organism whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques. GMO became wildly                                  used to produce genetically modified crops, medications, medical devices and nano-technology. Furthermore, GMOs is widely                                  used in many aspects of scientific research.
We also learned that there are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, when a marked difference can be                                  found between the United states that favor for GMO products while Europe union is basically against.
Third, we asked ourselves what is the potentially harmful consequences that may emerge when implementing new technology.                                 Does a genetically modified organism can have a negatively effects on the environment or on human being? Such concerns                                  are also considered a biosafety matter as creating a GMO is accompanied with lots of uncertainties regarding its future                                 effects on the environment. Apart from biosafety, synthetic biology raises also biosecurity concerns, as products of                                  synthetic biology could potentially be used for malicious intentions.
The regulation of bioethical issue in Israel
In recent years, effective biosafety laws and regulations have been adapted by several countries to prevent terrorists and                                  other hostile powers from obtaining dangerous biological agents, technologies, or information that would allow them to                                  develop and manufacture biological weapons.
In 2008, the Israeli parliament (""Kenesset"") decided to tighten biosecurity measures and legislated the regulation of                                  research into biological disease agents law, which provides a legislative framework to conduct research involved biological                                  disease agents. The law calls for the establishment of a council to regulate and monitor research on select infectious                                  disease agents. It also prescribes institutional committees with defined responsibilities and identifies means of control,                                 including penalties and liabilities.

The background-subtracted values were calculated by subtracting the mean of E0240 from the other means.
The replicate standard deviation was estimated to be 0.014, meaning that the effect of using multiple replicates contributes a random effect distributed with this standard deviation. The residual standard deviation was estimated to be 0.040, meaning that the random effect of taking multiple measurements on the same sample has this standard deviation.
Which, if any, of the samples are excluded and why
In two of the triplicate sets, one outlier was excluded: For the promoter J23100, one replicate did not grow very much. For promoter J23102 one replicate had negligible fluorescence.
Flow cytometry
Histograms of fluorescence values for each construct are shown below. At least 100,000 cells were measured for each construct. Values on the X-axes are log10-values of the fluorescence measurements. For each construct, a threshold was determined to split the measurements into high-fluorescence and low-fluorescence cells. The high-fluorescence sub-datasets were log10-transformed and a normal distribution was fitted. Mean and standard deviation for the log-normal distributions are reported below each histogram. The vertical red line indicates the threshold.

Description
In this section, we describe the background and our bacterial cellulose project in brief.
We advise you to have a quick overall understanding of our project before viewing result pages.
What is Bacterial Cellulose ?
Cellulose is a major component of natural plant cellulose and plant cell wall; it covers 1/3 to 1/2 of plants’ dry weight and is the largest conservation pool of polysacchrides. Cellulose also exists in numerous lower level plants, some lower level animals and bacteria. Bacteria synthesizing cellulose was first reported by Brown in 1886. Bacterial cellulose is pure cellulose secreted by microorganism and its molecular composition shows no differences compared with normal cellulose. They are all β-D-glucose linked by β-1,4-glycosidic linkage forming linear chain. These linear chains,as known as β-1,4-dextran are paralleled ,branchless and exhibits no alpha helical conformation.The main differences between them is that bacterial cellulose doesn’t contain other polysacchrides such as hemicellulose and plant cellulose contains lignin, hemicellulose among others.
Character of Bacterial Cellulose
In terms of chemical property, bacterial cellulose are the same with those from plants and seaweeds. However, as a new-type of bio-material, bacterial cellulose possesses many unique properties[1]
1)High degrees of crystallinity and chemical properties. 100% cellulose, doesn’t contain any hemicellulose,                                     lignin, components of cell walls so the purification process is easy.
2) High degrees of tensile strength and elasticity modulus. After washing and drying, the Young's                                     modulus of bacterial cellulose can reach to 10MP ; after autoclave, the Young’s modulus of it can reach to 30MP,                                     4 times stronger than organic synthetic fibers.
3) Outstanding water binding property. Its internal structure have many poles,                                     it has fine air and water permeability."

It is an open-non-lucrative organization with representatives from the Academy, Laboratories, FabLabs, Colleges, Hack-labs, DYIBio and NGOs who cooperate to organize the event through the continent.
This year, the second edition of the event TechnoX  took place in our home city in Mexico: Guadalajara. We held a workshop on science communication and the importance of critical thinking. Our goal was to make people conscious about how easily information can be manipulated, especially by social media and activist groups. This is a big issue that prevents Synthetic Biology and other technologies to be accepted by the general public because of the fear to the unknown.
Our workshop was held on the same auditorium where Drew Endy, one of iGEM’s founders, gave his speech during the same event.

1) Made tetracycline plates using LB agar and Hallam lab tetracycline, diluted 400 uL in 400 mL. Previous kan and amp plates were shown to not have LB in them, and were also discovered not to support growth. However, a working kan plate was gifted by Cameron and used for a knockout experiment.
2) A gel from yesterday's PCR was shown to have some products that worked, while others did not. The MetA, TrpA, TrpB, and ArgE biobrick PCR's worked fine, but the ArgE-Kan cassette and the ArgC biobrick PCRs did not, and were not repeated today. From personal correspondence with Joe, his PCR was not working either, despite trying different cycles and conditions. He suspects that there may be something wrong with the template, given the inconsistent performance of the Kan plates.
3) The biobrick PCRs that did work were digested with EcoRI and PstI, as was the psb1C3 linearized plasmid backbone.  it was unknown whether or not the plasmid had any methylation, so DpnI was used only in the PCR product digestion. The procedure will be uploaded to the wiki in the near future. A gel was made showing the ligation products.
4) The biobrick ligation products were used to transform K12 cells and were plated appropriately. The successful amino acid-antibiotic cassettes were also transformed into EPI300, DH5a, and BL21 cells with the appropriate recombineering plasmid, and plated. To date, all the tet resistance strains have been plated, as well as Mehul's Amp resistant strain. The kanamycin resistant strains remain recalcitrant, perhaps due to, again, the inconsistent performance of the kanamycin plates.
5) Joe, looking into rhodococcus growth, decided to make some TB.
It should be noted that several of the transformations sparked during the electroporation procedure. Some success has been reported with sparked cultures, so they were plated anyways.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium.

We will proceed to DNA sequencing for a fnal verification.  For the restriction digest, it does not look like the DNA was cut as the bands in the cut lanes are identical to the bands in the uncut lanes for all colonies.  This may have been because the reaction was not run long enough, there was a problem with the enzymes or there is a problem with the restriction sites themselves.

iGEM Hamburg: What do you think about our approach for a self-sustaining mosquito trap?
Dr. Jacobs: I think it is really interesting and I think this technology is amazing. I am not sure if the prize will actually meet the criteria which we will need for Africa. I do not know, I just do not know. I think for German situation it will be wonderful, because we are used to spend a lot of money for such devices. But for example, in Africa where we even have discussions if we should spend 3 € for a new vaccine per dose. So, I do not know if you can actually build this trap for Africa. I do not know maybe you have to find a sponsor, like Bill Gates for example who would like to invest a lot of money in these traps. But I think apart from this, it is an interesting technology
iGEM Hamburg: Let’s imagine we get founded and we can invest enough money to develop the trap. Do you see problem within the trap? Problem with the concept or things that might not work?
Dr. Jacobs: Well I think the toxin should be effective. I would not expect any development of resistance because normally the mosquitoes should not come into contact with this kind of toxin. From this angle I would not see any problems. No, not yet.
iGEM Hamburg: Do you think, that there could be a resistance development against the toxin?
Dr. Jacobs: No normally not. I would assume, if the dose is high enough and the mosquitoes will be dead afterwards there will be no transmission of resistance. We made this experience in Germany where we used this BT-toxin over a very long time. I do not think there are any issues with that.
iGEM Hamburg: Do you think there are pathogens that can grow on our trap which can be transmitted by a mosquito? And therefore, our trap could help to spread it.
Dr. Jacobs: No, I think this is very unlikely. Normally the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes is really relying on sucking blood. I would not expect that you have living pathogens on the trap surfaces for a very long time. Even should there be microorganisms on the trap, they would not easily transmitted by mosquitoes. The proboscis is antimicrobial and we do not observe microorganisms from any surfaces to be distributed by mosquitoes. If that were the case we would have a whole"

Defending North American bats from the emerging White Nose epidemic
Bats play a major role in the ecosystem and economy here in Missouri and across North America. According to the USGS, bats are the primary consumers of insects in temperate regions. The insect suppression service that the bats provide saves the nation’s farmers between four and fifty billion dollars a year in lost crops and pesticide costs. Bats then produce waste that becomes the primary input of nutrients to Missouri’s over 7000 caves and allows the caves to support diverse and unique life.
Unfortunately, in 2007 a disease that is now called White Nose Syndrome (WNS) appeared in the bat populations of the northeastern United States. It is caused by a white fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. The fungus grows on the bats while they hibernate and causes skin lesions leading to inflammation. This inflammation and irritation wakes the bats from their hibernation, causing them to burn precious fat reserves while it is still winter. The bats then starve or die from shock before spring arrives. The fungus has spread rapidly across the eastern United States and has left behind it high mortality. Generally, bat populations have declined by 80% with some populations totally lost.
We investigated two approaches to defend bats from WNS while avoiding disturbing their hibernation, killing beneficial fungi, or releasing genetically-modified bacteria. We designed pathways on plasmids for the production of ocimene, a volatile organic compound, and leupeptin, a protease inhibitor, to reduce the severity of disease in different ways.

Our previous methods were similar. We promoted through the seminars, conducted campus exhibitions, and let everyone communicate with us face to face. We can also understand your thoughts and questions more clearly. It is mainly to hold activities that can reach more people and raise awareness of iGEM.
In the early stage, we discussed with the Xiamen University team about the norms and methods of the team selection process. Later, we also discussed how to train new players in the initial stage of team formation.
In May 2018, we conducted the 2019 iGEM recruiting seminar. After the presentation, we conducted the first round of team formation through the QQ group, and released our training and selection items in it. Everyone entered different groups according to their intentions. After that, the relevant leaders in the 2018 team will be trained. In the early stage, I met with you through the group meeting, and arranged and taught the tasks according to different contents, and conducted an assessment between September and October 2018. Different groups determine the way of assessment according to needs. The number module is tested by some models, the art team is initially selected by some design tasks, and the other groups are also performing corresponding tasks.
Throughout the training period, we also conducted unified training for the experimental part. At present, we are more likely to share the necessary bibliography, organize everyone to self-learn, and submit corresponding summary reports on a regular basis.
We have exchanged information with Xiamen University this year. They have put forward some opinions on our training. During the communication process, we found that the selection methods between our two teams are different. They will be the newly selected players. After the determination, the training is carried out, and we are gradually training during the entire selection process, and through the step by step assessment. At the same time, it was found that a large amount of literature reading was started at the beginning, which is a bit difficult for the initial selection. It may be necessary to provide some help, such as some training in reading skills and reading focus. After the discussion, we conducted the previous literature learning training in the second phase of the selection, and found that the literature review written by the second phase of the team was more logical, and also able to better grasp the key points.
Finally, we communicated with the daily management of the team, just like the problems encountered when starting the team. After entering the team, the basic aspects of the experimental part must be approved. After the preliminary determination of the project, each The tasks of the group are gradually"

Even for Bb5, using an ANOVA test for six groups and 4 replicas, one can reject the null hypothesis of equal mean values (F=4.253, p=0.010) which means that the expresion of the Biobrick is indeed different. Each strain proved to be more “efficient” at hosting a different Biobrick          part. For instance, Bb1 and Bb5 are highly expressed in strain JM109, whereas the expression of the other biobricks was low or nearly undetectable. Note          that Bb3, containing the weak promoter J23110, could not be detected in four out of the six strains. It is also remarkable the fact that in 1A and in 1B (Bb1 and Bb2 are under the control of the same promoter) the pattern obtained is almost equal among strains except in JM109.
Figure 1. Behavior of Biobrick parts in six different E. coli strains. Fluorescence intensity of Bb1, Bb2, and Bb3 (A, B, and C, respectively) was corrected by the fluorescence of cells containing an empty plasmid. Absorbance values of Bb4, Bb5, and Bb6 (D, E, and F, respectively) was corrected by the absorbance displayed by non-transformed cells (bacteria containing an empty plasmid where not used because the white-blue screening sytem present in the vector).

Discussion and conclusions
We demonstrate here a difference in the output of the Biobricks depending on the host strain. If we assume that they are in the same physiological state this results could be related  to epistasis, since epistasis describes how gene interactions can affect phenotypes ( Miko, I. Epistasis: Gene interaction and phenotype effects. Nature Education (2008) 1(1):197 ). In other words, the behaviour of a particular gene strongly depends on the presence of others, on the genetic background of each Escherichia coli strain .
The different behavior can be a consequence of the synthesis rate, which also depends on the genetic background. The measures were made in the exponential phase of growing, where the bacteria are constantly dividing, in such a way that the protein synthesized is also being divided. Maybe, if the same experiment was carried out when the bacterial cells had reached the stationary phase, the output obtained could be more homogeneous. We are currently testing that.

Results
Every network starts with a basic unit. While our declared aim is to enable networks allowing fine-tuning of gene expression beyond the regular on/off, exploring such an on/off switch/signal pair is the first step towards a functional network. We constructed several units and tested their efficiency, robustness and reproducibility in vivo, in vitro and in silico. Furthermore we developed a software which allows easy constructions of networks based on our designed logic gates. Conclusive elaboration of a few first RNA-based logic units is the major contribution of our iGEM team.
in silico Design of Switching and Trigger Unit
As described on the project page, one key aspect of our switches is the idea, that a RNA transmitter molecule is capable to shift the state of a switch only if its trigger site is present and its identity site corresponds to the recognition site of the switch . We successfully constructed several switches and their corresponding transmitter RNA in silico on a thermodynamical basis. We modified different transcriptional terminators in such a way, that the formation of the terminator was prevented by a transmitter molecule. As desired, this only occured if the transmitter molecule contained both, a trigger and an identity site. Analogously, we were able to design and verify a NOT gate using the same thermodynical approach.
Diffusion and RNA Folding Dynamics
We estimated the diffusion time for our constructs and modeled the folding dynamics of our bioLOGICS switches including the switching process with a stochastic RNA folding program. We were able to provide better insight in their folding dynamics and proved that they are able to interrupt termination. We also optimized the switches and the corresponding signals. Furthermore, we combined the switches what resulted in a logic gate. See our Modeling page for further details.
in vivo Functionality Screening
Since our logic gates are intended to function in living cells, in vivo measurements were essential. In a set of experiments we concentrated on two different switches based on known attenuators from nature: the HisTerm and TrpTerm . Focusing on fluorescent proteins for quantifiable input and output we designed a functional and robust screening system. For greater detail see Experimental Design .

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," can effectively synthesize liposomes from 12 µm to around 17 µm with our current         set-up. Nevertheless, we have found that when Q = 0.7, spheres cannot form anymore, as the OA phase cannot cut         the stream of IA phase and it transforms into a continuous flow (Fig. 11). Therefore, Q = 0.7 is the critical         value for liposome synthesis in our system. In conclusion, the regulation of IA phase flow rate gives us             an effective and fast method to vary the size of our liposomes in a range of few micrometers.
Fig. 11 Liposomes stop forming in our system when Q > 0.7, or V > 1 ( vIA/vOA).     It means that in given dimensions, these values are critical for vesicle formation.
Liposome size dependency on IA channel width w
While our goal has always been to attain cell-sized liposomes, which stretch from 5 µm to 30 µm, theoretically         we had yet only managed to produce 10 µm to around 17 µm sized vesicles by modifying dynamic viscosity and flow         rates of our fluids. It became clear that in order to expand this range, we had to start from the microfluidics         device design. Possibilities of the design are virtually infinite, but here we focused on the width of IA phase         channel, which we assumed to have the biggest impact on sphere size.
In our model configuration, we have added an additional parameter wy, which is the width expansion of         the device parallel to the symmetry axis (See Geometry). The simulation was run with a set of different wy         values (Tab. 5.) and results are present in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13

Continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS), the constant release of L-DOPA, is sometimes used for very severe cases to prevent further symptoms resulting from the “wearing off effect.” A common application of CDS is Duodopa, a portable pump that administers a continuous mixture of L-DOPA and carbidopa, an L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, directly into the duodenum or jejunum via a surgically implanted tube.
Other treatments such as deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS), dopamine agonists (compounds which activate dopamine receptors, and drugs inhibiting the activity of enzymes that facilitate the degradation of dopamine in the brain have also been used in efforts against PD. Generally, however, surgeries can be expensive and drugs such as dopamine agonists have been found to be less effective than levodopa and wear off about a year.
What is our project?
Quite simply, our project involves building DNA circuits that produce and sense L-DOPA using bacteria. But, why have bacteria producing L-DOPA? Our answer lies in the gut microbiome; although still not fully understood, the bacteria living in the intestinal tract could potentially serve as a chassis for L-DOPA producing circuits. Similarly to Levodopa treatments by way of orally-taken pills, L-DOPA would be absorbed into the bloodstream from the digestive tract and could pass through the blood-brain barrier to the brain, where L-DOPA would be converted into dopamine.
Unfortunately, our project never reached the stage where we were able to test our circuits in any gut bacteria, be they human or otherwise, but we did build and test our circuits in lab strain E. coli.
Our project consists of two separate E. coli cells, each with its own specific circuit: one cell, the ‘production’ cell, focuses on the production of L-DOPA while the other cell, the ‘sensing’ cell, senses and reports the production of L-DOPA by the ‘production’ cell.

UCL,2015,Team:UCLA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," test to verify which end of the monomer the cap was binding to ( 6/5/2015 ). If the cap bound to the C-end, there would be no problem as this end is not exposed to the C-cap at any time. However, if the cap bound to the A-end, it could compete for ligation with the AB monomer, which would limit ICA efficacy. We tested this by ""blocking"" one end of the CA monomer by ligating CA to BC or AB. Then, the capping oligo was added to the mixture and left to incubate. If a double band corresponding to ligation appeared, it would indicate that the UNMASKED sticky end was binding to the cap. The results of this test are shown below. In addition, we would test the initiator and terminator at higher concentrations.
Fig. 4 The BC+CA reactions with or without C-cap show no double band character at the 200 bp mark. The CA+AB+C-cap reactions exhibits a double band similar to the CA+C-cap reaction from 6/3/2015. AB+init exhibits a band at approximately 160 bp. CA+term exhibits a band at approximately 140 bp.
From these results, we can conclude that C-cap binds to the C-sticky end, and not the A-sticky end. We will be able to proceed with ICA as planned. In addition, the initiator and terminator work as expected.
With these results, we were able to confidently proceed to performing ICA. Throughout the summer, we were able to successfully use ICA to create a number of different constructs . These constructs were successfully cloned into Biobricks. The image below represents the cumulative work done using the REDESIGNED monomers, and demonstrates that we were able to substantially improve BBa_K1384000.

As for patent application, we plan to add further experiment after iGEM and make our project better-rounded. Fortunately, bioresearch has been emphasized in education of our university, which will make the process go more smoothly. But we may not be able to apply the patent individually, but in the name of our school.
There is no denying that we need technological improvements in the further transformation process. For example, we must consider whether the system will work in vivo environment, the degree of degradation, which disease will be targeted to and other relative issues. After solving these questions, the commercialization will be possible, theoretically.
CFDA Inquiry
As our project will finally apply to mammalian cells in curing protein-related diseases, we must take laws and policies into consideration from the time we conduct experiments in the laboratory. We have inquired China Food and Drug Administration about this issue and got a feedback of the interpretation related to Technical Guidelines for Research and Evaluation of Cell Therapy Products.
Cell therapy technology is currently the key development field of international medical frontiers, which provides new hopes for the treatment of some complicated diseases. This policy was released in 2015 in order to better create an environment for cell product research and development and provide technical support to relevant scientific research institutions and enterprises.
The contents helpful to our project are shown as follows.
According to the general principles and basic requirements, we designed and conducted our experiment and future work in a more effective and rational way. We had a deeper investigation of non-clinical research on cell therapy products. Even though we haven't transformed our work into actual drugs or products, we still learn some details from the policy."

Initially, we had the idea to create an educational synthetic biology board game called BioMech because we discovered the shocking lack of synthetic biology education in the United Kingdom. When we tried to address this lack of education, we spoke to Edexcel and they responded by saying that unfortunately there was no scope to change the GCSE syllabus this year; if we could create a ‘stretch and challenge’ tool then we could influence students at this level via an alternative method. The aim of BioMech is to introduce secondary and sixth form students to this scientific field in a fun and interactive way. The game teaches students about plasmid construction, biological parts and other essential biological concepts like mutation.
Why did we decide to create a board game?
After researching synthetic biology education in the UK,  we discovered  that there is a limited number of cheap and nationally   available educational resources for biology, with many teachers needing  to create their own material to inspire students. Furthermore, there is  also no education in synthetic biology for secondary school or A level students.
In response to this we decided to get in contact with Edexcel,  a GCSE and A Level exam board, and enquired the possibility of introducing  synthetic biology in the syllabus. They responded with “iGEM could produce   support resources, for the existing A level, which introduced ideas of   synthetic biology and which could be used as ‘stretch and challenge’   materials by teachers”. At this point we focused our efforts on making   BioMech an easily accessible educational tool that can be used alongside   the current syllabus, building on the cellular biology and genetics that  are currently taught at GCSE and A-Level biology.
The aim of the game
The game teaches students about plasmid construction,  biological parts and other essential biological concepts like   mutation. The game starts with 10 BioBrick cards for each player  who places 5 cards on the board to construct their plasmid. The   winner of the round is the player that designed the plasmid that  will be most useful in a randomly chosen scenario, the most appropriate   plasmid is"

IIT_Delhi,2015,Team:IIT Delhi#project_-_-_TEXT.html," after the protein is formed. While no intermediates of the reaction are released, NrfA is also able to reduce various oxides other than NO such as, hydroxylamine (H2NOH), and nitrous oxide (N2O), but notably also sulfite(SO32-), providing the only known direct link between the nitrogen and sulfur cycles.
The pathway of the nrfA Gene is still not completely understood or characterised. However, the overall reaction is given by:
Thus, the six electron reduction of NO2- to NH3 is catalysed by the nitrite reductase nrfA. Also, another important product of the reaction, NAD(P)+ act as reducing equivalents that are an inherent part of the electron transport system in the host.
The nrfA gene is suppressed at higher levels of nitrite or nitrate. Steady-state gene expression studies revealed a differential pattern of nitrite reductase gene expression where optimal nrfA-lacZ expression occurred only at low to intermediate levels of nitrate.
The reason for this repression at high nitrite concentrations is the presence of two regulators of the nrfA gene, NarL and NarP, in the E.coli K-12 genome (from where this gene has been isolated). While either NarL or NarP was able to induce nrfA-lacZ expression in response to low levels of nitrate, only NarL could repress at high nitrate levels.
This problem could therefore, be solved, by expressing the nitrite reductase gene under a constitutive strong promoter, which is what we have done.
Escherichia coli possesses two biochemically distinct nitrite reductase enzymes encoded by the nrfABCDEFG and nirBDC operons. The NirB nitrite reductase is a soluble siroheme-containing enzyme that uses NADH as an electron donor to reduce nitrite in the cytoplasm. The NrfA nitrite reductase is a membrane-associated respiratory enzyme that couples to the membrane-associated formate-oxidizing enzymes via quinones in order to generate membrane potential. The abundance of each enzyme is elevated during anaerobic cell growth conditions when either nitrate and/or nitrite is present[7]. Nitrite, the substrate for the two enzymes, must either be encountered environmentally or generated by the cell from nitrate reduction by one of the three E. coli nitrate reductases.
Gene construction & cloning:
The general cloning strategy for NrfA consists of the following steps.

These proteins became our system of choice: usable as a nanobiotechnological scaffold for a lot of different cell-free applications, providing S-layer BioBricks in an assembly standard for fusion proteins which are supposed to allow future iGEM teams and synthetic biologists an easy arrangement of their nanobiotechnological systems of choice. Our idea of do it yourself nanobiotechnology was born.
Development of different subprojects
Our knowledge of the current state of S-layer applications grew. Afterwards, we needed a way to functionalize a S-layer surface in order to use it as a BPA biosensor. While searching the Partsregistry we found BioBricks for BPA degradation in Freiburg assembly standard. These BioBricks became the starting point of a BPA detecting enzymatic reaction. In this BPA degradation reaction NADH is converted into NAD+. By a sensitive and specific detection of NAD+, an indirect analysis of BPA is possible. Consequently, we divided our project in three subprojects:
Isolation of S-layer genes from different organisms and establishment of methods for producing, purifying and immobilizing the related gene products.
Enabling E. coli to degrade BPA and establish an enzymatic cell-free BPA degradation.
Detection of NAD+ with a high sensitivity and specificity.
For further information about the current state of each subproject take a look at the overview description and for more background information look at the S-layer , bisphenol A and NAD+ detection pages.
Our aims
Primarily, we want to establish methods for the usage of S-layer BioBricks as molecular building blocks for do it yourself nanobiotechnology. We want to provide this system, which is expandable to many other applications and therefore a great example of the principles of creating and using BioBricks and the possibilities of synthetic biology for the scientific community. But aloso our other subprojects are expandable to other applications, showing another principle of engineering: engines are built modular - no matter how small they are. The enzymatic, specific and sensitive NAD+ detection can be used in many other biosensors in which coupled NADH- or NAD+-dependent enzyme reactions are used and the bisphenol A (BPA) degradation BioBricks may be further used in bioremediation approaches.
The final product
After showing the functionality of all our subprojects, they are combined to a cell-free bisphenol A biosensor immobilized on small beads. This biosensor will have many advantages compared to other analytical tests:

We ran a gel of the colony PCRs, but the bands looked very blurred, so we re-ran another gel of them, which gave clear results - 3 of the 4 inserts appeared to successfully be in pAg13H! Ran a PCR of pC13DU for use in a final Gibson attempt. None of the ‘’PpkiA’’ + pC13Z transformants were present. We cultured ‘’PpkiA’’ + pC13F transformants for sequencing. Unfortunately, to test the strength of the promoter using fluorescence, we would have to transfer ‘’PpkiA’’ + pC13F from the pSB1C3 backbone into homologous constructs for transformation into fungi, which would require several days to grow. Thus, we would not have enough time to collect data before the World Jamboree.
We checked our last set of inserts ligated into pAg13H, and the constructs with pC13AT, pC13AV, and pC13CE appeared successful! The Gibson of pC13DU failed to grow, indicating a failure of our Gibson assembly. We planned to try one more time.

Overview of Project DR. SWITCH
(Disease-associated RNA Switch)
Our project focuses on developing an on-site subtyping method for Influenza A viruses subtype H5N1 and H7N9 using toehold switches. To facilitate future toehold switch projects, we also developed an online software program for designing toehold switches, and constructed a toehold switch cloning tool that allow easy construction and validation of toehold switches.
Influenza A is a rapidly changing disease that causes 5,000,000 of deaths annually worldwide. Among different subtypes, highly pathogenic avian influenza has the highest mortality rate. Challenges of disease control in the modern world with high population mobility remains at the speed and accuracy of diagnosis. However, nowadays influenza A subtyping method relies greatly on RT-PCR, which requires a long period of time, expertise and laboratory space. Meanwhile, a novel type of riboswitch, namely toehold switch, shows its potential in subtyping Influenza A with quicker detection and lower production cost.
By combining cell free system and toehold switch, a rapid on-site detection method for influenza A subtype H5N1 and H7N9 is designed and investigated. It has a high potential to be used widely in, but not limited to, animal farms, and border inspections and schools wherever expertise and laboratory equipments are not readily available.
Our objectives are to
Provide a rapid detection method with higher accuracy at a lower production cost;
Stop Influenza A pandemic by early on-site detection; and
Ease the stress on public health service when disease attacks, especially in less developed countries.
Influenza Type A
Influenza is a prevalent acute respiratory disease circulating among humans and other animals (1). Influenza A can be spread rapidly throughout poultry flocks and cause severe illness, or even death in human. The most notorious pandemic was the “Spanish Flu” which occurred in in 1918, and have killed approximately 50 million people worldwide (1). Influenza A viruses pose large social and economic burden. Each year in the United States, it is estimated that around 600,000 lives and $90 billion US dollars are lost due to influenza A viruses (2). The existing form"

We took this fun opportunity and recorded a short piece for the music video, which iGEM TEC CEM edited into the music video. We really appreciate the opportunity that we           received from them and encourage anyone to view the result!
European Meet-Up
From the 20th to the 22nd of July 2018, iGEM Munich organised the first European Meet-up for 2018. As we were eager to meet the other iGEM participants, a           delegation of our team drove to Munich. Here we enjoyed three days of interesting lectures, poster presentations, social events and sightseeing. It was a great opportunity to meet many iGEM participants and learn about all their great           projects. We look forward to seeing everyone again in Boston and to learn how all the projects turned out.
Postcards
Over the course of the summer we were approached by iGEM HHU to participate in a very cool collaboration set-up called: Postcards. The idea was to           let as many teams as wanted to participate design a postcard related to their project. We could all send them to iGEM HHU and they would redistribute them. Sending us 50 of our own design with addresses of all the other teams and one           from every other participating team. We have received all the postcards and were able to decorate our office with all of them. Thank you iGEM HHU for this great collaboration, we really enjoyed looking through all the great designs!
Eindhoven Mini Jamboree
We had the pleasure of attending the Mini Jamboree in Eindhoven on the 19th of October. Eindhoven organised a mock jamboree in order for the Dutch           team to practice presenting their posters and their final presentation. They even arranged for professional jury members to be present. Afterwards the day was concluded with food and drinks. We immensely appreciate the effort of iGEM           Eindhoven and thank them for inviting us.

Killing test
I Background
    From our orthogonality test, we find that no matter how we construct, warrior I can’t fulfill our desire that it is only killed by warrior II but not itself. However, our orthogonality test uses RFP to represent the level of LacI, thus representing the killing effect. We want to find out if it is really the case in our warriors, so we construct our warriors and carry out the killing test.
II Experimental design
    To test how our warriors kill the enemies and if they kill themselves, we let equal amounts of the two kinds of warriors to grow together, with the warriors growing separately as negative controls. We attach different fluorescent proteins to different warriors in order to differentiate them. We compare the killing effect of the warriors by monitoring the ratio of the two kinds of the warriors.
    To test how efficient our warriors can kill the enemies, we do a gradient experiment. We let warriors and beggars from different sides to grow together with different starting ratios,with beggars growing alone as negative controls. The warriors and beggars from different sides are attached to different fluorescent proteins. We monitor the change of the amount of beggars with time to see how the killing effect is.
III Methods
    1. Construct our warriors and beggars by co-transformation. (the gene circuits are as follows)
*if you want to know the details of how we assemble the parts together, see our protocol “DNA construction”(download）

The FACSCalibur was set up with a side scatter threshold of 4.5, to filter out events that were likely to be noise. Fluorescence was measured with a log amplification value of 750.
 
What protocol did you use to take measurements?
The BioLector was instructed to take measurements every 4.86 minutes. Settings: GFP: 80; Biomass: 30; Humidity: controlled at 95%. 1.5 mL LB media with relevant antibiotics in each well.
 
The FACS was set up with a threshold on side scatter, as events with low side-scatter are very likely noise, i.e. not actual cells. Each sample was then analysed at 1000-1500 events per second, until a total of 100,000 events was reached.
 
What method is used to determine whether to include or exclude each sample from the data set?
Strains that showed correct digest patterns were included. Strains that were sequenced and showed wrong sequences were excluded. As were cultures that did not grow, and single replicates that showed negligible fluorescence.
 
What exactly were the controls that you used?
DH5α with BBa_E0240 (no promoter) was used to determine cell background fluorescence (without GFP). For the BioLector, clean media (without cells) was used to determine media fluorescence.
 
What quantities were measured?
On the BioLector: GFP fluorescence (488 nm /520 nm) and biomass (scatter at 620nm). The flow cytometer measured forward scatter (cell size), side scatter (cell granularity) and fluorescence.
 
How much time did it take to acquire each set of measurements?
The running time of the BioLector experiment was 12 hours and 30 minutes. One cycle took 4.86 min.
Flow cytometry: The measurements themselves took less than 1 hour.
 
How much does it cost to acquire a set of measurements?
Assuming the lab already have a BioLector. For a full plate with samples: Flowerplate for the BioLector, 170mL LB medium, chloramphenicol, 16 pts. inoculation tubes, tips, Eppendorf tubes approximately $150.
 
What are the practical limits on the number or rate of measurements taken with this instrument and protocol?
BioLector: With the used protocol 48 samples can be measured within short intervals of"

Anthropomorphism
Biocentrism
General considerations. The field of biology evolves very quickly thanks to the technological advances that we witness day by day. The definition of ""biology"" is also changing. Formerly simply meaning ""study of the living"", it is now more complex because we are able to transform the living. Indeed, the birth of synthetic biology has created a revolution in the world of biology as important as the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Watson and Crick or the first complete sequencing of a human genome in 2003. It is natural that suspicion emerges in the minds of the public when they only have a vague idea of ​​what this new discipline is, and the safety measures implemented to minimize the risks. Scientists everywhere have to work with integrity, communicate with transparency on their results, their doubts and their failures so that the public can gain more confidence.
Because respecting the living is or at least should be a value rooted in each one of us, it is only natural to be reluctant to projects that aim to modify organisms and living systems. Scientists therefore need to carefully explain the purpose of their projects. However, before doing so, to prevent a blurry debate, some basic concepts comprehensible by everybody need to be explained. First of all, how do we define a living being?
The definitions are very diverse and evolve over time. Actually more than 300 definitions have been collected by the astrophysicist Radu Popa (2010). For example, Vikipédia (an encyclopedia for children aged from 8 to 13 years old) gives the following definition: “A living being is an organism that is endowed with life, that is to say that this organism: is born, grows, nurtures itself, reproduces itself and dies”. For the NASA, “life is an auto-maintained system, capable of Darwinian evolution” (Gerald Joyce, 1992). Some definitions exclude, for example, viruses from their definition when others don’t. The limit has never been clear and yet we know is something lives almost intuitively. James Lovelock even said “The detection of life is part of our natural mental equipment”.
From the start, it is complex to define what we work with. In spite of the absence of definite answer, we can question ourselves differently: when is an organism considered “modified”? Indeed, we are not capable of changing the whole system of an organism, we can only change some functions or metabolic"
Lethbridge_HS,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"ofundme page, the event posed a way for our team to gain funds for our project. Promoting the synthetic biology community and the involvement of high school students in scientific learning was a worthwhile experience.
Parent-Teacher Night
One of the components to our public engagement aspect for our human practices was a parent and teacher night. This night was certainly a success. During the event, we had our parents and teachers come to the University of Lethbridge for a presentation, and a few labs. The event gave our team the perfect opportunity to showcase our lab space, as well as introduce our project to the community. We used the presentation to briefly provide an explanation of iGEM, as well as our project. Following the presentations, the participants had the chance to perform a few experiments that require similar protocol and science to our own experiments. For example, they got to extract the DNA from strawberries, as well as run an agarose gel. This allowed the teachers and parents to gain an insight into the experiments completed by our team throughout the season, such as our minipreps. After the event, we collected some brief feedback from the participants. There was an overall positive response to the presentation and experiments; they were found educational and engaging. However, it was suggested that the delivery of the presentation should be refined and that our project, SynthetINK, be explained further in depth. By the end of the evening, a strong interest was shown regarding synthetic biology and a willingness to promote iGEM to extended family, friends and students. Many participants seemed eager to participate in similar events in the future. The teachers and parents expressed great enthusiasm seeing their students or children participating in the program and applying science outside of school. Overall, this event helped us to engage with the public, while also allowing the opportunity to spread more awareness for synthetic biology. It enabled us to show the teachers at our schools and our parents a glimpse into what happens during a season of iGEM, as well as the number of benefits gained by students from the program and the competition.
Curriculum Proposal and Research
Team members were fortunate to have interviewed Sheanne Cox, a middle school teacher at G.S Lakie. During our interview, we discussed the possible integration of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) into the Alberta middle school curriculum, Sheanne stressed to us the importance of early integration into the education system in order to help students develop a strong interest in STEAM initiatives. Sheanne also explained to us that focusing on middle school integration gives teachers the freedom to create an option class designed to support the current curriculum."

NOTEBOOK
'Cas-Find' is a novel bioluminescent system for point-of-care diagnostic testing.
Sexually transmitted infections (STI) represent an important issue for global Public health, due to their high-morbidity and prevalence. Laboratory-based tests for STI require specalised infrastructure, equipment and procedures for optimal performance [1] . As such the utilisation of these tests is generally expensive and time consuming, limiting the availability of results for immediate use in management decisions and potentially impacting on patient prognosis. In addition the majority of STI testing is conducted in resource-constrained environments, where such infrastructure and facilities are unavailable [2] .'Cas-Find' exploits CRISPR/Cas9 to potentially achieve point-of-care diagnosis alleviating some of the global health burden associated with these diseases.
CRISPR/Cas9 achieves sequence specific interrogation.
Most bacteria and archaea possess RNA-mediated adaptive defence mechanisms composed of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRIPSR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas). Initially exogenous DNA sequences are recognised and incorporated into the bacterial or archaeal genome at the CRISPR loci, transcription through which produces CRISPR RNA (crRNA). An additional trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA) is required for interference, and is partially complementary to this crRNA. In Streptococcus pyogenes this forms a crRNA:tracrRNA [4] duplex which recruits the endonuclease Cas9, and collectively these molecules achieve sequence specific DNA interrogation and cleavage. This is summarised in Figure 1, demonstrating the sequential acquisition of exogenous DNA, RNA processing and interference. In synthetic applications a single guide RNA (sgRNA) construct fulfills the role of the crRNA:tracrRNA duplex. This sgRNA consists of a 20 nucleotide sequence complementary to the target, a 42 nucleotide Cas9 binding RNA structure, and a 40 nucleotide transcription terminator [5] . 'Cas-Find' utilises the capability of CRISPR/Cas9 to achieve sequence specific interrogation.
The reconstitution of luciferase activity constitutes a positive signal.
Luciferases catalyse bioluminescent reactions using ATP in the presence of molecular oxygen"

I describe myself as a very creative, social and smart person. I am in Genetix because it is a group made for science and also have social activities to share and spread science. Its a place where I can be myself, and apport to share my knowledge to others. Also is a way to be in IGem, and develop my abilities to my future, due to the fact that I want to study biochemistry. This development is also useful to my school work. My future aspirations are to work on the scientific field and help the society by this way.

Business Plan
Helping the iGEM community  -With this section we aim help other iGEM teams by providing a guideline for writing a successful business plan. Further more we present Biolink, a revolutionary way of 3D printing biofilms into a desired form, adding control, replicability and automation       over classical biofilm formation methods.
How to Write a Business Plan
A business plan is useful for more than just attracting investors. For example, we wrote our business plan not for starting a business, but for exploring the business perspectives of our project. In this way, both the audience and the team can complement classical scientific and social understanding with a business view. We want to help future iGEM teams to write a business plan specific to their project, so that the business perspective is more thoroughly addressed in future iGEM projects. Therefore, we propose a few guidelines, and direct iGEM teams to literature for further details of business plan writing.
Click below for the rest of the business plan guidelines
Start with target audience
Before starting to write a business plan, you should identify the target audience of your project. In general, a business plan is a basic document required by any financial investment source. It is an opportunity of an entrepreneur (who wishes               to create a new venture) to impress investors and attract funding. (Mason, 2004).
However, even if you are not planning to start a business from your iGEM project, writing a business plan can be useful to communicate the key business elements to a different target audience: the iGEM community and the general public.
Structure the Business Plan
A classical model of a Business Plan can be found in literature as described in (Abrams, 2010). There are many books and websites with various advice about writing such a document. The structure can be variable, depending on what information               you want to give and to whom. Regardless of what the theme of the project is, its business plan should include at least the following core chapters:
Executive Summary. The definitory part of any business plan, the executive summary provides a concise and attractive overview of the entire project. It is meant to both inform and catch the audience’s attention. Keep in mind               that it has to be attractive for an audience with various backgrounds - both scientific and nonscientific.
Company / Project overview. High level description of the elements of the business/project and how they integrate with each other. Motivation and core arguments supporting why the project will be a success are included here.
Market / Industry Analysis. The project is"

Ethics Meeting with Dr. Wolbring
Read two papers on Ethics: First a review paper by Keasling called Synthetic Biology for Synthetic Chemistry, which I didn't find super useful as it mostly just focused on defining Synthetic Biology and metabolic engineering.  I also started to read Scenarios for the Future of Synthetic Biology by Stephen Aldrich, James Newcomb, and Robert Carlson.

Overview
Poverty in taking reliable and repeatable measurements remains a key obstacle in establishing synthetic biology as an engineering discipline. The Measurement Committee has been studying the measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) over the last several years by interlab. The most commonly used markers though GFP is in synthetic biology, labs often resort to making relative comparisons, which makes it difficult for labs to share and data and/or constructs.
The goal of the fifth iGEM InterLab Study is to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements by answering the question ""Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD? ""
As we know in the previous study, the fluorescence value measured by a plate reader is an aggregate measurement of an entire population of cells, we need to divide the total fluorescence by the number of cells in order to determine the mean expression level of GFP per cell. Due to the fact that the ""optical density (OD)"" of the sample is an approximation of the number of cells varying from lab to lab, we decided to use a special silica beads that are roughly the same size and shape as a typical E. coli cell to set up a universal, standard ""equivalent concentration of beads"" measurement.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," isolate the correct sequence, we cloned the gRNA into pSB1C3. All samples that we sent for sequencing did not contain the correct sequence of gRNA 1. We repeated this process multiple times, but could not find a correct sequence for gRNA 1. Furthermore, in an attempt to isolate a correct sequence of gRNA 1 we used TOPO cloning to insert our gRNA 1 into the TOPO vector in order to isolate a sequence-confirmed sample of gRNA 1 but had no success finding a correct sequence.
Due to the fact that our base editor could not be assembled, we attempted to incorporate our gRNA into the CAMERA W2.1 base editor. Using PCR we added restriction enzyme sites to W2.1 and our gRNA and attempted assembly using standard restriction enzyme cloning. Unfortunately, our ligations never produced colonies that had an insertion of our gRNAs.
Due to our struggles in cloning the gRNA and the fact that our model demonstrated that this system would not produce the outcomes desired for this system to work we decided to redirect our focus to the oscillatory gRNA system.
Oscillatory gRNA System
Our single cell oscillatory system recording and writing plasmids were ordered from Twist Bioscience as complete plasmids. However once again we had to insert more repeat sequences into the recording plasmid using type II restriction enzyme assembly (BsaI) and DNA oligos as we did with our individual gRNA system. Additionally, we had to remove a spacer sequence from our writing plasmid using type II restriction enzyme assembly (BsaI). This was successfully assembled and sequence-confirmed. Additionally, we successfully modified the CAMERA W2.1 base to remove the gRNA in order to work with this system because our own base editor could not be assembled.
Once all plasmids were assembled and sequence confirmed, we attempted to co-transform all three plasmids into our chassis organism E. coli S1030. However, after multiple attempts, we were unsuccessful in isolated colonies that had successfully up took all three plasmids.
We are continuing to work on co-transforming these plasmids so that we can start this experiment.

Our plasmid containing three off-target gRNA recognition sequences along with 1 target sequence was fully assembled using standard restriction enzyme protocol into the pSB1C3 backbone and sequence confirmed. This plasmid was co-transformed with CAMERA W2.1 base editor plasmid in S1030. We are currently awaiting results and analysis of our on and off-target editing efficiencies, which"

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html,", with some critics warning that the scientists were 'playing god' .
Fears have been raised about the dangers of tinkering with life and releasing malignant bugs. ""We don't yet know what are the social, ethical and even bioweapons implications of this research,"" said Hope Shand of the ETC technology pressure group. The most ominous note was struck by a scientist at MIT: ""The genetic code is 3.6 billion years old. It's time for a rewrite.""
That list has to be taken into account in order to know if fear about synthetic biology is taking more and more importance for uninitiated people.
In a quite different perspective, we can wonder : “how do we qualify a new organism?” Do we have to distinguish that organism from  all “natural living organism”? Thus, Balmer and Martin show us how that organism is qualified by different institutions or personality of synthetic biology.
« Venter’s team calls these minimal genome microorganisms, synthetic biologists more broadly may refer to them as chassis, those in the UK synthetic chemistry field have named them chells »
That different process of discursive marking of synthetic organism will take a part in the debate. Depending on the way we will name it, we will perceive it as organism (conceptually attached to the “living”) or as chassis (referring so to the lexicon of construction, material support) : two ways, two possibilities of perception are offered to us. In the case of using the word “microorganism”, we will include it in the whole group of the living, make it understandable through the evolutionary process or through its autonomy. In the case of the chassis, we will perceive it as something which will help us to build an application, answering to our utilitarian needs.
However, the initial question about naturality and artificiality is still not solved. That point is about to show how the question of qualification is redirected when the debate is happening in scientific or uninitiated field even if the object, the “minimal genome”, doesn't change. When the signified is not the point (which is the point of the biosafety and biosecurity questions), the question of the signifier rises.
C. A false question? ...
The question of concepts of life and nature, the question of the signifier is gradually criticized in Balmer and Martin's report, progressively viewed as a “false question”.
Referring to the work of the philosopher Edward Machery from Pittsburgh University, the authors put into light both the difficulty and, above all, the uselessness of a definition of life. Thus, trying to"

Riboswitch
Abstract
Riboswitches are RNA-based genetic control elements that regulate gene expression in a ligand-dependent fashion without the need for proteins. Herein, we collect theophylline aptamers and their molecular analogues aptamers including adenine, xanthine, 3-methylxanthine, hypoxanthine and caffeine. All these sequences are available in supplemental data. We want to find out correlations among those aptamer sequences and build versatile expression platforms for required aptamer. In order to achieve these goals, we classify the aptamer sequences by analyzing their secondary structures and identify the consensus sequences by sequence alignment (BLAST engine).Finally, we reveal the riboswitches function and structure relationship and suggest design principles for creating new synthetic riboswitches and their platforms.
Analysis
Theophylline
Classify
First, we predicted the secondary structure of the theophylline aptamers by mfold. Then we found that the aptamers can be classified into 3 categories by their secondary structure shapes. The first category aptamers have two loops, the second category aptamers have three loops and the last category aptamers have complex secondary structures which cannot be classified by the number of loops (Figure 1).

Thessaloniki,2018,Team:Thessaloniki#Model#dCas9_-_-_TEXT.html," for which our system works, disagrees with those found in bibliography                     [4][5], we decided to make an experiment to validate the functionality of                     the dcas subsystem. The results of the dcas9 toxicity measurement,                     indicate that dcas is produced, in very good level, without causing any                     problem for the cell growth.
The reason that the concentration of dcas in the model depends that much by                     tetR’s ability to bind to DNA, we believe is due either to wrong                     configuration of tetR or to the modeling of the Doxycycline dose in the                     system. Having received the feedback from the experiment, we wanted to                     correct the model so as to bring the right result. We decided, to not                     change the modeling of the dose, but to adjust the concentration of dcas,                     by changing the aforementioned kd as seen in Fig.4. We ended up, that the                     value of the constant must be equal with as its                     concentration is greatly                     increased for other, bibliography based, values [2].
sgRNA subsystem
The sgRNA is produced by the promoter Pbad, only when he is activated by                     the complex Rhamnose-RhaS. In contrast, with the repressed function of                     dcas, the sgRNA is activated by that complex and that is induced by                     Rhamnose, which we add as a dose to the system.
As shown in Fig.1, the production of protein RhaS is done by the genome of                     the cell and therefore the concentration is independent from changes in its                     copy number of sfGFP. From that fact, we can understand that the complex                     which it creates with Rhamnose has this upper limit in each experiment for                     different copy number. The exact amount of complex and by extension the                     activation for the production of sgRNA, will directly depend from the                     Rhamnose that will be provided to the system.
For the mathematical representation of the system, considered the following                     assumptions:
Inducer dynamic Rhamnose: Stabilization of Rhamnose as soon                             as it’s injected to the solution. As Rhamnose degradation rate is                             quite lower than this of rhaS, we assume that the degradation rate                             of the complex is the same as rhaS degrade. When rhaS degrades the                             free Rhamnose molecule is added to total Rhamnose concentration.
RhaS dimer and binding rate to operator site of PrhaBAD:Like                             in tetR, we assume that Rhas is produced as a d"

Week 1: May 1 - May 3
This week we attended the appropriate safety courses required by our University to work in the lab. Besides that, the undergraduate supervisors presented about the principles of Genetics and Synthetic Biology to the new team members.
Week 2: May 6 - May 10
This week we participated in a general molecular biology workshop to refresh our memory of techniques used in molecular biology.
Week 3: May 13 - May 17
We continued the molecular biology workshop. This week we also divided up into our respective groups for the project and decided research priorities.
Week 4: May 20 - May 24
This week we started to perform literature searches for our element of the project. Our goal is to find a way to link the transcription activator-like effector (TALE) and ferritin elements of the project. We have decided that using a two part system is optimal as this would allow the ferritin subunits to self-assemble without having a TALE protein attached that could potentially interfere with this process. In order to accomplish this we have decided to use coiled-coils. The synthetic IAAL E3 and IAAL K3 coils (Litowski and Hodges, 2002) have been selected to accomplish this. These coils make use of hydrophobic regions composed of leucine and isoleucine to bind to each other (Figure 1). The specificity of these coils is conveyed by the presence of glutamic acid and lysine residue that limit the binding to the formation of coil heterodimers.

The translated polypeptide T will be considered as a transcription factor using the following logical basis. mRNA Elongation will occur if TnaC acts upon the ribosome by stalling it over the terminator site, thus preventing rho-dependent termination. Conceptually, this corresponds to the positive action of a molecule on the initiation of transcription. This resembles the action of an activator (positive transcription factor) on an enhancer sequence. Ergo, the TnaC is considered a transcription factor and modeled as such.
The above two equations show the rate of change of the RNA-polymerase with time, both in its bound and unbound forms.
3. Formation of the protein GFP:
The above two DEs show the rate of change of concentration of the mRNA and the peptide forms of the protein GFP.                 The below reactions correspond to the degradation of the above species:
Results
The below is the model of the adaptor containing the constitutive RBS, designed in the SimBiology applet in MATLAB,
ACTIVE STATE
The Stop time was set to 118,800 seconds (33 HOURS) and the following plot was generated:
INACTIVE STATE
Since the constitutive RBS does not have an inactive conformation, GFP is produced constitutively irrespective of the conditions. However, considering any other riboswitch in its stead, the plot may look like this:
Clearly there is no GFP production when the adaptor is placed under the inactive conformation of the riboswitch.
GFP PRODUCTION WITHOUT AN ADAPTOR:
Here we have designed a standard genetic model, consisting of a promoter, an RBS and the GFP gene. On simulating this model, the plot obtained looked like this:
This was essential to our further understanding of the adaptor. The comparison between the two cases clearly showed a difference in their production; in the model without adaptor, GFP production started almost instantaneously, i.e., from time t=0. But in the model containing the adaptor, GFP production starts after a while. From this, we were able to infer that the adaptor has more control and does not permit much basal transcription.                     Furthermore, it was also inferred that by replacing the constitutive RBS present upstream of the adaptor with a translational riboswitch, we can gain even more transcriptional control.                     From the above model, the following conclusions can be made:                      1. The team got to understand the workings of the adaptor with the help of the model                                          2. The adaptor reduces the level of basal expression                      3.  By replacing the constitutive"

Collaboration with Paris Bettencourt iGem Team 2016
This year’s Macquarie University iGem team continued a tradition of collaboration by assisting the Paris  Bettencourt iGem Team with their project. The Paris team’s project this year involves determining the enzymes involved in the break- down of pigment molecules in wine. The idea for this project stems from the fact that wine stains on clothes are amongst the hardest  stains to remove, requiring, amongst others, perchloroethylene, which is listed as a possible human carcinogen. As such, finding an  alternative method to removing wine stains would be beneficial to human health. The need for collecting samples from vineyards stems  from the idea that certain organisms contain enzymes that are able to degrade wine pigments such as anthocyanins and tannins. Collecting these samples would enable the isolation and identification of these enzymes.
The many quality wine producing regions of Australia made collaborating with the Paris team for their iGem project seem a natural fit for collecting the required samples. After discussing with the Paris team about their requirements, we were able to collect two samples from a vineyard here in Australia for their project. The first sample was a falcen tube of soil obtained from an located around the roots of a vine. The second sample contained contain vine bark, as well as shoots from both last year’s vintage, and this year’s vintage. A more detailed description of the samples obtained is as follows:
Sample 1
The soil sample comes from what is originally clay soil. 16 years ago, the soil was improved with large amounts of cow manure, and other nutrients. No such improvements have occurred since then, although there is the occasional top up with chicken manure only. The soil was obtained from the base of the trunk, just under the top soil, near vine roots.
Sample 2
There are three components to sample 2. There is bark off the trunk of the vina, a shoot from last seasons vintage, and a new shoot for this seasons vintage.
Given samples were being sent overseas. Customs forms for both France and Australia needed to be completed detailing what was"
