Hybrid promoters
Pre-decoder
In a first step two promoters were cloned together. The promoter controling mCherry expression is repressible by TetR and cI while the promoter controling eCFP expression is repressible by LacI and cI. To verify the expectations we used the pSEVA-LacI-tetR to test our construct for 4 distinct expression conditions.
TOP10 cells cotransformed with the pSEVA-LacI-tetR and the pre-decoder plasmid were grown in 250 mL shaking flask in LB containing  Ampicillin and Kanamycin. After a certain time, each pre-culture was aliquoted into 4 shaking flasks containing:
1. No inducer: LacI as well as TetR (due to the leakiness of the tac promoter) are present and bind to the Lac & Tet operator regions. No output.
2. IPTG: LacI cannot repress the tac promoter anymore, TetR is expressed. TetR represses the expression of mCherry. On the other hand the promoter controling eCFP is active. Blue output.
3. aTc: LacI is expressed, TetR is not there, mCherry is expressed. eCFP cannot be produced as LacI binds to the LacO operator region. Red output.
4. IPTG & aTc: mCherry as well as eCFP are expressed. Red and blue output.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project Chemotaxis Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," the seed is steady and time-independent. Hence, the modelling of bacterial population chemotaxis will be built with different patterns of chemoattractant distribution.
3.2 Description
This part of the modelling focused on creating a movement model of a bacterial population for chemotaxis. In chemotaxis, chemoreceptors sense an increase in the concentration of a chemoattractant and then send a signal that suppresses tumbling. Simultaneously, the receptor becomes increasingly methylated. Conversely, a decrease in the chemoattractant concentration increases the tumbling frequency and causes receptor demethylation. The tumbling frequency is approximately 1 Hz when flagellar movement is unbiased, and decreases to almost zero as the bacteria move up a chemotatic gradient[5]. In order to accurately built this model, the following assumptions were made based on literature:
1)  During the directed movement phase, the mean velocity at which E. coli moves is 24.1 μm/s[7]. Whereas during the tumbling phase, the speed is insignificantly slower and can be neglected.
2) E. coli usually takes the previous second as their basis on deciding whether the concentration has increased or not. Therefore, in our model the bacteria will be able to compare the concentration of chemoattractant at t seconds to that at t-1 seconds.
3) In our model, we ignored that E. coli do not travel in a straight line during a run, but take curved paths due to unequal firing of flagella.
4) Our model did not consider the growth of bacteria or the tendency of bacteria to congregate into a small area due to quorum sensing.
In the model, the bacteria should be able to compare the chemoattractant concentration at the current time point to the concentration at the previous second. If the concentration decreases (i.e. Ct1-Ct2 ≤0), the bacteria will tumble with a frequency of 1 Hz. If the concentration increases (Ct1-Ct2>0), the tumbling frequency decreases, hence the probability of tumbling decreases. From equation 10 in reference [6], we know that when Ct1-Ct2 >0, the probability of tumbling decreases as an exponential function of chemostatic constant, bacterial velocity , concentration difference between adjacent time points and angle between the two time points. Therefore, we can condense the above description into the following statement[8]:

Sweet Sensing Yeast
Description
Low-caloric artificial sweeteners (LAS) and Low-caloric natural sweeteners (LNS) are among the most widely used food additives worldwide, regularly consumed by lean and obese individuals alike. With the improvement of people's living standard，desired sweeteners are expected far more eagerly due to the growing living level and the developing science technology. The goal of this work is to introduce the human sweet receptor T1R2-T1R3 system to create a practical application of a sweetener sensor using an engineered yeast strain. Initially，we replacing the endogenous yeast G-protein Ste2 with the human sweet receptor T1R2-T1R3, additionally, we deleted some genes to further improve the sensitivity of the T1R2-T1R3 reporter signal. And we also introduce a RFP expression cassette to characterized the relative sweetness degree by RFP fluorescence intensity. Our work will assist the development of a fluorescence-based - sweetening agent sensing system using engineered yeast.
GPCRs constitute the largest family of membrane proteins and are involved in the majority of signal transduction. The common architecture of GPCRs has a seven transmembrane domain structure (Fredriksson et al., 2003; Takeda et al., 2002) that responds to a remarkable range of stimuli, including neurotransmitters, hormones, and ions (Lefkowitz and Shenoy, 2005). G proteins are binary switches that are ‘oﬀ’ when bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and ‘on’ when bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The P-loop is responsible for the correct positioning of the triphosphate moiety of the bound nucleotide (M. Saraste,1990). Activation of the G protein stabilises the eﬀector binding site via an interaction with a conserved threonine residue in switch I and a glycine residue in the switch II region, which form hydrogen bonds with the γ-phosphate of GTP in combination with a Mg2+ cofactor. This functionality is conferred by an ∼20 kDa G"

Our collaboration has been mutually beneficial: We have gained an understanding of the second type of optimization with the option of future implementation into our work, while being able to help Edinburgh with inevitable problems, which arose when simulating systems.
Specifically, we helped the Edinburgh team to identify their system as being stiff, which requires different techniques to solve, for example better stability properties of the integrators. Additionally, the Edinburgh team required help to solve the nonlinear equations that arose from the model.

Danish iGEM meetup
Enjoying a beer in the sun, discussing ideas and the upcoming jamboree. The past couple of years the Scandinavian iGEM teams have met  over a weekend to discuss projects, experiences, and presentations. This year, it was our turn to host the event. Unfortunately, only Danish teams had a chance to participate, as the chosen weekend coincided with the start of the new semester.  The first day of the meetup featured team building exercises and (in the spirit of great Danish tradition) a beer to get the talk going amongst the teams. The following morning, we presented our projects and preliminary posters, got feedback for improvements in preparation of the Jamboree, and discussed lab-related topics during a workshop. And importantly, we enjoyed each other’s company and exquisitely nerdy humor.
Bricks of Knowledge:
During the meetup, we heard about the University of Copenhagen’s Bricks of Knowledge-project and decided to support the great initiative. We made a short movie about what we have learned in terms of keeping order in lab to conserve an overview of the project. We believe we did this quite well, and our little tips were included in the video. This video can be seen on the website of the 2013 University of Copenhagen iGEM team.

- Today I learned how to make a basic GUI in java and use the text fields in this GUI to create format, person, and part objects using the Clotho core.  I also learned how to save the part object to the database and make a basic status text label.  Most of all though, I learned that it takes more than five minutes to write your first app.

- After boot camp, Jenhan taught me about BioFab and we discussed the separation between the BioFab IDE and the functionality of the tools.  We think that this needs to be set in stone before we develop our tools, or else there will be compatibility issues between the iPhone style widget and BioFab.

- Today I implemented a search function in my PADS GUI.  I'm currently trying to separate the returned collection by parts/formats/vectors etc.  Most of my time has been spent learning layouts and swing.  I'm also trying to generalize our permutation problem by looking for any modularity that might exist as the number of parts increases.  Jenhan had the interesting idea that maybe, rather than find a general algorithm, we might need to find ways to optimize brute force methods of invertase placing...
6/8/11
- Implemented a dynamic tabbed search bar today based on the code from the BioFab's search tool.  Jenhan and I are going to fix this up a little and replace the BioFab search with it.  We thought this would not only be useful for the BioFab widget but that people could use it for other apps if necessary (I might use it in my PADS app).  Also, Swapnil and I discussed a few different sorting methods that are similar to our invertase problem.  I'm still trying to play with ideas and make generalizations.  I think that these algorithms will be a good starting position.

[17] [18] Since transiently and even semi-stably transfected cells do not propagate the transfected DNA indefinitely, repeated transfection of cells would be unwise due to the high consumption of time and ressources. Therefore, we created three stable cell lines that chromosomally encode the respective receptor constructs. For this purpose we used the Flp™-System by invitrogen. The three compound system consists of HEK-TRex™-293 cells that harbour one chromosomal Flp recombination target (FRT) site, a Flp recombinase expression plasmid and the plasmid encoding the receptor as well as another FRT site for stable integration. [19] The detailed principle of the integration is described in the figure below.
Cells that succesfully integrated the plasmid into their genome will lose their resistance for Zeocin™, but become resistant to hygromycin B (hygB) as the plasmid encodes the hygB-phosphotransferase, a kinase inactivating hygB by phophorylation. [20] Thus, successfully transfected cells can be easily selected via hygromycin B. To ensure that the resistence does not come from non-integrated plasmid, this process takes several weeks and divison cycles.

The succesful integration of the pcDNA plasmids was verified by genome-PCR (see methods). Therefore, we designed three primers: One that binds to the SV40 promotor and part of the following FRT site, one that binds part the hygromycin restistance gene and another one for the lacZ-Zeocin sequence. In the event of stable integration, the size of the amplicons will be around 550 bp, according to the distance between the SV40 and the hygromycine resistance gene. Wheareas in case of no integration the amplicon size will be around 400 since this corresponds to the distance between the SV40 and the lacZ-Zeocin sequences.
The results are shown in figure on the right. The lower band visible in the samples 2-5 leads us to the conslusion that, despite hygromycine selection, the cells are not yet"

Week 30
After multiple design iterations based on literature and consultations with field experts we have decided it is time to start building different parts from our system.
.
Building CAT-Seq
Week 31
We have started to build our first activity recording system prototype and immediately found the first issue with our initial prototype: the usage of circular ssDNA template.
More
Firstly, it was extremely difficult to make circularized ssDNA templates, as ssDNA is highly unstable and the strand removal from dsDNA and circularization reactions were resulting in low yields even after weeks of various optimizations.
Secondly, the final elongated DNA concentration we got in each droplet after the prototype workflow was extremely low. Each time, it was sub-nanogram amounts of DNA. That was because initially in each droplet there was on average one template of circularized ssDNA. As phi29 elongates that ssDNA template during the amplification step, it still does not make enough of a difference to increase the DNA yield significantly, even when generating millions of droplets in a single experiment. Moreover, after phi29 elongates the ssDNA molecule it creates another long ssDNA molecule, therefore second strand synthesis needs to be performed, which is also far from 100 percent efficient. Considering that nanopore sequencing requires at least of 100 ng to 1000 ng of starting template, we immediately knew we had a serious prototype design flaw in our hands.

Week 32
In hopes of finding a quick and elegant solution to our problem stemming from the usage of single stranded DNA template we have met with Audrius Laurynėnas from the Institute of Biochemistry at Vilnius University.
More
We knew that Audrius has in-depth knowledge about Phi29 and similar isothermal polymerases. We have discussed about different ways that phi29 or any other isothermal polymerase could be applied to our case to solve our current issues.
The meeting was concluded with the idea to try and use the Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) reaction together with random hexamers instead of elongating one long single stranded DNA molecule from the circular ssDNA template. Firstly, this would both allow us to use double stranded circular DNA which would make the preparation for experiments much quicker and easier. Secondly, in each droplet the MDA reaction would yield a lot more DNA.
Audrius also suggested that we should model our MDA reaction first in order to know what length distribution of product we should expect and what effect the substrate nucleotide might have"
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and small strongyles was consistent with Vidilabs needs, indicating that the majority of each stakeholder had the same view of the current situation. This was noticeable in the concern regarding small strongyles, contradicting some of our skeptical sources. In addition, we used the opportunity to gather data about how a GMO based diagnostic tool would be perceived among horse owners.
Also, to advocate our stance that the amount of treatments can be optimized, we needed to know the mean amount of treatments performed on each horse per year. We received this data as part of our market analysis. Our predictive model simulating the extent of strongyle infection depending on the amount of anthelmintic treatments suggests that the current situation can indeed be optimized. Fewer treatments than the average today would decrease the risk of developing anthelmintic resistance and still keep the horses healthy.
The market analysis gave us insight into the horse-owners perspective and it resulted in the objective data that we needed to draw our conclusions. We used the data from the survey to confirm our project strategy and to build our different models.
The survey was translated into 10 different languages, making it a truly international feat (see table 1).

Market Analysis
Ethics
The purpose of our project was to combat the systematic overuse of anthelmintics and thus also address the growing resistance against such compounds [1]. Resistance may arise from multiple factors, like that of mass treatment, under-dosing and not varying the drugs used [2]. These factors may sound familiar, because this is not unlike how resistance against antibiotics arise in bacteria [3].
The resistance against anthelmintics might also be a problem for humans in the future which increases the motivation for a new diagnosis and/or treatment approach [4]. This is “good” news since the organism used in our project (namely E. coli) are inherent to the microbiome of humans and horses alike. We believe that a new, specific and potentially eco-friendly method of diagnosis or treatment would have a positive outcome on society as a whole. This could lower the degree of stress and potential suffering for animals that get infected as well as for their human owners.
There are however some concerns in the public about E. coli being pathogenic or a transmitter of disease. It’s often the incidence when E. coli contaminated meat for consumption gets coverage in news media."

7/18/2015: Day 33
MIT and the BU iGEM team came over to Wellesley today. We had a lot of fun testing our prototype with students that came today.  Also we got to hear their feedback on our project and they gave us some wonderful suggestions. Also, we got to hear what the other teams have been working on since we last met. It was super cool for them to come over and play with all the gadgets in the lab!
7/20/2015: Day 34
We spend a lot of time on functionality today as well.
21/7/2015: Day 35
We got the status bars to work today! They were easier to make than we expected them to be. The status bars decrease automatically as time passes! We also talked to Anja and Romie briefly. They gave us feedback on our current prototype and also gave us updates on the wetlab portion that they are working on.
22/7/2015: Day 36
Today, Casey sent us more images. They sent us message bubbles for us to insert into our prototype. So we incorporated the new message bubbles that guide users during the experience. In addition, we also tested the prototype with 3 high school interns.  We looked to see how they interacted with our current prototype. We also asked them for feedback.
23/7/2015: Day 37
This morning, WE FIXED ONE OF THE MAJOR BUGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH FOR THE PAST WEEK. Wohoo, we realized that there was something wrong with how we constructed the marker recognition. We fixed by simply creating a new array when the plasmid is cleared. It was such a simple fix. We also realized that Johanna is a wonderful human and gave us a lot of suggestions. If Johanna is around, everything ends up working out.  Also, around 50 kids from Upward Bound came in today to test our prototype and provided us with a lot of wonderful feedback.
24/7/2015: Day 38
We worked on various things. We wrote and submitted our two abstracts that are due for the Wellesley Summer Science Research. We also looked at the various bugs that we found yesterday, and we fixed a couple. We also changed some formatting and switched from buttons to tabs for some of the information that will accompany the exhibit.

When the temperature is high enough to give yeast heat shock, expression of reporter gene is induced,showing green fluorescence. On the contrary, if our rebuilt yeasts exist in relatively low temperature, green fluorescence is invisible.
Propri-ontein looks like an open tool box, because the downstream gene can be any genes of interest and we can use this circuit to control the expression of many genes by giving it heat shock or GdnHCL. In our experiments, we use GFP as downstream reporter gene to test the function of our circuits.

Team Work
Ideas
Our project came out from months of brainstorming and was first proposed by Kairan Zhang on June with solid foundation laid after great amount of synthetic biology-related readings. Being the core of this project Zhang has been continuously giving new thoughts as well as advice on the project design throughout the season, and has carried out great improvement on our device.
Biobricks
Peixiang He, Zhihan Liang, Zhixiang Liu and Yirui Hong were mainly responsible for biobrick-related works in wet lab. They were capable of engineering unique bacteria that express exactly how we wanted them to. It is also their efforts on preparing engineered bacteria for further properties examination in cell and mouse experiments.
Cell Experiments
Cancer cell lines HT29 and normal epithelial cell lines HACAT were cultured by Yuncong Ran, Shiyu Sun, Ruoyu Xia and Shihao Bai to serve as the subjects for multiple short peptides adhesive property examinations. The examinations aimed to testify the specificity of antigen-antibody binding between our bacteria and different cell lines.
Mouse Experiments
Mouse experiments are among the most important parts of our projects and they are mainly designed and performed by Shuyu Zheng and CHIA-YI HSIAO, including diseased mouse model induction as well as device testifying.
Ultrasound imaging
Ultrasound-related experiments were mainly designed and performed by Qingwei Fang. He also developed the Matlab code for ultrasound image processing job. And Shiyu Sun carried on doing this job when Qingwei was overwhelmed with the team wiki.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Project#dsf_-_-_TEXT.html," cellular c-di-GMP relieves inhibition of the transcriptional activator Clp , which is then free to bind to the manA promoter and allow transcription of the downstream genes5. In our synthetic system (as shown in Fig 1) we fused the manA promoter to promoter-less gfp to give a fluorescent output.
Building the DSF Sensor
Chromosomal DNA from Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris 8004 was kindly gifted to us by Drs Robert Ryan and Shi-Qi An from the Division of Molecular Microbiology in the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee. This was used as template for the amplification of the rpfC, rpfG and clp genes, and the manA promoter region.
The manA promoter region was cloned into the pSB1C3 plasmid (to give BioBrick BBa_K1315006 ), and was then subcloned into pBluescript. Promoterless gfp was amplified (using BBa_K562012 as a template), and was cloned into pBluescript downstream of the manA promoter. The manA promoter-gfp construct was then subcloned into pUniprom. A schematic of our completed construct can be seen below (Fig 2).
To adhere to the iGEM rules and regulations, it was necessary to remove three specified illegal PstI restriction sites and one EcoRI site present in rpfC. We also removed one illegal EcoRI site from rpfG and one illegal PstI site from clp. Each of the modified genes were individually cloned into the pSB1C3 plasmid (to give BioBricks BBa_K1315002 , BBa_K1315003 , BBa_K1315005 , respectively. The genes were then sequentially subcloned into the pUniprom vector that already harboured PmanA-gfp. To facilitate immunochemistry we chose to supply each of RpfC, Clp and RpfG with an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) tag which can be detected with commercial antibodies. This tag was added to the C-terminus of each protein.
The plasmid was verified by sequencing.
The completed construct was transformed into E.coli strain MC1061 as a chassis for our biosensor.
Characterisation
A series of western blots were performed to test for the sequential production of each of the HA-tagged proteins. We transformed our plasmid series (encoding RpfC-HA, RpfC-HA"

Firstly, looking at the differences in RBS strength - if we compare test device 1 and 4 which both contain the same promoter, J23101, but different ribosome binding sites (test device 1 containing B0034 and test device 4 containing J364100). Looking at the comparison between test device 1 and test device 4 it can be seen that test device 4 is only fluorescing at roughly 40% the rate of test device 1 and so the B0032 ribosome binding site is about 2.5 times as strong as the J364100. However, if we compare test device 2 and 5, which both have the same promoter –J23106- but different RBS, in these it appears that the B0032 RBS is 5 times stronger than the J364100 RBS. Furthermore, this value increases even more when comparing test device 3 and 6- both containing the J23117 promoter and in this case, is appears that the B0032 RBS is almost 20 times as strong as J364100.
Next, looking at the relative strengths of the promoters, test device 1, 2 and 3 all contain the B0032 ribosome binding sites but different promoters so can be used to compare the efficiencies of the promoters. Test device 1 contains the J23101 promoter, 2 the J23106 promoter and 3 the J23117 promoter. In the case of these test devices the J23101 promoter appears to be 3 times as strong as J23106 and almost 20 times as strong as J23117. Looking at the other trio that can be used to compare promoter strengths – test devices 4, 5 and 6- that all contain the J364100 RBS, from these J23101 appears almost 7 times stronger than J23106 and over 100 times stronger than J23117.
Discussion
Firstly, in regard to the strengths of the promoters our results corroborate what was already known about the strengths of the promoters, with J23101 being the strongest and J23117 being the weakest. However, the relative strengths of them seems to ask more questions than it answers from previous results. It had been previously seen that when the promoters relative red fluorescent protein expression levels were studied J23101 was 1.5 times as strong as J23106 and around 10 times stronger than J23117 [3] however when we compared them using GFP our relative strengths of expression, although they followed the same pattern, did not"

iGEM Safety Questions
1. Would our project raise any safety issues in terms of:
Researcher safety- Certain chemicals used in our research may be harmful ie. ethidium bromide when running agar gels. The safety issues are covered in COSHH assessments and safety protocols will be followed. Bunsen burners are used when making agar plates for sterility need to follow safe working practices for bunsens. Need to use aseptic techniques to avoid contamination with bacteria from us and to us. Also we will be handling hot agar so care should be taken not to burn ourselves by using oven gloves. Throughout our research we will follow health and safety regulations required by law. To add to this university health and safety policies will be enforced to ensure researcher safety.
Public safety- If our Biosystems were to be used as a commercial device, the effects that it would be have on the environment and wildlife would have to be considered; as well as possibly contamination it could cause. This is a concern as the plasmid we are using to carry our genes contains an antibiotic resistance gene which could be transferred to other virulent bacteria. Therefore a kill switch will be inserted into our plasmid with will allow us to kill bacteria easily if a containment issue occurred. Therefore this would will stop the creation of any dangerous, resistant bacterial strains hence keeping"

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics conclusions_-_-_TEXT.html," a necessary relation between the existence of a God and sacred or holy properties of life.
Although many people think that the reductionist approach can reveal the properties of biological systems, there is an almost equally big group that is not yet sure about this. The lack of a majority that either agrees or disagrees with the statement shows that there is no concise answer for this question. Contrastingly, the majority of the scientific community does support the holistic approach of describing complex biological systems with emerging properties. The questions remaining: can we ever characterize the emerging properties? Can a living system ever be explained completely materialistically?
Materialists believe that all things are composed of matter and all phenomena are the result of material interactions.  A plurality of 40% believes that life can be explained materialistically, versus 19% that rejects this statement. A rather large group does not choose sides and keeps his answer in the middle. There might be a conflict between the traditional perception of life where it is thought that living systems are just too complex to understand and the breakthroughs in science getting closer and closer towards explaining life. Will the scientific community ever be able to reveal the principles of life completely, or will there always be things we cannot understand? Supposedly time will tell. Or not, depends on what you believe. Although research has given us indication that life is purely physical and can be explained materialistically, there is a chance that we will never figure out its foundation.
Insight in the goals of synthetic biology can help in defining the fields where possibly more regulation is needed. The most popular reasons to work in synthetic biology appear to be sharing knowledge of fundamental processes in biology  and social objectives, using synthetic biology for applications in fields such as medicine and the bio-fuel industry.
One of the problems in science in general is the way to communicate research to the public. It gets even more difficult when controversial subjects raise ethical issues that might be hard to understand without any scientific background knowledge. Informing the public is perceived to be necessary, but the media apparatus and the scientific community should generally work together on getting a clear unbiased and easy-to-access story out, rather than publishing controversial and misleading headlines to draw attention. Moreover, debating ethical issues in synthetic biology together with the general public is assumed to be even more important. Researchers have to work together with governmental institutions to identify, characterize and possibly find solutions to issues emerging from synthetic biology.
When discussing ethical questions concerning the implications of the approaches in synthetic biology, the ultimate questions that always come up are: ""what is life?"" and ""what is natural?"". Furthermore, can the reductionist approach ever lead to an explanation of"

As of the time of writing, our team was in the process of troubleshooting the final regulatory construct.
Applications
Our proposed system has many practical uses. Bionanotemplating could be used to generate biologically inert medical devices, precision crafted parts, nanochips, and many other useful products. The advantage of our system over contemporary industrial processes is that bionanotemplating can be done at room temperature and often with mild reagents. In contrast, industrial implementations have great energy demands due to the extreme heat which is often necessary to produce these products and frequently requires the use of caustic chemicals.
Our system is designed to work primarily in two dimensions and has limited capabilities for producing complex three dimensional structures. Further enhancements might include use of IR/heat-shock induction to facilitate complex three dimensional constructs. Furthermore, this technology could be expanded to nucleate different materials to produce a broader array of products. For example, our team postulated the use of this technology to develop bio-mimetic bone materials which might allow doctors to generate biologically compatible bone grafts in the exact physical dimensions required by a patient.

C stands for the control group in which the filter paper is dropped with 5 \(\mu\)L DMSO; T stands for the experimental group in which the filter paper is dropped with 5 \(\mu\)L 5% l-limonene.
According to the data we get, we did simple analysis, of which we used the ratio of the number of nematodes distributed on two sides and drew a histogram(Fig.6). In the histogram, nematodes distribution of experimental group show significant difference that nematodes prefer limonene.
Fig.6 Proportion of nematodes' distribution.
During our verification of attraction of limonene, we analyzed 20 samples. In order to verify if there is any difference between test group and the control group at statistic level, we used paired t test. The methods are as follows:
The confidence of the following is 0.05, α=0.05. Firstly, we used the normality test. We selected the single sample K-S test to verify whether it had normality.
Judging standard of the single sample K-S test.
If P > 0.05, it has normality, otherwise it doesn’t have normality.

Even though the trait bracelet activity appeared childish, many parents and teachers were intrigued by the uniqueness of each person’s trait bracelet leading them further to inquire how our genomes work and transitioned to how genomes can be edited.
According to Mrs. Paulson, “The Broad Run iGEM assisted well over 100 kindergarten through 5th grade students as they completed three DNA investigations. They worked very well with the students and provided a meaningful learning experience!.”

Synthetic Biology 101: An Evening of Casual Science Conversations
October 28, 2015, Washington DC
At the American Microbiology Society’s Synthetic Biology 101: An Evening of Casual Science Conversations organized by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, we met with microbiology experts and researchers in the DC Metro Area. Speaking to a largely technical audience, our team members presented our research and networked with leaders in the molecular biology industry. Through showcasing our poster and iGEM wiki, we engaged in stimulating conversations, from the significance of iGEM to us as high school students, to our shared vision with iGEM about the importance of engaging the public on the safety and ethics of synthetic biology.
Panel Discussion at DC Fab Lab
November 12, 2015
Our team was invited to speak at Woodrow Wilson International Center’s panel discussion on synthetic biology and DIY Bio at the FabLab, DC’s premier makerspace. The only students on a panel of synthetic biology experts and leaders in the budding DIY bio community, we shared our unique perspective. Our team discussed our research, voiced our opinions on broader issues concerning synthetic biology, and emphasized the importance of teamwork and leadership in research. The Panel Discussion was moderated by Dr. Todd Kulken of the Woodrow Wilson International Center’s Synthetic Biology Project.

Lab Work Strategies
1. PCR up sleB and RBS using EcoRI and XbaI (Primer JJ1 – 5’) and SpeI (Primer JJ2 – 3’) as illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1: RBS + sleB
Labwork:
1.1 Perform PCR with Primer JJ1 and Primer JJ2 on wild type Bacillus subtilis, where the sleB region will be amplified.  1.2 Carry out DNA gel electrophoresis after the amplification of the DNA in Step 1.1, and we should see a fragment of approximately 918bp.
2. Cut pSB1AT3 or pSB1A2 (BioBrick compatible vector, already have it in stock) with EcoRI and SpeI, then purify backbone fragment using kit to get rid of mCherry.
Figure 2: Cut mCherry out of the plasmid backbone (pSB1AT3 or pSB1A2)
Figure 3: Remaining backbone fragment after cutting out mCherry
Labwork:
2.1 Carry out restriction digest using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and SpeI, where the DNA segment mCherry is cut. 2.2 The DNA segment is then analysed via gel electrophoresis where the shorter fragment would be mCherry, and the longer fragment, the backbone fragment. 2.3 Use kit to process the backbone DNA fragment.

BBa_K2790004 (P2A1)
This composite part can be used for the expression of three proteins (sMMO C- 1047bp, sMMO D- 312bp and sMMO Y- 1170bp) from the methanotrophic bacteria M. capsulatus. The sequences of these 3 proteins are codon optimised for expression in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris. These three proteins are subunits of the enzyme methane monooxygenase which converts methane into methanol. The expression is driven by the strong constitutive GAP promoter from P. pastoris and ends with the AOX terminator from P. pastoris. The three genes are linked together with viral peptide P2A sequences and hence, their mRNA will be transcribed as a whole but during translation, they will form individual polypeptides due to ribosome skipping a peptide bond between the proline and glycine residue at the C-terminus of the viral 2A peptide. This construct drastically reduces the expression cassette size since each of the genes need not be flanked by their own promoter and terminator rather can be controlled by a single promoter similar to a prokaryotic operon. Also, the order of the genes in the construct is insignificant since the 2A peptides would give a similar expression for the three proteins. In total, this part provides an expression casette for the constitutive expression of three sMMO subunits codon optimised for P. pastoris but can also be expressed in S. cereviseae.

Colicin Production
Here we show a glimpse of our results.We have successfully expressed bacteriocins (colicins and microcin) in Escherichia coli and have used them to kill wild-type bacteria. Here below, you can see the observed effect produced by our colicins.
To check the different colicin activities, we used different Petri dishes of wild type Escherichia coli. After 10h of growth, we added 100 µL of the different liquid colicin-producer cultures to each plate. Finally, 20h later we checked the plates back and noticed a blue halo, indicating death of wild type E. coli (left image). As you can see on the right image, the negative control plates did not present this coloring.
Why is this important?
Our project is about killing bacteria and that activity is exerted by bacteriocins, such as colicins. That blue halo means that the strains we have on the fridge is perfect for our objectives.
We want to study the different colicin and microcin properties regarding pH-dependence, minimum active concentration, time dynamics, etc.
In order to gather all this information we designed different experiments. Unfortunately, we are still lacking enough experimental results, so most of the statistical and mathematical models we have developed are not validated, yet. Even so, we can advance that the activity vs. concentration model follows a logistic growth model.
Antimicrobial peptides
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of gene-encoded natural antibiotics found in all living organisms. In multicellular organisms, such as mammalians, defensins and cathelicidins  are a principal component of innate immunity. In unicellular organisms, bacteriocins function to suppress competitor species. AMPs kill bacteria by disruption of membrane integrity and are less likely to induce resistance than common antibiotics, so they have attracted attention in different fields such as medicine and food safety.
Bacteriocins
Bacteriocins are lethal to bacteria other than the producing strain. As a group, bacteriocins are heterogeneous and"

Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," was present in these conditions.
Figure 2. Shows data of MG1655 cells inoculated with 100 ml agar.
From the data shown here we can see that the feed stored in refrigerated conditions continued to grow and although more cells did remain in the product, the product again went mouldy after 4 weeks. The same experiment stored under nitrogen gave a gradual decrease in cells, which would be expected and again, no mould was found to be present for the duration of testing.
Figure 3. Shows the survival of pcol Ia-ssp2 on coated feed inoculated with a 1 litre PBS solution.
From the data presented here we can see that the number of cells in the fridge stored feed stays roughly constant. The feed stored in nitrogen gave a gradual decrease in cells which was to be expected. This ensures that no unwanted growth was occurring.
Figure 4. Shows the survival of MG1655 cells on coated feed inoculated with a 1 litre PBS solution.
From this data we can see that again the refrigerated feed managed to keep a constantly high number of cells however, some growth was still occurring. The nitrogen stored feed only showed growth in the final week of testing.
Conclusion
To test if our product is capable of killing E.coli cells, 0.1% arabinose agar plates were made and MG1655 E.coli cells were grown until an absorbance of 0.1 was recorded. 50ul of this culture was plated out and a coated feed pellet from each construct / strain pressed into the agar. This process was repeated with the slight alteration of mashing the pellet in LB before adding this to the plate.
Through the testing carried out here we can conclude that the optimal storage conditions for our product would be under nitrogen. This is due to the fact that too much unwanted growth was present in the refrigerated feeds which could result in making the livestock ill. This is also backed up by the longer shelf life of the nitrogen stored feed.
ACME Stomach Masher
The science working in the lab is great but we wanted to ask what would happen when our device is taken outside of the lab, since we couldn't bring our device out of the lab we brought the outside in.
We designed a piece of hardware, (ACME Stomach Masher) which would simulate a part of the intestinal tract, which our colicin producing bacteria in the BactiFeed would be exposed to: the stomach. The stomach exerts mechanical stress, amongst other stresses, on the contents of the stomach. To prove that the BactiFeed we designed would"

A it is believed that the auxin should be kept at a very close region around the root (0.25 cm [4]), therefore it is very important to obtain the number of chemoreceptors needed on individual bacterium that enables the it to stay close to the plant root/seed from modeling.
In addition, modeling of chemotaxis of bacteria population is also valuable for us to capture the overview of movement of bacteria around the plant root; therefore it can potentially inform our project about how and where we can place our bacteria.  Under experiment condition, the chemoattractant diffuses all the time from the source. However, in real soil, the root produces malate all the time, therefore we assume that the distribution of chemoattractant outside the root is steady and time-independent. Hence, the modeling of bacteria population chemotaxis will be built with different patterns of chemoattractant distributions.
Chemotaxis Pathway
The chemotaxis pathway in E.Coli is demonstrated in Figure 1. MCPs form stable ternary complexes with the CheA and CheW proteins to generate signals that control the direction of rotation of the flagellar motors [5].  The signaling currency is in the form of phosphoryl groups (p), made available to the CheY and CheB effector proteins through autophosphorylation of CheA[1].CheY-p initiates flagellar responses by interacting with the motor to enance the probability of ‘run’ [1]. CheB-p is part of a sensory adaptation circuit that terminates motor responses [1]. MCP complexes have two alternative CheA autokinase activity; When the receptor is not occupied by chemoattractant, the receptor stimulates CheA activity [1]. The overall flux of phosphoryl groups to inhibited and stimulated states. Changes in attractant concentration shift this distribution, triggering a flagellar response [1]. The ensuing changes in CheB phosphorylation state alter its methylesterase activity, producing a net change in MCP methylation state that cancels the stimulus signal [1]. Therefore, studying of methylation level, phosphorylation level of CheB and CheY are important to understand chemotaxis of single cell.

Useful Refresher and Initial Lab Completion
For the majority of the morning the second life team was able to get a walkthrough of what has been happening in the lab. It served as a useful refresher to the beginning of the year and included:
The purpose of everyone’s tasks in the lab.
Returning to the original signalling system inside of a cell
The circuits required (signalling, reporter etc.)
How the circuits will be tested.
The virtual lab has basically been completed aside from some structural modifications and position changes within the second lab. Do to permission setting difficulties, these modifications will be made tomorrow when the team members with modify permissions can make changes.
I began working on the framework for DNA replication, which now consists of a double stranded DNA strand that has been separated along with nucleotides for each strand. A representation of helicase will now travel to its respective position along the framework and now I will be working on changing the nucleotide orientation once rezzed behind the DNA polymerase.

2nd half of the tour...
ConocoPhilips have given us a thorough tour through their oil processing plant. Their footprint was much smaller than the Suncor's due to the use of different technologies. Where as the Suncor uses surface mining to collect the bitumin from the mine fields, ConocoPhilips uses what's called in situ method, which uses high temperature steam to lower the viscosity of bitumin, which is then sucked up to the ground. They mainly are looking for solutions to lower the viscosity of bitumin without steam or with lower amount of steam so that they can save some energy related costs, and we may be able to remedy the problem with bacteria. Further research is required regarding this issue.
The oil sand discovery center was very interesting. They provided us with clear demonstrations of how bitumin was extracted and processed, and how thick bitumin actually is. We were also given the opportunity to watch a film regarding the history of the oil sands, which gave us a good idea of the gradual development of the oil sands.

The control construct E, without the N protein. Again three different strengths of promoters strong, medium and weak. It is seen from this and other E-colonies that the B1003 terminator has a very weak effect. B1003 cannot create a visible difference in florescence, or the anti-terminator effect is triggered.
From the plates we further counted the numbers of strong and weak promoters and investigated if the positive feedback mechanism was triggered. Colonies from construct B, with the strong B0015 terminator and from C with the strong single terminator B0011, it was possible to see a clear termination effect in most of the colonies. Further a few colonies with very strong green florescence also had medium to strong red fluorescence. This is an indication on that the positive feedback mechanism from the N protein works. For B construct 15% of the colonies showed this triggered effect and for construct C 19% shows the triggered effect, see the table below.

We did a series of restreaks of the successful series A transformations described above. These were used in the Biolector experiments. We used fluorescent microscopy to confirm the BioLector results and the construct's stability.
The efficiency rate was drastically decreased, as was the consistency regarding terminator efficiency. Most of the colonies that had undetectable levels of GFP appeared to gain a mutation that prevented expression of functional GFP, but when isolated, all except for two colonies from each construct showed detectable levels.

The SgrS BS sequence consist of ptsG sequence, the transcription of the ptsG sequence will produce ptsG mRNA which this mRNA will help to the production of glucose transporter IICBglc , this will help the uptake of glucose . But the mechanism of ptsG to become IICBglc can be blocked by the presence of the SgrS. SgrS can be produced by the help of the SgrR when the concentration of glucose is high

It's a Fluorescent gene which expresses red color once the gene is expressed.
(From  iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden)
SgrS BS + RED color chromoprotein Once the recombinant gene is expressed:
(In the presence a lot of glucose) SgrS will bind with the sequence of recombinant mRNA , and it will degrade the activation of ptsG with the help of RNase and another cofactor, resulting in no red color produced because it's also bind with the ptsG sequence.
(In the presence of low glucose) SgrS will be produced in low level and the number of SgrS is not effective enough to degrade the presence of the ptsG sequence , resulting red color will be still produced.

WESTMINSTER MODELING COLLABORATION
Another model based on the UCL simulation
Since Westminster's iGEM team had not produced a model of their own, and their project has several similarities to ours, we have constructed an additional model, also in C#, and sent this to Westminster's team for them to use. The model simulates bed bugs moving randomly in a cubic room. One of their proposed ""blood traps"" is integrated into the simulation, which visually demonstrates bed bugs being attracted and then subsequently killed by the device.
This simulation was written in C#, in a similar manner to UCL's own model. The animation below shows the model operating. Red dots represent bedbugs; as they move to the bottom-left hand corner of the floor, they are killed and removed from the model.
Below this animation are a couple of graphs demonstrating the potential uses of the model. The first shows the approach of a single bedbug to the device; note the random fluctuation in addition to the directional motion. The second graph shows the effect of room size on time taken for all bedbugs to reach the device and die.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," there are indications that it comes with reduced fitness and increased susceptibility to other antibiotics (20). We thus selected lysostaphin as our main bacteriocin for this project. For more information on lysostaphin’s functioning and the mechanism by which it is secreted, please have a look at our Design page .
Figure 2. The addition of lysostaphin to an S. aureus biofilm will eradicate S. aureus.
Local release
To release lysostaphin locally to the wound, several approaches are possible. In 2016, teams from SDU Denmark as well as from Stockholm designed wound dressings from recombinant spider silk functionalized with antimicrobial peptides. However, the teams described the silk production process as “challenging”. Alternatively, one could pack lysostaphin in a hydrogel. Hydrogels are polymers which swell in contact with water. Thanks to their biocompatibility, similarity to the extracellular matrix and flexibility in chemical and physical properties, they are popular drug delivery vehicles. Their chemical properties can be adapted to bind the drug of interest (21). However, a disadvantage of loading a hydrogel with functional proteins is that the gel will eventually get depleted. Furthermore, the limited half-life of proteins such as lysostaphin will affect their effectivity (18).
An interesting novel approach for sustained release would be the use of a living material. Living materials are a combination of a biocompatible material and living organisms. Both would be specifically chosen and engineered to perform a task as a single device. Such devices could range from drug delivery vehicles to toxicity sensors. An important advantage of the combination of living cells with materials, is the ability of cells to be programmed to compute and to respond to complex external stimuli (1). In our case, the living material can release lysostaphin in response to environmental stimuli such as induction by medical professionals or based on quorum sensing (see Outlook). In contrast to regular biomaterials used as drug delivery vehicles, living materials are suitable for sustained release (figure 3).
Figure 3. The difference of a loaded material versus a living material. Whilst the loaded material will eventually get depleted, the bacteria inside the living material will keep producing fresh proteins.
Several groups have endeavored the construction of living materials. Attempted strategies include the 3D printing of hydrogels with living (bacterial) cells, the incorporation of yeast or bacteria between a polymer support and a nanoporous top layer and the integration of bacteria in hydrogel-elastomer hybrids (3,22–24). Those attempts successfully resulted in the construction of"

Fatty Acid Quantification and Cell Viability
Overview
Since the project measures fatty acid (FA) up take rate at different fatty acid concentrations, cell viability was measured to assure that cells are stable and alive in various FA concentrations. The change of FA uptake rate is expected to be affected by both the inducible and constitutive glyoxylate shunt transfected into human liver cells, respectively.
Cell Line
HepG2 cells were used for testing constitutive and inducible glyoxylate shunt by measuring change in sodium palmitate uptake rate by the cell.  Ultimately, we are testing the glyoxylate shunt inside HepG2 cells, thus it was subject of study in our cell viability test.
Cell Viability
To make sure the whole system we created works well in cells, we also have to use MTT assay to test cell viabilities in different FA concentrations. The optimal goal is to determine the range of optimal concentrations of fatty acids to introduce into HepG2 cell and achieve more than 60% viability after 24 hours incubation and/or more than 50% in 48 hours.
MTT assay description
Cell viability was measured to identify the amount of sodium palmitate that we need in the medium to do our characterization, including to make sure that the enzymes are expressed stably inside cells.  High concentration of sodium palmitate can induce cell death.  We, therefore, had to determine the concentration of sodium palmitate that is high enough to activate our promoter, but not excessive to kill our cells.
MTT assay was used to measure the cell viability. It measures the enzymatic activity of oxidoreductase enzymes that only show activity when the cells are alive. MTT, a tetrazolum dye, is redued into an insoluble formazan , giving a purple color. Organic solvent such as DMSO can be used to dissolve the formazan. Absorbance at 570 is measured"

USTC,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to our algorithm but to the space of the user interface.
It is possible that different schemes may correspond to one expected genetic function. In order to pick out the most feasible circuit design, we weighed many contributing factors to relieve the wet-lab cells of heavy burden and tried our best to eliminate the chances of cross talk and coupling. Fitness score is introduced into our software to measure the applicability and functionality of designed gene circuits. Many synthetic biologists have introduced similar scores to rank functional gene circuits. Our fitness score combines several types of scores to give a comprehensive and reasonable evaluation. Different scores put different emphasis on genetic regulatory processes which can also be influenced by different experimental environments. As a result, using a set of scoring standards, rather than only single one of them, to evaluate different properties of a gene circuit is undoubtedly a better approach to ranking gene circuits.
2.Gene network: See the detailed structure of a designed gene circuit
Function:
A simple click on ""Gene network"" button will lead you to another tab where the detailed structure of your designed gene circuit is shown. When a gene circuit consists of many Boolean gates, it is crucial to understand the internal substances and mechanisms. In this tab, you can see how substances react with each other clearly, such as inhibition and activation in or between Boolean gates.
Details:
As the scale of gene circuits grows larger, the difficulty of construction and measurement can be extremely formidable. Under the circumstances, it cannot be emphasized more to understand the internal substances and mechanisms. When the Boolean gates are combined together, the performance of the integrated system may not be as good as expected, even if the property of each Boolean gate is well understood. In contrast to the design of modern engineering disciplines which are always predictable and have a solid basis of accurate theories, synthetic biology may fall into the consistent process of trial-and-error. Huge cost of repeated experiments therefore becomes one of the constraints for biologists to further standardize Biobricks and devices. Therefore, our software is elaborately designed to provide a platform where biologists can design large-scale gene circuit before realizing them in laboratories.
3.Simulation: Get concentration-time simulation results
Function:
Given a designed gene circuit, such as a simple serial circuit composed of an AND gate and an OR gate, you can use our default parameters and change initial concentration of reactants to get simulation results.
If you want to get different results, you just need to change system parameters such as the rate of reactions, namely, to fill constants into the dialog boxes on our canvas.
What's more, simulation time slot is necessary as well to give concentration-time figures of the inputs and outputs of"

Aug 2 ~ Aug 15, 2010 At first we want to use MySQL to manage our database, later we find Berkeley DBXML is a better tool, so I studied on how to use DBXML. Kun Jiang quickly write an interface using DBXML API and a small PDF instruction, code genius! Finish database format v3.0 – the 3rd version of database, now there are 4 lists, the global, the module, the species, the reactions. Global list stores data that must be pre-defined"

Phage delivery of CRISPR-Cas9
The third part of the project attempts to solve the delivery mechanism problem by using non-replicating recombinant bacteriophage.  The non-replicating phage are created by infecting cells containing helper phagemids (plasmids coding for phage structural proteins), M13K07, with the CRISPR-Cas9 phagemid (a plasmid containing a phage packaging signal), BBa_K1445001.  Similar projects have been published in Nature Biotechnology this year by Professor Marrafini of the Laboratory of Bacteriology at the Rockefeller University in New York¹ and Professor Timothy Lu of the MIT Microbiology Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology².  The results of these studies are promising; however, further refinement of the phage delivery is required to increase virulency rates².

Table 1: Table of parts used for constructing the Fim Switch.
Implementation
To assemble the Fim switch part the isothermal Gibson assembly cloning method was chosen as it would significantly shorten the time taken to assemble 3 separate sequences compared to traditional cloning methods.  The 3 gBlock DNA fragments shown in (Table 1) were amplified by high fidelity Q5 PCR and the pSB1C3 backbone was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI.
Figure 2: High fidelity PCR amplification of the 3 gBlock fragments for assembly of the Fim Switch.  The gBlock-1 amplification is shown in lanes 1+2 (819 bp), gBlock-2 amplification is shown in lanes 3+4 (1148 bp) and the gBlock-3 amplification is shown in lanes 5+6 (939bp).
The Gibson assembly reaction re-forms the iGEM prefix and suffix regions at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the Fim switch part making the component biobrick compatible while leaving no scarring regions.  Following assembly, the plasmid was transformed into chemically competent DH5α E. coli and colonies patched onto LB Chloramphenicol agar plates.  A single patch showed the correct red colour indicative of the eforRed chromoprotein (see Figure 3).
Figure 3: Patches of the Fim Switch transformants.  Patch number 6 shows the correct red colour which indicates expression of the eforRed chromoprotein.
The red patch was cultured in LB chloramphenicol overnight and the plasmid DNA extracted by miniprep.  The plasmid was digested with restriction enzymes XbaI and PstI.  The image in Figure 4 shows the DNA bands from the digested Fim switch plasmid.
Figure 4: Restriction digestion of the Fim switch plasmid to confirm successful integration into the iGEM pSB1C3 backbone.  The Fim switch plasmid (Lane 1) was digested with XbaI and PstI with expected band sizes of (2840 bp and 2044 bp).  The pSB1C3 plasmid (Lane 2) containing sfGFP as a control was also digested with XbaI and PstI with expected band sizes of (811 bp and 2044 bp).
The Fim switch insert is 2882 bp in length which makes performing standard short sequencing reads challenging as multiple reactions are required to completely sequence the"
Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,". The wiki needs to be easy to navigate, a task much more challenging than we initially thought. Visitors need to be able to get a good overview of our project with little effort, but on the other hand, we need to have every aspect of our project thoroughly covered for those looking for more detailed information.
We started early and made step-by-step schedules for the wiki development to ensure that we had time to think through the design, structure and the various other details in wiki development. We considered many different kinds of structures, including having fewer but larger categories and having a walkthrough-wiki structure, somewhat similar to SDU Denmark. After plenty of planning and discussion we decided to go with eight categories with a summary of each category on its main page and the details in the subpages.
Social media
We kept active on social media throughout the summer. Our team page on Facebook has about 500 likes and on Twitter we have over 350 followers. While it is great to see how many international followers we have, it is especially wonderful how much interest there is towards synthetic biology in Finland, reflected on our likes and followers from Finland.   For people to be able to get a better sense of what we’re doing, we published a blog on Tumblr. On the blog we posted updates on our progress, daily tasks and on special events, among other things. Additionally, each week a team member profile was published.
Finding partners
For us to succeed in our project it was absolutely crucial to find partners. Without them, there would have been little we could have achieved. Thankfully, we already had the four first big steps in forming an iGEM team covered by the 2014 team and their mentor Markus Linder: we had the students forming the team, Markus as our mentor, a lab bench to work at and the registration fee taken care of. But no, we did not run out of things to do!
Universities
We quickly proceeded to find more partners. We first contacted our own universities for support as well as to raise awareness of synthetic biology and our project. Early on, we met with Rector Jukka Kola and Vice-Rector Keijo Hämäläinen from University of Helsinki to present our project. It was super-encouraging to see how interested they were in our project and to hear that they would support us. We also met with two Aalto University Deans, from the School of Science and the School of Chemical Engineering . They were also really fascinated about iGEM and our major supporters. We were in contact with different Faculties and Departments in the University of Helsinki. All"

Biodesiel Synthesis Parts
In order to combine the ethanol and the fatty acetyl-coenzyme A molecules into the desired fatty ethyl esters, a wax esterase is required. This wax esterase is coded through the atfA gene, which is found on the pKS104 plasmid. This plasmid would be inserted into either strain, and produce the desired fatty ethyl ester compound to be used as biodiesel when both components are avalible. This plasmid was ordered from Addgene, and we were unable to convert it into a part in time for submission to the registry.

WHU-China,2014,Team:WHU-China#Footages#team_-_-_TEXT.html," our project and finally our sub-team project became the only project in the team. First I even could not understand what we would do but thanks for the team members, I made it clear ultimately.  To retrospect the last 10 months we went through the hardness and success which enrich my experience, broaden my horizon and give me friends. Now I am placid to write the story between iGEM and me and appreciate all the people helped us.
I am Shuohui Liu. During the four years in university, one could choose to sit around and achieve nothing. Or one could treasure the time to do something meaningful. The most meaningful thing for me is to join the iGEM. In the iGEM, one could do researches that are really special and interesting. One could also make friends and work in a team efficiently and comfortably. What's more, one could enjoy the best time in the life. In other words, the one in the iGEM is the most fortunate one in the word. Absolutely, I'm a guy like that.
Zhengwei Yuan| Senior in Biological Sciences Zhengwei is responsible for the separation of FDH (Formate dehydrogenase) gene from Candida boidinii which was bought from China Center of Industrial Culture Collection (CICC) and he work so hard with our team leader that they stay up late for three consecutive days to do the experiment. The main driving force of their diligence is the love for the iGEM and members in our team!
I joined iGEM-team at my second year of colleague. I chose life-science and wished to learn how to design a new life by myself. iGEM gives me the chance to know more and do more. Ideas will never appear suddenly - after the brain storm and layers of screening we got the amazing idea finally and had a colorful life in the lab for several mouths. I joined the human practice group at the last few weeks and did some help. Thanks to my teammates and teachers, we finished it quite well. I love dancing and reading novels. My favorite novel is Harry Potter and I don't think it is childish. Life is colorful, both in the lab and outside.
My name is Lei He coming from Wuhan University school of pharmaceutical science. Because of my enthusiasm and teachers' help, I have got a rich experience of experiment. But being an iGEMer of a great team is the most exciting part.

For information about the 2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge, click here!
BostonU 2018 is tremendously excited about sustainable lab practices. Laboratories are massive consumers of energy and sources of waste production. Energy and resources are put to good use in the pursuit of science, but BostonU believes that it is our scientific responsibility to maximize efficient use of our planet's resources. In doing so, we not only can reduce our energy consumption, but can ensure our results are ironclad.
Here, we present GreenGEM, an online resource that builds upon the work of TU Dresden 2017, the makers of iGEM Goes Green . GreenGEM aggregates a collection of resources to generate a streamlined, user-friendly guide to implementing best practices for sustainable science. Many of the suggestions contained herein are chosen to minimize energy consumption and waste production while prioritizing robust scientific results.
Action Areas
After reaching out to Sustainability@BU and conducting a review of sustainable science literature, we compiled a list of sustainable actions for labs. We identified four Action Areas in which scientists can improve their environmental impact while preserving the quality of their results.
Equipment

    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:

We now expect to run three parallel experiments to get to our end goal: a control using Gibson and homologous arms to create our gene cassette and integrate it into our Y. lipolytica genome; assembly of the plasmid inside S. cerevisiae using yeast-mediated cloning,  isolation and insertion of the plasmid into E. coli for amplification, and insertion of the gene cassette into Y. lipolytica using lox sites; and assembly of gene cassette/plasmid inside Y. lipolytica and integration into genome using lox sites. For each of the three experiments, we will begin by inserting lox sites into the Y. lipolytica genome using homologous recombination.

About half the team spent the week drafting our thesis. While some of us were writing, others were meeting with professors on campus to discuss our ideas and to pick up some S. cerevisiae strains to use as our experimental organism. We learned from Rohinton Kamakaka that we could insert Cre recombinase into our yeast using a plasmid, so now we are in pursuit of a method to both express and remove Cre recombinase once we no longer need it. Our yeast parents have been growing our Y. lipolytica and amplifying the plasmids that we have received. Our wiki boys have almost finished formatting the website to their (or our) liking and are now adding more content about our project itself. A few of our team members scheduled an interview with a representative from Family Planning 2020, but due to timing issues, had to reschedule.

She enlisted grammar police, style monitors, and LaTeX formatters to help her revise our drafted ideas into one cohesive overview of our work to-date. Each of us also wrote about our own contributions to the project and personal reflections describing our feelings towards the journey thus far.

With our business plan in place, FREDsense Technologies needed a strategic method to obtain funding in the future.  We assess from our market evaluation, the potential of annual revenue of over $2 million from our flagship product, with approximately a $2 million investment over a 3 year term to bring the technology to the Alberta market.  We have developed a funding strategy to provide these needed funds in a realistic time frame, and a strategic framework to ensure our company is profitable in the shortest possible time frame.
Market Evaluation
Our market evaluation has shown the potential for FREDsense Technologies to operate in the highly regulated field of oil and gas related water quality monitoring. We see an enormous potential impact our technology could play in this market. We have assessed that the general toxin sensing market represents a $50 million dollar opportunity. Our full assessment of the market is specific to Alberta’s oil and gas monitoring and does not cover the wide platform of testing that our technology can cover. These additional markets include waste water monitoring, non-regulatory testing for private companies and agricultural monitoring streams, all of which are potential market opportunities for our diverse platform technology.
By 2015, there will be well over 500 sampling sites mandated to be monitored for their water quality in the province of Alberta.  Each one of these monitoring sites are required to take"

But collecting the steady states under different initial input light condition in the kinetic modeling, we can get the relation between the intensity of the input light and the amount of fluorescence.
The result agrees with the previous result.
This modeling work is chiefly done by Siyu Wang, assisted by Zheng Zhang,Hongda Jiang and Wenhao Yang.

Optimal Quantities
NEB recommends a total of 0.02–0.5 pmols of DNA fragments when 1 or 2 fragments are being assembled into a vector and 0.2–1.0 pmoles of DNA fragments when 4–6 fragments are being assembled. Efficiency of assembly decreases as the number or length of fragments increases. To calculate the number of pmols of each fragment for optimal assembly, based on fragment length and weight, we recommend using NEB's online tool, NEBioCalculator , or using the following formula:
pmols = (weight in ng) x 1,000 / (base pairs x 650 daltons)
50 ng of 5000 bp dsDNA is about 0.015 pmols.
50 ng of 500 bp dsDNA is about 0.15 pmols.
The mass of each fragment can be measured using the NanoDrop instrument, absorbance at 260 nm or estimated from agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining.
Assembly Protocol:
Set up the following reaction on ice:
Optimized cloning efficiency is 50–100 ng of vectors with 2–3 fold of excess inserts. Use 5 times more of inserts if size is less than 200 bps. Total volume of unpurified PCR fragments in Gibson Assembly reaction should not exceed 20%.
Control reagents are provided for 5 experiments.
If greater numbers of fragments are assembled, additional Gibson Assembly Master Mix may be required.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"
Kyoto,2018,Team:Kyoto#ExpertInterview_-_-_TEXT.html," yeast was supported.
It turned out that using soy sauce yeast genes to create seasonings that we normally use is effective for obtaining salt tolerance!
Boil Method
We had to investigate how much salt was absorbed by the yeast. Initially, we were thinking about using sodium measurement drugs like Thermo Fisher 's Corona Green and requiring measuring external companies to measure, but they were expensive and could not afford to use it. When we looked at a laboratory that likely has an instrument for measuring ions in the laboratory at Kyoto University, I found that Dr.Kobayashi of the agriculture department had been measuring ion concentration. We decided to use the atomic absorption spectrophotometer using there.
A method of measuring the sodium ion concentration in the cells, crushing cells and extracting the contents was first proposed, but by strong recommendation of Dr.Kobayashi, we decided to suspend the yeast in distilled water after boiling and centrifuge supernatant was taken. And by taking out and diluting to certain amount and measure; Boiling method. Special Methods
It became possible to actually measure sodium ion concentration!
Column method
In order to learn more about yeast itself, we went to see Dr.Inoue who is specializing in yeast. We held a discussion based on this year’s project outline. As the discussion progressed, we faced a problem of biosafety and as an answer to the problem, he proposed to implement a device using a column. The design of this device is like this: first, we will fix yeast to a specific matrix using a classical method called immobilization bacteria. Then we will fill that in a cylinder. The advantage of this device is that there is no worry about the leakage of yeast in this case. We got a big hint on how to safely use our device.
SLiCE method
We are trying to develop devices that can help other synthetic biological devices and contribute to social problems including salt damage. In reality, however, most of the work we did was to prepare plasmids and create knockout yeast strains. In order to efficiently conduct original research, it is indispensable to establish a system that makes this plasmid construction easily, reliably and quickly. A literature search was conducted while struggling with PCR and gBlock, and as one way to solve this problem, SLiCE method was introduced.
SLiCE method is a seamless cloning method which was originally developed by Zhang et al in 2012. This method was further optimized by Prof. Motohashi of Kyoto Sangyo University. The feature of the optimized method is that it is low cost and protocol is easy for students to reproduce. We suppose that such a low"

iGEM Hamburg (Bio)
Beyond the collaboration, we also bring our help to team whom simply need it. By the end of July, iGEM Hamburg contacted us to catch up after the European Meet-up in Delft organized by iGEM TU Delft. During our discussion, they told us about some problems they encountered in molecular biology. For their project, they needed to express a gene so long they had to synthesize it in three parts. Cloning didn’t work because of the ligation between these parts. Our head of science, Jérémy, considered the problem and helped them to find other ways for ligation through Golden Gate assembly, expertise we developed after our interview with Dr. FOURNIER ( See our Integrated Human Practice to learn more ). He dressed an entire cloning strategy based on his brand new expertise and helped iGEM Hamburg to bring out their main part for the competition. He also provided support and continuous help for the issues they were facing to finally make it out. ( See our work on their page ).

BBa_K648011: Standard 25-Ready Xyle Reporter
This is a mutated version of the Xyle reporter gene which encodes for the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (metapyrocatechase), which converts catechol to the bright yellow product 2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconic semialdehyde. This version of Xyle has been made compatible with standard 25 assembly methods by removing three restriction sites (two NgoMIV sites: at bp 315 and 486, as well as one AgeI site: at bp 837). These mutations were made synonymous with the original sequence and codon optimized for E. Coli.  Because of the synonymous mutations, this gene can be easily used to create fusion protein parts. For more information on the Xyle gene and its uses as a reporter see part BBa_J33204.
BBa_K648029/BBa_K648034: Or Operator
This is the operating region for the Lambda switch that repressors C1 and Cro bind to. This region contains promoters prm and pr facing in opposite directions. It also contains operating regions Or3, Or2 and Or1. In the lysogenic state, the C1 dimer is bound naturally bound to the Or1, repressing promoter pr and production of cro. Once RecA cleaves enough C1 dimer the system switches to the lytic state. The Cro produced at the pr promoter then binds to the Or3 site inhibiting the prm promoter. For a more complete description of the Lambda system read the book ""A Genetic Switch"" by Mark Ptashne. We used Or in creation of the lambda system, as part of our project to create a sensor for DNA damage in bacteria due to radiation.
BBa_K648123: RecA (Mutant)
RecA is a protein used by E. coli to repair and maintain DNA as well as perform homologous recombination. Many normal laboratory strains of E. coli like DH10B are mutants that code for an inactivated form of RecA known as RecA1.  RecA1 is deficient in all known function of the RecA protein specifically in ATPase activity, binding with DNA in the presence of ATP, and changing conformation in the presence of ATP as well as repressor cleavage. In order to restore RecA1 to RecA and to reduce its recombinant activity while maintaining its"

⇒ OmpA, signal peptide, lac and pBad stocks were purified from their overnight form. All stocks yielded poor growth, with OmpA being the lowest yield.
⇒ Competent cells were produced from a BL21 DE3 overnight of unknown origin using a protocol from the Jakob lab. This protocol is not currently available.
⇒ OmpA was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, as well as EcoRI and SpeI for verification. The signal peptide was digested with EcoRI and XbaI to prepare for an upstream insertion. pBad, being an insert, was digested with EcoRI and SpeI. A gel was run to confirm as follows:
OmpA was digested with E and S as a confirmation of its length. From this, a band can be seen around 480-500, which is correct length. The signal peptide cannot be confirmed about the completion of its digestion; this is also the case with OmpA cut with E and X. pBad appears to have cut correctly, and the previous PCR failure is unknown in cause. What is disturbing, however, is the cut length of the lac promoter, J04500.
Repeated experiments with this indicate either only one side of the PCR product is being cut, or the part is incorrect in its entirety. Previous gels indicate J04500 may be in fact too long to be the correct part, as PCR run on this part shown in previous gels appears slightly too long to begin with.
After repeated failures of PCR product in this part, something may be wrong with our protocols."

These digestion products were then run on a  gel so as to separate the plasmids and RFP/ ccdB genes. The Promega Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean- Up system was used to extract and obtain the separated DNA from the gel  to be used for ligation. The ccdB gene was then ligated into each plasmid. Once the   ligation was complete, the product was transformed into the ccdB survival strain from invitrogen.
