Progress and Results
Cloning
We generated coding sequences of EtnR1 and EtnR2 either native to Mycobacterium NBB4 or codon optimised for E. coli. K12 which were then cloned into the pET28c plasmid to be under the control of the T7 promoter . All expression assembly was successful and verified by colony PCR, restriction digestion and Sanger sequencing. We also cloned EtnR1, EtnR2 and the putative promoter from NBB4 into the assembly standard BioBrick pSB1C3 for parts submission verified using similar processes.
Expression assay in BL21 (DE3) E. coli.
To test expression of EtnR1 and EtnR2, we transformed the pET constructs into BL21 (DE3) E. coli. containing a pGro7 helper plasmid expressing the GroEL and GroES chaperone proteins for aiding protein folding. We selected for Km and Cm resistant colonies, induced protein expression upon addition of IPTG in liquid culture and ran the cellular lysates on SDS-PAGE (Figure 6).
Figure 6. SDS-PAGE sizing of EtnR1 and EtnR2 expressed following 6 hour IPTG induction. Cellular lysates were isolated from BL21 (DE3) E. coli. with pGro7 chaperone plasmid expressing pET-EtnR1 or pET-EtnR2, and separated electrophoretically on 12% SDS-PAGE. The bands around 66-70 kDa and 25-28 kDa respectively were trypsin-digested and analysed using mass spectrometry. (a) Isolated EtnR1 lysates. (b) Isolated EtnR2 lysates.
EtnR1 was recovered from the soluble lysate fraction at a size of roughly 66 kDa, whereas EtnR2 expression was only detected upon solubilisation with SDS at a size of roughly 25 kDa. This indicates that EtnR2 may be membrane associated or expressed in inclusion bodies. Expression of the two genes was found to be stronger using codon optimised sequences, and so were used for all subsequent applications including protein characterisation and biosensor construction.
Mass spectrometry analysis"
Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan China#DifModel_-_-_TEXT.html," III, the protein producing rate will reach a balance with the dilution and degradation rate. In addition, there is a Neumann boundary we should consider, the cytomembrane, which restricts the sphere of the diffusion.
So we can get following differential equations to describe the process
Finally, we simulated those fuctions and get the steady concentration distribution:
Figure 3.2 | The concentration distribution describes the steady relative concentration of the integrase varies with the relative position to the plasmid which we consider as the point source of repressor production in E.coli. The arrow marks out the average distance between the promoter and the point source as well as the corresponding concentration. We assume both the average radius of the cell and the concentration of the point source as the unit 1.
The average distance mentioned above can be estimated from the copy number of the plasmids.Though further discussions about the the interactions between those plamids can not be made yet, our hypothesis about the diffusion of the repressor causes the leakage has already been proved by this model. Futher improvements to eliminate the impact caused by diffusion may help to solve our leakage problem. .

．NTHU Collaborate Memo :
In the beginning, we were interested in the 2016 iGEM NCKU project which is about the signal detection on urine samples by single frequency laser reflection. After discussing the whole progress and detail, it inspires us to engage in the UV excitation fluorescence to detect our sample. In addition to mutual inspection and troubleshooting with both projects, we also presented our detector design to iGEM NCKU and shared different experimental strategies. During the last meeting, we learned that we had an identical commercial value in aquaculture. As a result, we offered our investigation results of Aquaculture questionnaire to them to strengthen their data integrity by the information of market demand and consumer’s ideas. Furthermore, we looked for other teams who were also participating in pollution detection and trying to combine all the detectors in our demo-board. Nitrate detector from iGEM NCKU offers us a great opportunity to strengthen this idea. On the other hand, they also developed a special boat combining several extra functions other than nitrate sensor, like GPS, radio, motor etc., which is also an independent and integral equipment ready for adding other sensors like our IoT system. Thus, we are also happy to offer them our blueprint of EDCs sensor which might also offer them a chance to broaden their sensing target!

． NCKU Collaborate Memo :
In this September, we received the invitation to have a collaboration with NTHU. NTHU detected environmentally hazardous substances while our project is focusing on the sensing of nitrate concentration. They try to give a broader aspect. However, we try to give a more detail sensing system. Thus, we had a profound discussion of both teams’ projects. Moreover, we also shared our fluorescence idea of 2016 and 2017 with them.
After mutual inspection and troubleshooting with both projects, we were enlightened to expand our sensing device to detect more substances like environmental hormone even heavy metal in the future, which would make our project more practical. Also, NTHU offered their investigation results of aquaculture questionnaire to us. These questionnaires strengthened"

Overview
 
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is one of the most harmful types of air poisoning around the world. CO gas is mostly released from the internal combustion of engines as well as the use of fuels such as wood and coal. Since CO is highly produced in urban areas, it presents a big danger for any living organism. The aim of our project is to convert CO into CO2 biologically, which then can be converted into oxygen with photosynthesis by photoautotrophic organisms. In order to achieve this, we plan to construct a biofilm containing the enzyme Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase (CODH). With the production of this biofilm, it may be possible to obtain a biological filter that can fix the ratio of CO and CO2 present in the environment. We also try to integrate a kill switch, previously developed by Berkeley, to our system for safer use of our biofilm as well as a cell limiter for better characterization of the biofilm activity

Debate about synthetic biology       Meeting of the young minds
Meeting of the young minds: Rathenau Institute
On the first evening of the European iGEM Jamboree in Amsterdam, the Rathenau institute organized a debate on the future of synthetic biology. In this debate, youth representatives of political parties and iGEM participants came together to discuss whether synthetic biology can have a great impact on our future and how we should handle this ‘new’ subject. Six young politicians (PINK, DWARS, CDJA, Young Socialists, Young Democrats and PerspectieF) and representatives of six participating iGEM teams (K.U.Leuven, UCLondon, Imperial College London, Potsdam, Paris Bettencourt, Freiburg) were invited to give their view on synthetic biology and how it can influence our future.
The debate was divided into three main topics: ‘Promise’, ‘Regulation’ and ‘Ownership’. For each topic, two politicians discussed their view. Afterwards, the other politicians and iGEM representatives could intervene and give their own opinion on the matter.
After an introduction by speakers of the Rathenau institute, the debate started. As mentioned above, the first theme was ‘Promise’. The first speaker was from the political party Dwars (Green Left), her statement was: ‘Synthetic biology developments cannot be stopped. The question should not be whether we want to use synthetic biology, but in what way.’ Her first thought of synthetic biology was that it is brilliant, as scientists can create biofuels etc. But also some other scenarios came to her mind, like bioterrorism. She was convinced that politicians are lagging behind and no one can stop development, so question is how we justify our acts.  The second speaker, from the CDJA (Christian Democrats), did not share this point of view at all. His opinion was: ‘Science is a way of trying not to fool oneself. We shouldn’t fool ourselves in overestimating our capabilities to reform life’.  He was very clear in his point of view by saying synthetic biologists have no governmental power,"

Biosafety
a. Safety
It is a state whose simplest definition is that there is no danger. The more detailed definition means protection from various types of failures, damages, mistakes, accidents, injuries or other reluctances. These include many aspects, such as body, social, spiritual, financial, political, emotional, professional, psychological and educational. Safety can also be defined as the ability to control a specific identified hazard so that the risk is below an acceptable level, thus reducing the likelihood of health or economic loss. Security can include protection of people or belongings.
In some guarantees or insurances, safety can define the function quality of an item or organization, and this function is harmless. The goal is to ensure that the item or organization only performs the functions that were originally defined.
In some cases, security is a concept of relativity. Sometimes it is impossible to eliminate all risks, or it is not feasible because of its difficulty and its cost. In this case, safety means that the risks and damages of people or items are low, within acceptable limits, and manageable.
  
b. Biosafety
Based on the possible adverse effects of biotechnology development, the concept of biosafety has been proposed. Biosecurity generally refers to the potential threat to the ecological environment and human health caused by the development and application of modern biotechnology, and a series of effective prevention and control measures taken against it.
(1) Biological hazard
Biological hazard: Also known as “biohazard”, it refers to biological or biological substances that are harmful to humans and animals. These materials include but are not limited to: animals, plants, microorganisms, viruses, and tissue sections containing pathogens, body fluids, solid waste, and exhaled breath.
Substances with biological hazards are represented by an internationally common pattern: “☣”.
The term and its symbols are often used as warnings to alert people who may be exposed to biologically hazardous substances to take appropriate protective measures.
Biological hazard level
Level 1:   It is less harmful to humans and animals. The main measures are wearing gloves and paying attention to face protection during contact, washing hands after contact and cleaning the exposed table and utensils.
Listed at this level are Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, chickenp"

The search for the team has started, ex-iGEM’mers introduced the iGEM competition by a movie in auditoria.
iGEM Competition
iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course at MIT during their Independent Activities Period (IAP). The students designed biological systems to make cells blink. This design course grew to a summer competition with 5 teams in 2004, 13 teams in 2005 - the first year that the competition grew internationally - 32 teams in 2006, 54 teams in 2007, 84 teams in 2008, 112 teams in 2009, 130 teams in 2010, and 165 teams in 2011. Projects range from a rainbow of pigmented bacteria, to banana and wintergreen smelling bacteria, an arsenic biosensor, Bactoblood, and buoyant bacteria.

SZU_China,2015,Team:SZU China#Quick view_-_-_TEXT.html," whose RLUC activity of experimental group is about 7 times as high as that of control group, the working efficiency of our orthogonal system in two plasmids is much lower. So we had better construct our system in two plasmids to express higher level of therapeutic gene in bladder cancer cells and reduce its expression in other cell types to increase its specificity.
Green fluorescent light measurement in two and three plasmids system
December 23, 2013 by Jacob
To further verifying the working efficiency of the unnatural amino acid orthogonal system, we replaced the amber mutated output gene in former plasmids to amber mutated GFP. The plasmid psiCHECKTM2-CMV-GFP was used as a positive control to monitor transfection and expression efficiency. The two plasmids and three plasmids system being constructed by GFP recombinant plasmids were transiently transfected into 5637 and T24, both of which are bladder cancer cell line.
Pictures of green fluorescent light produced by target cells were taken by fluorescent microscope. From these pictures (Fig. 3), we can see there is no expression of GFP being detected in no Ack groups while the light intensities are rather high in with Ack groups no matter in T24 or 5637 cell lines. These results indicate that the output gene is expressed only in cells which have Ack in the culture medium. These findings suggest that the constructed circuit based on AND GATE and UAA orthogonal system can be used to specifically identify bladder cancer cells, and may yield a new therapeutic approach for bladder cancer.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component"

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of n-octanal and butanone is the first part of the biosensor and leads to both expression of mating genes in the cells and initiation of the switch, which is the second part of the biosensor. The switch consists of a CRISPR/Cas9 system where a gRNA is expressed in mating type α and the Cas9 protein in mating type a. In the initiation of the switch, Cre recombinase is expressed which is needed to commence the transcription of the gRNAs and the Cas9 protein in the cells.
The third, and final, part of the biosensor is the output of the AND-gate. Detection of the VOCs leads to mating between the two mating types resulting in both the gRNA and the Cas9 being in the same, fused cell. As the gRNA corresponds to a sequences in ADE2, the CRISPR/Cas9 system disrupts the gene. Disruption of ADE2 gives the colony a colour change that is the final output of the biosensor.
Figure 1. The biosensor BREATHtaking is an AND-gate. Recombinant receptors sense butanone and n-octanal in mating type α and a respectively, and initiates a CRISPR/Cas9 system. The system disrupts ADE2 and gives a colony colour change as output from the AND-gate.
Detection
Native mating in S. cerevisiae starts with the two mating types (a and α) producing pheromones called a- and α-factor [9]. These factors are recognized by GPCRs on the cell membrane of the opposite mating type. Ste2 is found on the membrane of an a-cell and recognizes α-factor, while Ste3 is found on α-cells and recognizes a-factor. When sensing the corresponding pheromone, Ste2 and Ste3 activates the Gαβγ G-protein, which then activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The MAPK cascade promotes expression of mating-specific genes and cell cycle arrest. During this process, the cell starts to direct itself towards the partner cell and create a shmoo where the cells then can fuse together. During the fusion, the cells become diploid and will thereby have the genetic properties of both the original haploid cells [9].
In BREATHtaking, the native GPCRs are replaced by the mammalian GPCRs Ri7 and Olfr1258. Ri7 originates from Rattus norvegicus and recognizes n-octanal [7], while Olfr1258 originates from Mus musculus and recognizes but"

SAFETY
Laboratory Safety
The Ribozyme Project is not expected to raise any research, public or environmental safety concerns other than those normally associated with Biosafety Level 2 organisms, such as Escherichia coli (DH5-alpha), which is classified as very low to moderate. The use of this project is primarily reserved for research and laboratory use, therefore, should not purposefully be exposed to the public or environment except after further testing in its specific applications (such as with particular fusion proteins). Furthermore, the basis of our project is to establish a self-excising sequence (ribozymes), which should limit the expression of any intervening sequences to the RNA level. If the intervening sequence were something of environmental or"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html," toxin production that does not impair bacterial growth and survival. To this end, we propose a regulatory system that enables E. coli to express recombinant proteins only in high cell density. Additionally we designed a system to allow E. coli to divide in subpopulations. This would allow separation between toxin producing cells and non-producers with increased chances of survival.
Quorum Sensing: Bacterial Density Regulation
Systems that enable bacteria to regulate expression based on their density are called quorum sensing mechanisms. We have adopted one of the best known quorum sensing systems: the lux system originating from Vibrio fischeri. We demonstrated this system's functionality using a newly constructed GFP reporter.
The lux system consists of luxI and luxR: two genes that allow bacteria to communicate. LuxI is a synthase that produces acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs). AHLs are small compounds that diffuse across cell membranes. They function as autoinducers: molecules that bacteria secrete to signal population density.
A single cell produces insufficient autoinducer molecules to start quorum sensing. However, when there is a high density of bacteria that produce AHL, the AHL concentration in the medium increases. Upon absorption of AHL by the cell, these molecules bind to LuxR. LuxR is the receptor protein that binds AHLs. Upon binding, LuxR then further induces expression of luxI. This positive feedback is the crucial component of quorum sensing.
Figure 4. Schematic of the lux quorum sensing system as designed in this subproject. luxI, luxR and GFP represent protein-encoding genes. AHL represents acyl-homoserine lactones. LuxR-AHL represents the LuxR protein bound to acyl-homoserine lactones. Arrows between component indicate induction/activation/production.
To test density dependent expression, two strains of E. coli DH5α were modified. The first strain contains two plasmids: one with the luxI and luxR operon and one with the GFP quorum sensing reporter . The second strain contains one plasmid that combines both the luxI/luxR operon and the quorum sensing reporter.
Either strain should be able to communicate their cell density and produce GFP when cell density is high enough. The bacteria were indeed found to acquire green color, preliminarily indicating functional quorum sensing and reporting. The cells that contain only the reporter plasmid did not turn green, indicating that they are not able to communicate their cell density.

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," inoculated into 100mL of ATCC:BG11 minimal medium and grown for 22 days in a 28°C incubator under shaking at 100rpm. OD at 600nm was used to check for growth every second day in the period. Every fourth day the medium was changed by centrifuging the cells and remove the spent medium and add fresh. The cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4500rpm. After 17 days, sucrose was added to a final concentration of 30mM.
Result: As already shown, B. subtilis cannot grow in BG-11 medium supplemented with 30mM sucrose. We therefore hypothesized that we have to have a mixture of the ATCC and the BG-11 media in the final co-culture. The ability of B. subtilis to grow in a combination of ATCC and BG-11 media was tested. Over a range of 22 days the OD was measured at 600nm to obtain a growth curve (Fig. 11). This shows limited growth of B. subtilis in the ATCC:BG-11 medium, even changing the medium every fourth day do not show any effect on the growth as it did for B. subtilis in ATCC medium (Fig. 7).
However, when the cells were centrifuged before the new medium was added it was noted that the pellet was red in the samples with the ATCC:BG-11 medium compared to cells grown in ATCC medium (Fig. 12) Also, this pellet was much easier to resuspend than the pellet grown in ATCC medium. This strongly indicates that B. subtilis will form spores when it is grown in the ATCC:BG-11 medium.    To verify the spore formation in the ATCC:BG-11 medium, 30mM sucrose was added when the medium was changed after 17 days. After just a couple of days, it can be seen that the OD increases meaning that the cells begin to grow (Fig. 11). After the addition of the sucrose it was also noted that the red pellet began to decrease, while the cells got more dominated in the pellet after centrifugation. These data taken together strongly indicates that B. subtilis cannot grow in ATCC:BG-11 medium due to carbon starvation. As soon sucrose is added, the formed spores will germinate and more cells will begin to form in the medium.

Overview
Depicted above is our team's rendition of a hypothetical process of converting perchlorate into the oxygen gas, which you can see, would be fed towards the Martian Colony. It starts with a methodology for mining and extracting perchlorate. Then, the extracted perchlorate ions are purified and concentrated to be used in a bioreactor.Next comes the bioconversion of perchlorate into oxygen in a bioreactor containing genetically-engineered micro-organisms which have the Ideonella dechloratans perchlorate reducing metabolic pathway.This oxygen is then captured, transferred and made available to an enclosed Martian colony. The colonial biowaste could also be used as a feedstock for the bioreactor, as well as in tandem with the newly remediated martian soil to grow produce, closing one of the loops in this process.
Further Investigations
Though the focus of this project is of the bioreaction of Chlorite Dismutase and chlorite ions, our team also explored two other components of the perchlorate conversion process: Perchlorate Extraction and Concentration, and Recycling Media.

Kavitha Kuruganti, ASHA Convener
She is one of the conveners of ASHA Kisan Swaraj Alliance (Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture), which is a network of people committed to a cause (not an NGO). She is a part of the not-for-profit social enterprise that seeks to revive organic Indian cotton in a garment value chain called TULA.
While reading her articles on GM, we were prompted to interview her. She has been very vocal about her protest against GM crops in India. She has protested against the government permission to Monsanto for open field trials. We asked our questions to her by exchanging mails. Her views on GMO in India, can be described as followings:
Transgenics are unsustainable and incompatible with agro-ecological, organic farming, apart from being potentially detrimental to consumer health and conservation of biodiversity as one of the bedrocks of economic and ecological sustainability. The control of seeds into the monopolistic hands of a few multinational seed corporations would not at all be helpful for our farmers. The unproven claims of benefits of GM crops are not needed as plenty of natural seeds for each crops are available. GM crops have not done any benefit to consumers. GM crops are largely unsustainable in their reliance on external, non-renewable inputs. Precision of genetic engineering has been shown to be a myth by many scientific studies. An upsurge in the consumption has been observed due to the use of insecticides, which is giving rise to highly resistant weeds, also known as superweeds. A continuous production of insecticide reduces soil microbial activity. GMs are a diversion to problems, for which solution already exists in the form of traditional organic farming. A thorough experimentation should be performed before putting the GM crops into the environment.

Dr. Sesikeran, former chairman of RCGM (Review committee on Genetic manipulation- India), former director of NIN (National Institute of Nutrition). He was one of the prominent persons involved in approving of GMO related research/products in india. He was kind enough to have a conversation with us through mobile phone. He was answering our questions in both ethical and technical ways.

Press Report
Young scientists from University of Potsdam participate in an international synthetic biology competition
For the first time an interdisciplinary group of students from University of Potsdam takes part in the international iGEM competition (international Genetically Engineered Machine). This competition is arranged by Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge for international teams every year since 2005.
The junior scientists from Potsdam develop a system for the detection of novel peptide based agents for therapeutical applications in human. In the process they use the properties of bacteria, in that case of cyanobacteria. These bacteria are capable of linking short protein parts in an unusual way. These properties are transferred to bacterial laboratory strains and optimized. As a result the students hope to find inhibitors, which e.g. can be used in regulation of blood coagulation.
The 15 students from 4th to 8th semester are guided by Dr. Kristian Müller and Prof. Katja Arndt, whose former groups were able to win gold-medals and special awards. The biochemistry students plan and perform the lab work. They are supported by physic students, contributing to the design of models, and informatics students, developing an application for smart phones. The work is aided by Dr. Elke Dittmann, Professor of microbiology. Moreover the students discuss the possibilities and borders of synthetic biology with the publicity and work on financing the project.
In the beginning of October all results and projects will be presented during the European Jamboree in Amsterdam and evaluated by a jury. The final round takes place in November in Boston.

Meeting the young minds
Children are the future and will follow our footsteps, if we guide them.  We cannot start early enough to awake their interest in research by letting them feel like real scientists in the lab. Children are open minded and want to discover everything. It’s easy to inspire them with our work.  The earlier we start to introduce people to science"
Freiburg,2012,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractices#Philo_-_-_TEXT.html," context, the analogical transfer from technological properties into the realm of the living can be understood as the epistemological program of synthetic biology. This transfer then promotes the aim of creating life, as it provides an understanding of life which makes such a feat possible in the first place. In short: within the field of synthetic biology, we encounter living beings as if they were machines.

Forth meeting - Metaphors
Because synthetic biology approaches biological systems as technological systems by means of analogy, we examined the general concept of metaphors ([12],[13],[14]) and the epistemic value of inference from analogies. Through this examination, two problems became clear: First, because conceptual metaphors constitute of a way to see, think and act towards things [14], it is necessary to inquiry how our position towards life might change in the light of it as a machine [3]. Second, if synthetic biology does base upon a series of conceptual metaphors, which are not identified as such, then serious epistemological problems exist. All inference from the inductive argument of analogy is to be considered invalid: We might try and understand living beings as machines – that, however, does not impy that they indeed behave as such.

The Lyon jamborees is a great opportunity to form a platform where we can discuss our safety issues, what we have done to overcome them and the main parts that have challenged us the most.
After reading your abstract a few questions on the safety of your projects popped into our minds. If you are interested in forming a discussion platform, we would be delighted  receive your answers as this, on the day of the platform will enable your team to see how much progression was made with safety from today onwards.
We would be really grateful to read your questions on the safety of our project too J
iGEM cares about safety, so do we! Lets take a step together and make a change in how we handle this caseJ
Questions
1)      When you change the genetic information of bacteria in bees’ guts this may have the possibility of changing the genetic material of most bacterial flora. Have you thought about a possible solution to this?
2)      Will this change effect the bees honey production and so affect humans and animals health?
3)      How will you manage the amount of Coumaric Acid produced?
4)      Will coumaric acid affect plants which the bees’ touch?
Metu hope your project is going well. It's a pitty we couldn't make it to the national re-union in Istanbul but do hope you made the most of it :)
ATOMS Turkiye
Their Response
Hi ATOMS Turkiye,
For the first question, we will introduce our gene construct to the bacteria before hand and then introduce it to the host bee via food (a process called paratransgenesis), so it is highly unlikely for the other bacteria to get this part. Also, our system is optimized for b. subtilis, the promoters we used and the products as a whole have slim to no chance of functioning anywhere else.
For the second question, the bacillus strain we selected is native to the bees' gut. It is normally not found in the honey stomach of the bee, even if the bacteria were to get into honey, it will still be in the natural levels. Other than that, according to literature, IPTG is never traced in honey, so our little germs, even if they can make it into honey, will be killed because of our kill switch.
The third question was a hard one because there is actually no real data about the p-coumaric acid levels let alone it is not known if such a thing as p-coumaric acid overdose exists."

Gel purified the previously amplified CBCRs 2,3,and 8
7/21 - Jon
Transformed the four CBCRs from 7/20 into DHS alpha anyways. Plates turned out negative -- need to reevaluate golden gate methods.
7/21 - All
Met with Monsanto at their Monsanto Seminis site in Woodland. We were hosted on a tour by the company in order to hear about the molecular and genetic biology they perform with plant research. We were provided with $1,000 for our iGEM team, no strings attached, from the company and were provided with opportunities to continue engaging with the company for further research and/or assistance with our iGEM project. We were taken on a day-tour of their facilities to learn about their operations and draw connections to the scope of iGEM.
7/23- Jon
Freezer stocks of collaborators colony strains were prepped and put in the freezer.
A lot of colonies formed on plates from 7/21 which makes us suspicous there is contamination. We decided to run a colony PCR on npf colony to try and find results. We discovered it was once again a false positive. Need to brainstorm why this could be.
7/24- Samir
Repeat PCR amplification on CBCR gblocks so we can have a higher concentration of DNA. All amplifications were unsuccessful-- hypothesized to be due to denatured DNA polymerase.

7/25- Amanda & Jon
Prepared cell culture of collaborators cells so that we can mini prep them tomorrow.
7/25 - Jon
Third Golden Gate reaction performed on npf, pcyA, RBS1, RBS2, and the plasmid. Allowed to incubate overnight at 16℃.

To promote synthetic biology, we designed Bio-Chess with a board game version and an online version. Please see our Contribution for more details.
Special Awards
Best Integrated Human Practices
At the beginning of this competition, we came up with idea of constructing the database. Because of the specialty of our project, we serve mainly with iGEMers and synthetic biologists. We created a 7 step ‘advice-test-feedback-promoter’ circle to make sure our product is of well-used for synthetic biology. So, we integrated all our human practices in correspondence to every step of this circle including interview, questionnaire, communication and conference. We also collected their feedback and further improve our project. After all these work, we promoted the product to public and synthetic biologists in order to help them solve their problems. What’s more we designed Bio-Chess based on the simple procedure of gene engineering, with the integration of knowledge in a game, it affects public in a subtle way. Please see Integrated HP for more details.

The product idea
Figure 1: Schematic drawing of the tank. The Nutrition Generator is constructed of two tanks, one bacteria tank and one cellulose tank. The two tanks are connected with a bacterial flow tube, and a bacteria reflow tube with a pump helping the flow. The tubes are equipped with a safety closure system, so that bacteria can only be transferred when  needed, and contamination risk is minimized.
The bacteria tank contains Edible coli, a gene modified bacteria that expresses huge amounts of proteins and fatty acids by using cellulose as a carbon source. It is not possible to open the bacteria tank, which avoids  contamination by other bacteria or fungi. The tank is designed to contain Edible coli from the beginning,  which will reproduce, so that it is not required to change or add new bacteria at any time. Furthermore the  tank will contain a pH indicator and a thermometer, so it's easy to keep an eye on and maintain the  optimal growth conditions of the bacteria.
The cellulose tank is much larger than the bacteria tank. It has a lid in the top, where cellulose containing materials, e.g. plant material, can be added, and through which the tank can be cleaned. In the  bottom of"
Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," was supposed to induce zif268 and thus His3 expression. We will try a couple things to make sure nothing went wrong:
redo cultures in the same pattern as yesterday--perhaps IPTG+/- were mislabeled
inoculate cultures of ∆HisB∆pyrF∆rpoZ +/- pSR01 so that Vatsan can use a plate reader to compare their growths
Joung wrote back and said that the HisB deletion is in fact 6 bases in frame. He also mentioned something about a lac deletion which we are looking into.
MAGE3 sequencing results:
none of the colonies had the stop codons.  This may be because mutS is not knocked out, and it can correct strands that have up to 5 bases mismatched.
Kan-ZFB for lambda red:
Noah did lambda red in EcNR2 and the plate was covered in crystalline patterns that may be cells. We will test this by:
Restreaking some of these ""colonies"" onto a fresh kan plate to get the bacteria more spread out
Streaking a kan plate with pKD46 (from glycerol stock) to see if the kan is effective
Taken a streak off the plate, diluted it in 200µL H20, and used 1µL as template for PCR
KAPA, 1529620-flanking primers, 90 sec elongation and 56 anneal, 25 cycles
Results: 300bp band--the streaks on the plate are bacteria, but they do not have the insert.
1529620 locus PCR of EcNR2 lambda red 7/13/11
We also retried the thio kan-ZFB PCR using some new primer aliquots. Once again it failed.
Thio kan-ZFB PCR 7/13/11
Because this PCR keeps failing, we're going to try a different way and do two separate and shorter PCRs to be joined later in an overlap PCR:
PCR of kan cassette: kan cassette as template (diluted 6/16 aliquot), kan F phosphothio and kan R primers, KAPA, 56˚C anneal and 90 sec elongation

Applications
There are numerous applications of the PixCell system which are split into two broad categories. The first of which are core uses, which rely on the use of electrogenetics and utilise our PixCell electrode array. Experimental proofs of concept were achieved for two of these applications. The latter category of applications are extended-use ones, which apply the PixCell part library outside of an electrogenetic system.
Core Applications
Biocontainment (Environment)
Preventing the escape of GMOs is a major public worry and obstacle to their implementation. This device prevents the escape of GMOs using an electrical “cage” where an oxidising potential causes expression of a toxin or growth inhibitor. This operates similar to how an electric fence restrains livestock. A proof-of-concept for this device was experimentally confirmed using the Gp2 growth inhibitor (Shadrin et al., 2012). Our transcriptional repressor pSoxS mutant (BBa_K2862010) could be used to create a more robust device where cells require an electrical stimulus to survive.
Hybrid Digital-Biological Computation (Information Processing)
Integrating electronic and biological computation with our device would improve the complexity of synthetic biology devices without increasing the metabolic burden imposed on the biological chassis. For example, a fluorescence camera could be connected to our electrogenetic system, with the information it records being processed via an in silico feedback loop which changes the electrode array’s output. An example of this would be to use the in silico feedback to model an activator-inhibitor system, with parameters of the feedback function being altered to search for Turing patterning behaviours.
Spatially structured cocultures (Foundational Advance)
Spatial separation in co-cultures can provide numerous advantages when compared with disordered consortia (Kim et al., 2008). PixCell could be used for spatial patterning of co-cultures to improve their function, for a segregated co-culture of cells resembling the α- and β-cells of the"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," between the joined
CDS
parts or tags. We decided to preferably use amino acids that are abundant in natural or synthetic flexible linkers like glycine and serine (Chen et al. 2012) . Flexible linkers have been shown to improve the performance of epitope tags in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sabourin et al. 2007) . Therefore we added the bases GG upstream of the fusion site between 4x (N-Tag) and 4y (
CDS
) which results in glycine and methionine (methionine is preset by the fusion site) and the bases TA downstream of the fusion site between 4 (
CDS
) and 5a (C-Tag) resulting in an  alanine and leucine linker. To allow for the optional use of C-terminal tags, a
CDS
part must not possess a stop codon. Therefore an additional linker has to be introduced between 4 (
CDS
) and 5 (Terminator) as well as between 5a (C-Tag) and 5b (Terminator) resulting in an alanine-STOP and glycine-STOP, respectively.
Design of Connectors
One key feature of the Marburg Collection are the connectors that provide our toolbox with the required flexibility. Our design is inspired by the “Dueber Toolbox”, a golden-gate-based cloning method designed for applications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Lee et al. 2015) . To our knowledge, the “Dueber Toolbox” is the first cloning system that performs assembly through all levels using restriction sites located on independent basic parts, termed connectors, instead of destination plasmids for level 1 and level 2 plasmids (Weber et al. 2011) .
Figure 5: Default setup of connectors for building a LVL2 plasmid consisting of 5 transcription units
The connectors match in the following pattern: 5'Con(N) connects to 3'Con(N-1)
Using connectors instead of destination plasmids enables the user to freely choose antibiotic resistance parts and oris. To achieve the flexibility to choose one out of four resistances and one out of three oris, like it is possible in our toolbox, twelve plasmids would be required for building LVL1 plasmids. For building LVL2 plasmids, LVL1 plasmids with different fusion sites are needed. In our system, this is also achieved through the connectors in contrast to the destination plasmids"

What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
We kill bacterial waste using 10% bleach solution before it is disposed of.  We are also using nonpathogenic baterial strains: E. coli DH10B, P. putida KT2440, and P. fluorescens B2.  These strains cannot grow outside the laboratory environment and are non-infectious BSL 1 agents. Our iGEM projects are designed to use only small scale techniques, reducing the amount of materials used and bacteria grown.
The Risks of Our Project in the Future
What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
CODON OPTIMIZATION PROJECT:
A great success in the field of codon optimization would allow for the optimization of genes at the codon level that were previously considered difficult to repress, tune, or even express at all. The ability to break these barriers would allow researchers, industry specialists, and possibly unauthorized individuals the ability to tune the expression of genes expressed by altering them at the codon level. It is foreseeable that companies generating biological products such as medicines that are coded by weakly expressed genes could find a way to generate stronger genes that code for the exact same products. Because any gene could be optimized in this manner, it is also theoretically possible that the production of toxins or other dangerous biologically produced molecules could be increased - as with any synthetic biology technique. This scenario is not likely, and does not carry significant risk for several reasons. FIrst, alternative methods of increasing output of metabolic pathways are already extant, and the use of codon optimization as a tool for doing so would not be the easiest, quickest, or most cost effective method. Second, to codon optimize a gene, large scale DNA synthesis equipment and know how is required, and any group sending a dangerous genetic element for codon optimization would have to go through the additional layer of security of a commercial entity, and would thus be even less likely to use our method.
An interesting application of our project, if it were to truly allow for much more efficient optimization of existing genetic systems, is that scale up of biomolecule production could be done much more quickly than is now possible. This is"

Applications
After travelling a long way of circuit construction, you may wonder what we are going to do with those sparkling bacteria. Of course much thought was given, too, to make our oscillation circuit both showy and substantial as a safety guard in daily life. Here we are going to show you the potential of those shinny soldiers as biosensor, cancer cell killer and gene sinusoidal signal generator.
Biosensor
To date there appears a great number of biosensors that are used for detecting certain factors, such as small organic molecules or metal ions. And we've noticed that each year many iGEM teams relate their projects to biosensors. Biological detection has strength in its low detection limit, high sensitivity and bioaffinity when compared with chemical detection methods. We can use the same gene sensing circuit to detect various metal ions or other determinant via changing different promoters which responds to a specific target molecule.
Compared with traditional single-cell biosensor, our oscillatory system biosensor has three advantages.
1) Synchronized colonies will be more sensitive to concentration changes of the target molecule and the changes in fluorescence strength are easier to observe than single cell biosensors.
2) Single cell biosensor usually works, or ""switches on"" when the concentration of the specific molecules which can be responded by the promoter reaches to the lowest value. Sometimes this kind of detection is limited when we want to narrow the range of detection. Because the oscillation will happen only when concentration of certain molecule is between two value, the maximum and the minimum, it can dwindle the detection range of the determinant.
3) Oscillatory system is more robust and stable when used as a biosensor. These advantages will promote oscillatory gene circuits a better use in biosensing.

Panama,2010,Team:Panama#Team#students_-_-_TEXT.html," I love food! Every outing is complemented with a good meal.
The iGEM experience: Everything has been learning. From learning how to organize ourselves, to the procedures that we have done in the lab. We have learned from each other, from our own mistakes and how to fix them. It has been an intense job, how to juggle our daily work, english courses, personal life and iGEM has been tough but not impossible. In the end, all of it has been worth it. I hope that everything that we have learned helps the next teams that participate in representation of Panama.
Research Interests: I'm a Biotecnologist therefore, my main interest is Molecular Biology. I'm currently working in the area of Parasitology and I hope to continue learning in that field and continue in Biomedical research.

Hobbies:  I am movie-lover, I like all types of movies with the exception of horror films. I like to read, to stay healthy by doing excercise. But what I like most of all is to travel.
The iGEM Expectations: It has been a new experience where I have learned a lot and we've worked very much; staying at the lab until late running the experiments. We would like to win very much so we can probe to the panamanian people that there are a lot of young people in Panama with the entreprenurial spirit.

Degradation
Proteins, mRNA and other metabolites have a turnover rate. They are degraded over time. The degradation rate will be described with first order kinetics where d represents the degradation constant. Not every molecule has the same degradation rate since some molecules are more stable than others. We can influence the stability of the molecules. For example, in cell B it is important that there is a fast switch between conditions and a fast turnover of CheZ and RFP is necessary. This is why we add a LVA-tag to these proteins. This tag destabilizes the protein and makes them degradade faster"

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

James Long
Hello, I’m Jamie and an undergrad student of Immunology studying at the University of Aberdeen. Originally from Sandwich Kent, I moved to Edinburgh, Scotland        when I was young. In my spare time I like building and playing with bikes and computers. I am fortunate that I was offered the opportunity to take part in        iGEM with my uni, and glad that I seized it. I turned down a paid summer placement in the U.S. for iGEM, but have no regrets about doing so. iGEM is much        more fun and interesting than I was expecting.  My role on this project was (with Joseph) to take the BioBrick produced by the iGEM Edinburgh team in 2011        and insert a FLAG/His Tag inside a multiple-cloning-site, onto the end of YFP. This would allow future teams to easily insert a gene for a protein which the        cell would then surface express.
James McAvoy
Hi I’m James, originally from Hertfordshire near Cambridge. I have a BSc in Pharmacology from Portsmouth University. I am now entering Honours for a second        BSc in Biotechnology (Applied Molecular Biology).
I am involved in the designing and testing of the quorum sensing system, for this I need to know about how cells can communicate with molecules, signal        transduction and its resulting impact on gene expression. I have a keen interest in experimental design, developing novel ways for finding out information        for the team they wouldn’t otherwise be able to know. For instance how can you simulate how binding of cells to a target will determine their relative        distances and resulting signal output? I try to see the bigger picture and guide the team towards its end goal of a viable diagnostic system.
In my spare time I read science fiction and philosophy while blasting ‘Crystal Castles’.
Joseph Mackinnon
I’m a third year undergraduate in microbiology. I am the ‘local person’ on the team as I have lived near Aberdeen for most of my life. I joined the team as I        realised how unique an opportunity participating in iGEM is. The role I have been fulfilling in the team is one of the lead human practices contacts, and        working on the modification of Ice Nucleation Protein. As well as being interested in microbiology I also enjoy spending time outdoors and have spent some        time working for Outward Bound in South"

USP-EEL-Brazil,2018,Team:USP-EEL-Brazil#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we dedicated some days to teach and demonstrate some concepts of chemistry and biology. The kids had experienced how to make a sodium bicarbonate and vinegar volcano, how to measure ph with red cabbage, they learned what is DNA and how to extract it from fruits; and they learned how to fill a balloon with vinegar and sodium bicarbonate.
Our partnership with AIESEC aim to approach science to children and instigate their curiosity for sciences!
Contraceptive Awareness
The feminist movement Enedina Alves Marques from EEL-USP, is a student entity that aims to discuss and fight for women's rights inside and out of the university. The movement fights against social oppression and brutal crimes against women, trying to bring equality between genders.
During project development, we learned the dangers of using contraceptive pills without the knowledge of its sides-effects. So we Researched datas, statistics and  we found a relation between taking contraceptive pills and acquiring some diseases such as venous thrombosis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, varicose vein and others.
Then, CBSIN made an event with Enedina Alves Marques entity in order to discuss and aware women and men about some topics releated with contraceptive pills. We focused in talking about health, importance of consulting doctors before using medications and we invited specialists to talk about others anticonceptive ways.
Industrial Biotechnology Week
Our team made a lecture about enzyme production at the industrial biotechnology week. But what is it? Our university and the academics centers do every year a week with lectures and scientific presentation about a specific theme, and this year it was enzymes. We show them all the process to produce a protein, since the design and molecular biology to the purification (we used our iGEM project as a basis). We were able to show the public a little bit about iGEM and our entity CBSin too, and it was great to present synthetic biology and show them how beautiful and promising it is.
The Research Incentive Week
The research incentive week was an event organized by the Union of Chemical Engineering with the special participation of CBSIN. During this week, several lectures were made with researchers and professors talking about the importance of scientific research for the development of the political, social and educational scenario of Brazil.
At the event, teachers and students of scientific initiation were invited to open stands explaining the themes of their work, giving opportunities for recruiting interested students. In this sense, CBSIN had the opportunity to talk a bit about synthetic biology and present our project for IGEM 2018.

Their experience in aiding start-ups to build effective pitches and presentations, we found, proved to be one of their greatest contributions to our team. They gave us the confidence and skills to present clearly and effectively and this was a major bonus to our team. Additionally, the fact that they’re backgrounds were in business rather than science, helped us to avoid the pitfalls of using overcomplicated and scientific language when presenting, one of the key aspects when presenting a project to an audience that know nothing about it. UCC iGEM would like to thank Peter, Alexis and Trish for all their help throughout our iGEM project, without which our project would have run less smoothly

Completion-Indicator
The indicator circuit can act as an alarm clock, sending out banana odor when cavities are going to happen in our oral environment.
Aside from testing the circuit in E.coli, our ultimate plan is to use a special chassis, Streptococcus sobrinus, to express our circuit.
Because Streptococcus sobrinus is a commonly seen bacteria in human oral, we don’t need to worry much about the risk that it would trigger human immune system or damage human body.

Purpose
Exploring the situation of oral environment and send out warning signal if problems concerning tooth decay are going to emerge. With the banana fragrance getting stronger and stronger, people will be able to know that the risk of cavity in their mouth is on the rise.
Background
The special organism we adapted in this part is Streptococcus sobrinus. By using its specific biological feature, we can turn our circuit into an alarm clock, which would ring whenever humans are in danger of oral cavities. Most people don’t know about the existence of cavities in their mouths until suffering from toothaches or serious pain. However, it is difficult for people to go for dentist checks very often because of the high expenses and amount of time spent. Furthermore, for people in rural areas, there might be insufficient dental resources. Therefore, we have decided to create a system that can alert people from time to time. We aim to use banana fragrance as our indicating method instead of visual cues, avoiding the embarrassment that might result from unsightly colors appearing on our tooth.
Chassis
For this circuit, we use a special chassis to load and express our wanting genes, which is Streptococcus sobrinus, it is an anaerobic, spherical shaped, Gram positive bacteria. The reason why Streptococcus sobrinus can serve as a good indicator is"

Collaborations
Cooperation between different teams is in the core of the iGEM ethos. We decided to embrace said philosophy by initiating an association with UNITN , a team from Northern Italy. Their project, focusing on Microbial Fuel Cells, focuses on the same issue as ours: sustainability and renewable energy. This relationship has been reciprocal. They have contributed to our Human Practices by completing our questionnaire and they have provided thorough feedback on our wiki. We coached them with their presentation and most importantly, we developed a mathematical model to describe their system.
Modeling
James helped the UNITN-Trento team with their modeling . Their project has a protein called proteorhodopsin (PR) which is a light driven proton pump that can be used to produce ATP molecules. The team asked James ""what is the number of ATP molecules that can be produced per second as a function of light irradiance that hits the bacterial membrane?"" James found that the reaction was based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics as the PR must complete its cycle before it can absorb another photon and at high light irradiance this leads to saturation.[1][2]

Making New Friends
Our team has successfully and directly followed the meaning of the word “Collaboration”, which originated from Latin con- (“with”) and labōrō (“work”). We found several iGEM teams that we happily involved in our activities and dry lab development of SynDrop, as well as joined their initiatives and proposals. Entering into relations with like-minded people and broadening our scientific network came as mutual benefits which may evolve to common projects in the future as well.

iGEM teams participating in BioHackathon
As you may have already read in other sections of this wiki page, our team has organised BioHackathon - the international coding competition. Since symbiosis between Life Sciences and IT fields in Lithuania still is in its initial stage, we considered about gaining valuable experience from other countries, especially from other iGEM teams. Because of that we have invited iGEM teams to visit Vilnius and take part in 48 hours-lasting BioHackathon: Lab Issues event. As a result, team Aalto-Helsinki (Finland), team Lund (Sweden) and team Groningen (Netherlands) accepted the invitation. We considered it to be a very meaningful collaboration because everyone was working on the same goal – to create programmes or tools which were supposed to ease teams’ everyday laboratory life. Most of the BioHackathon ideas grew from from difficulties faced while working on their own iGEM projects. In that case, final applications and tools, created during BioHackathon, had improved their projects or at least relieved the realization of ideas. Some teams have been in touch with mentors after the event and received qualified advices. We have also used some created tools including team Lund search-engine that helped us in searching for particular BioBricks. Additionally, as team Aalto-Helsinki stated, it has been a great chance to learn about other iGEM projects, exchange knowledge and experience as well. As BioHackathon took place in the Life Sciences Center where the major part of our project development happened, teams had an opportunity to take a look at our laboratories and daily workspace. We strongly believe that such an event might become a pattern for the future collaborations.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Mutation#Global_-_-_TEXT.html," harbors     the strongest known mutator dnaQ926 is almost completely unviable without additional mutations (Fijalkowska, Schaaper 1996).    Therefore, recent development was directed to the rational design of a plasmid-borne mutator system. Combination of strong mutator capabilities with a     tight inducible promoter should result in a controllable mutagenesis system, generally circumventing many issues of chromosome-based hypermutator strains.     Furthermore, the rational combination of different groups of mutator genes enables compositions, which have a very balanced mutagenesis spectra
Our mutation system was designed to use an untargeted mutation approach as an alternative to the error-prone polymerase I. Therefore, we reconstructed     the previously described mutator plasmid (Badran, Liu 2015), which consists of six different genes.
Figure 1: Schematic view of the mutator genes on a plasmid developed by Badran and coworkers (Badran, Liu 2015). This mutator plasmid uses six        genes under tight control through an arabinose promoter. The different DNA fidelity mechanisms affected by the genes are indicated by coloring.
Overexpression of these mutator genes rises the mutation     frequency in E. coli to 6.2×10-6 per bp per generation with induction and only ~4×10-9 per bp per generation without induction.     Moreover, the mutation spectrum is very diverse.
Figure 2: Mutation spectrum of the mutagenesis plasmid developed by Badran and coworkers (Badran and Liu 2015).
DnaQ926
The dnaQ gene encodes ε-subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III, which is responsible for the proof reading activity     of this enzyme. DnaQ confers  3'-exonuclease activity, which excises falsely incorporated bases during replication. DnaQ926 contains two amino     acid substitutions  (D12A, E14A) in the Exo I region, which prevents coordination of an essential metal ion and therefore abolishes the     proofreading activity (Fijalkowska, Schaaper 1996). The overall structure of DnaQ and  interactions with other proteins of the DNA polymerase III     complex are not affected by these substitutions. dnaQ926 acts as a dominant negative gene causing a strong mutator phenotype even in E. coli strains with chromosomal wild type dnaQ (Cox, Horner 1986). DnaQ926 competes against DnaQ about incorporation into the DNA polymerase     III complex"

Microorganism Isolation and Characterization
We successfully isolated and purified uncharacterized Myxobacteria from Chihuahua’s soil. When exposed                     to stress factors (such as starvation), Myxobacteria tend to form fruiting bodies. These amazing                     microorganisms are able to secrete almost 300 different metabolites with different uses. Even though                     they have been studied, they have not been used for any iGEM project until now!
Confrontations
The inhibitory activity of our isolated Myxobacteria was proven by confronting them with previously isolated             fungus.
However, our project needed our Myxobacteria to be confronted with fungus isolated from crops. Our                     main objective was to test its action against R. solani, and see if Myxobacteria had inhibitory                     action against it. Confrontations were performed in PDA agar plates, Myxococcus xanthus against Rhizoctonia                     solani and later against Rhizopus oryzae. It was determined that unmodified Myxobacteria are able                     to inhibit fungal growth. A major inhibition was observed in Rhizoctonia than in Rhizopus. Other confrontations                     were performed against uncharacterized fungi only to challenge Myxobacteria.
 
Rhizopus oryzae
In our visits to the crop fields, we collected some samples of infected alfalfa. We wanted to know for sure what             was the reason of the infection and what part of the plant its attacked. The team found some fungi around the             root and took them back to the lab to try to characterize them. We were able to successfully characterize a fungus             macro and microscopically, suspected to be R. oryzae.
The first attempt to build our BioBrick™ consisted in the assembly of eight different parts. We transformed E. coli             with each of our BioBricks™ to increase the quantity of DNA we had, then we extracted the plasmid of each one             of them so we could make the assembly. Each plasmid that was extracted was ran in an electrophoresis gel so we             could be certain that what we obtained was what we wanted.
When we did the last electrophoresis we had as a result that all"

Our final goal is not only to construct our sensor but also to examine the cytotoxicity caused by acrylamide exposure. Our aim is to show how acrylamide may affect different tissues. This part of our project is going to demonstrate how different cell lines (i.e derived from different tissues) react to acrylamide exposure .
Our group of students focused on one (the one processed by high heat and in presence of reducing sugars and amino-acids) of the food products that are considered as carcinogenic by the American Institute for Cancer Research. There are many more carcinogenic food that we are exposed to and more research needs to be done.That is why we encourage other IGEM teams to find out more about food safety!

ImageID assembly orders for each construct have been used to      extract the type information for each subpart with that construct.      This innovative approach helped us to reveal 400 possible brick      combinations present within the 3x384 well plates distributed by      iGEM in Spring 2010
Four different graphs were constructed based on graphical modeling      theory where relations of atomic parts, devices and systems and      the functional combinations that can build new constructs are presented      for the iGEMs parts registry database. Three graphs are composed      of iGEM devices and one graph is based on Biobricks.
Each graph comprises a set of vertices or nodes and a set of      edges. In the set of nodes each node represents a device, while      in the set of edges each edge represents the input-output combination      of the nodes.
We arrange a survey to analyze user needs and response, According      to our survey results, 244 participants are completed our survey      between 10 to 22.10.2010, 57% of the participant had scientific      degrees from B.Sc to Professor and 18% had graduate degrees. 18%      of participants are enrolled in their teams as either Instructors      or Advisors.INSA-Lyon, Lethbridge, WashU are dedicated as collaborators      with more than 60% team participation.

Kent,2016,Team:Kent#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", reaction temperature, pH value and ionic strength. 1 If all conditions are standardised this method is completely reproducible but tends to produce rather polydisperse nanoparticles. To produce monodisperse nanoparticles there must be a quick nucleation followed by a slow controlled growth of crystals, which is absent from this method as a gelatinous  precipitate of crystals is formed immediately.1 Despite this methodological shortcoming, the black magnetic particles formed in the precipitate and were imaged by EM.
Figure 13: EM images of Magnetite Nanoparticle.
Figure 13 shows various images taken on EM, they show spherical polydispersed nanoparticles of approximately 10-20nm. This is an average size of nanoparticles however these nanoparticles are not regulated diameter. However, there was considerable variability in diameter, and there are alternative methods where the particle sizes are more uniform.2 The second image shows where the individual nanoparticles have aggregated forming what appears to be a cuboctahedral geometric shape; this is one of the most common geometric shapes of magnetite nanoparticles.3 This implies that the cuboctahedral geometry is most stable with {100} and {111} miller planes. This shape of nanoparticle has a large surface area which would make it more reactive, however this is at odds with our observations that these nanoparticles are very stable. These nanoparticles were used in subsequent protein experiments to test whether the Mam proteins is able to alter the structure and shape of these presynthesised particles.

Visualisation of Magnetite nanoparticles
Using the reaction performed under zero oxygen conditions multiple EM images were obtained figures 14-16 (red circles) which are consistent with the modulation of the size and shape of magnetite nanoparticles. However, these samples contained too much protein material and it was therefore difficult to identify magnetite particles. Future experiments with a higher concentration of each protein, using more highly purified protein samples or separating the proteins entirely from the magnetite crystals will improve the validation of the function of the proteins."

To overproduce the enzymes pabA and a fusion pabB and pabC we used already existing parts from the Part Registry : <partinfo>BBa_K137055</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_S04039</partinfo>. We fused these two parts under one constitutive promoter into one plasmid to reduce the amount of plasmids in our final system.
