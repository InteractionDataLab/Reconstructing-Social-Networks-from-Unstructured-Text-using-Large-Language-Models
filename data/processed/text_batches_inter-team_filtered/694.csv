Premise
Hi everyone:
Based on last week's meeting, team members are going to be pairing up with grad mentors to flesh out the details of the project.  As I mentioned last week, I think it's a good idea if everyone feels like they're contributing to all the ideas that are generated.  At the same, I know that a lot of people feel like they need to work through the projects that they've been presenting these last two weeks.  As a compromise, everyone will be allowed to choose two project ideas (one is your original idea and the second is another team member's idea).  Over the next week, you will be helping brainstorm around both ideas with a graduate student mentor(s).
At these meetings, please try and flesh out as many problem areas as possible.  Remember that your goal is to expose as many constraints as possible so the team chooses a project wisely (i.e. knowing the problems and constraints they are likely to face).  Hence, it is important that your are critical, in a good way, of both project ideas - your own and the other team member's.
A logistical issue: There are five team members so pairing won't be even.  If any team member wishes to work with two project ideas outside of their own, let me know.  Otherwise, grad students, please ensure that there are two of you working (mentoring) on that project.  I will also try and be a team-member substitute if necessary.
The sign-up sheet link:
https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnnziKtulIwTdFk2OEtyR0tQMEM3VWZSdVpLZGx2V0E&hl=en
Please sign up soon and coordinate a meeting(s) with your grad student(s) and other team member.  Try and keep the meetings to 30min or "

Two-signal System
Result
Design
Design of the system
To memorize a dynamic changing process of one signal or serial signals(Fig.1), we have proposed an idea of constructing a unique memory device with sequential memory structure, called MemOrderY, to record one changing signal in multiple time periods. Besides the signal we want to record, the Target signal, a Clock signal with the manner of oscillation is brought into the system to provide the circuit with the information about time. And we have chosen serine integrases to build the main parts due to their diversity, orthogonality between each other and high efficiency. Here, we are going to illustrate how we design the simplest version of this memory device, the two-signal system, which records one changing signal in two time periods.
Figure 1 | The overview of the input and output. A serial signal shown as blue lines is recorded in different time periods shown in light grey, obtaining the corresponding data. Two-signal system can only record in the first two grey blocks.
Overview of the whole circuit
As you can find in Fig.2, the whole circuit of two-signal system is made up of three parts: logic gates, sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules. Logic gates are where the signals from Target and Clock signals are processed. And sequential memory structures control the whole memory schedule, being the core part of this project. Integrases labeled with numbers belong to this part while those labeled with English letters belong to next part, basic orthogonal memory modules. IntA and IntB are true executors of signal memorizing, and designed to record the signal in early and late time period respectively.
Figure 2 | The overview of the circuit design. Each integrase and its related attB/P sites are shown in the same color. TF, Transcriptional facters; Int, Integrases; C, Clock; T, Target.
Notice:
You may be confused with what we have said in the description and above about the usage of serine integrases. In fact, in this project, serine integrases are not only used as memory devices based on DNA level in basic orthogonal memory modules, but also used to build the sequential memory structures which control the memor"

US_AFRL_CarrollHS,2018,Team:US AFRL CarrollHS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", September, and October the LabPats focused on repeating the ligation and transformation of the iGEM backbone, and our PRhl_31_CheZ_J23117_34_RhlR ordered from IDT. Finally, after a successful ligation, the LabPats transformed their ligation into DH5a cells, plated the transformation, and left it overnight. Afterward, a colony PCR was run to confirm that our transformation was successful. Overnight samples were made from transformation, and miniprepped. The miniprep was dried down in order to submit and ship to iGEM. The miniprep was digested and then ligated into CheZ knockout competent cells that were made from the E.coli strain UU2685 in order to perform motility. Ligation was then transformed and plated. Colonies were present on plate and a colony PCR was ran to confirm insert. Due to unexpected difficulties, we have not been able to perform the motility testing that we planned, but look forward to continuing testing.
Lab 2
Due to the incorrect sequencing of the original primers, new PCR Primers were ordered in order to amplify the DNA of the Chitinases and Cinnamaldehyde for assembly.  These orders were patiently awaited all month. While waiting on the primers, the entire team worked on the wiki, the presentation for Jamboree, and began work on designing the poster. Late in September, the PCR Primers finally arrived and work resumed.  The chitinases and the cinnamaldehyde were amplified and many assemblies and transformations were attempted, but not succeeded.  Throughout the entire lab process, high concentrations of the iGEM vector plasmid were extracted and new protocols for assembly were attempted.Outside of the lab work, the team focused this month on fine-tuning their presentation and creating a background story for the presentation.  Mock presentations were made to the school and mentors and criticism was taken and used to improve the presentation.  Several students of the team also presented a basic lesson of synthetic biology and our project to local grade schools as part of human outreach.  Finally, the team also worked on creating wiki content and on the poster for Jamboree.We got two parts!  Weeks of hard lab work finally paid off after the transformation and cloning of the bacteria containing our plasmid assembled into the iGEM backbone was accepted.  Chitinase C-1 and Chitinase B4A were then dried down and sent to iGEM.This month was spent fine-tuning the presentation and poster. Wiki is"

The CLS iGEM team started this year on an uphill struggle. To enter a competition of this magnitude is an impressive feat for any high school, let alone one that is entering for the first time and with minimal help from any Universities. We were told countless times to wait till we go to University to enter, or to spend this year raising funds and to enter next year. However, thanks to the generosity of the School and in particularly to Sarah Fletcher the Head, we raised enough money to enter 4 boys and the PI to Jamboree although every boy has done enough to merit a place. We have completed the vast majority of our lab work without any outside help, and we are thankful to Imperial for lending a helping hand when, and only when, required. We are in the unusual position of being in a boys only team, simply because CLS is a Boy’s School. However the fact that our team is comprised from only one school, unlike many of our competitors, has proved advantageous. We are able to meet up at incredibly short notice and we have gone through the inevitable ups and downs of microbiology as a coherent unit. The smaller number of people in the pool to choose from forced us to look beyond Biology as the primary skillset of useful Team members, and the resulting montage of skillsets in our team has allowed us to reach such heights.

As a High School team, the only elements of Synthetic Biology we studied before starting iGEM were the basics of protein synthesis as part of our Biology Course. So, in order to prepare for the work ahead of us we had to spend a few weeks of intensive studying and learning the basics of the molecular techniques we were going to use. One of our aims this year has been to set up a model that would allow the future teams from our school to take part in iGEM without needing significant help from any other institution, which is why we aimed to work as independently as possible using our own labs.
Textbooks we used at the earliest stage to research gene expression and basic techniques of Synthetic Biology:

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Toulouse,2014,Team:Toulouse#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," completely every two weeks. Because we work with fungi, we have to be very careful with the cleanliness of the BSC.
Electric burner
We also use electric burners to manipulate into a sterile area. The burning and fire risks are high but weaker than with a Bunsen Burner. We are very cautious when we use electric burners, and we use in preference BSC if it is possible. We do not have to wear gloves and we have to check that the electric burner is turned off after the manipulation.
Chemical hood
We use chemical hood in case we have to manipulate dangerous volatile chemical compound.
Water-bathes
The water-bathes are used extensively (transformation, digestion, etc.). However, they can be dangerous because of the exposition of boiling or hot water. We use special gloves for protecting us from heat, steam and projections. We verify that we have turned off the water-bathes at the end of the day.
Safety of our project
""Precaution is better than cure""
Several risks exist when working with microorganisms and manipulating genes. We can identify different classes of risk of our project now:
- risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab,
- risks to the safety and health of the general public,
- risks to the environment,
- risks to security through malicious use by individuals, groups, or countries.
There are also risks in the Future, linked to our project’s growth (new knowledge and methods development).
Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab
We work with the B. subtilis and E. coli chassis. These organisms are non-pathogenic. Moreover the used parts are also non-pathogenic (the bio-fungicides produced are harmless for humans).
On one hand, there is a major biological risk because of the manipulation of DNA and RNA of bacterial organisms.
On the other hand the main risk for humans is chemical: we use Ethidium Bromide, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, solutions from a Miniprep kit, ethanol and bleach.
However, we have a black room dedicated to the manipulation of Ethidium Bromide. Everything that touches something in this room cannot get out of the room. The waste has a special treatment.
For the other chemical solutions, we always use gloves and glasses, and if necessary a hood.
Furthermore, there are other risks such as UVs when we analyze an agarose gel but also water-bath and electrical/fire risks.
For protecting us from the UVs, we use adapted glasses.

A gel electrophoresis sample was next performed with these constructs, and SYBR safe was used as a visualizing agent for the DNA. 0.375 grams of Agrose in 50 ml of 1x TAE Buffer was heated to a boil to produce the homogenous gel mixture, 3 μl of SYBR safe visualizing gel agent was added, and this solution was cooled to produce the solidified gel.
6/30- Brent
PcyA and HO from 6/30 were PCR amplified using a 55℃ annealing temperature. For each PCR, 10 μl of HF buffer was added, 1 μl of 10 nM DNTP’s, 0.5 μl of DNA Polymerase, 23.5 μl of milliQ H20, and 9 additional microliters of milliQ H20. 2.5 μl of a forward primer was added, 2.5 μl of a reverse primer was added, and 1 μl of template DNA.
PCR was implemented with a ProFlex PCR system with the following parameters:
Initial Denaturation at 98 deg. C. for 30 seconds
Denaturation at 98 deg. C. for 10 seconds
Primer Annealing at 55 deg. C. for 30 seconds

"
Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Gallery_-_-_TEXT.html," year's iGEM competition and what other activities they were planning for outreach etc. After lunch and another set of presentations, there was a workshop session to which one member of our team attended each workshop, gaining a perspective on each subject area. Then came a poster session where teams could ask additional questions and propose collaboration requests. Jonah gained endless compliments on his art work on the poster, while the rest of the team got on with the serious business of drinking more coffee and chatting SynBio.
That evening we ventured further into London and found our hostel, then headed back out for the social. That night we got to know some members of the other teams better and made new friends from across the country. The next day was another day packed full of presentations and Synthetic Biology. Emily and Jeni were particularly tired as they were woken up by a busker playing the guitar outside their window at 6am (only in London!). Then it was our turn to present. We think the response to our project was great and we were asked lots of challenging questions, showing people had a good interest in our work. The afternoon consisted of chats about the different aspects of iGEM, like modelling and outreach for example, and then the event was wrapped up by the head of iGEM himself!
On the whole we feel that the conference was a real success and it was worthwhile to be able to meet other iGEM teams from the UK and gain insight into their projects. It is the first conference ever to be held by SynBioSoc and hopefully there will be more in the future! The conference allowed us to gain feedback and new ideas about our own project as well as being able to contribute ideas and helpful hints to other team's projects. The conference was also a way to set up potential collaborations with other teams or even just to network so that we would be able to ask for help in subject areas in which other teams had particular strengths . We feel that these kind of conferences are very important if Synthetic Biology is to continue expanding and growing as a new field. They allow project ideas to reach a wider audience and help form collaborations across the UK iGEM teams.

Miniprep L#, “R#”, F*, I*, QC J*4
For the rest - miniprep the full volume (see “upgraded” protocol: spin down cells → decant → resuspend in smaller volume before beginning the miniprep; pre-warm elution buffer to 55degC; run the same elution mixture through the column twice for maximum extraction)
Digest 10µL → gel run (gel is now in cold room, awaiting staining and visualization tomorrow)

User Interface
The UI is an intuitive web application that enables the user to interact with TERRA. The interface is designed so that it takes the necessary experiment information from the user and sends it to the device. The user will enter how many outputs their microfluidic chip has, the flow rate on the microfluidic chip, and properties about the fluid itself (density, continuous vs droplet, etc.). Given this information we are able to use our TERRA droplet predictive model to calculate a dispense time. The user can then select which wells each output should be dispensed into. This information is sent to the Arduino and enters the back-end software components. The video below demonstrates how an experimenter would use the UI.
The UI is able to facilitate communication between the user and TERRA through the use of Peripheral Manager, a daemon that runs on the workstation and facilitates communication between cloud-based applications and hardware connected to the workstation. This communication link uses WebSockets, a communication protocol that enables two way communication between the browser and server. Peripheral Manager takes advantage of this protocol for serial communication with the Arduino.
Designing the User Interface
When initially designing TERRA our team knew that we needed some sort of platform for the user to interact with our system. During the designing and testing phases of the individual hardware components, a simple Serial Monitor was enough to communicate data via a microcontroller. However, a Serial Monitor is not an ideal platform for users to interact with devices, so we decided to create a user-friendly web application to use as the user interface for TERRA. In addition to the UI, the website also contains full assembly instructions, component descriptions, and other any other relevant documentation for the user to access. The goal was to create a one-stop website for users to help streamline their experience.
The first step during the UI design process was to plan how it would look and create the static page via HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. The initial design, pictured below, was the first iteration of the UI. On the left side the user would enter information about their experiment, such as the number of outputs and the vessel they plan to use. They would then configure each output by inputting"

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," will swamp the image and not produce an accurate coliroid. Despite integrating His-tags into the design of this pathway, due to time constraints we were not able to nickel column extract the proteins to check for their production.
Red Light Module
We have successfully attached the OmpR specific promoter (ompC) to the cyan pigment coding region, and are now working on transforming the plasmid into EnvZ deficient cells (kindly provided to us by the Dundee iGEM 2013 Team).
This is due to OmpR and ompC being endogenously expressed in most E. coli strains as part of their osmoregulation. EnvZ is the transmembrane protein which phosphorylates OmpR (to become OmpR-P) when osmolarity in the cell changes; its phosphorylation triggers the production of outer membrane porins. In our project, we only want OmpR to be phosphorylated when the cells are exposed to green or blue light, and for phosphorylation to halt when exposed to red light. Obviously, if OmpR-P is being formed outside of these rules, we will be getting pigment production (or lack thereof) when we have not allowed it, which will ruin the images we are trying to develop. Hence, we will express the Red Light Module in EnvZ deficient cells. The plasmid for the Red Light Module contains coding for EnvZ, but also for the second half of the transmembrane protein which allows our system to be light responsive; Cph1. EnvZ and Cph1 work together to form Cph8.
We came across multiple issues with the assembly of this pathway. These include: misunderstanding a part description causing cells to output the wrong colour pigment, the well in the 2012 Kit Plate which we expected to be Cph8 actually coding for a human oestrogen receptor, transformation issues with home made competent cells and ligation inefficiencies brought about by attempting to ligate very small parts like BBa_B0034 to longer sequences.
Our work on the red light pathway uncovered that the coding sequence for BBa_K322124 when taken from the 2012 Kit Plates is not as stated on the Registry. This part should have been an RBS and the coding region for Cph8, however sequencing revealed that it is actually the coding sequence for a human oestrogen receptor.
We have managed to get the cyan pigment BBa_K592011 working after some difficulties with our digestions/ligations. The pigment takes a while to develop, around 36 hours compared to magenta's overnight development, but the colour is"

Thanks a lot to Wisam Zureik for recording and processing the video material!
Along our journey we were fortunate to meet a great number of interesting as well as dedicated people belonging to various fields, companies and societies.  Out of all people we met, the ""Makers"" from several Hackerspaces who demonstrated their work at the MakerFaire in Hannover, fascinated us the most. Their creativity and commitment for DIY Biology inspired us to take a deeper look into the DIY community or, to be more precise, the Community Labs Scene.
Established in America - New to Europe
Fascinated by DIY Hardware
Across the USA, you will find a wide spread of Community Labs. These open labs allow thousands of people to experience and get an understanding of biology. Furthermore, they provide an open platform that promotes discussions about life sciences. In contrast, there is only a tiny number of Community Labs in Europe, which are only scarcely connected.
We therefore started to contact and connect Community Labs in Europe. Due to their polarizing and educating character, the introduction of synthetic biology into the Community Lab Scene could have a huge impact on society. In cooperation with the Community Labs we met, we already reached a broad variety of open minded people of all ages. By helping and learning from each other we can bring the spirit of iGEM to everyone. Join us in exploring the exeptional world of Community Labs.

Week 16 : choosing an AHL pair, improving diffusion
Monday 8th September
We have enough crosstalk results to decide which pair of quorum sensing systems we will use : Las and Lux. See this article for more details.
Diffusion experiment (trying to have a correlation between channel length and time of fluorescence, having cells at the end of a channel and adding pure HSL at the other end of the channel, see this article for more details on the setup) : We tried lower concentrations of pure HSL and the wells start shining at different moments, but we still don't have any correlation between channel length and starting time of fluorescence, because our chip seems to be leaky and some wells dried completely. However, this experiment enables us to check that fluorescence appears after a reasonable time and that channel length probably doesn't influence this time too much.
On the modeling side, we are not able to retrieve diffusion coefficient of HSL from this diffusion experiment but we can use a parameter from literature.

Crosstalk experiments continued
Monday, 6th September
Until now we thought Lux was crosstalking too much with las and tried to improve the pair Las-Rhl. However we realized today that Rhl is difficult to improve and that our induction curves of Las and Lux are good enough, since Las is never responding to lux-HSL and we only have to be in a range of las-HSL concentrations that is below 10 nM to avoid Lux responding to las-HSL.

Kazakhstan Collab
Our collaboration with Kazakhstan team began when they contacted us to talk about molecular modelling. As we’re working with enzymes that can be highly influenced by their structures and their interactions, we were very glad to contribute with them.
We had a meet via Skype and we discussed and passed to them some of our data, and so they returned with a model, exploring the reasons behind all the molecular proprieties.
That’s important to understand the functioning of the protein and, maybe, we can solve certain problems or be able to find a probable substrate for the enzyme with these models.
Stockholm Collab
In September, we contacted the Stockholm team because our projects are similar and we wanted to exchange ideas and information. After a Skype meeting, we talked about how our projects were going and what we had done so far.
After this, they shared with us their knowledge about different Waste Water Treatment Plants presents in Sweden and we sent them the information we had about our local WWTP. With this information exchange, we were able to compare how Europe (Nordic) and South America (Brazil) regions treat their wastewater. This helped us on gain some perspective for our project's Application.
CCA San Diego Collab
Also in September, we received contact from CCA-San_Diego to do a collaboration. After some exchange on information about our projects, we decided to help their Public Engagement project
This iniciative consisted in a Video Series destinated to groups that want to attend on iGEM some day. It was a really nice way to see what we had achieved so far by sharing our expirience with future iGEMers. Check the videos here: https://2018.igem.org/Team:CCA-San_Diego/Engagement .

Collecting information from Latin America teams, UChile_Biotec team designed a magazine that gathered several aspects of the competition and the projects of the participating teams, as well as integrating cultural information. We joined this project by sharing details and the implications of our project, our own experience as iGEM members and describing some interesting, fun elements of the Brazilian culture regarding science and biotechnology.

Experiment:
Goal: To  test the fluorescence intensity of PBAD-RLT beads.
Each  well contained 5 beads. Ara: 20 uL, 50 mM
As the  graph shows, beads emitted approximate intensity of fluorescence when  cultivated for 10h, no matter what time Ara was added. So we can add Ara after  beads were transferred into culture medium for 3 h in our later experiments.
Device  construction:
Filled  the tubes with beads and tested the properties of tubes using a peristaltic  pump to pump water through the tubes,
Finding:  The flow of the pump was too small and the flow was blocked badly in tubes.  Each tubes had different resistance to water, thus the flow in each tubes was  different. While blasting air through tubes, an upright tube would   make air pass easier. Also, the flow should  not be too fast, otherwise the beads will rush to one side and plug up the  tube.

Sequence from plasmid
For verification of Tn5-lin insertion in pACYC, primers 003, 012, 029 and 030 were used for sequencing. The sequencing starts from the -20 bp position of fragment Tn5-lin, flanking the promoter of T7 and terminator from T7 of the vector.

""What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others and the world remains and is immortal.""
Our project provides a brand-new solution for cell therapy of cancer – to deal with free extracellular ligands instead of cell surface antigens, which are obviously difficult to reach because of the barrier of tumour microenvironment.
For clinical application, the STEP system can be used to equip cells for cancer therapy. Stable STEP cell line can be produced with T cells extracted from patients. Then it can be reinfused into the blood to monitor level of target ligand and to produce specific drug in real time (Figure 1). In this way we can release patients from the pain of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, while inhibit tumour development in a more efficient way.
Figure 1.
One of the biggest advantage STEP has over other treatments is its modifiable upstream and downstream. For ligand recognition, we’ve already developed STEP for VEGF and for D-Dimer, the former for broad-spectrum scanning for tumour and the latter more specific for NSCLC. Both systems will be ready to use after overall test and optimisation in T cells. Our users can also select one or more tumour marker for a particular cancer type, clone the scFv or other kinds of binding domains to the extracellular domain and test the output. The binding affinity can always be increased, or in some cases decreased, with the help of our user-friendly assistant software and Rosetta. If there’s no sequence of binding domain available, we can also help you design a high-affinity scFv in silico with these softwares (Figure 2). As a result, we can literally achieve recognisation of any customer appointed ligands with our STEP system.
Figure 2.
Another superiority of STEP is the tuneable downstream and the changeable reporter. The curve of downstream gene expression can be easily modified either by simply changing a transcription factor, or by altering the binding"

Q1:
Why not incorporate SBW in this software to make it more powerful？
A1:
As SBML has become a standard description format for modeling a biological system. Considering the output of our design obeys this standard, a combination with SBW tools such as cell designer should be incorporated in our software for analysis and simulation purpose. We have left a button “SBW” and have written the interface template in our software.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#human practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the public, by taking an interdisciplinary approach to the evaluation of its role and impact on society. InnovationLabs are events that bring students in touch with startups, inventors and accomplished researchers, inspiring them to start the next big thing, in a way that they would advance humanity and influence the world. We decided to hold two workshops during the event; one for dry lab oriented students and one for wet lab enthusiasts. During the dry lab workshop in May we went into detail of our then-only analysis; that of miRNA differential expression analysis and explained the algorithm behind it as well as the basic principles of modeling. We presented them with a simple example of a stoichiometric matrix that we turned into differential equations. Moreover, our workshop included:
-Computer modelling of genetic circuits (fuzzy logic)
-Searching for miRNA expression data in patients (GDC)
-Selecting the most appropriate miRNA candidates (MATLAB, R)
-Annotating miRNAs of patients and matching them with the involved genes and metabolic pathways (R, Diana Tools, KEGG, GO analysis)
-Structuring suitable ODEs for simulating biological systems-phenomena (MATLAB)
For the wet lab workshop, team members formed with participants a “think tank” as a way to brainstorm and design a synthetic biology project. By simulating the engineering cycle and following multiple abstraction levels (System → Device → Part → DNA), the students were able to come up with innovative ideas (such as yeast cells targeting cancer), consisting of different modules.In addition, to back-up their proposed design the following tools were covered:
-Various top-notch technologies (e.g. CRISPR / Cas9, Gibson Assembly).
-The iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts
-Software for the construction of desirable DNA sequences (e.g. SnapGene)
We put in great time for the preparation of the aforementioned hands-on experiences that foster exploration, innovation, and interest in the emerging field of synthetic biology. The goal was to show the participants how the two labs of an iGEM team work independently but they combine and collaboratively interpret their results. Finally, we were excited that we received enthusiastic feedback as the students quickly made progress and designed a project from scratch learning engineering methods to approach a concept and solve occurring problems.

As for the OD measurement, we used LB medium as our blank. Since samples for fluorescence measurement were acquired from the cuvettes for the OD measurement, sample processed in plate reader had the same dilutions.
Results
After observing the optical density (OD) and fluorescence for 18 hours while taking samples every 2 hours, the following results were obtained:
Interlab Study Results
Our measurements of fluorescence and optical density of the three genetic devices and a negative control.
This shows that all cultures had ODs in the same range throughout the experiment. After the exponential growth phase the stationary phase started shortly after 4 hours of cultivation time. The OD did not change from thereon until a cultivation time of 16 hours after which it started to decline.
The development of fluorescence followed largely the pattern of the OD, but differed a lot in between the different cultures. J23101.E0240 exhibited fluorescence three times stronger than I20260, and about 10 times stronger than B0015 and J23115.E0240. The latter two did not differ in terms of fluorescent signal.
Discussion
The OD is an indirect measurement of the biomass in the shake flask. Through the correlation of both measurements the results show that the difference in biomass of the cultures is not significantly enough to affect the fluorescence data. Therefore, the fluorescence data can be interpreted as a direct result of the fluorescence per cell instead of an overall fluorescence per culture.
The fluorescence data shows a strong difference between the I20260 and J23110.E240. Even though both inserts are the same, there is a difference in fluorescence, as expected, because of the different plasmid backbones. The high copy plasmid pSB1C3 shows a 3 times stronger fluorescence signal per cell than the low to mid copy plasmid pSB3K3. This can be directly related to the number of plasmids in the cells coding for GFP.
Both J23115.E0240 and B0015 show no significant fluorescence. The increase at 4 hours is explained by the increase of OD resulting in noise. B0015 behaves therefore as expected. J23115.E0240 in its original, non-mutated state was supposed to show a slight but weaker fluorescence than J23101.E0240. However, the mutations introduced made the promoter non-functional, which lead to no expression of GFP and therefore no observation of fluorescence.

On the bacteria side of the room, there are 8 petri dishes with letters and numbers written all over them. There is also a gene template on the wall. They have to recreate the gene template with the symbols on the side of the petri dishes. When all of the petri dishes are stacked up, the players can read from the top « iGEM 2017 », that they have to write on the computer. Concept: Gene sequence
On the interns’ side of the room, they have a DNA template, with base pairs, however 4 bases are missing. They also have a lot of letters with a number on each, they have to find the missing base and when associated with the right nucleotide on the DNA template it gives a code. The code opens the box from the Box with UV light enigma (10). Concept: Fluorescence, plate reader
On the interns side of the room, there is a box filled with ice with the letters S E N S O R and other decoy letters. Concept: Biosensor
The game works with a computer interface where the players have to write words missing during the first part and then complete the 5 biobricks on the computer in the second part. The goal is for the bacteria and the interns to collaborate to complete the interface and escape the lab. Our game is designed for players aged from 16 and older, we created it to be a perfect balance between fun and education, for people to learn what biology is without even realizing it!

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," much more efficient optimization of existing genetic systems, is that scale up of biomolecule production could be done much more quickly than is now possible. This is significant because it is foreseeable that in the future a rare chemical or medicine derived from biological sources could require rapid scale up, and the ability to quickly optimize coding sequences could be extremely valuable.
BIODETOXIFICATION PATHWAY PROJECT:
Our strains of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida are engineered to be unable to survive outside of the laboratory and we use antibiotics to prevent other bacteria from growing. However, if our materials should ever become contaminated with wild-type bacteria, they could potentially transfer antibiotic resistance markers between hosts. We are inserting the neomycin resistance marker into the genome of P. putida and intend to remove it via homologous recombination in a second round of cloning. If that sample becomes contaminated, it is theoretically possible that other bacteria could acquire this antibiotic resistance. The late stage goal of this project is to engineer E. coli with a pathway to degrade the furfural toxin, which would allow it to survive in the presence of furfural and also metabolize it for energy. At a larger scale we could unknowingly be selecting for a more robust bacteria if any wild-type E. coli was ever able to acquire the pathway or antibiotic resistance markers.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
CODON OPTIMIZATION:
Since transgenic organisms almost always grow slower than their wild type counterparts, our hosts, shackled with a metabolically demanding reporter gene such as GFP would stand little chance at reproduction in the wild. In addition, by knowing the sequence of DNA in the plasmid harboring the fluorescent gene, measures could be taken to disable the transcriptive or translational machinery in these organisms. We are committed to making this data available to anyone who would require it.
BIODETOXIFICATION:
The biodetoxification project currently uses an auxotrophic strain of E. coli, in which it cannot grow without leucine. In the future we would intend for others to use similarly auxotrophic strains for biofuel production. If a strain of E. coli was engineered that it could live on furfural, this facility would have to be kept separate from other facilities producing furf"

The First Annual Virginia iGEM Meet-Up
On Friday June 27th, we hosted our first meet-up for iGEM teams in the surrounding area.  Members of the Rutgers, Duke and Georgia Tech teams came out to the meet up.  We began with short presentations by each team of their projects for the summer.  Teams then split into specialized discussion groups; these groups discussed topics such as the iGEM lab experience, human practices and community outreach, and finance.  We ended the main portion of the event with a discussion of team collaboration.  Some team members then joined us for dinner on the Corner and a night on the Downtown Mall.

Strength prediction for a transcription signal amplification system (BBa_K2201373) :
We modeled and visually compared the mRFP production over time for a normal mRFP reporter system and compared it to our enhanced signaling. .    Validity was done as part of the positive selection process for an adapted tRNA synthetase.
Short Summary
As our project explores possibilities of an expanded genetic code via unnatural bases and non-canonical amino acids,     we set out to complement and improve our lab work via modeling of novel amino acyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS) for a non-canonical amino     acids, which were synthetized in our lab. In order to incorporate non-canonical amino acids into proteins via the translational     process, the aaRS has to attach the amino acid to the respective tRNA. Thus, we designed aaRS sequences which were adjusted     to link our own non-canonical amino acid to a fitting tRNA. Candidates were evaluated and selected, based on a ROSETTA score.    Most promising sequences were ordered via gene synthesis for the experimental validation.     Figure 1 provides a rough overview of our modeling project. Table 1 below summarizes the realization in practice.

A stylized overview of our modeling project,    containing both in silico and in vivo components.
Table 1: Steps of our modeling project Our modeling project consists of seven main steps, combining in silico and in vivo components.
Step
Software/Method
Meaning
1. Ligand preparation
Manually via Avogadro
Due to the novelty of our amino acid, no information on the ligand is available in databases.        Therefore, manual generation of a conformer ensemble, containing        for example all energetically useful arrangements of atoms within the molecule, was required.
2. Scaffold categorization
ROSETTA protocol
The scaffold describes the rough layout of the synthetase. We downloaded the scaffold 1J1U , the aaRS of Methalonococcus janischii as a template, and then relaxed its structure to improve the outcome of the ROSETTA algorithm.
3. Set simulation constrains
Manually via ROSETTA
Constrains with regards to possible mutations of the synthetase ensure that the generated sequences fit to the amino acid.        For example, we constrained the distance between certain atoms and their angle to a range optimal for hydrogen bonds.

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," system high RDF expression can be matched with high Int expression and the switch can still flip. Since the PhiC31-style system allows for RDF to complex with Int in solution, RDF can be sequestered by Int in solution. This allows for they dynamics we see in Figure 3.
Two-switch Systems
A promoter switch system may be subject to noise, where the switch temporarily flips accidentally due to a burst of integrase expression. If there are multiple copies of the switch present in the cell, there is a region of Int and RDF expression where some copies of the switch are flipped while others are not (the range of colours between blue and red in Figure 3). This behvaiour is undesirable, as it is not “switch-like”; since a switch is an all-or-nothing device, we would like our switches to function this way even when they are present in multiple copies.
We wanted to see if use of a two-switch system, wherein the first switch controls the second switch, could improve the “switch-like nature” of a multi-copy set of switches. If the first switch must flip to completion before the second switch flips, then the expression range where switching is only partial may be reduced in the second switch.
We modeled a two-switch system where the first switch controls expression of the Int and RDF corresponding to the second switch (RDF2 and Int2).  RDF2 is expressed when switch 1 is in its initial PB state, and Int2 is expressed when switch 1 is flipped to RL state. The Int and RDF corresponding to switch 1 are now referred to as Int1 and Int2 (Figure 4).
Figure 4. A two-switch system where the second switch is controlled by the first switch.
Modelling the Two-switch System
In this system, we have state variables for Int2 and RDF 2 (I2 and R2), their mRNAs, and complexes involving them and the second switch. The two-switch system was modelled using the same principles described for the one-switch system, with one extra detail: the transcription rate of Int2 and RDF2 genes depends on the state of switch 1. We introduce the parameter,
αS1,
the transcription rate from the promoter in switch 1. The differential equations for Int2 and RDF2 mRNAs are given by:
where Pi are complexes involving S1 in PB state, and Rj are complexes involving switch 1 in RL state.
Sensitivity Analysis of a Two-switch System
We simulated the two-switch system with varying Int1 and RDF1 promoter strengths. We used 50 switches in the simulations"

Challenges and Limitations
Using the bacterial two hybrid system as a screening method for peptide aptamers proposes several limitations.
Figure 1: Membrane bound proteins
Firstly E.coli has to be able to produce the target protein and the protein must have the same conformation as it would in its native species and environment. Since this screening method functions intracellularly, the target proteins are limited to intracellular proteins. Please consult figure 1 for further elaboration.
Figure 2: Size Restriction
Secondly there is a limit to the size of the target protein, please consult figure 2 for an elaboration on the subject.
The biggest limitation of the bacterial two hybrid system is that it can only screen for peptide aptamers against proteins. The targets have to be encoded in a nucleotide sequence. But many other molecules besides proteins are immunogenic antigens, such as lipopolysaccharides or sialic acids on the surface of bacteria. In principle a peptide aptamer could be generated to target these types of molecules, but not by using the bacterial two-hybrid"

The second approach was to construct this column in a more professional way, and so we asked the technical workshop of our university for assistance. They helped us by cutting the parts more precisely and so improve the applicability of the column. This lead us to two versions of the purification column, a 3D-printed show model and the application model.

We used a 3D-Printer to print the scaffold blocks and cut the front and back plate and the top and bottom hold bars by our self from acrylic glass. The glass slides were not biotinylated yet and the plates are not UV-permeable, so not usable, but the basis of further improvement and test of sealing and compatibility of the lab pumps. Besides the 3D-printed parts we cut and drilled the acrylic glass blocks and plates, the 3-mm threaded rods and the rubber mats at the home of a team member following our 3D-model.
Preparation of the non-3D-printed parts at the home of team member Markus.
We then assembled the parts and luckily everything matched as expected. The hand cut pattern of the rubber mat was still a bit uneven but should be still functional for some preliminary tests.
Inside and outside of the EluX prototype.
We were very happy that our first self-build model looks exactly like the 3D-modell and we were very excited to show it to some experts to gain some opinions and advices for the following design and construction of the application model.
Comparison of the build and presented show model and the 3D-Model.
We used this show model at our meetings with Prof. Dr. Dirk Lütkemeyer, General Manager of BIBITEC GmbH, and Dr. Benjamin Müller, CEO of Biofidus AG for Analytical Services. They advised us in building the shown models professionally to test and validate the system and also discussed the further development of the column and possible applications.
Elux: Theoretical basics
Affinity Purification columns
To purify specific target proteins out of the cell lysate, different approaches are adequate. One of the most common method (Mersha and England, 1997) is an affinity chromatography where the target protein is fused to a tag that binds specifically to a compound on the surface of the packed beads in the chromatographic column. In this case, different systems are in use, for example the highly specific and strong streptavidin-biotin"
UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile2#SpiderColi#Notepad_-_-_TEXT.html,"March, 5 - 11, 2012
The whole team met for the first time after the vacations of February. We discussed our scheduling and divided ourselves in two groups: Cyanolux and Bactomythril. The leaders of each group were elected: Carla (Cyanolux) and Claudia (Bactomithril).
Cyanolux: Wetlab: Simon, Seba / Drylab: Carla, Tamara, Isaac  Bactomithril: Wetlab: Ulises, Bryon / Drylab: Claudia, Emilia, Max
Carla and Max were chosen to maintain the wiki updated.
Bernardo and Rolando are going to collaborate with both groups.
Also, we scheduled meetings of the whole team every Friday or Tuesday (depending on the availability of the majority of the team), and meetings with the whole team and our advisor, Professor Rodrigo Gutierrez, every other Thursday. Likewise, each group should have their own meetings.
Finally, we decided to work based on delivery dates. Each member should compromise to complete a task in specific time intervals.
March, 12 - 18, 2012
We registered our team in iGEM. Now we are officially part of iGEM 2012! Also we began to learn how to use our wiki. Our Bactomithril project is still in its initial stage, so we began to read as many papers about recombinant spider silk and protein modeling as we could.
Some of the most relevant papers we found are
- Xia et al. 2010 - “Native-sized recombinant spider silk protein produced in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli results in a strong fiber”
- Widmaier et al. - 2009 - “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers”
We learnt about interesting protein modeling and simulation software (e.g. Rosetta, Foldit), and some protein visualization software  (PyMOL, VMD, Chimera)
Additionally, we began to send emails requesting genetic sequences from spider silk to scientists from other countries. According to what we know, in Chile nobody works with natural or recombinant spider silk proteins or its genetic sequences. So that this is a real challenge to us.
March, 19 - 25, 2012
The iGEM team Slovenia 2009 had a project potentially useful for our own project. For that reason, we sent an email to them asking if they could share their biobricks Bba_K245005 and Bba_K245113 with us.  They answered"

Process
The idea was put forward in 2015 iGEM Asian Conference in NCTU (Hsinchu, Taiwan) at the end of July. The initial team consists of BIT, BIT-China, CGU-Taiwan and CUHK. We found that we can conduct a global survey which can achieve that all of teams can share the data about their own project from different areas. The idea attracted Stockholm’s attention and they brought the teams from Europe and America in at the beginning of August. During August, all the teams made efforts to collect the questionnaires from public and we processed data at the beginning of September. Ultimately, each team can gain the different data from other 10 regions and it’s useful for every project to improve their world-wide adaptability.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#notebook 9_-_-_TEXT.html,", finish E.coli oscillator database, update DB document. Discuss UI with Soimort and push him to work faster, discuss synchronized E.coli with Zhaoyi Li. Have fun working.
Summary: Today is Oct 7, and I have just start writing work summary of the last week in Sep. During last 2 weeks we celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival and had 7 day off for National Day, while others are enjoying themselves traveling, we iGEM team members didn’t take a day off. We have to seize every minute to make our software work! I guess I’m just too busy to write my work log, and right now I am trying my best to recall what exactly I did in the last week of Sep…
Here’s what I can remember.
Zhaoyi Li looked into the nature article on synchronized ecoli clock and gave a brief lecture, then he started to analyze all the reaction and species in the model, and prepare to write the DB of it. Zhengda He’s parents came to see him, so he disappeared for 3 days or so. He has finished part of EPF-Lausanne DB but not all, so Yubo Qi kicked in to investigate the proper parameters for reaction. Unfortunately, it’s almost a hopeless task, no reliable source with specified parameters can be found, so we gave up at last.
I finished another detail draft on input UI design, and Soimort is constructing our UI according to it. I tried to discuss more with Soimort and push him harder, but can’t find the right way…
My girlfriend came and we spent 3 days together. It was 3 halves of days actually, since there are tasks I cannot put aside. However, she was so thoughtful and supportive, and didn’t complain about my absence. We had our sweet moments together. Her visiting means a lot to me, and fuels me up with energy to work on.

every single one of them said they suffered from imposter syndrome at some point during their career.
We therefore again have to question why there is this inherent lack of confidence and whether an undergraduate degree does enough to prepare students for their futures. Dr Lewis talked of her Masters student, a very intelligent woman who had published three papers whilst undergoing the Masters degree; who could have walked into any top quality PhD position. When she asked her about the prospect of future study, the student said:
I’m not sure I’m good enough
It is difficult to listen to all these accounts of the lack of confidence that female students and academics have in themselves and say convincingly that people are trying their hardest to stop this from being the case. Confidence is a real issue, and the consequences of a lack of confidence can be devastating.
In both the meetings with Dr Griffiths and Dr Santos we talked about the problem of maternity leave. Dr Griffiths proposed that more should be done to promote a parental leave, shared between both parents, relieving some of the stress and tensions normally felt by the woman during the early periods of family life. Dr Santos provided a very interesting and shocking account of how she was judged for her decisions on balancing family and career. Dr Lewis talked about her experiences of her friends who had left the country to go to Sweden for their Post-doctorate fixed term jobs:
Because they could have families...they could share leave...the paid time off was greater and that meant their ability to continue their career progression was better as a result
If academics are leaving the country to have better quality of life for them and their families then we need to take a hard look at our education system and university career progression. Dr Lewis did stress, however, that:
In the last few years, we have done an awful lot
It might seem that from these shocking personal accounts of gender inequality and ingrained lack of confidence in female students, nothing is being done by the university to make a difference, however with the work of Athena Swan, more women are getting a voice in science. The university are encouraging leadership and mentoring courses for women so they can compete with all their peers. All three of Dr Griffiths, Dr Santos and Dr Lewis have highlighted the work of the University on improving equality, diversity and inclusivity but it must not be forgotten that there is still inherent gender inequality and as Dr Lewis showed, intelligent female scientists still feel unworthy of applying for top quality jobs in science. This is something that needs to change.

1. What I have done in the past 2 weeks is mostly making gradual improvements on Resource Manager. I have been keeping in close touch with Viktor and helping his debug each time he encounters a bug on the Resource Manager's side. I fixed the bugs that we found during the Tasby's meeting as well as features that needs to be implemented.  For example, I implemented the incubator as well as differing DiTi sizes.
We are currently finishing debugging RM and Puppeteer and getting ready to test the whole flow on the robot. I am also working to revamp all the format of all the JSON Objects that are being passed back and forth between Puppeteer and ResourceManager to a more consistent and predictable format. Me and Viktor agreed that as RM grown, the differing return formats for each individual method is becoming harder and harder to manage, so this new format will make it easier for users to understand what those returns are.
2. My work fits into the overall iGem project as the bridge between Clotho design and physical assembly. The automation in assembly completes the entire workflow from a high level description to physical assembly. This is something that not every lab can do, but we have both the software platform and the Evoware robot to complete a design from start to finish with the push of a few buttons.
3. There are a number of features and hurdles that we bypassed using a pretty hackous solution just to get the flow working, those short term approaches must be finalized with more permanent implementations.
Week of 6/20 -Revamp JSON formats -Sample Naming, a. UUID b. Auto-Generated Linearized SDSTree c. User-defined names
Week of 6/27 -Sample History Implementation and Search
Week of 7/4 -Learn Puppeteer/Python for July demo -Get the entire workflow debugged and tested
Week of 7/11-Parallelism and Optimization. Optimize movement to pipette from many wells at the same time instead of using only one Diti at a time
Today: So today was rather productive. Me and Viktor communicated over Skype in the morning to get some final bugs fixed and we met up at the wetlab at 3pm to test our protocols on the robot.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,": NRPSpredictor2, Stachelhaus, and Minova et al.  [11,17]. Stachelhaus et al. aligned the binding pocket of 160 adenylation domains based on the first solved structure of NRPS A domain, PheA using a structural alignment approach[15]. By trimming off the sequence, 10 core amino acids encoding specificity in the binding pocket were identified, giving rise to the Stachelhaus code, see Table 1. In addition, it was shown that by modifying the binding pocket in silico, substrate affinity could be altered or relaxed  [16].​
Prediction of substrate affinity is sometimes complicated by the fact that adenylation domains may incorporate a variety of different amino acids. This is represented by a redundancy in the Stachelhaus code, though this is very low[16]. Tyrocidine is one example of this phenomenon. Tyrocidine is a commercially available mixture of non-ribosomal antibiotics synthesized by Brevibacillus parabrevis. It consists of four decapeptides varying at three amino acids (see Table 2) and is synthetized by the NRPS Tyrocidine Synthetase A-C, containing 1, 3, and 6 modules, respectively. (see Figure 2 )
Tyrocidine has a unique mode of action wherein it disrupts the function of the cell membrane. Unfortunately, it has high toxicity towards human blood and reproductive cells and can only be used in topical applications. This makes tyrocidine an interesting target for drug improvement. Our initial plan was to express tyrocidine in Bacillus subtilis, but due to time constraints we decided to focus on manipulating the native Surfactin synthetase with our oligo recombineering technology.

Samples were prepared for mass spectrometric analysis of circularisation..First activity assays were run, showing activity of all modified proteins.
Behaviour of circular DNMT1 compared to linear DNMT1 after a 5 sec heat shock at PCR conditions was analysed.
In another experiment, we attempted to prove circularisation with thrombin cleavage, which did not work to not pure enough sample solution.
Additional activity assays to support the data were run.
First PCRs: With ordered primers to extract inteins Ssp DnaE and Npu DnaE CDS for plasmids that we got from Addgene.
In this week we did our first CPECs to build our pre-circularization standard with a ccdb insert as protein of interest. We build constructs with and without a His-tag. Constructs with a His-tag we could use for Western Blots.
Toolbox:
Assembly Construct: Planning for a universal two-part assembly construct. The construct should be available for all inteins and enable the user to scarlessly clone any protein inside using Golden Gate Cloning.
Circularization-Test:
By cutting it with BsaI and a GFP CDS amplified by PCR with restriction sites with EcoRI and SpeI we used our first Npu Circularisation construct to yield a first GFP circularisation construct.
Expression vectors:
As we planned to generate a whole bunch of genes whose function need to be tested after an induced expression, we decided to construct expression backbones with a strong inducible promoter in front of the the Biobrick prefix to get rid of one extra cloning step for all constructs. We chose a well established LacI repressible T7 promoter.
Toolbox:
Assembly Construct: A standard was designed for universal restriction overhangs that lie inside the N- and C-terminal splicing sites of most inteins (N: Cystein, C: Asparagin). This standard will allow to clone a protein once PCR-amplified together with any of our inteins. Should also be adopted for the Circularisation Construct.
Expression vektors: Oligos containing the lacI repressible T7 promoter were cloned into the EcoRI site of the BioBrick prefix of all pSB1X3 and pSB4X5
Construct was cloned into an expression vector (pSBX1C3) with NpuDnaE-GFP-H6 and Ssp-GFP-H6 (ID 44,45).

Chalmers iGEM and Dr. Eriko Takano
Biodetection of hCG hormone
The Chalmers Gothenburg team are working to modify Saccharomyces cerevisiae to function as a biosensor for the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG). This hormone is produced in the body during pregnancy and and their idea is for their biosensor is to function as a simple pregnancy test. They also plan to introduce genes for bio-indigo production as the output signal of the pregnancy test.
Moving Biotech into a Problem-Based Field
Prof. Dr. Eriko Takano (Groningen) has an internationally leading position in the field of small signalling molecules in Streptomyces coelicolor, the model organism of the major group of commercial antibiotic producers. Her research interests include the synthetic biology of new antibiotics, the systems biology of the metabolic switch from primary to secondary metabolism, and the regulation of antibiotic production through signalling molecules.

Backgrounds
Good bricks make strong buildings. The same is true in the field of synthetic biology. To ensure the biobricks created in iGEM competitions are repeatable and reliable ,a robust measurement procedures been developed for green fluorescent protein (GFP) over the last three years by the Measurement Committee, through the InterLab study.Also,numbers of teams participate in this standardized measurement project.We’re honored to participate in the fourth International InterLab Measurement Study.
Aim
By providing a protocol in details as well as forms helping unify the analyse of data,the Measurement Committee hopes to handle the problems emerged while establishing a baseline for replicability of fluorescence measurements.So with the same devices,the same protocol and devices,we try to measure the fluorescence intensity controlled by this year’s devices and study the distribution pattern of those results with teams all over the world.
Methods
Cell Transformation
The following devices (from InterLab Measurement Kit) were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α:
● Positive control ● Negative control ● Test Device 1: J23101+I13504 ● Test Device 2: J23106+I13504 ● Test Device 3: J23117+I13504 ● Test Device 4: J23101.BCD2.E0040.B0015 ● Test Device 5: J23106.BCD2.E0040.B0015 ● Test Device 6: J23117.BCD2.E0040.B0015
Transformation Selection
2 colonies from each of plate were picked and inoculated on 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Cell preservation
200 µL of each of the 16 overnight cell cultures was mixed with 400 µL 50% glycerol and the mixture was preserved at -20℃.

UNBC-Canada,2017,Team:UNBC-Canada#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," the fundamental structure of DNA and proper base-pairing. We then used the vacuum chamber to “blow-up” the marshmallow DNA. These camps were a raging success! Each group listened intently to us teaching and participated actively asking great questions as we moved along. What’s more, in the August camp the children spontaneously began chanting DNA! Based on how well we were received we were, we plan on collaborating with the camps again next year.
Highschool Presentations
Another way we brought synthetic biology to the north was through classroom presentations at local high schools and as well as high schools in towns surrounding us; these included North Peace Secondary School in Fort Saint John, Correlieu Secondary School in Quesnel, Prince George Secondary School, and College Heights Secondary School in Prince George. Our presentations were constructed to garner young interest in synthetic biology as a field. We discussed introductory concepts on synthetic biology, applications of biotechnology including CRSIPR, and finished off each presentation with what iGEM is, and what our team was working on this year. Each class we visited were vibrating with interest on the new concepts, and were highly interactive with thoughtful questions.
Lesson Plans for High School Students
In conversations with local high school teachers we learned that only basic synthetic biology concepts are taught in grade 11 and 12 biology classrooms, while the unit on biotechnology previously included was removed from the British Columbia curriculum in 2016. We decided to act on this and create short lessons regarding introductory synthetic biology and biotechnology that could be easily integrated into the busy schedule of the high school classrooms. Our lesson book is a simple interactive material that serves to introduce high school students to the field of synthetic biology and introductory biotechnology. Each lesson includes a short one to two-page write-up of a specific concept(s), followed by a concept check. Each student reads the lesson then can answer the questions independently in class or as homework, in groups, or as class discussion. Our lesson book was enthusiastically received by high school teachers around Prince George, as well as by teachers in other communities. We distributed the finished product to the interested teachers for them to use as additional classroom material throughout the year and for years to come.
Central Interior Science Exhibition
In April, we participated in the Central Interior Science Exhibition Demonstration at UNBC. This event fit perfectly into our initiative “Bringing Synthetic Biology to the North”. At this event, we had the opportunity to provide hands-on and interactive activities for young students ranging from 7-12.  For one activity, we conducted Strawberry DNA Extractions, first we talked about DNA, what it is, and what"

Syn-Bio logically explained: A dictionary
Motivation
With the ongoing advances in synthetic biology, a distinct dialog between researchers and the public becomes more and more essential. While genetic engineering is a heavily discussed topic, communicative difficulties are often the starting point for misunderstandings, which leads to a twisted public opinion about synthetic biology.  While working on our iGEM project, we have noticed that a lot of people outside of the scientific area have difficulties to understand our project. Since we are working on a highly specific issue, we assumed that people have trouble to comprehend the biological background of our project, but apparently we were wrong. We spoke with Florian Helfer, a student in cultural anthropology at Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, who told us that the vocabulary we are using is too confusing for people who are not working in the field of synthetic biology.
Realization
To resolve this problem, we have designed and published a dictionary containing a list of scientific terms from synthetic biology and iGEM in general. These words and terms are described by using common English phrases and simplified as much as possible.  We started our collection by gathering words we were commonly using in our everyday lab work, but we soon realized, that we have to expand"
Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#VitaminA_-_-_TEXT.html,".
An optimized HMG gene
Additionally, we codon-optimized for S. cerevisiae the HMG-CoA reductase gene from S. aureus that had been used by Li & al. in 2013. Indeed, their study had shown that S. cerevisiae transformed with this gene had a better ß-carotene yield than the ones transformed by the tHMG1 from S. cerevisiae; it is highly probable than a codon-optimized version of this gene from S. aureus would produce even more ß-carotene.
Chromosomal integration
In the strain containing the polycistron designed by Beekwilder, the polycistronic construct is on a plasmid (pUDC082). But since in our final product we would like our yeast to grow on non-selective media and to keep the polycistron, we designed a way to integrate the construct in the yeast chromosome. Our plan was to use the HO-Poly-KanMX4-HO plasmid (AddGene plasmid #51662) as a backbone for our construct: it's a yeast plasmid for chromosomal integration into the HO locus, with a selection marker for yeast (KanMX4). This plasmid also has an origin of replication for E. coli and a selection marker for bacteria (Ampicillin).
Map of the HO-Poly-KanMX4-HO plasmid containing our optimized polycistron:
Mutation optimization
Another very different way to improve the sequence of the pathway would be to replace the regions that are the most likely to mutate by alternative, more stable versions. Indeed, our strain is meant to be released in the environment without containment and to be consumed by people, so if mutations were to happen in the genes we have engineered, the yeast's ability to produce ß-carotene could be greatly reduced, or lost.
To address this problem, we made a collaboration with the Vanderbilt iGEM Team 2015, who invented an algorithm to scan the sequences looking for regions that are likely to mutate. Thanks to their software they were able to find alternative versions of the polycistronic construct crtE/YB/I and HMG-CoA genes that were more robust and durable."
Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html,"etase pair for incorporation of tyrosine at an amber termination codon (the pair containing the tRNA mentioned above) is co-transformed with pFRY , a flourescent reporter plasmid for measurement of incorporation of ncAA into BL21 DE3 gold, which is induced by 100 µM ITPG. pFRY is one part of the two plasmid reporter system for measurement of incorporation efficiency of ncAA via amber supression. It consists of two fluorescent domains connected through a linker sequence containing an amber stop. When induced with IPTG, a the fluorescence can be measured. A red fluorescence is always visible upon induction, and if an amino acid is incorporated in response to the recoded amber stop codon, a green fluorescence intensity is also measurable. Fidelty and efficiency of the incorporation can be determined by comparison of fluorescent levels. This experiment is performed in order to obtain fluorescence spectra of mRFP1 and sfGFP. GFP formation is measured as a result of successful amino acid incorporation via amber supression. Excitation and emission spectra of mRFP1, and sfGFP were obtained through measurements with a modified Biolector set-up. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
K2020051
- mutated tRNA synthetase specific for tyrosine and UAG codon in E. coli → Y-RS with Y32G This is a DMNBS-synthetase to be used as an orthogonal tRNA synthetase in E. coli. It can be used in combination with the cognate tRNA K2020042 to incorporate tyrosine in response to an amber stop codon. This synthetase has Y32 mutated to glycine and is therefore a template for further mutations for the purpose of changing amino acid specificity. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of ncAA: Most synthetases are used in low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The tRNA and the synthetase have to be assembled in a low copy plasmid, each one with its own promoter and only one terminator. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:

Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer."
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#testing_-_-_TEXT.html," current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [11, 12, 16].
In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to graze on. Therefore we have analysed the possibility of developing the second worm buster by studying fluorescence in grass samples. Our results were promising since the fluorescence was clearly visible in the grass!
The Global Worming Problem and Society
As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will help solve the physical problem, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved [6]. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Raising Awareness
We have attacked the problem at several angles to raise awareness for our project. We have performed a market analysis of the problem and sent out questionnaires to better judge the severity of the problem. We’ve even been published in a local swedish magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training & sports stables, and riding schools [18]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields [17]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [18, 19].  A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we have worked on the market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions actually will be possible to implement in real life.
Uppsala 2018 is on a mission for the future"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Selection#BindingControl_-_-_TEXT.html," the OR1 fragment but with a different sequence. However, the agarose gel did not reveal any recognizable differences between addition of SH2-cI and no addition of SH2-cI. This result confirmed our conjecture, that there is only an interaction between   cI and the cI binding site.  The binding at the single binding site OR1 of cI is compared with the binding at the double binding site OR1 and OR2(figure 1B). In both cases, a shift by the SH2-cI protein with the DNA is noticeable, but it is not possible to see a stronger shift with the doubled binding site. Therefore, the construct with one 434 binding site is sufficiently for    binding with the cI protein. Moreover, it was demonstrated that one binding site upstream of the promoter is enough for a strong binding and adequate for the bacterial two-hybrid system used.
Figure 1: EMSA results. (A) In alternaty application the DNA fragment with the 434 OR1 binding site and the DNA fragment with the lambda binding site were used as DNA sample. +/- = with/without SH2-cI fusion protein.(B) The DNA fragments containing the single OR1 and the double OR1 and OR2 binding site were applied. The SH2-cI protein was added with an amount of 0, 0.5, 5 and 50 pmol.
In vivo binding
Figure 3: Illustration of the in vivo experiment. The experiment is designed by an GFP generator upstream of the reporter. If no cI is binding at the OR1 binding site, the RNA polymerase, which is bound at the anderson promoter of the GFP can read over the binding site and express the GFP and the RFP gene(A). If cI is binding, the RNA polymerase is stopped by the binding protein and only the GFP can be expressed (B
A new construct was produced as in vivo binding control. A GFP gene under the control of a constitutive Anderson promoter ( BBa_K608010 ) was cloned directly upstream of the reporter construct of the single reporter part BBa_K2082211 and of the reporter and SH2-cI combined part BBa_K2082231 without any terminator. The expectation was given, that the Anderson promoter would be able to increase the transcription rate of the RFP if the RNA polymerase can not be stopped. The polymerase is able to read over the second promoter and leads to an expression of the normally weakly expressed RFP gene.   If the cI protein would bind at the binding site between the GFP gene"
ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Modeling#Photoinduction_-_-_TEXT.html," the product photoconversion cross section times photon flux.
The results show that the UV fractions for all light source-receptor combinations are always less or equal 15.6 % (which is the maximum achieved by Lov). For Cph1 and CcaS, which are activated and deactivated by light, the difference between UV activation and deactivation is very small (approx. 5 %).
We assumed these values would be in the order of magnitude of noise and therefore concluded it would not be possible to measure the amount of UV radiation with a combination of several combined (UV and visible light) receptors.

Collaboration with Peking University
Time: 7.14
Location: School Of Life Sciences, Peking University
As a senior igem team, Peking University has provided many reliable and effective suggestions for                         our projects. After the introduction of the team project, we started brainstorming on the                         project together, the most prominent of which is the proposal for high-throughput application of                         the test method of the project, and the proposal of team cooperation.
Through this interflow, we have enriched our ideas on this project, and we are also moved by the                         enthusiasm of Peking University students. This is our first collaboration, which provides a lot                         of different ideas for our project.
Collaboration with Northeastern University
Time: 27 Aug, 2018
Location: The Meeting Room of Northeastern University Life Science Building
Participant: Four iGEM teams from Northeastern University and Dalian University of Technology
Content:
The meeting began with the introduction of their project by the iGEM-A team of Northeastern                         University. Team A's research project is engineering probiotics, and they expect to study                         methods to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) that                         may be triggered. The next is the Northeastern University iGEM-B team. Team B students turned                         their attention to wine and its excess lactic acid.
After the students of Northeastern University showed up, the students of DLUT-A team brought                         their team's research on gout disease. High levels of uric acid in human blood may cause acute                         gouty arthritis, etc., and existing methods for treating high levels of uric acid have many side                         effects. The students of the DLUT-A team plan to oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxyisouric acid by                         engineering bacteria to express a uric acid oxidase. The compound is decomposed and quickly                         decomposed into allantoin which is easily metabolized, thereby reducing uric acid.
Finally, the DLUT-B team brought a portable introduction to the detection of β2-microglobulin. By                         immobilizing the Nanobody on the slide, a change in the alignment of the liquid crystal causes a                         change in the brightness of the image to detect an excessive excess of β2-micro in the urine. As                         a possible marker of chronic kidney disease, β2-micro is an effective and portable method for                         early detection of chronic"

Project Description: Everglow
With electricity consumption increasing across the globe, the conservation of energy has become a topic of major concern. Our team has devised an innovative solution to reduce electricity usage by attempting to create genetically modified bioluminescent plants. By altering particles on the microscopic level, we hope to create plants that can glow and thus replace electricity in the future. To these ends, our team conducted experiments to transfer the lux operon, a cluster of genes (LuxCDABEG) that control bioluminescence in the bacterial species Aliivibrio fischeri, to plant species like Nicotiana tabacum. We also attempted to insert an extra copy of LuxG to enhance the effects of bioluminescence. The results are promising and point to the possibility of creating a greener alternative to current lighting. Furthermore, we will design a new plasmid that can detect potential stress factors like ethanol and report the signal with stronger bioluminescence.
A Video of Our Project
Our Background
We are SHSID_China, the first iGEM team from Shanghai High School International Division. Our story began in a small classroom on campus when sixteen seniors with a diverse range of skillsets and a common passion for synthetic Biology decided to work together to improve the environment around us. Aware of the environmental ramifications the high amounts of electric consumption used for lighting can have, our team began Project Everglow in hopes to engineer plants that can glow on their own. We hope that by inducing bioluminescence in plants, the need for electric lighting will decrease in the future.

BIOFILM ENGINEERING
What are biofilms?
Biofilms are communities of microbes where the cells are in an aggregate on a surface, bound together by extra-membrane material made of a mixture of specialized carbohydrates and extra-membrane proteins. The special environment in the biofilm allows cells to survive harsher environments.
What is the “biofilm response”?
Bacteria cells can exist in multiple physiological states, which are caused by environmental factors. Common ones include heat shock, nutrient (carbohydrate or amino acid) starvation, metal micronutrient starvation, etc.
Gene expression in each of these physiological states is mediated by the changing the sigma factor involved in transcript synthesis. Each sigma factor has its own consensus sequence; the sigma factor on the RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to promoter regions. When a sigma factor is active, its effect is to shift which fractions of the genome are preferably expressed, because of the different promoter recognition consensus sequences. The sigma factor that is involved in the stationary phase (I.E. no motility, no reproduction) of E. coli strains is the σS factor. It directs the expression of genes necessary to induce biofilm and aggregation behavior are a subset of those genes whose promoters are recognized by the σSfactor.
Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.
