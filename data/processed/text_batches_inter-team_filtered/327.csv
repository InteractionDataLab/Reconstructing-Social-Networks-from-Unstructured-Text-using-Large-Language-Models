Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," I have found that working with viruses, people sometimes make judgements, but many don’t find the idea so scary anymore once explained.  I think the media sometimes oversimplifies things which can cause knee-jerk reactions.  I don’t have any problems at all with creating artificial life, although I would have reservations about work involving virulent pathogens, particularly linked to military establishments.”
Phil, 30, Immunologist
“You have to consider the thinking behind projects and potential abuse of systems.  Self-regulation reduces ethics to relative clauses, rather there needs to be a common framework in place before actions take place.  Such a framework and external regulation should involve everyone and the ethical framework needs to be formed with the welfare of everyone in mind.  I don't agree with work that results in weaponised diseases or genetic reductionism and I think its these kind of projects which have resulted in a negative public perception, that scientists haven't sold their work to the people very well and many find something patently wrong with such research.  This would be a reflection of a lack of a holistic point of view, which needs effort to be put in by all sides.”
Immanuel, 24, Theology Student
“I feel that like every other industry the majority who will doubtless make sound decisions will always be overshadowed by a few irresponsible individuals.  Work will have to be guided by regulation to be for social benefits, not for example military ones.  Just because one can doesn’t mean one should.”
Steve, 31, IT Engineer
“I definitely think that there should be research in this field. There will no doubt have to be some specialized regulation to deal with the unique situations that synthetic biology will create.  My experience with ethics boards for our work suggests that they are not dynamic enough to cover all the different areas of research and should perhaps work with those with specific area expertise in making their judgments.  I understand patents have caused problems in many areas, but on the other hand private investment needs some incentive if it is expect to invest. Also, there will need to large scale, umbrella organisation to control it, consisting of a mix of researcher and others from legal professions and civil society groups, to counter that those in research may become blinded by their goals.  I think that like global warming, this area may be full of people taking polemic, extreme positions, something that will only be made worse by media sensationalism.  I don’t think people are stupid as such, they just don’t get access to real information.  This problem is made worse by experts dismissing peoples concerns out of hand.  It isn’t"

Kennedy Moshebashebi, Pandamentaenga Farms, Botswana
Because our GM bacteria has the potential to help farmers worldwide, we wanted to gain the perspective from someone living in a region of the world affected by drought. We sent a list of written questions via email to Kennedy Moshebashebi, a farmer at Pandamatenga Farms in Botswana. He replied with written responses via email.
What is the biggest problem with agriculture in your area today?
The biggest problem at Pandamatenga is climate change. We are used to having huge amounts of rainfall from mid-November to December but nowadays we can have rains from January to March.
What do you forecast changing in agriculture over the next 20 years?
I forecast climate change where we will have more rain, and less predictable weather, that will alter crop plans.
Are droughts a problem for you?
Drought is a problem in my area to a point where we have to irrigate the fields.
Are salty soils a problem for you?
Salty soils are a problem for our region.
Do you have any ideas for how to fight these problems?
I believe regular soil tests and analysis could curb the effects of salty soils on crop production. Furthermore, new developed cultivars can be of help; we would need to explore drought tolerant cultivars.
If you had a team of scientists to help the agricultural industry, what would you want them to do?
Hold workshops and discuss new means to carry out crop production in the midst of drought as this affects the food production of the nation.
Our team is designing a plant that can grow in salty soils and droughts; do you think this would be a helpful product? Would you buy such a product if it entered the market?
New products that improve our crop production are always welcomed. I would definitely buy that product.
Do you use GMOs in any way (crops, et cetera)?
There are certain GMOs that I use, mostly the developed seeds which usually have high yield and the end of crop season.
Do you think your community would eat GMO crops?
My community would gladly embrace anything that looks good and is high quality?
Do you currently use herbicides, pesticides, or any kind of fertilizer on your crops?
I use a number of pesticides.
What kinds of crops do you grow?
I grow sorghum, maize, cowpeas, potatoes, butternuts, watermelons, and tomatoes.
Do you think that our project is feasible?
Your project is definitely feasible because it comes as an answer to the many questions that farming communities"

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of the libraries of study PRJEB27635, are not known which makes the task of assessing the quality of reads a challenge. In order to ensure that the analysis is complete, Ginga implements both Trimmomatic and BBmap trimming tools.
All samples were analysed using Trimmomatic (v0.38). To remove the adapters the Trimmomatic was run using the single end mode (SE) and IlluminaClip was initially performed using the standard parameters (seedMismatches = 2, palindromeClipThreshold                   = 30 and simpleClipThreshold = 10) and the universal adapters contained in the TruSeq v3 single end adapters which can be found in the table below (Table 1). With the above parameters, no sequences were clipped from the raw initial sequences.                   The method was repeated, in order to optimize the parameters. seedMismatches was maintained at 2 bp since TruSeq v3 adapters are particularly short and enriching the bias towards mismatched sequences can lead to deletion of exonic information                   (Bolger, Lohse and Usadel 2114-2120). The other quality control options of Trimmomatic were not used, since the FastQC report of the library shows good overall base per quality and distribution, however they are recommended.
To ensure that the sequences were not containing no other bias, other typical adapters were used, including NextEra [ID:5-6] and TrueSeq [ID:3-4]. AmpliSeq adapter trimming, typically used for creating large cancer panels was also tested                   [ID:7]. When using adapters 5 and 6, the 265 sequences were successfully clipped, which accounts for below the 0.01% of reads in the library, while the other adapters [ID:3,4,6] where unsuccessful. This is unusually low, and might be                   due to sequences that are similar to the kmer adapters in the exome.

Population of next generation is proportional to that of this generation by the coefficient r.
Population reaches a stable stage regulated by the number of capacity K.
Death caused by naturally existing anisopliae is considered as a part of K.
With IOS system
The addition of our IOS system leads to greater death rate caused by M. anisopliae in our traps and . The additional term is modified from SIR epidemic model:
Male flies within the attraction radius of the methyl eugenol from trap will be attracted to the trap by a certain probability.
After being trapped, male flies will be infected by anisopliae and released later.
Infected males are prone to spread anisopliae conidia to females while mating.
Females are likely to re-mate and thus are likely to spread anisopliae conidia further.
The overall lethality of the infection is described by the formula

As this process might be only partial there is a possiblity for the formation of disulfide dimers. Nevertheless the fractions 14 to 17 were pooled for further experiments as they showed the highest enzymatic activity. The protein concentration of the pooled fraction was determined to be 0.48 mg/ml after SEC.
Characterization of the enzyme
The enzymatic activity of the laccase BioBrick was investigated under different conditions as this was important for our filter model in which we try to simulate the application of the laccase in our remediation raft to clean highly contaminated rivers. The first activity assays were dilution series experiments in which we wanted to determine the appropriate amount of protein which we had to apply in the assays. We found that a 1:100 dilution of the prepared protein (0.49 mg/ml) to be ideal and thus performed all experiments with this concentration.
Kinetic assay (Substrate dependency)
Figure 14: 96-well plate showing dilutin series of substrate (ABTS) for kinetic experiments
For the kinetic assay a 1:1 dilution series of the substrate was set up. The oxidation of the ABTS substrate was then monitored over time observing the absorbance at 405 nm. The experiment was performed in triplicates (see Figure 14) and as a control the dilution series of the substrate was incubated with PBS instead of the diluted protein. It can be seen that there is no autolytic oxidation of the substrate. The resulting kinetic parameters are summarized in table 3.

miniprep of virA in the uc vector, fragment was digested a the gelelectrophoresis showed a good result
new restriction digest for virB was done
TOPO-cloning for rpoA failed again, so due to deadlines we decided that there was to few time left to do the TOPO-cloning again or with new protocols and to do the mutagenesis also.
[ edit ] Tuesday
Because virA was now properly inserted in the pucvector we could now start mutagenesis on restriction sites 187 and 720. We did this with PCR. We used a protocol for site-directed-mutagenesis with the matching primers. PCR was done overnight
new ligation for virB was done
[ edit ] Wednesday
Gel-electrophoresis showed bad result for the mutation of virA probably due to too long elongation time. So we performed this PCR again with a new mutation.
Ligation of virB didn't showed the expected result so we did it again.
[ edit ] Thursday
New PCR showed a better result for virA and geleclectrophoresis showed some result. The motherstrain was cut with DpnI to remove those residues, PCR-purification was performed and a restriction digest with PstI was done to see if restriction sites indeed were mutated
virB ligation in K was again

We checked if the PstI had cut the mutagenated places by gel-electrophoresis but we forgot to add a sample as positive control so the restriction digest was done again. The result we put on gel and saw that there was no cutting in both samples. Restriction disgest with pstI was now done overnight.
virB ligation showed good results so it was electroporated

Distinct visual differences were observed: incremental concentrations of IPTG directly correlated with an increase in chromoprotein expression. Measurements were made on the spectrophotometer and the Chrome-Q for comparison.
Successful Transformations of ATUM chromoproteins (ScroogeOrange and TinselPurple)
Additionally, the 2017 Lambert iGEM team continued attempting a similar construct to the 2016 Lambert iGEM team: pλR LacI tsPurple/tsPurpleDAS/tsPurpleLAA pLac ClpXP CI. DAS (a moderate degradation tag) and LAA (a strong degradation tag) allowed rates of degradation to be compared when measuring the RGB values of the cells on the Chrome-Q. The promoter, pλR LacI, had very low miniprep concentrations, and it was hypothesized that the toxicity to the cells prevented from both transformation and miniprep efficiencies to be proficient for the rest of the assemblies. As a result, the team switched to R0040, a promoter that was transformed from this year’s InterLab study. This was successfully ligated to the three reporters, but the colonies did not turn purple when transformed in the NEB 5-alpha E. coli strain and the Keio strains.
For the reporters alone, sequencing results showed that both tsPurple and tsPurpleLAA had the correct part length, but tsPurpleDAS did not include the degradation tag in its sequencing result. As a result, the team contributed these new composite parts to the iGEM registry.
The final third of the construct - pLac ClpXP CI - was successfully assembled and sent for sequencing, which revealed that CI had been mutated during assembly and therefore not functional. Due to time constraints, the 2017 Lambert iGEM team did not have time to put together the entire construct.
While characterizing non-lysosomal inducible protein degradation, the 2017 Lambert iGEM team developed the Chrome-Q to quantify the degradation of different chromoproteins.

Formal Lab Session - 12th August 2009
The Stochastic Switch team and the Chassis Team discuss ideas with Neil
Overview
Metal Sensor Team - LB + Chloramphenicol plates containing potential Bacillus subtilis transformants yielded colonies - transformations successful!
Stochastic Switch Team - attempted to transform B. subtilis with pGFP-rrnB as practice
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team - attempted to recover cw1D spores using Method A - somewhat successful
Metal Sensor Team
Recap
In the last session the Metal Sensing team attempted to transform B. subtilis with pGFP-rrnB plasmid (an integration vector). We carried out the procedure and plated the 'transformants' onto 4 plates:
LB alone - (MM competence medium MINUS B. subtilis)
LB + Chloramphenicol - (Bacillus subtilis + water (NO DNA))
LB + Chloramphenicol - 50ul of B. subtilis + pGFP-rrnB
LB + Chloramphenicol - 200ul of B. subtilis + pGFP-rrnB
Today, the Metal Sensing team will assess the plates and judge whether the transformations have worked well.
Observations
No colonies grew on the LB alone plate or the LB Chloramphenicol plate with B. subtilis lacking pGFP-rrnB. However there was considerable growth on both of the LB + Chloramphenicol plates which contained pGFP-rrnB B. subtilis transformants - more colonies could be seen in the 200ul portion than on the 50ul portion but"

3D plot of resulting timecourse
Figure 6. Simulated time course of resulting probabilities of the fluorescence according to the generated samples
Using the generated samples we can simulate the time course for all of them and use the 2d kernel density estimation script kde2d.m[ Botev, 2009 ] to plot a distributed time-course of the simulated fluorescence.
Conclusion
Figure 7. Joint 2D density of α and k1. Obtained with kde2d.m.
Figures 3-5 all show a strong positive correlation between k1 and α. When looking at figure 7 we see that the joint density of the two parameters has a clear peak. Thus the two parameters should be identifiable.
Figure 8. Smoothed 2D histogram of the joint distribution of in each case 2 parameters.
For parameters μ1 and k2 figure 4 and 5 clearly show a strong negative correlation of the two parameters. The joint distribution in figure 8 suggests no single localized peak, hence those two parameters are most likely non-identifiable.
As the profile likelihood tells us that we should not expect any structural non-identifiabilities, it must be possible to remove this non-identifiability by inclusion of further priors.
This non-identifiability is also reflected in the huge size of the confidence intervals.

Further, we decided to fuse the target protein, additionally to the specific degradation tag, with PIF which will assume the role of the adaptor protein SspB .
Light detection system
 
 
As told before, the Phytochrome/PIF system has been chosen as light detection system. Many reasons have motivated our choice: it is well-characterized, offers a second timescale control which is an order of magnitude faster than previous chemically induced translocation systems and are very near the physical limits for whole-cell diffusion. It has  also been proven to be robust being cycled over a hundred times by alternating red and infrared illumination with no measurable decrease in recruitment ratios over time [41] .
 
 
Description
Phytochromes are photoreceptive signaling proteins responsible for mediating many light-sensitive processes in plants, including seed germination, seedling de-etiolation and shade avoidance. They detect red and near-infrared light through the photoisomerization of a covalently bound tetrapyrrole chromophore such as phycocyanobilin (PCB) for plant phytochromes. This photoisomerization event is coupled to an allosteric transition in the phytochrome between two conformational states called Pr (red-absorbing) and Pfr (far-red-absorbing).
Upon stimulation with red light (650 nm), the phytochrome B (PhyB) protein binds directly to a downstream transcription factor, the phytochrome interaction factor (PIF). PIF is a nuclear-localized, basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) factor initially isolated as interacting with the non-photoactive, C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis PhyB.
Construction choice
We needed to study the different domains of the phytochrome B in order to try to reduce its size which can be a potential sterical hindrance for ClpX activity.
All plant phytochromes can be divided into an N-terminal photo sensory domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain. The Nterminal photo sensory domain comprises four consecutive subdomains called P1, P2/PAS, P3/GAF, and P4/PHY (named sequentially from the N terminus), the C-terminal domain consists of two subdomains, the PAS-A and PAS-B domains and the histidine kinase–related domain (HKRD) [45] . The PAS domain is named after three proteins in which it occurs: Per ("

Friday 10/7
After finishing our final exam, we talked a lot about our project. We determined our goals and direction of getting there. In the discussion, work assignment had been done. Our team tidied the lab together. Moreover, with the help of our senior fellow-student brothers and sisters, we received lab safety training.
Saturday 11/7
With the help of our senior fellow-student brothers and sisters, we studied the method of culturing cell. And we tried to culture some. Then we waited for the result.
Monday 13/7
We were informed that we failed in culturing cells. We tried to recall the experimental process to find out the reason of failure. We found that maybe the overdue cell-culture medium we used caused the failure. We still wanted to try again, although not without pain.
Wednesday 15/7
We put forward experimental procedure and gave in detail.
Sunday 19/7
Part of our team members took part in a meetup which was set up by Sun Yat-sen University Guangzhou, China. The meetup contained three parts: ice breaker, project presentation, world café. Many teams had been involved such as SKLBC-China, SKLBC-GDSYZX, SYSU-China, SYSU-Software, SCUT-China. In the meetup, they shared their ideas to us and we also introduced our project and showed our presentation to them. Their teacher and members pointed out our shortcoming and gave us some advices. And we also exchanged our views with modeling team to seek a better way to cooperation and development. We reaped a lot benefit from this meetup!
Thursday 23/7
We learned basics, as running a PCR, and we got every reagent we needed in our project. And we set those reagents on appropriate place. We can find everything we needed in the lab.
We set about designing three primers and came across some trouble. PDE5A mRNA has three variants, we felt confused about choosing which variant.

3 things my friends say about me:
committed, helping, and passionate.
Hello everyone I ’am Karthikeyan from Tamil Nadu, India…  Nature and life forms fascinates me and lead me in the field of life sciences. So, I did my graduation in Biotechnology. My work on isolating and characterizing endophytes from Banana pith and pseudo stem for my bachelor’s thesis was in finding naturally accessible means to utilize the enormous quantity of biomass wasted after the fruit harvest.  Synthetic Biology- It’s a platform to apply our knowledge to create something spectacular for better understanding of life and for the betterment of mankind. To me, iGEM as an international platform to experiment with synthetic biology, was not a choice but a chance, to experience an unforgettable journey in Science. Join me along to Boston, for a fun filled learning experience.

Hi! My name is Shantal and I come from Mexico, one of the biggest cities in the world! that’s why I like the versatility, the movement, the noise! But during my free time I love to go to places where I can enjoy nature, calm and quality time with my family and friends... you can say that I like the best of both worlds! and so, I chose my Bachelor looking for exactly the same thing, I have always been good in math but I loved immunology, parasitology and everything related to infectious biology! Therefore I decided to study Biotechnological Engineering and for my thesis I worked with the Biosecurity Manual for a lab that diagnoses epidemiological diseases back home, after all, security comes first. I am currently doing my Master in Microbiology and Biochemistry, part of iGEM Team Göttingen and hoping that all of you decide to follow us on our way to Boston 2014!

Magnetosome - Nanostructure with Great Application Potentials
Figure 1: Magnetosome
Magnetosome is a kind of rare intracellular membrane-bound structure in a specific type of prokaryotes, of nano-size ranging about 35 - 120 nm. They comprise of a magnetic mineral crystal encapsulated by a lipid bilayer about 3 – 4 nm thick (Figure 1) [1], which might be utilized in various applications involving magnetic field.
The magnetosome membrane is highly significant for its biogenesis as it creates an isolated environment within the cell crucial for mineral crystal nucleation and growth [2]. These inorganic crystals are magnetic in nature (hence its name), which compose of either magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4). The magnetosomes usually arrange in one or multiple chains along the cell axis. Different varieties of crystal morphologies such as cubo-octahedral, elongated hexagonal prismatic, and bullet-shaped morphologies were discovered in different magnetotactic bacteria [1].
Magnetotactic Bacteria - The Magnetosome Producer
Figure 2: Micrograph of a Magnetotactic Bacteria, Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense (image from Departamento de Inmunología, Microbiología y Parasitología, University of the Basque Country)
Magnetosomes are organelles synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria for its movement along magnetic field. These magnetotactic bacteria are mobile, aquatic, gram-negative prokaryotes [3] with an array of cellular morphologies, including coccoid, rod-shaped, vibrioid, helical or even multi-cellular. Some of them are more extensively studied, including Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense. They are found optimally grown at the oxic-anoxic interface in aquatic habitats, and in fact grow less happily under atmospheric oxygen concentration.
Magnetosomes form a chain and are aligned along the axis within the bacteria. With these magnetosomes inside them, they are able to align passively to the earth’s magnetic field so as to swim along geomagnetic field lines."
UCL,2016,Team:UCLA#Protein Cages_-_-_TEXT.html," protein cages, we have designed mutants with inserted thrombin cleavage sites with the intention to induce disassembly of the cages by treatment with thrombin protease. Future directions of this project consist of loading anticoagulant drug molecules into our mutant cages and assaying for the release of the drug molecules upon disassembly in the presence of thrombin.

Methodology
The main goal of the project is to develop a mechanism for targeted drug delivery.  By incorporating protease cleavage sites into our protein cages, we control disassembly of the cage simply by providing it with a specific protease. The protease we decided to work with is Thrombin, a crucial member in the blood clotting cascade. Its role in Thrombosis makes it a key target in many of our leading causes of death including, heart attacks and strokes. By incorporating Thrombin cleavage sites into our cage and using Thrombin as our targeting molecule, we hope to directly combat heart attacks and strokes using our drug delivery mechanism.
The design of the project involves three distinct steps.
1. The first step revolves around the design of our mutants derived from the wild type cage. Because of the sensitive nature of these protein cages, there were specific criteria that we had set to maximize mutant formation and guarantee disassembly of our cage once it came into contact with the protease
Design mutations away from any possibly secondary or tertiary structures.-The main reasoning behind this criteria is to avoid disruption of the protein cage. It is difficult to gauge which sequences are crucial in cage formation so by avoiding mutations in secondary or tertiary structures, we hoped to mutate a region that would have a minimal impact in cage formation and thus cage disruption.
Design mutations on the exterior of the cage.-The main reasoning behind this criteria is to allow for easy access by the Thrombin protease. By placing the mutation on the exterior of the cage, we hoped to reduce steric hindrance to the protease and maximize chances of cleavage.
Design mutations near the linker region (ONLY FOR PC Quad)-The main reasoning behind this criteria is to help disassemble the cage. In the original design of the wild type PCquad cage, it is understood that the there is a linker region that serves as the backbone of a subunit thus proving crucial to the cage structure. By mutating a region close to the linker, we hoped to maximize chances of cage disassembly.
Using these criteria, we designed 10 mutant cages for PCquad and 3 mutant cages for O3-33.

Berlin_diagnostX,2017,Team:Berlin diagnostX#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," NGOs such as the Christoffel Blindenmission (CBM) or of other scientific institutes such as HTW Berlin. After a reception, a panel discussion with eminent speakers ensued. We were happy to welcome Dr. Georg Kippels (member of the parliament), Prof. Dr. KH Martin Kollmann (member of the advisory board of DNTDs and scientific advisor to the CBM Kenya), Dr. Joachim Klein (German Ministry for Research and Education), Dr. Maria-Luisa Rodriguez (Global Program Head Nifurtimox, Bayer AG) as well as our team leader Henrik on the podium. In an insightful discussion, we were discussing not only the scientific requirements for tackling the problem of NTDs but even how science might be a driving force in reaching the sustainable development goals.
Organizing an event involving almost 150 people was no small endeavor to our team – so what was the goal we aimed to reach with the symposium?  Early in our project we realized that neglected tropical disease not only warranted our attention, but needed more general awareness. A broader public should know about these diseases to make a joint action against NTDs possible. We are happy to report that we reached our goals in two different ways: On the one hand, the many students in the audience very visibly curious to find out more about these poorly understood diseases and we even gained new team members. On the other hand, our invited speakers were impressed at the many questions and informed statements from the audience and realized that the topic of NTDs is also interesting to non-experts.  Our partners, NGOs as well as scientific groups, expressed interest in organizing a second NTD lab next year – our plans on making this event involve an even larger audience were favorably met, and the planning phase has already started!"
NCTU_Formosa,2013,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html,", we have manage to accomplish our project modeling, assembling our E.colightuner as well as tissue culturing. The most significant event is we've also combined these three dependent systems and created a magnificent tool, called i-Culture, to achieve the goal of synchronizing different plant growth stages for exportation. We can control our E.colightuner by giving input data into the computer programs, regulating it to secrete the corresponding hormones under specific sets of conditions.
For Example, Taiwan is one of the main exporters of orchid. From a business point of view, the orchid need to blossom precisely at the moment the customers receive it, so the flower growers need to control the blossoms manually during transporting. By using our i-Culture device, we can adjust the blossoming time automatically to reduce the laboring cost. In conclusion, our system has a great development potential in business.
Future Works
The multiple regulated-system we have created in this project consists of two different parts : the light induced part and the dark induced part. Each part regulates two different genes, resulting in a total of four genes that can be regulated. We tend to regulate more genes by employing more light sensing promoters. By adding each light sensor, we would be able to regulate two more different genes by employing regulation mechanism of 37 °C RBS and sRNA.
Application
Taiwan is renowned for Phalaenopsis, producing more than 35 million Phalaenopsis each year. There is no doubt that Taiwan has become ""The Kingdom of Phalaenopsis"". The technique we usually use to grow Phalaenopsis is plant tissue culture, thus we intend to apply it to our system.
Tissue culture is the growth of tissues or cells separated from the organism. This is typically facilitated via use of a liquid, semi-solid or solid growth medium, such as broth or agar. Moreover, hormones are added to the growth medium purposed to what plants need during growth period. However, the hormones needed during each growing state are not the same. So, we need to figure out a way to generate multiple hormones. By adding our engineered E.coli to the growth medium, the plants can gain multiple hormones secreted by E. coli under different circumstances. We chose four common hormones as our genes, Auxin, Cytokinin, Gibberellin, and Florigen.
Since Florigen (known as the FT protein) is the protein which isn't produced by E.coli naturally, there aren't any secretion systems in wild type E. coli to transport Florigen out of the cell. Though secretion through cell"

Turn on the French Press and select the pressure for cell disruption (18,000 psi for B. subtilis and E. coli ).
Fill the re-suspended cells in the disruption cell and close it tightly.
Put the closed disruption cell into the machine so that the piston is on the top. Make sure that the handles of the piston are turned in your direction so they cannot come in contact with the mounting while the cell gets compressed.
Press start and follow the instructions on the display of the machine.
Open the valve slowly while you put a 50 ml falcon under it.
Collect the opened cells that flow out of the valve. Watch out that the cell suspension flows out slowly and the pressure remains almost constant until the whole suspension has flown out.
Reload the disruption cell. For Gram-positive bacteria, open up the cells three times. For Gram-negative cells one run should be enough.
Spin down your disrupted cells at 8,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Proceed with the supernatant.
Fill the supernatant into ultracentrifugation tubes and balance tem. Spin down for 1 hour at 4°C and 35,000 rpm. Tubes must be filled with buffer at least with half of the tube-volume.
In the meantime, clean the disruption cell with ethanol (70 %) and distilled water. Then store it in the fridge until next use.
Fill the supernatant into pre-cooled falcon tube.
Purification of Strep-tagged proteins
The Strep-tag II is a short peptide (8 amino acids, WSHPQFEK), which binds with high selectivity to Strep-Tactin®, an engineered streptavidin. The binding affinity of Strep-tag II to Strep-Tactin® (KD = 1 mM) is nearly 100 times higher than to streptavidin. This technology allows one-step purification of almost any recombinant protein under physiological conditions, thus preserving its bioactivity.

In addition, we also introduced our project to other iGEMers so that they could give some suggestions to us about our project. We also enhanced the friendship with each other. The common progress has fully reflected the spirit of iGEMer's synergy.  When we were introducing our project, students from other team asked several questions about our interview with companies. By knowing about the situation of market and social requirements, we can make our project more suitable for the status at present.
3. Manchester United iGEM Idea Exchangement
Our team members visited the iGEM team at the University of Manchester on August 7th and had a friendly communication, which promoted the cooperation and friendship between two universities. When communicating with the iGEM team at the University of Manchester, we found that both teams were modifying special bacterial strains, not E. coli., which raised a better understanding between the two teams. During the communication, we also discussed several issues about the competition, and had a clearer understanding of their project. This communication activity built a bridge of friendship between our two universities, which made us recognize the importance of the spirit of cooperation and learn from each other's strengths to enhance ourselves and climb the peak of science. In addition, the projects of the two teams have some steps in common, so we focused on discussing about how to make these steps better.
4. A Communication with MIT iGEM
In this MIT tour, our team members got a chance to meet with iGEMers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and conducted communication and discussions on the 2018 competition project to provide optimization possibilities for each other. The MIT iGEM team's project this year is to solve the health problems of human tooth decay through the transformation of engineering bacteria. The team members of two schools raised many meaningful questions and suggestions on the content of each other's project, which enabled us to further improve their respective project frameworks. In addition, we have the honor to visit the biological laboratory of their team. Through this visit, we saw the difference in scientific research between ourselves and internationally renowned college students, inspiring us to constantly improve ourselves and improve our comprehensive strength and scientific research quality.

In these proteins we randomise     the CDR-like binding regions in that only amino acids known to contribute to binding are expressed there.     Together we create a library of binding proteins with a relative small size (~109 variants), but restriction     to specific amino acids raises the overall library quality. To read more about our library design go to the library subpage.
Survival of the fittest - bacterial two-hybrid
In the next step, the binding protein library should be screened for proteins with a innate affinity for our target. We want to realise     this by using a bacterial two-hybrid system. Therefore, the binding protein is fused to a RNA polymerase subunit and the target protein     is fused to the DNA-binding phage repressor cI protein. In the complete two-hybrid system the target-cI fusion is located on the cognate     DNA-site. If the binding protein binds to the target protein the RNA polymerase is recruited to the cI binding site. There it finds a     very weak promoter and increases the transcription of the downstream gene. All in all should the interaction between the binding and the     target protein lead to increased gene expression of a reporter gene.
From the two-hybrid system we expect foremost a selection of the binding protein library. But furthermore we expect a correlation     between binding protein – target affinity and the thus activated gene expression of the reporter. By using an antibiotic resistance     protein as a reporter we predict increased levels of the resistance protein inside a cell with a good binding protein. The outcome of     this should be an increase of individual fitness for the bacteria, which should lead to a higher growth rate under strong selective pressure.     The complete two-hybrid system should cumulate in a relationship between binding protein affinity and bacterial growth rate, which should     lead to selection of a few bacteria with strong binding proteins.
Accessing the sequence space - in vivo mutagenesis
After selection of the bulk of our library we will increase the affinity of our evobodies in a process similar to the affinity maturation     of antibodies. As addressed above we will select our evobodies by increasing the selection pressure. At the same time, we will use an in vivo mutagenesis system to further adapt our evobodies. Thereby we can increase the accessed sequence space and may modify useful binding proteins     from our library using the power of evolution.    Technical this leads to us using a low-fidelity polymerase I in an otherwise Pol I temperature-sensitive E. coli strain or the classical     approach of global increased mutation rate by modulatiog"

Microorganisms are usually settled in the non-sterile condition, and participate the bio-processing in consortia. In most of the time, they play the role of iron-oxidizer, sulfur-oxdizer and mixotrophic or heterotrophic acidophiles repectively or together. In the “bottom up” approach to optimize the consortia, the logic of synthetic biology is a worthy try to get the optimum colonies. Fungi is a natural resident in the acid mine drainage and involved in the reduction of ferric iron and sulphur, matching the main role in bioming consortia. Among these fungi is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the best studied species and a very popular model organism for synthetic biology. The goal of our project is to take advantage of synthetic biology approach to synthesize a optimized biomining Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain.

This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

In fact, Sugarfilm system has the potential to apply to any phase-related synthesizing pathway, as long as the intermediate and final products would not have strong interactions with the biofilm structure (either causing damage to biofilm or be damaged by the extracellular materials within biofilm). Second, to better fit the synthesizing procedure, tweaks about the bacterium strain could be done. Better secretion efficiency and preservation of enzyme function are all vital for whole process. Also, with improvement of the basic Rainbofilm model, especially in accelerating biofilm formation, controlling of biofilm thickness and density, and choosing promoters of higher efficiency in each device (anaerobic promoters particularly), Sugarfilm would benefit a lot.
  Improvements listed above may be subtle, yet they all mean a lot to the whole system. Sugarfilm, with its versatility and feasibility, has great vista in application in synthesizing work flow. By every small step towards the perfect, we believe Sugarfilm would outstand in the end, as a truly beneficial and powerful method in industry.

I am Xinzhu Luo, a junior student majoring in Life Science in Nanjing University. Thanks to my predecessors, I had this precious chance to join our iGEM team and helped to finish those experiments. Although I've made mistakes in the experiments, it really made me proud that I finally got the results I wanted. Through this unique experience, I indeed learned a lot about synthetic biology and enhanced my skills in the lab. Most importantly, I became confident about my further study in biology. I am so happy to have this chance to work with these wonderful and intelligent teammates.

Suspend the pellet in 50 μl of TBS and Titer. The titer should be approximately 10^14 pfu/ml. The phage stock can be stored for several weeks at 4°C.
Elisa was first performed in the 96 well plate with the target (fabric) developed by the Assay team. Fill each well completely with blocking buffer. Additionally, one row of uncoated wells per clone to be characterized should also be blocked to test for binding of each selected sequence to BSA-coated plastic. A second, fully uncoated microtiter plate should be blocked for use in serial dilutions of phage (step 13) before addition to the target-coated plate. Dilutions are done in a separate blocked plate to ensure that phage are not absorbed onto the target during the course of performing dilutions, which would result in a sudden “falling-off” of signal as the phage is diluted. Incubate the plates filled with blocking buffer for 1–2 hours at 4°C.
Shake out the blocking buffer and wash each plate 10 times with TBST, slapping the plate face-down onto a clean section of paper towel each time. The percentage of Tween should be the same as the concentration used in the panning wash steps.
In the separate blocked plate, carry out fourfold serial dilutions of the phage in 200 μl of TBS/Tween per well, starting with 10^12 virions in the first well of a row and ending with 2 x 10^5 virions in the 12th well.

The second level would allow us to rent out the reclamation module along with the organisms to cities, farmers, or homeowners. This would allow these stakeholders to benefit from the collected phosphorus by selling it to us or on the open market. We would be selling replacement parts and packaged bacteria to allow refills once the filters become less efficient. This second level would benefit from those who might not want to directly manage their system but view it as an investment where they can profit from the waste phosphors they may generate or have access to. The third level of our business plan would involve the leasing of the whole system, with propagation and encapsulation methods. This would allow groups to have complete control over the process to fit their specific needs. The phosphorus they accumulate could be sold back to our business for wholesale or could be sold on the open market.
Application
Our system collects and concentrates phosphorus out of the environment. Since there are a wide range of possible applications, the flexibility of our system can truly be tested. Below are some possible applications our team and stakeholders have identified, however we expect many more will be identified as our technology proliferates.
Wastewater Treatment Plants: Current wastewater treatment plants are being pressured by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the levels of phosphorus in post-treatment wastewater. A common biological method of phosphorus removal is incubation with phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Their ability to store luxury amounts of phosphorus is what our system attempts to imitate, our system however benefits from a common and well understood chassis and the ability to engineer the organism effectively.
Home Bioreactors: Our system could be implemented on the scale of the home instead of the community. Allowing citizens to take ownership of their resources and environmental impact. A easy to use home based bioreactor would open to doors to modular design, which would allow widespread remediation, taking strain off the wastewater treatment plant.
Tile Drains: The largest use of phosphorus is in fertilizers spread on agricultural fields. When this farmland experiences heavy rainfall, sections of the field can flood and phosphorus can be washed into nearly waterways. A common solution to flooding is an underground tile drain system, that allows water in over-saturated soils to drain into a ditch or waterway. Placing our phosphorus reclamation module (PRM) at the outlet of these pipes or at chokepoints in the ditches and waterways would allow collection of the runoff phosphorus before it was able to spread further into the environment"

4. Evaluation of Our Educational Tool
Through the activities mentioned above, we  found two questions about our project. The first is whether the tool would be  really useful for understanding the economic system. The second is how we can solve  the safety problem (related  to commercialization.)
Our approaches to these problems were questionnaire  to students and interview to a biosafety specialist.
First, we sent out questionnaires to the students of Tokyo  Tech to confirm whether  our project would help the understanding of economic system. The results are here.

Fig. 6-1-4-4.
By looking at the answers in the questionnaire, we were able to have confidence that our project can help people understand economic system better than before. Although we used several scientific details related to synthetic biology, the project was understandable for students without any knowledge of this field. Therefore, we can say that our project, which is making an educational tool for iGEMers is effective and practical for all students majoring science.
From this approach, we were able to see our educational tool’s effect. We can say that this feedback gave many good effects for us.

5. Interview with the Science Magazine Newton
On June 17th, we were interviewed by the graphic science magazine Newton. Newton is one of the most popular science magazines originated in Japan. Despite its scientific focus, easy-to-understand contents and catchy photos are used, so it is read by many people regardless of age and gender.                   In the article, the history and requirements of iGEM were described, along with what our team has done in preparing for the Jamboree. The article is shown below (Figure 6-1-5-1).

Amsterdam,2011,Team:Amsterdam#Biobricks#Basic Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," promoters can be achieved as well, given a finely tuned concentration of arabinose.
RBSes
Similar to our promoter selection criteria, the ideal RBS for our CryoBricks should be active at low temperatures, and available from the registry. We suspect temperature may have quite a drastic impact on how an RBS functions; RBSes form structures in mRNA that mediate ribosome binding, but thermodynamics govern the dynamicity (and stability) of such structures. Literature study revealed only very little information about how temperature affects the activity of RBSes. To fill this gap in the knowledgebase, we planned to characterise some of the RBSes available from the registry, using reporter constructs to measure their strength at low temperatures. Unfortunately, technical difficulties and tight deadlines impaired these plans as they did with the plans to characterise promoter strengths.
Forced to omit characterising the strength of different RBSes at low temperatures, we decided to take our chances with the RBS team Warsaw 2010 defined as their standard against which to compare other RBS strengths ( BBa_B0034 ). Running on the crude assumption low temperatures affect all RBSes in an equivalent manner, we reasoned this RBS - which is relatively strong compared to other RBSes at 'normal' temperatures - should be relatively strong at low temperatures too.
Coding regions
The novelty of the icE. coli project lies in its new submissions to the registry: 5 different coding regions, each encoding a protein reported to enhance cold resistance one way or another. Cold resistance, in this context, is defined as protein mediated mitigation of cold-induced systems failure. Such systems failure can be caused on many different levels, such as a decrease in the fluidity of the membrane; an excessive increase in structural rigidity of proteins, DNA and RNA; a drop in the rate of (bio)chemical reactions; and in extreme cases, mechanical damage caused by ice crystallisation. More often than not, low temperatures cause failure on several levels simultaneously, and mitigation of the effect on one level may be cancelled out by failure of another. In some cases, though, systems failure may be limited or prevented entirely by the expression of specific (combinations of) proteins.
Literature study reveals several proteins have been reported to decrease E. coli 's sensitivity to low temperatures. Team Amsterdam selected 5 of these proteins to create cold resistance BioBricks, or CryoBricks. They are all chaperones, originally found in cryophillic bacteria which thrive in cold environments, like the Arctic. The selected proteins are:

Missouri_Rolla,2018,Team:Missouri Rolla#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," city were to have more varied tree species, a problem EABs or Dutch Elm could not be as devastating again. By leaving ash trees on the market, this would encourage urban foresters to keep this diversity and prevent this same problem from happening again and again. Though multiple methods seemed appropriate, we began investigating Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and, based on talks with Monsanto scientists, this would be especially appropriate if used alongside an RNAi mechanism. Bt is a rod shaped, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium. Bt strains produces crystal proteins, called δ-endotoxins or pore-forming toxins. These crystal proteins often show insecticidal abilities to specific species within the insect orders Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.  After ingestion, Cry proteins are solubilized in the midgut and are processed into active toxins by gut proteases. Activated Cry toxins bind specific receptors on the midgut epithelial cell brush border membrane. While searching for a Cry toxin that may be effective against EABs, we came across Dr. Leah Bauer and her team at US Department of Forestry Service and the University of Michigan. They showed that Adult Emerald Ash Borers could be impacted by a Bt SDS-502, which expresses Cry8Da. After ingestion of a formulation of Bt SDS-502 sprayed on leaves, 89% mortality was seen within 96 hours of feeding. Cry8Da has been currently approved for the treatment of multiple scarab beetles, the Japanese beetle, and multiple wood boring members of the genus Agrilus.
Once we identified Cry8Da, we explored methods to improve the specificity of this toxin for Emerald Ash Borers. From this, we discovered iGEM Wageningen 2016’s project who worked to engineer a Cry3a protein to kill a common honey bee pest - the mite varroa destructor. To prove the protein could potentially combat the pest, the team conducted a fluorophore release assay. This assay was used to determine how well the mutated Cry3a protein could lyse open Brush Border Membrane Vesicles by measuring released fluorescence levels from the vesicles.
Using these ideas, our group hoped to engineer the Cry8Da toxin to increase specificity towards adult Emerald Ash Borers which would be expressed within leaf tissues of Arabadopsis thaliana to target feeding adult EABs. To begin, we had the Cry8Da gene synthesized (UniProtKB - D5H3I7) from IDT after being codon optimized to remove internal restriction sites"

Another way to verify the succesful transfection and protein expression is given by the two tags (A3C5 and Strep-tag II) that are included in the receptor design, which allow detection via Western Blot analysis.
After transfecting mammalian cells with the receptor constructs and selecting them for 2 weeks on hygromycin, we lysed the cells and checked for the presence of Strep- and A3C5-tag via western blot using primary antibodies (or a Fab for A3C5) against the respective tags und secondary alkaline phosphatase coupled antibodies (see methods). As the figure shows, the Strep-tag wasn't detectable via WB - however, the A3C5-tag-WB shows significant singular bands at the size of our proteins in the respective samples. This data corresponds with the flow cytometry results again showing that the BAP receptor is also present in the non-fluorescent cells.

Quantification of mRNA expression levels by RT-q-PCR
The characterization of our transfected mammalian cells showed that the two receptors containing an avidin variant were expressed and translocated to the outer cell membrane. The biotin-presenting receptor containing the biotin-acceptor peptide, though, showed a very low fluorescence signal. Therefore, the success of the stable integration was tested by PCR of the genomic integration, which lead to the conclusion that the construct was transfected and integrated sucessfully, hinting at a problem downstream of the integration. In order to understand where the source of this problem was, we took a closer look at the expression levels of the different receptors by analyzing mRNA levels in comparison to each other and to the housekeeping gene (HKG) GAPDH.
For a better comparibility, we used the same amount of cells for each receptor and not only reviewed cells with stably integrated but also cells with the episomal stable receptor constucts. After extraction of the total mRNA from the cells the quality and integrity was measured by Bioanalyzer. All samples showed a RNA integrity number (RIN) above 9 which means that the total mRNA is pure and does not have any contamination. During the first"

They are almost the same, but ""Attitude survey of biotechnology"" contains a little different question from ""Attitude survey of genetic engineering"". We only changed the word ""genetic engineering"" of the survey for ""biotechnology"" in order to make ""Attitude survey of biotechnology.""
And we attempted to indicate difference of image between ""genetic engineering"" and ""biotechnology"".

iGEM began in January of the year 2003 with a month-long course at MIT during the Independent Activities Period (IAP). Students designed biological systems to make cells blink. The course grew into a summer competition with 5 teams in 2004, 13 teams in 2005 - the first year that the competition spread internationally - 32 teams in 2006, 54 teams in 2007, 84 teams in 2008, 112 teams in 2009, 130 teams in 2010, and 165 teams in 2011. Designs range from a rainbow of pigmented bacteria, to banana and wintergreen smelling bacteria, arsenic biosensors, Bactoblood, buoyant bacteria, etc.
October
The search for a new KU Leuven team has started. Ex-iGEM’mers introduced the iGEM competition showing a movie in auditoria.
November
The ex-iGEM’mers and advisors organised information sessions on the 4th, 5th, 13th and 20th of November at different faculties. Candidates could apply untill the 23rd of November by sending their CV and motivation letter.
December
The interviews took place on the 10th and 11th of December and the ‘lucky 13’ team was formed. The first get-to-know-eachother meeting was organized on the 19th of December.
January
‘Exams, Exams, Exams’. January was a quiet month for iGEM, but we had a lovely team and a crazy summer to look forward too.
February
Unleashing the bundled enthusiasm during our first brainstorm session on the 11th of February generated seventeen primary ideas for an unforgettable project. Eventually, we chose eight topics to further research.
March
Researching and discussing those eight ideas enabled us to select three top notch projects. After working out these and with the hints of the advisors in our heads, the final topic was chosen. On the 31st of March, all our excitement converged into that one idea; Pattern formation.
April
On the 21st of April, we shared our topic with the advisors. We also organised ourselves into 11 subteams ranging from ""Wet lab"" and ""Modelling"" to ""Design, photos and arts"".
May
The ’Opening Event’ took place on the 20th of May. Here we introduced ourselves and our topic to the broad public, advisors and potential sponsors.

Overview
From our research, we found out all the plants tend to concentrate nitrate during their vegetation process. During fermentation process of pickle production, microbes and the nitrate reductase will convert nitrate into nitrite. After ingested by our digestive systems, nitrite will combined with the amine in our bodies, will resulting production of nitrite amine. Medical studies indicated in recent years that nitrosamine is a strong carcinogen. Also, nitrite is the cause of methemoglobinemia, which lead to tissue hypoxia and cause vasodilation and lower blood pressure.     To invest further into the matter, we conducted multiple integrated human practices.

Visit to Zhejiang Zhejiang Environment Contamination Control Center
We came to Zhejiang Environment Contamination Control Center. Here are the best equipments in Zhejiang province. The nitrite concentration is one of the important indication of water contamination; here, we can gain access to expert suggestion and equipment.       The researchers and scholars took the demands our team had, and they were willing to provide us the methods to examine nitrite. Nitrite reacts with 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid in weak acidic media to produce 4-sulfobenzenediazonium, which reacted with N′- ( naphthalenyl) ethane-1 ,2-diamine hydrochloride to produce a red diazene compound , the red compound was detected by spectrophotometer.

The models allowed us to ensure that it will be valid to use our modified system. Our cloning strategy hence focused on taking this brick apart and using its constituent parts in a new arrangement (Fig. 2). To test our system, we used the two compounds potassium chromate, and potassium dichromate. We also used two control substances, chromium(III)chloride and the isostructural potassium sulphate and observed if it had any influence on the level of fluorescence. Chromium(III)chloride was chosen to probe the system's specificity for Cr(VI), and potassium sulphate was chosen in order to test the structural selectivity for Cr(VI). All additives were tested at concentrations between 10nM and 100µM as recommended in the literature. (5) .
Before testing the complete system, we first checked if we can detect both individual parts of it. For this purpose, western blots against both, GFP, and His-6 - ChrB were done (Fig. 5 and 6).
Figure 5. Top: anti-GFP: Single colonies of JM110 + pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp (A) and MC1061 + pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp (B) were prepared for western blotting against GFP. pSB1C3 was included as a negative control, and PmanA-gfp as a positive control.
Figure 6. Top: anti-GFP: Single colonies of anti-6-His - ChrB: JM110 pUniprom-chrB and JM110 pUniprom-chrB (opt) were prepared for western blotting against 6-His - ChrB. pUniprom was included as a negative control, and hydA - 6-His as a positive control.
The newly designed system was investigated firstly by comparing the GFP output for the different concentrations of the respective additive. At the same time the results were compared to the original biobrick. Furthermore, the cell density was measured at the same time (Fig. 7). While in both cases an increase in fluorescence could be observed, this increase coincided in timing with the exponential increase of growth, suggesting that a higher level of fluorescence was observed due to more cells being present in the medium. Further experiments will have to be done in order to disconnect these 2 variables.

A First Introduction - Dr. Ding's One Summer
Do you want to enjoy more sunshine rather than fail and fail again in lab?
Do you want to design a biological system with computers rather than by thinking day and night?
Do you want to have more reasonable plans rather than an uncertain one for your experiments?
Follow Dr. Ding , our ABCD will try to make your dreams come true.
Wait!It would be much more efficient to get some general ideas about our ABCD firstly: Mathematical Model , Design Level , Design Type .
Now, tell ABCD what you want. There are different ways for you to Input your desired dynamics to ABCD.
Are there any restrictions on this biological network that happen to meet your needs? Good news! Dr. Ding will tell you how to complete this in ABCD.
Our ABCD engine starts working. The state of art algorithms we implement in ABCD will make design process automatically and different feasible solutions will be generated.
How can you find real components to construct the system. Thanks to BioBricks . Our database makes it possible to retrieve them while some new standards should be proposed.
Also, if our memory serves right, there are quite a few brilliant software packages specified at BioBrick organizing and related management, for example, Clotho from Berkeley's dry team, 2008. If combined with these softwares, the construction will be even more applicable.
Now, you may feel happy to realize a function such as oscillation , perfect adaptation or bistability following our solutions. But we still hold earnest expectations. Is it possible to complete the fabrication automatically in the future ?

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," how many safety measures must be implemented to make a technology safe. Furthermore, we discussed what happens when the effects of the technology are beyond the producer's reach, specifically when the producer delegates responsibility to the end-user.
Safety and Responsibility: How many safety measures should be implemented?
During development, it is necessary to carry out a risk assessment for the known risks that the technology poses. The result from this analysis will not be black or white, or in other words, it will not classify the technology as either dangerous or safe. It will place the technology inside a spectrum of safety. Therefore, the sort and number of safety measures will depend on the position of the technology in this spectrum. The larger the risk a technology poses, the more safety measures will be taken. It is advisable to take more safety measures than just the necessary ones. However, safety measures will also have a cost, leading to a more expensive technology. This can have serious effects on the success of some technologies, like Mantis, whose purpose is to be affordable to all and reach the maximum number of people possible.
As a result, an evaluation is necessary between the risk the technology poses in the specific circumstances where it will be used (closed device, trained personnel, etc.) and the cost of the possible safety measures. The rule that should be followed in these situations is the ""rule of reasonability"" that states that the producer should act as it would be reasonable to act, considering the circumstances. It would be totally reasonable not to spend thousands of dollars in a safety measure that might never be needed after all.
Transfer of Responsibility: Who has the responsibility if the device is misused?
Another problem related to responsibility is the inevitable transfer of responsibility to the end-user. There is no way for the producer to prevent that the end-user will misuse the technology, whether intentionally or not. For example, misuse might happen in form of inappropriate disposal of the device or unethical use of the device for discriminatory purposes. However, the producer has several options to avoid undesirable consequences from the misuse of the device. For example, the use of a biocontainment mechanism would prevent ecological disasters even in case of inappropriate disposal. In the case of unethical use, the only option for the producer is the explicit description of the proper use of the technology in the instruction sheet or on the label. Furthermore, the producer can have a pro-active role in the implementation of the technology, such as making sure that the personnel receives proper training or developing visual pamphlets to inform the (possibly illiterate) population about the device and its use.
Even taking measures, some responsibility will always be transferred. In the case"

The kit includes five vials of each different DNA concentration: 50 pg/μl, 20 pg/μl, 10 pg/μl, 5 pg/μl, 0.5 pg/μl of purified DNA from BBa_J04450 (RFP construct) in plasmid backbone pSB1C3.
 
The first test transformation (50 μl of competent cells, 20 μl plated) showed very poor results:

SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 Bauhinia Festival on Science and Culture
In South China Agricultural University (SCAU), Bauhinia Festival on Science, Technology and Culture is a grand activity every year. On the festival, tens of thousands of citizens in Guangzhou gather together in SCAU to enjoy the sight of bauhinia and new research progress in our university. This year, we seized this opportunity and showed interesting biology to hundreds of visitors, mostly are the youth and kids. We showed fluorescent protein, microscope and tissue culture technology. These attracted a lot of citizens. In the meantime, we brought some books and brochures about some laws and interesting things about GMO. For example, sweet potato has some DNA parts which originally came from Agrobacterium, which means that transgenic exists in the natural world.
To attract more people to visit our stall, we also made some beautiful postcards about SCAU or iGEM.
Our work finally turned out to be a great success. The most famous newspaper in our city--Guangzhou Daily interviewed our team leader and reported us with a brief introduction of our project and activity. SCAU newspaper and SCAU official WeChat also reported us.
We even invited visitors to taste our genetically modified papayas. All papayas selling in markets are GMO, and they've been commercialized for many years. Through this activity, we want to convey a message that GM crops are not devils, if we utilize transgenic technology in a reasonable way, they can be soft and sweet like papaya!
5.3 Laboratory open day
As many of freshmen in our college are eager to learn more about labs and biological research, we, our lab, took the charge of laboratory open day for freshmen. We led our freshmen to visit our lab, letted them knew functions of different equipments and showed our team video and posters. For many students, it's their first time to visit an advanced biological lab, so many of them were strongly impressed by our well managed lab.
Several months later, a group of high school students from many famous middle schools in Guangzhou came to visit our university. Our college decided to open our lab for visiting, and we took charge of this open day again. We tried our best to make this open day a success activity, for the reason that many of those young high school students might be impressed by this experience and make their decision to work in science and engineering in the future.

ADD Cholera Detection project overview
The mission of Brigham Young University--founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.
All instruction, programs, and services at BYU, including a wide variety of extracurricular experiences, should make their own contribution toward the balanced development of the total person. Such a broadly prepared individual will not only be capable of meeting personal challenge and change but will also bring strength to others in the tasks of home and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind.
.....
In meeting these objectives BYU's faculty, staff, students, and administrators should be anxious to make their service and scholarship available to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in furthering its work worldwide. In an era of limited enrollments, BYU can continue to expand its influence both by encouraging programs that are central to the Church's purposes and by making its resources available to the Church when called upon to do so.
We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission can have a strong effect on the course of higher education and will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University's influence in a world we wish to improve.

Goal: To  prepare NaCS.
Result:  After adding alcohol, some white floccule appeared on the top of the solution,  and it gradually separated to  several  layers. The upper layer was retiary floccule, the second layer was transparent  liquid, and the third layer appeared to be cloud form floccule (It might be  production whose chains were shorter than normal length).  Centrifuged and collected the upper retiary  floccule, 65°C  drying.

We  decided the uniform design in the weekly full meeting and discussed the wiki  design proposals.
Team  meeting:
Sophia  presented the experimental progress. Have finished all the parts and some  ligation between parts. Fluorescence test would be determined by SpectraMax M5  Multi-Mode Microplate Readers(Molecular Devices). She reiterated that group  leaders should send her daily report in time.
Shuqin  introduced their work on cell immobilization last week. Two method, calcium  alginate and NACS PDNDAAC microcapsule, were performed at the same time. They  will finish CAD drawing of equipment next week. Yunxin presented the journal  her wrote about their group. She also referred paper research on unstable GFP.  Wu thought more research were needed, especially on those iGEM teams who had  experience on unstable GFP. It takes about one week to prepare the NACS. Wu  pointed out that we should succeed in cell immobilization first, then to  consider improvement methods. Some preparation tests will help the next stage"

On IGEM
Synthetic biology is a new challenge in biosciences. It combines biology and engineering principles to design and build new biological functions and systems. Examples are abound: cancer cell invading bacteria, microbes that take pictures, antimalarial drug producers,... The advantage of using living systems for these purposes is that, once they are designed and built, they are self-reproducible. The challenge, however lies exactly within the design and construction: making biological circuits and devices as robust and predictive as their electrical counterparts. ...

The international Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) or iGEM competition is a synthetic biology competition for multidisciplinary teams of undergraduate students. It was first organized in 2004 by Drew Endy, Randy Rettberg and Tom Knight of MIT with two goals in mind: to yield new ideas in synthetic biology and to form the future researchers in this new scientific community. Whereas 5 US teams competed in 2004, the 2007 edition already had 750 students and advisors grouped in 54 teams from 19 countries. This year, the competition already counts 83 teams!
The core of the iGEM competition is to design and build a “new genetic machine” with BioBricks . BioBricks are standardized, off the shelf biological parts that are used by genetic network designers. All BioBricks that were made during previous iGEM competitions are registered and documented in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Each iGEM competition thus starts from the efforts of the previous years.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer."

Part 1 Sense Fatty Acids: We investigated four different sensing mechanisms using: 1) fatty acid metabolism regulator protein (FadR), 2) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) 3) liver- fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) and 4) binding immunoglobulin protein, HSP5 or glucose regulated protein (GRP78). The four sensing mechanisms were measured and compared.
Part 2 Introduce Glyoxylate Shunt: We introduced two key enzymes of glyoxylate cycle: isocitrate lyase (ACEA) and malate synthase (ACEB), which allow plants and bacteria to use fatty acids as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Here, the amount of fatty acids was measured to compare fatty acids uptake rates of cells expressing glyoxylate shunt.
Integration of Parts: The integration of sensing mechanism and glyoxylate shunt allows inducible glyoxylate shunt, in which the high levels of free fatty acids in the medium increase fatty acid uptake rate of glyoxylate shunt.
Although the problem of malnutrition may remain unsolved, the inducible glyoxylate shunt introduced to mammalian cell increases consumption of fatty acids, lowering the risk of excessive fat accumulation that presents risk to health.

Given that, he would like to develop his understanding around the potentials of the subject and how it can change the game for production and resource extraction. He believes that most of the world’s problems can be solved using synthetic biology and that humanity just needs to apply the existing tools.
     He is highly interested in science communication and would like to see the Toronto community become more scientifically literate about synthetic biology. He has worked on a previous 2015 cyanobacteria grant application, which has also formed the basis for the current iGem project. In his own personal time, Nathan loves to watch and play hockey while also thinking of ways to make biological wings for humans as his next cool science development.

Alkemicari su stoljecima vjerovali u postojanje Kamena mudraca, magične supstance koja je mogla ne samo pretvoriti proste metale u dragocjene, poput srebra i zlata, već i ispuniti čovjekove najveće želje: pomlađivanje i besmrtnost. Iako Kamen mudraca nije nikada pronađen, potraga za njim je nagnala alkemičare na testiranje brojnih supstanci i njihovih interakcija, izgradivši temeljno znanje koje danas primjenjujemo u kemiji, metalurgiji i farmakologiji.
Znanjem pokretan život u 21. om stoljeću je izblijedio naše vjerovanje u postojanje Kamena mudraca. Danas smo, ipak, kao i uvijek, u potrazi za rješenjima koja omogućuju ne samo dug i zdrav život, nego i izlaz iz ekonomskih problema koje smo sami stvorili procesom modernizacije. Suprotno prošlim vjerovanjima, danas vjerujemo da ne ismo trebali tražiti magične supstance skrivene negdje u Prirodi, nego biti njome inspirirani i stvoriti nove alate za aktivno rješavanje izazova u našem društvu.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," for HGT if lysis is successful. We added an OmpA signal peptide to Lysozyme C which   targets it to the periplasm, this was to ensure that the enzyme would be translocated to the cell wall where it would be  most effective. Our model predicted the complete degradation of the cell wall to be within the first generation of E. coli (details of the model can be found here ). This gave us confidence that lysozyme would be effective.
Method
To show the activity of lysozyme, a molecular probes EnzCheck lysozyme assay kit (Thermo fisher  scientific) was used. The coding sequence (CDS) contains an OmpA signal peptide targeting it to the perisplasm therfore lysozyme will  only be detectable if the cells have lysed. The kit uses a substrate containing Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell walls labelled with fluorescein to such as degree that fluorescence is quenched. The presence of lysozyme   causes a sharp increase in fluorescence by easing the quenching. The increase in fluorescence is proportional  to lysozyme activity in the sample. The fluorescence assay was used to measure the activity of the freshly   transformed kill switch and that of the cultures grown in the ministat. CFUs were also used as a measure of  efficiency by comparing the number of colonies to a control. 5 ml ovenights of E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed   with pSB1C3 lysozyme were used to inoculate 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of LB laced with 35 µg/ml   chloramphenicol. Once an OD of 0.23 was reached IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.2 nM. Protein production  was allowed to proceed for 2 hrs. The sample was serially diluted (10-2,10-3,10-4).  200 µl of each dilution factor was spread plated and incubated at 37 °C overnight. CFUs were then compared to a control  treated in the same way.
The potential for horizontal gene tranfser was tested using the lysozyme (Gallus gallus)  provided in the EnzCheck lysosyme assay kit. Cells were lysed, the enzyme inactivated  and then transformation of the resulting lysate performed. For a detailed protocol see HGT protocol

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#SinceAmsterdam_-_-_TEXT.html," for the fusion protein between FNR, BisdA and BisdB
The cultivations and BPA degradation of E. coli KRX carrying a fusion protein consisting of ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase, ferredoxinbisd and cytochrome P450bisd differ from the cultivations with the other BPA degrading BioBricks. Thus, the model for these cultivations has to be adjusted to this behaviour. First of all, no diauxic growth is observed so the growth can be modeled more easily like
(6)
The BPA degradation starts when the imaginary substrate is depleted, like observed in the other cultivations with BPA degrading BioBricks. But it seems that the BPA degradation is getting slower with longer cultivation time. So it is modeled with a Monod-like term in which the specific BPA degradation rate is dependent on the BPA concentration:
(7)
with the maximal specific BPA degradation rate qD,max and the constant KD.
Figures 6-10 show a comparison between modeled and measured data for cultivations with BPA degrading fusion protein E. coli. In Table 1 the parameters for the model are given, obtained by curve fitting the model to the data.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data"

1. Introduction/Background
Methods to capture insects in the nature
Fig.1
In the nature, organisms capture and eat insects by various ways. For example, spiders make cobwebs to capture insects. Nepenthes has pitchers which lure and trap insects. Pyrearinus termitilluminans, which makes and lives in a tunnel around the external surface of the anthill of termite Cornitermes cumulansand, emits light in the first week of the rainy season to lure and hunt the termites.
What is the feasible method to capture insects for Carnivorous E. coli?
Fig.2 : Drowning drosophilas
However, the feasible methods to capture insects for Carnivorous E. coli are limited. Because Escherichia coli moves very slowly and can only exist in the form of colonies on an agar plate or in liquid culture medium, it cannot exist in the form of complicated shapes. Considering these features of E.coli, one way for Carnivorous E. coli to capture insects is to lure the insects to itself, and bind them on the colonies or drown them in the liquid medium.
We noticed that drosophilas sometimes drown in electrophoresis tanks. Hence we are convinced that a liquid medium is a feasible and simple way to capture insects. If E"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-HP G_-_-_TEXT.html,"illin antibiotics, common first and second choice antibiotics that are empirically used by the farmer to treat mastitis, can not be used is blaZ is detected. Rapid detection of this gene could prevent the misuse of penicillins by the farmer and gives reason to directly prescribe other treatments. From the policy perspective, the presence of blaZ has a lot of impact.
The mecA gene is also relevant to detect as this gene makes the pathogen resistant against all β-lactam antibiotics, leading to the well-known disease MRSA. The experts revealed insights for the key of success. Furthermore, they told us that farmers are able to work with tubes and pipettes. Farmers are willing to invest and follow a more challenging protocol if time for a good results.
Reflection with workshop
Insights
Aspects that are still missing, like validation
To do’s to achieve a responsible and relevant synthetic biology design
Changes
Achieve relevance by validating the design at the farm
Achieve responsibility by analyzing the risks when there is false positive or false negative
Reflection of the workshop
Lists of responsible and relevant things in our project
Things that were considered as really responsible are listed below:
Reliability (this is not yet know)
GMO-free and safe
Sensitive detection
Contained
The broad range of applications of TDPs
Things that were considered as relevant are listed below:
Modules can be used separately and can be used for different purposes and broad applications: sustainable storability of TDPs
Tackling a real societal/local threat (ABR)
Costs (are unclear)
User Friendliness
Biobrick can be used for broad application and we contribute to an integrated synbio engineering system
Reflection. What is beyond the scope of iGEM and what is things we still can include?
Tackling a real problem
Beyond the scope of the project:
The need is to identify which AB is relevant to use when facing a disease. Our tool gives insights in which ABs not to use. Although we think that our strategy will help to reduce the abuse of antibiotics, the question in the market is slidely different. Prototype tests should give insights whether are device is relevant enough to tackle current challenges.
Point out which AB to use
Sensitivity and reliability
Things we can do:
What happens if there is a false positive or a false negative?
Estimate the change to have a false positive or negative
Make risks analysis: Contact TNO to talk about risks analysis
Beyond the scope of our project:
Being able to quantify detection
Make Cas13a able to detect mutated genes
