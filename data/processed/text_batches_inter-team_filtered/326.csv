Ligation was completed.
Preparation of Competent E. coli Cells
A sample of E. coli DH5ɑ stored at -80℃ was defrosted and inoculated in 5mL of LB in a 125mL conical flask (volume of LB 10% of flask volume so as to achieve sufficient aeration). The culture was left to grow overnight at 37℃.
Re-PCR of DNA Sequences
Two sets of sequences A,B,F,G, I, J, K, and M were PCRed using the same protocol as 22/06, with one set using a 55℃ annealing temperature and another using 50℃ annealing temperature.
Day 3
Re-PCR of DNA Sequences
PCR Results
The amplified sequences A, B, F, G, I, K, J, and M were loaded with blue dye and run on agarose gel as per standard protocol
Sequences G and J showed bands corresponding to the expected sizes at both 50℃ and 55℃ annealing temperatures.
The bands were excised and extracted according to standard protocol (E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction).
Plasmid recovery
The concentration of pSB1C3 plasmid recovered on 23/06 according to the NanoDrop was low (1.6ng/µl). To obtain more plasmids, we restriction digested a construct made by last year’s, pSB1C3 + abijk, to recover the pSB-1C3 content from the construct.
Set up the following reaction mixture:

During the incubation set up 1% agarose gel by putting 1g powder agarose in 100ml; 1% gel is more efficient at separating larger fragments
Results
Incubate the mix above for 2hrs at 37℃
Incubate for 30mins at 95℃ to inactivate restriction enzymes (Inactivation temperature of SpeI is 80℃, and EcoR1-HF is 65℃)
Cool and spin (there will be condensation at the top of the eppendorf)

Technion_Israel,2015,Team:Technion Israel#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," in the figure, the derivatives were the high for the reactions in which the NADPH/NADP ratio was high, and vice versa.
In order to better understand the process and the results, a simulation of the reaction rate of NADPH as a function of both initial NADPH and initial NADP was built. In each run we changed the ratio between K1 and K2. The result is in the following video:
Your browser does not support the video tag.
from this video we can see that for K1>K2, the system is more sensitive to an increase in NADP (which inhibit the reaction) than to an increase in NADPH.
This can explain the results we got in the lab because the more we increased the initial concentration of NADPH, the more NADPH was converted to NADP and so the inhibition effect was more significant.

Lastly, they sent us the yddg- strain from David's old lab at U of A, which could be used in complementation studies. Kerner et al. (2012) used the yddg part because it increases the rate of export of tyrosine by 3 times, and increases overall tyrosine production. We have created a constitutively expressed yddg part that we would ultimately like use to check for complementation (yddg also confers resistance to inhibiting concentrations of aromatic amino acids), but we have not made competent cells from this strain.

Finally, the protein was expressed successfully.
We added 5μl of the bacterial restored into the LB containing 5μl of ampicillin to the final concentration of 1mM. And then, we incubated them in the shaker at the temperature of 37 centigrade, working for 14-16 hours.
Experimental conditions as follow：
1. Incubate at 37 centigrade, until OD ranges from 0.6-0.8(4-5h).
2. Incubate at 4 centigrade, 220rpm, for 30mins.
3. Add 1mL IPTG to the final concentration of 1mM.
4. Incubate at 16 centigrade for 12-16h.
The purification of protein:
We used eppendorf to make bacterial deposited, working at 4000rpm for 20min. Use 15mL MCAC0 to suspend bacterial.
After resuspending, we used high pressure to break the cells.
In order to get the recombinant protein with the higher purity, the recombinant protein was purified through Ni-chelating affinity chromatography.
The results are as follow:

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#substrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the analytes, we quantified our substrates by UV-light. Nevertheless, mass spectrometry enables identification of possible degradation products. We analyzed estradiol degradation in detail (Fig. 15), resulting in the detection of possible chemical compounds generated during the (enzymatic) degradation.
Further analysis (after Regionals Amsterdam)
Since we have seen some possible degradation products, we used more estradiol, ethinyl estradiol (250µg L -1 compare to 50µg L -1 ) and more laccase (0,35U compare to 0,1U) for the reaction to the LC-MS measurement. We found out that after the laccase treatment two new peaks appeared in both the estradiol and ethinyl estradiol. A check against databases could not identify those components so we did an MS-MS on component A respectivly on component C. Since component B is fewer in concentration then component A, we could not find out anything about it (Fig. 16 and Fig. 17). To note the chemical formulares are M+H values. For the real chemical formula you have to deduct this H.
Figure 16: Mass spectromerty measurement of estradiol. On the X-axis you can see the Time in minutes and on the Y-axis the relative intensity. You can see two new peaks component A and B after laccase treatment. Component A was taken for MS-MS
Figure 17: Mass spectromerty measurement of ethinyl estradiol. On the X-axis you can see the time in minutes and on the Y-axis the relative intensity. You can see two new peaks component C and D after laccase treatment. Component C was taken for MS-MS
The tandem mass spectrometry results showed two peaks in every measurement for possible degradation products. Compared to the native estradiol the component A peak embodies a molecule with two hydrogen atoms less than the native, the same does component C for ethinly estradiol. These peaks were discussed in a short chat with Prof. Dr. Dietmar Kuck, an organic chemist with a lot experience in mass spectrometry.  This conversation led to two plausible models for the degradation. The first was a reaction at the hydroxy group of the five-ring of the estradiol (Fig. 18), oxidizing it to a ketone (resulting in estrone as the degradation product). This idea seemed improbable, because ethinyl estradiol cannot be oxidized at that position, but  its degradation product also"

Using Benchling, virtual digestions of the two sensitivity tuners and ligations to the part K2205010, the connector 1 receiver module, were carried out. These two new constructs were then virtual digested and ligated to the part K2205011, the connector 2 reporter module, resulting in the two plasmid maps detailed below; parts K2205024 and K2205025.

Implementation
The sensitivity tuners parts BBa_K274371 and BBa_K274381 were requested from the iGEM parts registry. Upon arrival, parts were transformed in DH5α E. coli cells . Colonies were picked and cultures were prepared for miniprepping . Minipreps were digested with XbaI and PstI for BioBrick assembly. The part K2205010 contained in pSB1C3, was digested using SpeI and PstI to allow for the insertion of the processing variants directly after the Las controlled promoter (pLas) that would trigger transcription of sensitivity tuners in the presence of connector 1 of the Sensynova platform. Ligations were set up overnight using NEB’s T4 ligase and transformed in DH5α E. coli cells . Colony PCR was performed to check ligations. Colonies picked for this protocol were streaked onto a LB"

BioSensor team member Mike introduces the Fluorophore-Quencher subproject
Introduction
The Fluorophore-Quencher (FQ) system operates on the basic biosensing platform: use an aptamer as a sensing domain and something else as an expression platform to signal that the aptamer had bound its target. In the case of the fluorophore-quencher, we synthesized a fluorescent molecule (fluorophore) directly onto the 5’ end of the aptamer, and a biotinylated the 3’ end. Unlike IRES, the FQ system is based on DNA, which is as versatile for folding for binding, and it is a much more stable biomolecule, allowing it withstand the harsher conditions of UV radiation in space. From there, we ordered an oligonucleotide that was complementary to the 5’ end of the aptamer and had a quencher synthesized onto the end of it. When both strands were allowed to incubate in a Streptavidin-coated plate, the result was the complex on the far left of Figure 1, both oligonucleotidess have bound together to form a quenched sensor complex that is attached to the Streptavidin-coated surface. When target ligand is introduced, the aptamer undergoes conformational change as it folds around the ligand. This conformational change sterically displaces the quencher oligonucletoide and exposes the fluorophore, thus emitting detectable signal.

Fudan,2014,Team:Fudan#pro_-_-_TEXT.html," is a very good example in RNA device construction because it provided a editable framework where we can make powerful parts through combining many different elements. Discovery of TALE DNA binding protein in 2009 provided us a very powerful tool to recognize arbitrary DNA sequence and boosted many fields of research, including synthetic biology. Early this year, R.Jerala et.al.[5]
reported a TALE-based system enable users to design almost any logic gate he want. By using TALE to block target promoter, we can build the NAND gate first, and then all other types of logic gates can be constructed by combining multiple NAND gates in correct order. The high orthogonality and editability of this system is really noteworthy, especially in the context of mammalian cell.
 
There are still many excellent works about circuit design, the examples we introduce there are only parts of them. Reviewing all these successful circuit construction, they all have very good orthogonality, scaleability and editability. If our team want to make a good design, then these features should be taken into consideration carefully.

movement for evidence-based politics and free research
On April 14th, we went to Cologne to attend the ""March for Science"".             With self-made signs and banners our goal was to draw attention to the importance of science in our society.
Fake-news, alternative-facts and populism raise fear and antipathy against research. To deal with those problems,             speeches on science were given. Speakers included science-journalist Ranga Yogeshwar and criminal-biologist Mark Benecke among others.
After this inspiring event, we used the possibility to get to know the iGEM-teams from Duesseldorf and Bielefeld and exchanged             ideas and visions about our projects.

Finding the Idea
Finding the idea
The first steps towards a certain project idea
In February 2018 we started brainstorming to find a project that could potentially transform people’s lives.
Ranging from a car fueled by hydrogen produced by cyanobacteria,             over the decrease of the detection-time of slowly growing pathogenic bacteria we had plenty of ideas.             We saw the greatest potential in the simplification of the diagnosis of a melatonin underproduction since the current measurement takes up to six weeks.
One of our team members, Biel Badia Roigé, had already experienced this issue.             The stunning findings in the past decades revealed a strong correlation with numerous diseases,             so our biosensor could speed up the diagnosis of multiple diseases. The idea of a faster,             cheaper and more versatile method of melatonin-measurement also resonated with our PI’s Dr. Wiechert, Dr. Schwaneberg and Dr. Bank.             Our first milestone was achieved.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," do you feel about the impact of synthetic biology on the world?”.
Figure 2: Frequency count of people describing how they feel about the impact of synthetic biology from highly positive to highly negative
Our data was skewed right, and we were overjoyed to see that a lot of people viewed synthetic biology as a positive influence on the world. Although it appears that more people in Stony Brook viewed synthetic biology positively, we found that there was not a significant difference (p = 0.41) in how people felt about synthetic biology in Stony Brook versus in Ithaca.
Perceptions change over time, so we asked the same question, slightly reworded. We replaced “on the world” with “for future science”, and asked: “How do you feel about the use of synthetic biology/genetic engineering for future science?” The response was not as positive as before:
Figure 3: Frequency count of how people feel about the use of synthetic biology in the future
Although many people felt that synthetic biology was a positive influence on the world, they also felt as if synthetic biology should be more restricted to certain areas of science compared to others. There was no difference in this view between Stony Brook and Ithaca (p = 0.21).
The results we gathered from our participants show us that we need to facilitate more conversation about synthetic biology in our community. We believe that the applications and possibilities of synthetic biology are endless. We hope that one day, others can also share this view.
Synthetic Biology vs. GMO
We started the survey primarily to analyze the impact of geography on the perception of synthetic biology. However, our analysis quickly expanded beyond that. Compared to synthetic biology, the term “genetically modified organism”, or GMO, has a much more negative connotation. GMOs are widely accepted by the general public to be unsafe and unhealthy. We wanted to analyze two things: understanding and perception. We hypothesized that people would answer the same question differently if we used synthetic biology instead of GMO.
Figure 4: Comparison of people’s answers to the questions “how would you rate your understanding of synthetic biology?” vs. “how would you rate your understanding of GMOs?”. On a scale of 1 to 4, 1 means “I know what it is and I can explain it”, and 4 means “I have never heard of it.” Sizes of the points correspond to the number of people and the line y=x shows where both questions have the same answer
The line y=x corresponds to people who provided the same answer to both questions. People who understand more about synthetic"

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Background facts and information
The field of synthetic biology combines different disciplines like molecular biology, engineering, mathematics and physics to improve the knowledge of existing biological systems or to design and manipulate genes, pathways and entire genomes of organisms, for them to fulfill a certain purpose [1] . Synthetic Biology is applied in various fields and disciplines. For biomedical applications it can be used to design bacteria that specifically attack cancer cells or to create bacteriophages that are able to infect and eliminate multiresistant bacteria, that cannot be any longer be treated by antibiotics [2] . Another application is the storage of information in microbial genomes, such as images [3]. Next to these applications, bacteria and other microorganisms are widely used as biological factories of chemical substances of interest. At this point many efforts have been made to enhance the yield of the synthesized products. One approach deals with the principle of metabolic channeling. By spatial organization of enzymes belonging to a certain metabolic pathway the yield of this pathway may be increased. This was for example investigated for the indole-3-acetic acid pathway using a transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-based scaffold system in E.coli [4].
To investigate whether applying metabolic channeling enhances the yield of the indole-3-acetic acid pathway we devised two different approaches next to the one of Zhu et al.[3] The first one utilizes the DNA-binding property of the dCas9-protein to put the enzymes next to each other on a DNA-scaffold. This will be done in E.coli, whereas our second approach will be implemented in S.cerevisiae . This second approach deals with liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). In this process membraneless organelles are formed, induced by"

XJTLU-CHINA,2018,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#RNA Packaging_-_-_TEXT.html," cognate bacteriophage coat protein MS2 (Hung and Leonard, 2016).                     In addition, MS2 is conjugated to the C-terminus of the transmembrane protein CD63, which can allow the fusion protein to localize inside exosomes.
Aim of the design
MS2 is anchored to the interior of the exosome membrane by means of CD63.                     Then the therapeutic mRNA with the 3X MS2 loops gains the capacity to bind to MS2 coat protein,                     and in this sense the mRNA is loaded into the engineered exosomes during biogenesis process.
Test of the construct
We constructed three plasmids pcDNA3.1-CD63-MS2,                     pcDNA3.1-nanoluc-3X MS2 loop (nanoluc encoding nanoluciferase) and pcDNA3.1-nanoluc to test the efficiency of this design.
The pcDNA3.1-MS2 plasmid and pcDNA3.1-nanoluc plasmid were co-transfected into HEK293T cells as a negative control.                     The pcDNA3.1-MS2 plasmid and pcDNA3.1-nanoluc-3X MS2 loops plasmid were co-transfected into HEK293T cells as the test group.
The exosomes in these two groups were isolated by ultracentrifugation of the medium of the transfected cells and the quantity of packaged mRNA was assessed by qRT-PCR.

Since cardiovascular disease is strongly associated with atherosclerotic plaque, three teams chose this disease to design their projects. Their solutions are expressing some key enzymes to degrade atherosclerotic plaque, the same with some treatments. Apart from atherosclerosis, hypertension is also the leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. One Asian designed their project as the treatment of hypertension. In consideration of versatility of cardiovascular disease, one team paid attention to prevention of cardiovascular disease, its scope becomes larger. The same with our project: the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia, it can solve a few kinds of cardiovascular disease. They used genetically-engineered bacteria or reform cell. However, we use adenovirus to transfer into HEK293 cell lines. The project about treatment much than prevention, may caused by the serious status of cardiovascular disease. There is no question that all of them try to solve the problems than haven’t been settled by the medical profession. It is really challenging and significant.
Meanwhile, as the Reports of cardiovascular diseases in China in 2014 show:
a. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease
The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in China is on the rising stage. Currently, an estimated 290 million cardiovascular disease patients across the country, including 270 million hypertension patients, stroke patients at least 7 million, 2.5 million patients with myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure patients with 4.5"

We measured the absorbance spectrum and we could see that the maximum of absorbance was at 315nm.
To found the link between quercetin concentration and absorbance, we did a calibration.
The R² is good, that confirm that the calibration is working. We have a relation between absorbance and concentration : A = 56,767*C, that mean that C=1/(56,767)*A
Finally C = 0,176*A
Week 22th-28th August
Result of the previous assay
There was growth on M9 glucose and M9 quercetin glucose for plates with dilutions of 20^(-2) and 10^(-3). However, the variability was much less important. No quercetin degradation organisms were found. This might be due to the osmotic choc caused by the dilution of the samples in distilled water. We will remember not to repeat this mistake.
Third assay
We did a third assay with a soil sample from Croatia. The conditions were the same than for the two first assays (with PBS and not distilled water !).
Fungal isolation
There was still growth on M9Q plates, we could still see the circles of quercetin degradation. It was confirmed that the strains have been isolated.
Week 29th August-4th September
Fourth assay
We chose to make a simple selection process:
For that, we put some soil sample at 10^-3 of dilution in a single carbon source liquid media. The only carbon source is Quercetin at 1g/L.
We waited for 4 days with the falcon tubes in the shaking incubator at 30°C. In an other hand, we made an other experiment with two carbon sources: Quercetin and Glucose both at concentration of 1g/L.
The idea was to give a chance to some strains that are not maybe able to use Quercetin as a carbon source, but able to destroy this coumpound with some other pathways
By providing them glucose, we could maybe maintain them alive and in the meantime theses strains would be able to degrade Quercetin.
We also had a negative and a positive control.
The negative control was M9 Quercetin without any microbes.
The positive control was Pseudomonas putida.
We made also some conditions with M9 + Glucose with the positive control, the negative control, and the two different soil samples we assayed.
This was done to have an idea of the consumption of glucose by"

With regards to incentive for long-lasting impact, I would emphasize on quality over quantity. Each BioBrick should have the capacity to be useful to others, and standards for the Registry should change to reflect the current scientific landscape. Incentivizing advancement of the field over flashy ideas with potential will not only help teams focus on important foundational changes and progress, but also allow individuals to see what it takes to make real headway. Encourage collaboration more and make it easier for teams to do so, since we can all benefit from each other's help and teamwork is an essential skill that can be developed.

iGEM 2014
It has been a fun ten years for Waterloo, and a difficult but rewarding three years for myself. I have learned a significant amount and will look back fondly on the countless hours spent working on various projects. And while I have issues with certain aspects of iGEM itself, I have hope that progress will be made to make iGEM more accessible and impactful, maybe even with some ideas stated above. It'll take some work, but as Randy Rettberg wisely said in the video mentioned above (5:10):
We don't make iGEM easy to do, we make it worth the effort.

Post-Jamboree Update
In an unexpected turn of events, Randy Rettburg ended up sitting down with me during the Jamboree and we chatted for over half an hour about what I wrote about above, and the situation at iGEM for the past few years. I won't divulge exactly what was said since I'm not sure how much he would like me to share, especially about his personal involvement in some aspects of the foundation. Regardless, I sincerely appreciate his time, and the fact that he decided to face the criticism I had head on. He's a very busy man and he had an overwhelming number of things to do that weekend, but he decided to take the time to explain some things to me, and I want to thank him for that.
We talked about how close iGEM has come to closing down in the past, why certain things were cut this year, why the Giant Jamboree makes organizing travel much easier than regional competitions (especially for teams from outside North America), and how much work the eight employees put in to make iGEM run as smoothly as"

After performing the protocol (see section Protocols ) of electrocompetents cells, we electroporated our cells at either 1200 V, 1800 V, 2000 V and 2200 V. Cells were then incubated respectively at 30°C for Pseudovibrio and 37°C for E.coli. Then we plated the cells on MB or M9 plates according to the media used for the pre-culture.
Unfortunately, some plates were convered by a cellular lawn and it was impossible to count the CFU. We chose to estimate roughly the cell growths as shown in the Table 6.
Table 6: Results of voltage tests.
In this table we can see that the higher voltage for which we obtained a very good rate of living cells is 2000 V for Pseudovibrio. According to these results, we chose to do a 2000 V electroporation to transform our Pseudovibrio denitrificans
Test with pSB1C3
This year, all the biobricks had to be sent in the backbone pSB1C3. For our first try to transform Pseudovibrio denitrificans, we thus chose to test this plasmid.
We made competent cells and then we did the developed transformation protocol (see section Protocols ), which is an electroporation at 2000 V.
Figure8: Maps of PSB1C3.
After a lot of tries, we did not succeed to have transformant of Pseudovibrio denitrificans which could grow on plates supplemented with chloramphenicol.
Because this plasmid works in E.coli which is a GRAM- bacteria as Pseudovibrio denitrificans, we expected it will work in our strain as well. Unfortunately, the plasmid was not expressed.
Other plasmids tested
After trying transforming our strain with a standard plasmid of iGEM, pSB1C3, we tried other plasmids, pBBR1MCS (Katzke N, Arvani S, 2010) and pRhokHI-2 (Katzke N, Bergmann R, 2012). Those plasmids were generously given by Dr Thomas DREPPER from the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Institute of Molecular Enzyme Technology (Group of Bacterial Photobiotechnology).

Project Overview
Numerous disease states in multicellular organisms involve anomalous expression patterns of endogenous genes.  Tumor growth, associated with the overexpression of oncogenes, is one vexing example in which this occurs.  While extremes of gene expression can damage living systems, normal expression is necessary for healthy function.  We have designed a modular genetic circuit to limit the expression level of a gene of interest to a user-defined, tunable threshold.  The limiter network reacts to the transcription of an endogenous gene within each cell, entering a regulatory state only where and when the rate of transcription lies beyond an acceptable range of activity.  Along with its potential therapeutic utility, we offer our device as a foundational tool for researching gene expression in a eukaryotic model.

Model
First we assume that the region that is affected by the lysostaphin is perfectly round, hence we can use cylindrical coordinates. The concentration of lysostaphin is assumed to be characterized by only diffusion and Fick’s law (eq. 1) can be applied.
By assuming  a steady state situation we can use the equation for mass balance (eq. 2) where we take the source term S(r) to be dependent on the radius, we can solve for this source term ones we have enough boundary conditions available. The source term will be modelled as a step function being equal to Sc for radius r < a, and 0 for a < r < R (eq. 3).
By substituting Ficks law into Mass balance equation we can solve the differential equation for both source terms separately. For r < a this is done in equations 4-7, where Ca is a constant that still needs to be determined. The equation is rewritten in such a way that Ca will correspond to the concentration at r = a.
For the region a < r < R the approach is similar. We obtain equation 7, where we still need to determine integration constant C2.
In order to determine both Ca and C2 we make use of the fact that the concentration is continuous in r = a and also its derivative is continuous is r = a. This is done in equation 8-12.
Since we know the concentration at b, namely the MBEC concentration cMBEC we can plug this in"

Two team members form Göttingen came to Groningen to work on the DNA microarray for the transcript analysis of their mutant strains. They arrived here on the 30th of July and then started doing experiment on the second day. We have a supervisor Mirjam, a PhD from Oscar's group. And one of our team member also helped them during the experiment. They would like to know how expression changed in the mutant strains in comparison with the wild type. The first two microarray for the two mutants were finished scanning on Friday. Then they repeated the experiment again including the dye-swap comparison. The whole experiment was finished no Sunday. During this period, they enjoyed the Dutch food, the Dutch beer and the Dutch weather as well! We shared our ideas about projects with each other and they introduced their experience about advertising their team to sponsors with a handy booklet. As a gift, they offered us a sample of the booklet. We believed that would be a help for us and hope them to get information they need from microarray experiment.

Droplet coalescence
In-silico mutant determination
Modified nucleotide inhibitory effect
During the development of CAT-Seq we have developed three different in-depth mathematical models that have immensely helped us create a well-working system.
Mathematical description of droplet coalescence
Efficient reaction mix enrichment by droplet merging was an extremely important aspect of CAT-Seq as it is directly responsible for the accuracy and information retainment degree. Yet, the droplet merging was immensely inefficient, as droplet coalescence techniques contain multiple parameters that requires precise tuning. For that reason we have developed an in-depth mathematical description of the droplet merging. Explore the model by clicking here .
In-silico determination of Esterase mutants
In order to assess the CAT-Seq accuracy and precision, using in-silico methods we have derived CAT-Seq esterase mutants which had different activities, which would be later used for Catalytic Activity Sequencing performance benchmarking. Explore the model by clicking here .
Modified Nucleotide inhibitory effect model
While researching the literature we have found out that modified nucleotides (which we are using as substrate nucleotides) might sometimes affect the amplification efficiency of Phi29 polymerase. We were concerned by that fact because the amplification efficiency was important for us, as nanopore sequence requires long amplicons. For this reason we have derived a mathematical model to assess the modified nucleotide inhibitory effects on the DNA amplicon length. clicking here ."
UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Project#Xenobiology_-_-_TEXT.html," so complex, if we wanted to draw  the map of these distances we would need to use (in general) N-1 dimensions!   Because we want to draw this information in 2 dimensions, we need to use a method to reduce the number of dimensions while keeping as much of the distance information as we can. Here we have chosen to use Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).   Finally we can plot the map of our molecules – incorporating their fingerprint dissimilarity – our Azodye Night Sky!   This work was performed in the Python programming language using the RDKit package (to generate molecules, fingerprints, and dissimilarity).
XenoRank: A Tool for Prioritising Xenobiological Synthesis
Our Azodye Night Sky is attractive, but really we want to use these techniques to help us find suitable xenobiological compounds.   So we have developed a web application to help us prioritise which azodye breakdown products are most similar to a list of xenobiological cofactor compounds that we are interested in. We've called this tool XenoRank.
We start by entering a list of molecules in the SMILES format. These are compared with a set of default compounds of xenobiological interest. Currently this is a list of cofactor compounds.
The results of the application is a report, where the compounds we are interested in (for us Azodye breakdown products) are ordered with respect to the highest similarity to any of our xenobiological compounds.
We show the above diagram for each compound, showing the similarity to each of the xenobiological compounds.   We have published this tool on Github under an MIT licence. We hope it to be useful for other iGEM teams, and the synthetic biology community in general.
Designing the Xeno-quinones
The pathway chosen from XenoRank was that of the cofactors ubiquinone and menaquinone. They are the electron buffer substituent of coenzyme Q in complex III of the electron transport chain that creates ATP on the membrane of E-Coli.
Ubiquinone is the electron buffer used in aerobic conditions and menaquinone in anaerobic conditions. Both quinols produce protons and electrons to create the electrochemical gradient used later in Complex IV and V to yield ATP.  In order to design Xeno versions of these molecules, it was important to ensure that we understood what each constituent on the the molecule provided to the chemical reaction.
From this understanding we designed the following molecules for our xeno-coli that we believe retains the properties described above

Then, in order to enhance the functionality of MFC device, we get further to introduce a B. subtilis strain with higher output of riboflavin into the co-culture system. Finally, the electrical output reaches 520 mV.
Future work
First, we will construct and characterize the system of acid sensing and orthogonal targeted protease degradation which can be an effective tool in regulating the relationship in synthetic microbe consortia. Additionally, we will reduce the volume of our MFC device with power generation unchanged, so that it will increase current density. We will also make improvements in Shewanella for more electricity output. We intend to weaken any other unrelated functions except for power production in Shewanella and using co-culture system to produce necessary nutrition for its survival.

We got some great feedback on ways to improve, likes and dislikes of the projects. It was great to get insight on different types  It was extremely valuable to have the time to get to know our peers in this competition as competitors and on a personal level. We got down to business the first half of the day, full of presenting our respective power points and brainstorming ways for each other’s team to enhance their research and asking questions. Our lunch break was my favorite part of the day because we played Catch-a-phrase, and I guess when you have a bunch of driven college students in one room it can get a little crazy. It was competitive and fun and really helped us get to know the other teams.
Upward Bound Testing
Today was a hectic day in the lab. We had the pleasure of hosting the Upward bound group to at the lab for a few hours.  Getting to show people all the awesome things in the lab is always fun so it was especially great to be able to share that experience with high school students who were excited to learn more about our lab. Everyone in the lab was in charge of a different “station”, and I got to work with the Leap Motion. In addition to technology like the Leap Motion and Oculus, it was great for these students to see the Multi-touch device and fiddle around with our iGEM prototype which was very helpful to see how a removed party interacted with it. The lab was buzzing with questions and my fellow co-workers explaining their various technology they were stationed at. Even though we all were pretty winded after standing up for a few hours straight opposed to working around the multi-touch and noses buried in computers, it was a blast and a great change of pace.

By measuring these factors, we provide  not only solid data to support our hypothesis for our model, but also the  values of the parameters involved ( Results ).  As a result, we were able to achieve a double-ring pattern by modifying the cooperativity of the response to AHL upon adding positive feedback to the genetic circuit. ( Results ).
During the experiments, we encountered numerous challenges and difficulties. To overcome them, we created several NOVEL  protocols, software, and devices with the help of our knowledge from different  fields, such as “growth curve on agar plate” ( Protocols ), “movie taker”, and “reflection spectrophotometer” ( Novel  devices ). We believe more researchers will benefit from our  inventions.
Last but not least, in this  project, we created 15 biobricks and characterized one existing biobrick ( Characterization ), which are considered to  be helpful to future iGEM competitions and the study of synthetic biology.

The initial result of our online research showed that the idea of printing biomaterials with a 3D-bioprinter is well received within the DIY community. Given the biosafety and operating requirements of a bioprinter, we inferred that biohacker spaces and fablabs would be its ideal context of use.
In order to get more information, we then conducted interviews in several fablabs and makerspaces in Paris. In addition to our initial survey, we were eager to target the fablab community for two main reasons:
this community represents a lot of values we stand for: giving the means for people to create products and experiment in a creative way.
this huge community is present around the world and displaying our biomaterial 3D printer in such places would help us reach a wider audience.
We visited Fablab University Paris VII Diderot, La Paillasse, Pasteur Fablab, Le Petit Fablab de Paris, Usine IO, Volumes, WoMa, and we also interviewed David Sun Kong from the MIT Media Lab.
We picked those fablabs in particular because they are all very different, from the business incubator to the volunteer-run community fablab, and the people in charge had very different personal opinions about 3D printers, which made the interviews particularly interesting. We also notice that the type of customers varies according to the type of fablab/makerspace, thus we were able to target customers such as regulars, private individuals or companies. When asking whether those fablabs would likely purchase our future device, we actually realized that professionals are very much divided on the importance of current 3D printers: while some believe it’s an extraordinary machine that will keep on expanding and become indispensable in the future, others see the device as overly hyped by the media and only used to produce prototypes.
Regardless of their opinion on current 3D-printing, all our interviewees converged on the fact that technicality and safety hazards associated with the microbiology would hinder the use of our printer. In addition, the more ""bio-aware"" biohacker spaces seemed more concerned by the efficiency and speed of our innovation. Overall we received very interesting comments and relevant feed back from our interview. Watch how Medusa was perceived by maker space in our summary footage .
Interviewing David Sun Kong from the MIT Media Lab
The take-home message for our interviews was that every fablab we talked to would be willing to display our printer, as long as it safe to use.                              This is very encouraging for the future of our project and we hope that one day, we will be able to distribute our"

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," hypothesize the usage of an activated charcoal column-based purification and concentration method. The concentrated perchlorate is then be shuttled to either be used as a base ingredient for the production of rocket fuel (ammonium perchlorate) or to the bioreactor. The bioreactor contains the engineered microbes, which act as biocatalysts to reduce perchlorate down to oxygen. The oxygen is then captured, transferred and made available to an enclosed Martian colony. Biowaste from the colony can then also be used as a feedstock for the bioreactor, as a method of reducing the load on the limited biomass resources available to the colony.
Project Description:
A Martian colony must make efficient use of the planet’s limited resources. Martian soil contains high levels of perchlorate (ClO4) making it toxic. Our team is developing an automated prototype for ClO4 extraction, its conversion to rocket fuel, and its genetically engineered biodegradation to oxygen. Remediated soil can then be recycled for construction and agriculture.Our goal was to take this perchlorate reducing pathway and to transform it into E. coli in order to effectively use it to remediate Martian regolith for use in a Martian colony. We want to show that Chlorite Dismutase when expressed in an E. coli chassis, is functional in regards to the conversion of chlorite ions into both oxygen and chloride ions. Our project is essentially a proof of concept, showing the viability of using biological systems as a method of oxygen production.
Our project has two main themes: 1) the extraction, purification and concentration of ClO4 from Martian soil, and 2) the bioconversion of ClO4 to oxygen using genetically engineered E. coli. ClO4 is highly soluble in water. We are testing the idea that ClO4 can be highly enriched and concentrated inexpensively using activated charcoal, as previously shown for a similar compound. For O2 production, we plan to synthesize and express genes from the soil bacterium Ideonella dechloratans, which is capable of degrading perchlorate to molecular oxygen. A schematic showing the mechanics of this process in Ideonella dechlorotans, is shown below:
Figure 1: The process by which soil bacteria degrade perchlorate to oxygen
This pathway utilizes two enzymes, perchlorate reductase (shown above in orange) and chlorite dismutase (shown above in purple). Perchlorate is first reduced to chlorate, releasing one molar equivalent of oxygen gas, through the action of perchlorate reductase, a two-sub"

Kleinwalsertal weekend
In June, we decided to have a seminar in the Kleinwalsertal (Austrian mountains). We climbed a mountain, spent some nice evenings together and developed a first concept for the Human Practices work. This weekend improved our team spirit very much and was a good possibility to recharge our batteries from the lab work!
German iGEM Meet-Up in Dresden
In July, the annual German Meet-Up took place in Dresden. A delegation from our team joined the German Meet-Up which was organized by the iGEM team TU Dresden. We got to know the other German iGEM teams, presented our project and talked about collaborations like iGEM Goes Green.
European iGEM Meet-Up in Delft
Five iGEMers from Darmstadt went on the journey to Delft, Netherlands to participate in the iGEM European meet-up. Thanks to the engagement of the host team from TU Delft, the meet-up became an inspiring and motivating happening. Due to good organisation, scientific talks, exchange with other iGEMers all across Europe and also fun time was well balanced.
Starting from the typical accomodation recommendations (campgrounds) and the social programs (pannekoekenboat - look it up, it's fantastic) or a canal-tour on a boat, not only were we meeting up to discuss science, we also got an introduction to culture in the netherlands and got a chance to meet the Dutch people themselves. We tried our best to not only represent our team, but also our local region, by bringing some typical apple wine (Äppler, or Appelwein or Ebbelwoi) and enjoying it with our fellow iGEMers, and making a fool of ourselves by swimming and jumping into one of the abundant canals (it was raining and really cold, but when in the Netherlands - do as weird tourists from Germany do!).
Through the event, we got feedback on our poster presentation style (too german) as well as contacts to teams which are working on similiar topics and interesting discussions. Especially, the opportunity to speak out about the idea of clonecademy on Friday during the Synergene Talk, was a big opportunity for us.
We brought back lots of new ideas and insights, new cooperation ideas (and cheese, we brought cheese and waffles). We would like to thank the TU Delft team and the whole university for hosting this regional Jamboree, and for organizing such an enjoyable and thoughtful"

1 Gene Expression Model for Lactate production
Simplification and Assumption
① Simplifications and assumptions for metabolic pathway and gene insertion:supposing that we have adequate glucose and constant pyruvate, the latter used to product lactate can be replenished by glucose in E.coli. Naturally, E.coli can itself produce lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) through LdhA gene expression. Later, we attempt to introduce plasmids with Ldh gene, which can produce the extra Ldh as an approach to generate even more lactate. However, the excessive Ldh, to a certain degree, will also inhibit Ldh gene expression.
② Simplifications and assumptions for Michaelis-Menten equation: we want to figure out the relations between the speed of lactate production and the amount of Ldh expression. But, there is a precondition in Michaelis-Menten equation, namely, the total amount of enzyme in solution keeps unchanged.
So, we need to modify the existing Michaelis-Menten equation:
 
 
The above equation reflects a general enzyme catalytic reaction process. With the help of steady state approximation, the equation can transform from first-order reaction to zero-order reaction. Because of the constant substrate concentration as we assumed, the variable in the equation is the variation of ldh amount, which means that the independent variable in the Michaelis-Menten equation turns into the enzyme amount. (variable change from [S] into [E])
 
 
in which :

③ Simplification of transmembrane transfer: the original pH in the medium is slightly greater than 7 and the pH can keep constant with the buffer function of KHPO4 together with KH2PO4. Suppose that Shewanella can absorb lactate brought by E.col"
UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#Epigenetic Flip Flop_-_-_TEXT.html," that PCR conditions had to be optimized (annealing temperature, template concentration, extension time, …).
Week 5 (August, 1-5)
I digested again tetR-CSD with the appropriate restriction enzymes, XhoI and XmaI, but and electrophoresis with the digestion products demonstrated that there wasn't cuts. Analysis of tetR-CSD DNA sequence showed that restriction sites were lost. A site-directed mutagenesis was order to recover restriction sites.
I made analytic digestions of pPR013 and pPR074, obtaining coherent results.
I also amplified and purified Swi6 using an optimized PCR reaction, in order to use it when needed. Amplification of sir3 with new primers gave no results. So, I need to optimize the PCR conditions.
At last, we received another synthesized part: tetO2. I transformed DH5α E. coli with this part and the following day I inoculated isolated colonies to make minipreps.
In the meantime, I began to construct the Purg-GFP-Tadh1 module, a positive control of the designed module containing the tetO flanking sequences. This construction will be integrated into the genome of S. pombe at the leu1 locus by homologous recombination.
In other hand, I ligated the fragment containing the Tadh1-tetOn obtained by PCR into pGEM-T vector and transformed it in E.coli. Colonies will be screened after the holiday break.
Week 6 (September, 2)
When I came back from holidays, I found the rest of synthesis parts (GFP·tetO4 and tetR·CSD) over my table. I used the standard protocol to transform them into E coli.
I made digestions of tetO2·Tadh1 and Purg with BglII restriction enzyme.
Week 7 (September, 5-9)
Colonies of transformation plates were quite strange. I set up inocula of them and repeated the transformation protocol. Some of the inocula didn't grow up, maybe because of selection of satellite colonies in ampicillin plates. I made minipreps and digestions of them, to get tetR·CSD (XhoI/XmaI), tetR (XhoI/BamHI) and GFP·tetO4 (PacI/AscI). I also digested pREP41X plasmid with XhoI and XmaI, in order to ligate tetR·CSD and tetR+Swi6 between pnmt41X promoter and"

Mutated virG
Phosphorylated VirG binds to vir box containing promoters and activates them. VirG is activated by the acetosyringone receptor VirA.  This version of VirG activates virB promoters in Escherichia coli without the rpoA-gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (compare to Theory) . For this reason the point mutations G56V and I77V are brought into the molecule YC Jung et al., (2004) . Because this BioBrick is synthesized, the codon usage is optimized for E. coli and illegal restriction sites were removed. When you use this virG gene in a VirA/G signaling system you do not need <partinfo>K238010</partinfo> anymore to get the system working in E. coli.
You can find this BioBrick here: <partinfo>K389002</partinfo>
virB-promoter
Vir-promoters from A. tumefaciens are induced by phosphorylated VirG response regulators and control genes for infecting plants in their natural host. They are part of the VirA/G signal transduction system.  We wanted to use the vir-promoter from the partsregistry (<partinfo>K238011</partinfo>) but the same problems occurred as with the use of the VirA receptor BioBrick from the partsregistry. So we also had to create a new vir-promoter BioBrick (again from Ti-plasmid of A. tumefaciens C58).

Firefly luciferase
Bringing the firefly luciferase gene from Promega's pGL4.10[luc2] vector into a BioBrick compatible form as a sensitive reporter gene. To amplify the signal of the luciferase three different sensitivity tuners are assembled before the luciferase gene. The sensitivity tuners were created in 2007 by the iGEM team from Cambridge and amplify the readout signal. We also assembled the firefly luciferase behind three different strong constitutive promoters for gathering additional information about this reporter gene Cambridge, (2007) .

6.1(all)
This weekend, we had our third regular meeting, and had a new teammate joining in us.  Jiren firstly further explained to us the conceptions we didn't figure out last week.  Chao, our team leader, introduced the fundamental knowledge about cancer therapies and the background of the review, combining with his own experience in previous experiments.  He also presented the weakness of the anti-cancer drugs nowadays, and the orientation scientists are working towards, which made us have a deep understanding of our project.
Afterwards, Anqi, Xianwei, and Jingwei gave us their presentations on specific bacterial targeting of tumors, intratumoral penetration, and native bacterial cytotoxicity.  An later added illustrations on Salmonella typhimurium with the information he found.
During the presentations, other students raised questions to further dig into the review. For example, when talking about TNF-α, we had doubts on human immune system, the infection of S. typhimurium, and the function of this factor.  Though we couldn't explain all these questions now, these discussions indeed broadened our minds.
In the end of the meeting, we assigned everyone tasks as usual.  Although the exams are coming, giving us pressure on our study, we will still working hard towards our goal.

Today we continuing to focus on document reading like last week.
Bomiao and Bei firstly illustrated on cytotoxic agents, cytokines, tumor-specific antigens and antibodies, gene transfer and gene silencing.  Among all these topics, the one of expression of anti-cancer agents caught the attention of us all.  Everyone presented his own opinions on this topic, especially in the transfer of genetic material in mammals by bacteria.
In the second part, Wenping described to us particularly on gene-triggering strategies, focusing on the pictures of the mechanism.  She tried hard to explain in detail, and asked us to understand it with the knowledge of molecular biology.  And it worked out.
After that, our new teammate Zhifei Yuan elaborated on detection.  Though he doesn't major in biology and is new to our team, his thinking is distinct and in order, and prepared"

The Tools You'll Need
27.05.2012
Jason
I've been asked on Facebook what I'm using to build the website.
What you really need, actually, are just a text editor and a web browser: you write your HTML and CSS with the editor, and open the .html file with the browser.
Plus a server to store the files you can't have on Mediawiki and possibly a FTP uploader to push your files.
These two are not mandatory, tough: you can put your stylesheet in EVERY .html file you're building, but that's definitely unhandy, as you'll have to modify everyone of them when you edit something.
This basic setup surely gets the job done, but I suggest you to find some more specific software.
I'm on a Mac and using Espresso or Coda 2 (plus Diet Coda on my iPad). These are all-in-one apps, so they have a built in editor, auto-completion, code highlighting, visual editor (very useful if you don't know CSS), FTP capabilities and so on. They're powerful, but also expensive.
I suggest you to try Sublime Text 2 , which is free and cross-platform.
Also, be sure to head over to Tuts+, where there are some must-watch free tutorials, including a 30 days one on basic HTML+CSS .

Hi everyone! I'm not sure how many ""everyone"" includes as of right know, since I'm not sure how many team members are already thinking about the Wiki. Being myself a web designer in my spare time, we're already on the Wikimedia train (I'm sure you've seen me cluttering the Recent Changes page in the last few days), so I've decided to put up this little Blog page, in addition to the Journal. I'll have the others post something too.
The journal is still a work in progress (actually, it's kind of a mess), and I don't think it would be very useful until it's ready. But I also want to have a place to share our opinions during this exciting iGEM let's-call-it journey, so here it is.
I'm gonna start with my thoughts on Mediawiki and some tips to manage to do something. I say"

Optimization
The efficiency of cre-loxp system is extremely vital to our design; it may fluctuate a lot in that the DNA are reversible.
The existing period of arabinose and the concentration of arabinose are two main variables, which we can easily control in our wetlab experiments. We find by modeling prediction that the concentration of arabinose doesn't matter much while the time variable is of importance.
Based on our model, we designed some experiments to test the inversion efficiency. This is the result we got with flow cytometor:
In terms of the overall tendency and some critical points, the result is well in accordance with the modeling prediction: the concentration of arabinose doesn't matter while the time variable is important. The result we got by further detailed analysis, to some extent, verify our model. Then to simplify the experiment procedure with a similar effect we add a feed forward control to the design.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", the collection team wore disposable Tyvek suits, eye protection, and heavy rubber gloves. We were careful to avoid splashing the water unnecessarily, however was not easy to pull bottom sludge samples to the surface and the protective gear was necessary. Since we had sequenced at least one round of samples from the canal already, we knew what human pathogens it contained. None of these were airborne, so proper protective clothing and attention to splashing was deemed sufficient by our advisory board (see Safety page(link)  for further description). Following collection, the samples were stored overnight at 4C. Freezing would have disrupted the microorganisms and potentially diminished the DNA yield.
Extraction of High Molecular Weight DNA
We followed a procedure published by Dr. Sean Brady’s laboratory at Rockefeller University . Dr. Brady’s group is searching for novel antibiotic synthesis pathways in soil samples, and their work gave us the idea to create the library of DNA from the Gowanus samples. Briefly, samples were placed in individual blenders and the extraction                     accomplished through a combination of shear force, surfactant  and high salt (Lysis buffer containing 1.5M NaCl, 2% SDS and 1% cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide). No living organisms are expected to survive this treatment. Although the                     original protocol calls for a pre-sieving step, this was not necessary for the Gowanus samples and was omitted, minimizing the contact with living organisms. The resulting crude DNA was further purified from the cell lysate by a series of                     centrifugation and precipitation steps.
Querying the Gowanus DNA for presence of specific pathways
Unfortunately we were unable to probe for more than one set of pathways before the end of the iGEM period due to lack of time. As a proof-of-principle demonstrating that such mining was possible, we used degenerate PCR primers to search for sequences bearing close resemblance to biosynthetically or biomedically interesting gene clusters following another published Brady lab protocol .  Secondary metabolites produced in microbes by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) biosynthetic machinery are a source of pharmacologically relevant chemical compounds such as antibiotics. The PCR probes we used were based on conserved regions within both NRPS adenylation (A) domain and PKS ketosynthase (KS) domain sequences. The paper states that “primer sets we used in this study are known to provide robust amplification of a wide variety of A/KS domains, particularly those found in the genomes of GC-rich soil bacteria traditionally"

Emory,2016,Team:Emory#Test_-_-_TEXT.html," research universities in high income countries.        One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation        of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle       vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that        A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by        spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin).        These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and        even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and        capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Educational Activities
This year we put a lot of effort in organizing lectures and lab activities around the synthetic biology subject. When organizing the events we took into consideration the public going to participate. It was extremely important to us to make the event accessible for Arab population as well as to the Jewish one.
For example, the 'SynBio in space' activity we organized for the ""OlimpiKnowledge"" program included both Arab and Jewish students, and we made sure there would be an appropriate Arabic translation during the whole activity for the Arab students convenience.
The Art of Science
Trying to explain a scientific idea to the public is not an easy thing to do, no matter in which language you choose to use. That's why we are strong believers in the saying: ""a picture is worth a thousand words"". All along our project we tried to enhance our scientific explanations through art. Whether you are an Arab speaker or a Hebrew speaker you would probably understand the language of art.
To see more of the original art made by our art director, Avi, see the art section .
We are extremely proud of our ”Synthetic Biology in 3 Languages” project. The comments we got from people who heard about our project, in one of the languages in which we published it, were positive and encouraging. Looking back to when we started the languages project, we feel confident to say we have achieved the project’s goals.
iGEM High Schools
The story of how we founded the first Israeli iGEM HS team
The iGEM competition is pretty new in Israel: the first Israeli team to compete in iGEM was the Technion team from 2012.
We are the second team from the Technion, and among our mentors are former Technion 2012 iGEM team members.
To make sure the iGEM continuity will last, passing the torch was one of the most important aspects for us this year.
So, in the spirit of iGEM continuity, we have taken upon ourselves to establish the first Israeli iGEM High School team!
In 2014, 54 high school teams were registered for the competition, but none of them were from Israel.
Not long after we started this amazing journey called iGEM, we started to wonder why the Israeli high school students aren't taking a part in this experience. We believe that the competition has so much to give for talented curious youth:
Synthetic biology knowledge

Systematic characterization of promoters
Overview
Significant knowledge gaps remain in the functional and dynamic characterization of several gene promoters, and engineering decisions depend on detailed quantitative information.
Comments
George, do you have any good papers about this? Chris.m.gowen 01:08, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
Yeah, there is a recent paper from Endy et al. titled Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using an in vivo reference standard .  In addition, there is a promoter measurement kit that has been developed by Jason Kelly (Ginkgo Bioworks) that is distributed by the Registry (I believe it was used in the paper mentioned above).  More information, including a protocol, is available here . GMcArthurIV 15:18, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
Here is another good paper by Adams and Hatfield titled Effects of promoter strengths and growth conditions on copy number of transcription-fusion vectors .  This idea of quantifying promoter strength seems very interesting and important to the idea of standardization.  I also like the idea of using a reference promoter to minimize the variances in promoter strength due to environmental and instrumental differences. - Albergca 22:58, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
Development of thermostable enzymes
Overview
Bacteria and Archea occupy nearly every nook and cranny on Earth; from deep beneath Arctic ice in the absence of light, to temperatures over boiling in Yellowstone. As thermodynamics tells us, reaction rates increase proportional to temperature. Therefore, an industrial enzymatic process normally carried out at 37oC, could be run at higher temperatures for a faster turnover. Additionally, incubating microbes is very energy-intensive, and the knowledge of thermostable properties can also be applied to utilize thermophilic enzymes in meso- or even psychrophiles. This could lead to Quiagen kits that don't require any incubation, yet can proceed at the same rate.
Comments
I think looking at homologous proteins across temperature preferences would be a good start. Usually dense G-C regions are more thermostable in terms of Tm, similar substitutions in amino acid sequences and tertiary/quarternary structure. Also, prions would be neat to look at, because they don't denature at 60°C,"

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Improving Flip Flop#Results#Plasmids and controls_-_-_TEXT.html," commercial vector. When the improved flip-flop module II is expressed in a high copy number plasmid, the system loses its bistable behaviour, probably due to the high represion peformed by the asRNA (figure 3). Also, this module was integrated in the chromosome of the X90 SspB- and RybB- E. coli strain in single copy by using the miniTn7BB-Gm functions, but the data of these measurements are too preliminary to be shown.
Figure 3. Relative fluorescence of improved flip-flop during 42ºC induction. When the asRNA is in the pSB4A5 low copy plasmid (left) we observe an optimal behavior  of the improved flip flop during the switch. In the pSB1T3 high copy plasmid (right) we can see that the relative fluorescence falls to basal levels and keeps in this way until the end of the experiment.

ACHIEVEMENT
1. We have successfully registered the team, had a great time discussing together, and spent a wonderful summer in lab.
 
2. We have successfully completed and submitted the iGEM 2012 Judging form and highlight our achievement on wiki.
 
3. We have designed a clear-organized iGEM wiki and really like the style. The wiki introduces our project in detail and present our outreach work in synthetic biology.
 
4. We enjoyed Asia Jamboree this October, presented out brilliant Riboscaffold with a Poster and talk and advanced to world championship. It’s going to be a great fun in MIT!
 
5. We successfully submitted and described 2 new standard BioBrick Parts, BBa_K738000 and BBa_K738002, in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, including details like primary nuleaic acid sequence, description of function, authorship, acknowledgment of sources and references. We have made detailed characterization in the operation of our new parts, which designed by ourselves.
 
6. We also made efforts on improving an existing BioBrick Part, BBa_K537009 and BBa_K411003,  entering this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry.
 
7. We enjoy our Creative HP Ideas Workshop a lot, practicing different ways in human practice of synthetic biology, and it works well. Human Practice of 2012 ZJU-China was divided into 3 main parts, which are experience a real iGEM, explore a new iGEM and collaboration. We made full use of Synthetic Biology Club by holding activities which had more than 100 participants on campus; we held several lectures to promote public understanding of synthetic biology and iGEM; We held ZJU Jamboree to welcome 60 undergraduates from more than 19 colleges to experience a whole “real” process of iGEM (research plan, presentations and project development); we participated in two big scientific fairs in university and our project was getting known by more people. We had a HP creative idea workshop which aims to dig deep in ethics and humanity in iGEM, and collecting creative and workable ideas from our club members. We collaborated and got involved in freshman English speech contest to see how our freshman will response to biosafety issues, we made an awesome musical comic video and sing in it. ZJU-China aims to be different in human practice this year.

In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved the following 3 goals:
√ 1. Provide a comprehensive, well-designed User Guide for your software and upload it to your wiki. Be creative! (An instructional video may work as well.)
We provide a tutorial (User Guide) of CORE in the software as well as in wiki. To see the user guide in wiki, please click ""Project/Tutorials"" !
√ 2. Develop a well-documented library or API for other developers (rather than ""only"" a stand-alone app for end users.)
We have provided the API documents. Please click ""Project/Techniques"" to read more!
√ 3. Demonstrate that you followed best practices in software development so that other developers can modify, use, and reuse your code. Provide more than one realistic test case. Examples of best practices are automated unit testing and documentation of test coverage, bug tracking facilities, and documentation of releases and changes between releases.
We have employed various techniques to ensure the quality of the software, and make the developing process as smooth as possible. These techniques include continuous integration, automatic unit testing, automatic documentation generation, bug tracking facilities and changes between releases. For more details, please click ""Project/Techniques"" .
We also did user studies (in a small range of people covering wet-lab and dry-lab backgrounds) during and after the developmental cycle of CORE. For more details, please click ""Project/Validation"" .
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved at least two of the following goals:
√ 1. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
Our Human Practices includes four parts: Scientific and Societal Thinking, Project Assessment, Public Engagement and Integrated into Project.
We brainstormed what potential impacts our project will have on scientific problems (like, scientific communication and collaboration, transparency and reproducibility, safety, security, etc.) and societal questions (like, intellectual property rights, ethics, regulation, etc.) before we began our project.

We recombined the aliquots and incubated them at 37 degrees Celsius for 6.5 hours to allow lambda to replicate.  We again aliquoted the cultures into 1.5 mL aliquots, added 400 uL chloroform, vortexed, and allowed to sit for 10 minutes.  After sitting, we centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate cellular debris from bacteriophage in the supernatant.
We added finishing touches to our book, including a dust jacket and a few blurbs on the back, and placed the order with an online publishing company!  That will give us one hard copy; Monday at noon we also have a meeting with Giovanni Tata, the director of BYU Creative Works, to discuss publication of the book!!

補足：
今まで、移動系、色素系、分裂系がありましたが、今現在システム全体が書き出せるものは
「物質合成→積算＆コミュニケーション→output」
の色素系であります。移動系のアイデアには、積算値が戻らないという利点があります。
しかしその位置情報を大腸菌に認識させるという、積算の次のステップのシステムが現在出されていません。
分裂系も、２のn乗で増えていくので色素系と比較すると問題点が多いです。
テスト前まで色素系を進めていこうかという話をしました。もちろん分裂系、移動系は棚上げで。

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-lys_-_-_TEXT.html," generally reduced with increased volume of lysostaphin treatment. The graph also shows that the drop in absorbance, which indicates a lower degree of crystal violet present in the wells, is prominent in both the supernatant and pellet sample. This reflects the SDS-PAGE results that show the presence of lysostaphin is in both the supernatant and the pellet. The constant negative control is maintained at 3.5 absorbance. Therefore t-test is viable to determine the statistical significance of the results. From the t-test, it is observed that there are significant differences in biofilm inhibition for the samples Lys 2 (S) with a P-value <0.05. A significance value was also observed for Lys 2 (P) at 5 and 10 μl with a a P-value <0.001. The positive control which used gentamycin had a much lower average absorbance of 1.065.
P. aeruginosa Biofilm inhibition [❓]
Figure 8. Absorbance measured at different volumes cell lysate treatment containing lysostaphin using P. aeruginosa as biofilm-producer. Negative: cell lysates of untransformed BL21(DE3) cells. Lys 2 (S): Cell lysate containing lysostaphin from the supernatant fraction  Lys 2 (P): Cell lysate containing lysostaphin from the pellet fraction.
Unlike the significant inhibitory results on S. aureus, data on P. aeruginosa was mostly insignificant, as shown from the figure above. Based on this figure, we can say that the changes in absorbance from the treatment was insignificant compared to the negative control. This was expected as we knew that lysostaphin specifically targets the peptidoglycan layers in staphylococci.
Demonstrating efficient biofilm dispersal
The enzymatic function of lysostaphin was also demonstrated by testing the efficacy of biofilm dispersal. The method of detection and quantification of biofilm dispersal was similar to that of inhibition, with the exception of growing the biofilm for 48 hours prior to adding the expressed protein. The same statistical analysis was used to determine the significance of data obtained.

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed.
Terra is designed to automate synthetic biology experiments run on microfluidic chips and the dispensing of the products. To utilize our system, the synthetic biologist would briefly educate themselves on microfluidic chip design or choose a predesigned chip from the 2017 BostonU Hardware team, MARS’, repository. The biologist would then fabricate and assemble the chip and connect the chip to Terra’s hardware components. They also have the option of utilizing commercially available microfluidic chips if they connect the output of the commercial chip to the TERRA Adapter, a predesigned chip for selecting outputs. They would input the parameters of the experiment to the Terra’s software interface and execute the experiment using our automated system. The outputs of the experiment would be selectively dispensed from the microfluidic chip to the 96-well plate, ready for analysis.
This system creates an interface between traditional benchtop biology and microfluidics and removes some menial work, like pipetting, from standard benchtop experiments. This would benefit the field by granting biologists more time to focus on the underlying science and experiment design behind their research.
As a proof-of-concept, Terra aims to dispense green fluorescent protein in a system within a microfluidic chip. Our experiment will consist of creating a gradient of concentrations of GFP among wells of a microtiter plate. The outputs of this experiment will then be selectively dispensed via the XY-stage according to the input to the software interface.

We did not stop trying. Below is our last attempt at assembling a functional butyrate pathway. This time.....we believe it worked!!! See Results/Demonstrate for more detail.
Final Butyrate Pathway Assembly Method
FimH Addition
Red fluorescent protein (RFP) (BBa_J04450) was inserted downstream of the engineered FimH via 3A assembly.  This part was then moved back into pSB1C3 using Ecor-I and Pst-I digestion. PCR and restriction digestion were used to confirm that this part was RFC 10 compliant. Visual confirmation of the RFP gene expression is seen in the pictures below. Red-pink colonies appeared on a culture plate after several days of growth.
Tube #1 - LB only
Tube #2 -wild-type E. coli Nissle
Tube #3 - E. coli Nissle transformed with FimH-RFP (in one plasmid)
Tube #4 - E. coli Nissle transformed with RFP and FIMH (two separate plasmids)
Our FimH-RFP part BBa_K267000 is clearly less ""red"" than FimH and RFP cotransformed onto separate plasmids. However our submitted part is useful in assays as seen below. This occurrence is likely due to genetic context dependency.
This test was performed on Caco-2 cells which are an immortal line of epithelial corectal cancer cells. Characterization assays showed that E. coli Nissle expressing our part were found closer to Caco-2 cells than colonies expressing RFP only, indicating that the Harvard Biodesign BBa_K1580011 is intact and functional. Box (A) shows Caco-2 cells alone, and Box (B) and (C) show Caco-2 cells infected with engineered Nissle 1917. In Box (C) the 137 isoform failed to result in binding to Caco-2 cells. Box (B) shows the 49 isoform successfully bound to Caco-2 cells in suspension, concluding that the expression of RFP and fimH 49 did not interfere with each other, and robustly allowed for the visualization of engineered Nissle 1917 using our method. As an extra control, Box (D) shows wild type Nissle 1917 and Caco-"
