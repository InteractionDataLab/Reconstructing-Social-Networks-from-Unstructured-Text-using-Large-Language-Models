UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," around, so we used a new strategy - using various amounts of template with duplicates placed at different annealing temperatures. One was placed in a touchdown setting as before but with annealing temperatures dropping from 60 to 50oC followed by 25 cycles at 65oC. The other was placed at 55oC for all cycles. We also didn't get good amplification of P1, P2, P3, P4, T1 or T2 so we repeated their PCR using touchdown from 70 to 60 as before but with 5 more cycles.
In the optimised PCR, we managed to get P1, P2, P3, P4 amplified, and T1 and T2 amplified but there were far too many bands to be certain we were amplifying the right thing. So we re-amplified T1 and T2 using PCR with touchdown 60-50oC as above. T1 was successfully amplified using this approach, however we got really strange bands for T2 so we went back to the samples from the previous PCR to see whether we could use those instead for T2. Our optimised PCR showed dCas9 was successfully amplified in all conditions - yay! The low copy backbone only amplified at 55oC using 1ng template so we repeated this PCR using those settings to generate enough DNA for later. This PCR was successful.
Now that we had most of the components, we could digest them. P1-5 + PE, the strong and weak RBS linked GFPs, and T2 were digested with BsaI. For the gRNA plasmid, J23119, gRNA 1-5 and gRNA0 as well as Tfdx were digested with BsaI. We digested 1ug for all of the components except the GFPs. 2ug of both backbones were digested too. The gRNA backbone was digested with SalI and AscI, whereas the low copy backbone was digested with SalI and BsteII. For the dCas9 brick, we digested dCas9 with Bsa1, T1 with BsaI and SalI, and PdCas9 with BsteII and BsaI. We PCR purified all of the digested before ligating together the bricks using T4 DNA ligase. We had problems digesting gRNA 4 as the DNA concentration dropped to 2ng/ul on two separate occasions, so the whole process was repeated for gRNA 4. 50ng of each brick was used for the"

As it is not straightforward to manually derive a protein model using protein structure files, we wrote a program that converts the commonly used ""protein database"" file extension (.pdb) for Cas13a into a 'LEGO-block' model (in the form of a matrix) (Figure 1). The hydrophobicity and charge (isoelectric point) scales applied ( Biro, 2006 ) can be easily adapted.
Figure 1: LEGO-block model of Cas13a to input into the lattice model. A) Model of Cas13a hydrophobicity distribution. For visualization purposes, a colour threshold was applied: red areas are hydrophobic while grey areas are not. B) Model for Cas13a charge (isoelectric point) distribution. For visualization purposes, a colour threshold was applied: blue patches are positively charged while gray patches are not charged or negatively charged.
We provide the Matlab script , enabling anyone with basic Matlab knowledge to import a structure, which can be converted to a coarse-grained 'LEGO-block' model with a resolution that can be set by the user. In addition, the code intuitively includes the desired hydrophobicity and charge scales to consider, which can be adapted as desired.
However, since TDPs are intrinsically disordered proteins, this method could not be applied to them. Thus, we simply settled on averaging the properties of five neighbouring amino acids in the sequence, instead of in space. Similar to protein folding, there are two main driving forces behind protein-protein interactions which are electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions ( Vagedes et al. 2002 ). To be able to calculate the interaction energies between different protein units, the hydrophobic moment and isoelectric point ( Biro 2006 ) of each amino acid were averaged for each unit during the discretization.
Generating the simulation environment
Besides the discretizations of the proteins used in the lattice model, several other aspects were simplified. In the model, we wanted to observe the interaction of a single Cas13a protein with TDPs at a certain concentration. To realize this, we fixed Cas13a at a specific point in the simulation environment and employed periodic boundary conditions, emulating a larger volume occupied by Cas13a and TDPs.
To generate the simulation environment, the concentration of Cas13a was set to 0.5 g/L, the concentration of Cas13a isolated with our protein purification protocol . For the planned Cas13a drying assays, 4 µL Cas13a would be dried in a final volume"

""The fart as a social tabu is becoming a dining ritual, an example for decadence and a way to disguise your body scent. By being plain and trivial, the topic of Synthetic Biology becomes more tangible for the consumer in a grotesque way.""
Product Description
'Odeur Cuisine' is the newest hype from Europe, allowing you to extend the experience of a delicious meal to a rich bouquet of combined fragrances in the form of gastrointestinal olfactory output, be it enhanced flatulence, enriched eructation, or both.  The Starter-Kit is based on a cookbook giving you insight into the various techniques of 'Odeur Cuisine' and their appliance in the recipes of world-leading chefs. Additional background information is also provided, such as the historical and cultural background of flatulence, up-and-coming dining rituals, and scientific illustration. Also included in the kit are accessories for cooking and savoring odeur meals, a strain of modified gastrointestinal bacteria and a set of smell triggers - indispensable and varying with your chosen package.  Everything you need to prepare the finest emission-cultivating dishes in combination with gastrointestinal activated odors!
Technical Description
The idea of Odeur Cuisine is based on modified E. coli bacteria that are able to secrete molecules with different smells (ethereal, camphoracceous, musky, floral, minty, pungent, putrid). The variation of smells can be triggered to be synthesized in different concentrations by flavorless substances mixed into your ordinary meal.

Project Description
Formaldehyde, the simplest aldehyde of high reactivity and polymerizing stability, is widespread used in construction and decoration industries. Formaldehyde in glues and resins are then gradually, naturally and slowly released into the ambient environments by decades of years. The colorless but pungent gaseous formaldehyde brings different degrees of harmful symptoms to us humans, such as eye, throat and skin irritation, and even carcinogenicity. Since 1971, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has published a series of Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Human. In 2012, IARC formally listed formaldehyde as a member of the Group 1 of carcinogens, which means definitely carcinogenic to human.
We plan to construct a E. coli-based in vivo system for detecting and further degrading formaldehyde in environments. In fact, formaldehyde is such an ideal substance to work on in an iGEM project that several previous iGEM teams (like TMU-Tokyo in 2012, WHU-China in 2014 and Jilin_China in 2015) have been working repeatedly. The problems are: 1) the present sensing threshold of formaldehyde concentration (~ 10 ppm) is far upper beyond the environment-protecting standard (~ 0.1 ppm); 2) the degrading system seems to work instably, although some survival or duration after formaldehyde addition was observed.
As a high-school competitor, we do not expect to establish a de novo more effective system. We plan to make modifications based on current systems (already registered as BioBrick parts); if possible, we want to introduce new genes to improve the performance. At least some of the following goals will be achieved during our iGEM project: 1) more sensitive detectability, 2) more effective degradability, and the most important 3) invaluable experience of problem-solving and team-working.

Hi, I'm Zhen Wang, I mainly work on MoDeL and Database of iGAME. As a member of Lixin He's research group, I focus mainly on calculation of quantum information, quantum correlation and entanglement.
You might have noticed that my address is same as Liao's. Yes, we are from the same Research Group, and the same department, too. It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.
As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!

It is my second year of studying in computer applied technology lab of Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master candidate. I am interesting in software engineering and Computer Sicence.  Last year I noticed the recruit advertisement of iGem 2010 USTC_Software team in school BBS website. I make the decision to apply immediately. It's really happy for me during those past server months working with our team.
I play Ping Pong most during my spare time, because Ping Pong is a sport emphasizes on speed, skill and acting harmony ability rather than brute force. And I go jogging every day, which i think is a good way to relieve  pressure and keep me in health!

In the conference, in-depth communication and ideas exchange occurred between each team. The attendees reaped substantial benefits from the inspiring sparks collided by thoughts and innovation among teams. After fast-paced preparation, we dissected our project into following parts, background, project, design, modeling and human practice. Meantime, we also held an open attitude towards the suggestions and comments from other teams.
In the conference, not only did we strengthen the collaboration with FAFU-CHINA, but we established new bonds with other teams as well. And the communication and mutual learning among the teams provided us with the opportunity to broaden our horizon and help us acquaint more people with our project.

The visible band at the expected size, corresponding to nuclease, in well 2 is not present in the wells (3 and 4) with the samples with lower IPTG induction concentrations. This indicates that the plasmid of interest is functional and that nuclease is expressed when inducing with IPTG. Since the same band is also visible in well 5 (pellet resuspension sample), and increasingly faint in well 6 and 7 as the IPTG concentration decreases, it is difficult to draw any conclusions whether nuclease is soluble or not.
Demonstrating efficient biofilm inhibition by Nuc
A crystal assay is conducted to evaluate how Nuc inhibits biofilm growth by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively. Induced BL21(DE3) cell lysate samples (both debris pellet resuspension and supernatant) are used for the experiment.
S. aureus was cultured in BHI media and P. aeruginosa PAO in LB media. After an overnight incubation, the cell density is measured at OD 600. Also, 200 µl of the liquid culture is added into each well and treated with Nuc of four different volumes; 1, 5, 10 and 20 µl. The biofilm is allowed to develop for 48 hours with subsequent staining. Absorbance is then measured at 595 nm. Cell lysates of BL21(DE3) cells are used as negative control. Differences between the negative control and Nuc is evaluated using the Student’s t-test. A p-value <0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Saving the bananas
Every time you go to the supermarket or to the local market to buy bananas you take for granted that there will be bananas readily available for you to enjoy and savour. However, banana plants are under threat and a world without bananas is more plausible than we all might imagine. Banana plants are threatened by Fusarium oxysporum. This pathogenic soil fungus enters plants through their root systems and lives off of them until they die. This fungus currently threatens all banana plants worldwide. Bananas, apart from being a delicious fruit, have economic importance in many tropical regions and are an important part of the diet. These are the reasons why the iGEM team Wageningen 2014 has designed and created BananaGuard, a genetic system in Pseudomonas putida that detects the presence of F. oxysporum in the soil and produces a combination of antifungals to remove the fungal threat. If you want to read more about the system and our work during the last six months, the iGEM team Wageningen 2014 invites you to continue surfing around our Wiki.

We ran a PCR of pA13BW. The CRE gene amplified correctly and the sample was column purified, yielding 54.8ng/uL (with GC enhancer) and 49.9ng/uL (with non GC enhancer). We ran out of supplies to miniprep, so we pelleted pA13AM and pC13BG cultures and began to not so patiently await the arrival of a new miniprep kit. Our PCR of pC13F to append BamHI and KpnI cut sites yesterday failed completely, so we digested pC13F with KpnI to linearize it with an internal cut site in mRFP for another PCR to be run tomorrow. Another gel was run of the pC13AY digests and all lanes were blank. There may have been an issue in quantification by nanodrop that was reading over 1000 ng/μL that mislead us into using low volumes of DNA for digestions. We decided to electroporate with the remaining pC13AY to miniprep and redo gel screening. On a brighter note, our restriction cocktail digestion of pA13BE with BamHI, KpnI and SacI showed a band at 500bp, which is the approximate length of PpelA. We also searched for a pAK13AN miniprep in the DNA storage box and for a glycerol stock of the same plasmid. We couldn’t find either. However, we did obtain a plate of colonies that had been transformed with pAK13AN. We picked colonies off this plate to miniprep and send off to sequencing. In addition, we column purified our inserts from the PCR run yesterday of pC13Z and pK13AL. We then quantified inserts after column purification. After, we digested backbones pAK13D and pC13P with SpeI and PstI and vector dephosphorylated both. The inserts, GFP in pC13Z and mRFP in pK13AL were then digested with XbaI and PstI. We ran a gel of backbones and inserts for confirmation of digests. Unfortunately, the results showed no bands from DNA. Perhaps there was not enough DNA from backbones for proper visualization. We also received materials for protoplasting today, and autoclaved or sterilized the supplies in whatever way we could. We made a filtration system such that all the filtering process during G. lucidum protoplasting will remain sterile. We made another"

This part is essential for our designed function of detection. With BBa_K1509001 (smt operator/promoter), it’s the core member of the cadmium sensor.
BBa_K1509001
This is a bi-directional promoter, a new non-coding region part. It contains two inverted repeats that are the binding sites of SmtB protein. And the activity of one direction of this promoter can be repressed after the interaction with SmtB protein. With BBa_K1509000 (the gene smtB), it’s the core member of the cadmium sensor.
For Recycling
BBa_K1509003
This is a constitutive strong promoter, a new non-coding region part. The promoter was designated as CP25. CP25 is a stronge promoter in Lactococcus lactis.(Jensen and Hammer, 1998) In this article, they measured the activities of the CP promoters in E. coli and assayed the expression of a reporter gene(lacLM) to rank the activities of those CP promoters. The result suggests CP25 is the strongest promoter. We picked it and insert it upstream of the gene CDS7( BBa_K643000 ), a part registered by Columbia-Cooper in 2011 iGEM competition, to make sure the gene CDS7 can be transcript constantly.
For Flocculating
BBa_K1509002
This is a new coding region part. It is responsible for the flocculent ability of Bacillus sp. F2 and has been converted to E. coli JM109. It has been proved that strain of E. coli positive clone FC2 could express flocculent activity, with the flocculent efficiency of 90%, thus can be a good choice in environmental applications.(Guangyu Chang et al., 2007) The 1071bp gene consists of 29% T, 18% C, 25% G and 29% A. Considering the subsequent treatment of our reconstructed bacteria, we use this gene to enhance the flocculent activity of our bacteria. This is to make it easier to collect nanocrystals formed by our bacteria and also a second thought of the problem of secondary pollution. It’s very promising in future application.

Market Targeting
After visiting and interviewing representatives from one private (BioPharmaceutical company AstraZeneca) and three municipal WWTPs (Henriksdal in Stockholm, Kungsängsverket in Uppsala and Lotsbroverket in Åland), we confirmed their role as potential customers. We were strongly recommended to implement Biotic Blue during the WWTPs processes (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018 and P Gruvstedt 18 Sept 2018). According to professionals from the industry, our product would not be feasible or controllable in initial steps since the water would not be clean enough, mainly because of sludge presence (Personal communication H Jönsson 15 Aug 2018).
Regarding municipal WWTPs with less than 2,000 people connected and non-municipal and individual wastewater treatment systems (up to 200 people connected), we understood they are customers with more complexity. Some of these systems do not meet the legal requirements [10], and also the implementation of advanced treatments are not under their main priority [11]. Investment costs and the ability to find workers with the appropriate skills are notable obstacles, whereas bigger municipal WWTPs possess the resources to welcome emerging techniques (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018 and P Gruvstedt 18 Sept 2018).
Different experts in the field also advised us to target hospitals, where the concentrations of pharmaceuticals are higher (Personal communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018, study visit T Mörn 30 Jul 2018 and J Olsson 15 Aug 2018). Tomas Mörn, in addition, thought that by treating water at its source, the cost of WWTPs would be reduced. In our visit to Kungsängsverket WWTP, we also learned that the Uppsala University Hospital has a particular interest in solving this problem since they are currently running two projects to treat toilet water before it reaches the municipal WWTPs (Study visit S Svebrant 15 Aug 2018). On the other side, Huddinge Hospital representatives do not think hospitals are the source point for pharmaceuticals (Personal communication K Sonesson and S Rosenborg 10 Sept 2018). Although they would be willing to modify its working routines if a new solution could minimize their costs when disposing of patients' urine, they"

Another minipreparation was done and again we didn’t get any results.
thursday 4th of August
Contamination on the agar plates was discovered and we decided to start all over again with the experiments, since we didn’t get any good results lately.
A transformation of promoters W (=pBAD), U(= constitutive promoter), R(=pLac-Lux), S(=plambda CI and LuxR regulated), B (= pLac/Mnt) and insert G (= GFP) was done in DH5alpha cells and TOP10 cells.
friday 5th of August
The transformation of DH5alpha cells seemed to have worked and precultures were made for miniprepping.
saturday 6th of August
The new miniprep didn’t result in DNA.
monday 8th of August
Minipreparations of the promoters and GFP were carried out by Lies Vandesteene of the Molecular Physiology of Plants and  Micro-organisms Section. She applied the CTAB method and  managed to get good  results. She also did a restriction and ligation of the promoters with GFP in TOP10 cells.
We did a transformation of biobricks H (Crt-EBI),  I (RBS-CI repressor),  X (ribokey) and K (terminator) in TOP10 cells.
Tuesday 9th of August
Instructor Erwin Swinnen carried out a DNA purification of the same biobricks as Lies did the day before. A high DNA yield was obtained. We have enough DNA of the promoters and GFP in stock to go on with restriction and ligation.
10 colonies per ligated fragment were inoculated  in LB medium with ampicillin so another minipreparation  can  be done tomorrow. 3 other biobricks were also inoculated  in LB medium (O= hybB  promoter, BBa_K410000; T= LuxR, Bba_C0062 and Y= MelA, Bba_K193602) but instead of ampicillin they were inoculated with a different antibiotic.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Landmine_-_-_TEXT.html," figure 1). Our goal was to find a model which would be able to reproduce the response curves of both promoters.
Figure 1: Dose-Response curves for the jbiJ promoter (left panel) and the yqjFB2A1 promoter (right panel). Figure adapted from [1]. We will use (m)M as unit for DNT concentration. Values are converted using the molecular mass of DNT, \(182.13 \ g \ mol^{−1}\).
To achieve this, we constructed two different models, both using deterministic modeling methods . One model is based on a simple binding model of DNT to the promoter, the other is based on cooperative binding of DNT to the promoter.
When based on the simple binding model, fits of promoter activation with respect to DNT concentration to the experimental data of [1] did not yield good results. However, when the fits were based on the cooperative binding model, we were able to match the experimental data in [1] really well, see figure 2.
From the fits shown in figure 3, it is clear that both the standard and cooperative activation model fail to describe the experimental data we obtained. This might have several reasons. Firstly, the response ratio of our measurements is very small compared to the measurements in [1]. Secondly, our experimental data suggest a detrimental effect of induction with high DNT concentration. This effect is not described in [1] and we don't know its reason. It is therefore not included in our model. Thirdly, both the data set from [1] and our experimental data set are small compared to the amount of parameters. This makes finding the right model difficult.
To improve the promoter activation model, a larger and more consistent data set has to be obtained. We need to conduct fluorescence measurements over a wide range of DNT concentrations. Besides that, possible detrimental effects of its solvent (acytonitrile) have to be investigated. Also, the induction of the N genes with rhamnose might influence the measurements in an unexpected way. Doing all this is unfortunately not possible in the time span of this iGEM project.
Figure 2: Fits of the promoter activation model described by cooperative promoter activation to the data of [1]. The left panel shows the fit for the jbiJ promoter, the right panel the fit for the yqjFB2A1 promoter. For comparison, also the fits described by the simple binding model are displayed.

Each merged droplet now contains a specific ratio of Product Cytidines to Methylated Cytidines. Such information can then be recorded by initiating MDA reaction. After the reaction, the amplified DNA molecules now have the specific ratio of nucleotides, wherein the ratio of those nucleotides depend on the specific esterase mutant activity.
6.  Reading the activity information - sequencing and data analysis
General description
The last step of the CAT-Seq is the retrieval of recorded activity information from the amplified DNA. In theory, this may be achieved by any sequencing method that can incorporate a DNA modification recognition step. Yet, CAT-Seq uses Nanopore Sequencing for several reasons:
1. Nanopore sequencing allows to sequence long molecules, which eliminates the need of biomolecule fragmentation. This is an extremely important characteristic to us because when working with large libraries of mutants in single droplets, fragmenting amplified DNA in those droplets means that all of those fragments in droplets would need to be barcoded. While in theory, this is a possible thing to do, it would require an extra merging and amplification step which would immensely decrease the accuracy of the activity determination. That is because in general, every step of the biotechnological method never is one hundred percent efficient. In turn, the lower amount of steps your system needs to take in order to produce results - the more accurate it will be. That is why reducing the number of steps in CAT-Seq by omitting fragmentation and barcoding was extremely important for us.
2. Secondly, nanopore sequencing can detect and discriminate different modified nucleotides with ease, because nanopore can detect slight changes in nucleotide structure and assign a different value to that signal.
Going back, the droplets containing the amplified DNA molecules can then be broken and the amplified DNA is purified. The purified DNA from water phase can be directly sequenced using a nanopore sequencer. As the library passes through the nanopore, it retrieves the biomolecule’s sequence and the information about its activity that is encoded in the form of Product to Reference Nucleotide ratio.
Using the same principle, billions of different catalytic biomolecule sequences and their corresponding activities can be recorded.
Proof of concept
The last step of the proof of concept story is the sequencing of amplified DNA using the nanopore. This is an important step, because it can provide the information about the CAT-Seq system precision. In this case, nanopore must accurately distinguish mutant sequences that contain"

An entire chromosome arm “9R” has been synthesized according to our mad scheme and successfully inserted into yeast. Moreover, the native chromosome 9R can be trashed and the cell continues to smile and happily reproduce ad infinitum. Initial testing of the Cre-ER system strongly suggests that recombination occurs when estradiol is added.  However, a more visual test is appropriate.  A FLO8 gene has been added; this gene allows yeast to grow and organize into “fuzzy” structures similar to mold, technically referred to as pseudohyphae.  We are doing experiments to initiate recombination in the presence of both FLO8 and the synthetic chromosome, which contains a number of genes required for fuzziness.  A control group of fuzzy yeast (with no synthetic chromosome) should not respond to the addition of hormone.  The experimental group should show a reduction in colony count, varying colony size, as well as a mix of fuzzy and non-fuzzy colonies.  This should show that recombination is occurring and can be controlled.
Genome Stabilization (and destabilization)
Another level of redesign was thre relocation of tRNA genes. tRNA genes have been as a documented source of genome instability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae v. 1.0. As a measure to combat genome instability, as well as examine the effects of a more rigidly constrained genome, the tRNA genes for Sc 2.0 are being relocated to a specialized chromosome, the tRNA array. This entirely synthetic chromosome thus far only consists of the tRNA genes from chromosomes III and IX of S. cerevisiae. The tRNA array of chromosomes III and IX of S. cerevisiae 2.0 consists of 17 tRNA genes; each gene consists of the coding region of the tRNA From S. cerevisiae and the upstream and downstream flanking regions from a close relative of S. cerevisiae, Ashbya gossypii. Use of the fusion tRNA genes was required to avoid incorporating the repetitive sequences often found upstream of tRNAs in S. cerevisiae, as another aspect of our redesign philosophy for Sc 2.0 is to minimize nonessential repetitive DNA.  Each of the genes is a representation of the same gene found on chromosome III and IX with all duplicates removed. Between each tRNA gene is a rox recombination site that will allow for"
UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#BidirectionalPromoter_-_-_TEXT.html," and start proteins transcription, regulating the bidirectional promoter depending on presence or absence of Hg, because MerR gene negatively regulates its own synthesis. It also has a really interesting characteristic to form a stable pre initiation complex with RNA polymerase, making it able to promptly answer to Hg presence in cytosol and starting transcription process.
Another remarkable characteristic of MerR is how it binds to Hg. The binding site is a homodimer and involves one cysteine in one monomer and two different cysteines on the other monomer. Unlikely other metalloenzymes that make strong bonds with their metal cofactors, MerR is capable of making strong but temporary binding to a metal ion.
This surprising mechanism of regulation and transport from Mer Operon inspired us to construct a treatment system (including biosensor, bioaccumulation and bioremediation) of mercury utilizing it. For this, we developed the key piece of all genetic constructions related to Hg! Check it out the Essential Biobrick!
Our construction: How it works?
To develop our biosensor, bioremediator and bioaccumulator in Escherichia coli DH5-alpha we designed a biobrick to be the key piece of many genetic construction related to mercury. The Essential Biobrick (BBa_K135001) is composed by the mer bidirectional promoter, having dual function: A) In reverse: transcription of the MerR regulator protein; and B) In forward: transcription of the MerP and MerT proteins, as represented below:
In mercury absence, MerR forms a MerR-promoter-operator complex, preventing RNA polymerase to recognize the promoter, consequently, messengers RNA MerPT will not be transcript. In presence of Hg2+, MerR protein binds to this element and dissociates from the promoter-operator complex, allowing MerPT expression.
Essential biobrick (BBa_K1355001) doesn’t have a transcription terminator, because it was made to be attached to others coding regions that permit a new function for bacteria. For this project, we used Escherichia coli DH5-alpha with Essential Biobrick attached to encoding region for Green Fluorescent Protein (BBa_E0840) to build a biosensor; as well as encoding region for Metal Binding Peptide (BBa_K346004) to build a bioaccumulator; and encoding region to mercury reductase (BBa_K1355000).

Safety
For iGEM 2008, teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects. See this link . Specifically, teams are to consider the following questions:
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
Researcher safety?
Public safety?
Environmental safety?
Biological safety
Within our department of Biotechnology in Delft, the Biological Safety Officer (BSO) is ultimately responsible for safety in the labs. Via this person, we learned under which permits our work is conducted and what is allowed and not allowed in terms of wetlab activities. The BSO is to be informed on a regular basis on what we are doing and plan to do in the near future. Also, the BSO has to approve of the project initially.
The molecular biology lab we worked in is an ML1 lab. Each lab within the department has a person responsible for checking whether or not the rules are followed. Every day before someone begins working in the lab, he or she should register and mention permit number in a log.
The rules of the lab, the permit and the BSO are followed strictly; the project did not raise any safety issues working under these requirements.
Safety issues
In safety issues, a distinction can be made between legal (or obligatory) safety issues and moral safety issues. The rules of the lab were followed strictly; hence legally researcher, public and environmental safety risks can be considered minimal. For the moral safety issues, this is a totally different issue, as is described in the ethics section of this wiki. Safety (or risk) itself is not really a problem for our team in a scientific sense, but the moral"

Abstract
We used the acetic acid bacterium Gluconacetobacter hansenii to produce bacterial cellulose. Because of its fibrous, tough, water-insoluble properties [1] bacterial cellulose is the perfect substrate for biOrigami. After making the cellulose, we refined it into a flat, paper-like sheet using a DIY paper-making protocol. One unique aspect of cellulose is the existence of a class of proteins known as cellulose binding domains (CBDs) that can attach to a cellulose sheet. We designed a universal CBD (uCBD) that allows for the attachment of any protein onto a cellulose sheet. Using our uCBD device, we can extend our self-folding system to serve additional functions, such a sensor for the detection of inorganic molecules, or binding enzymes to catalyze reactions on the surface of the sheet. We have contributed the BioBricks of our uCBD system to the registry. See our biobricks below:
See our BioBricks
Introduction
We used G. hansenii to produce cellulose as an alternative substrate for our biOrigami. Combine with cellulose binding domain and spore coat protein, cotZ, we could attach spores onto the cellulose surface for self-folding. Lastly, we collaborated with the Edinburgh 2015 IGEM team by providing them with cellulose sheets to test their protein sensors. You can learn more about the collaboration here

Agricultural Practices
The origin of our modern agricultural practices can be traced back to the post-World War II Green Revolution, which focused on improving crop yields by creating optimal environments for plant growth. The Green Revolution particularly focused on proliferating environmental management, pest management, and seed hybridization strategies. Products and services implemented included chemical fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation infrastructure, and mechanized equipment to work the land. These changes resulted in vast improvements in crop yields, including a 132% increase in rice production from 1966-1999 and a 91% increase in wheat production over the same time frame (Khush GS).
As the US and the world population continues to grow, the need for agricultural production has increased with it. The Green Revolution helped increase agricultural efficiency to meet much of this need during the twentieth century, but today we are seeing the limits of its techniques, as well as its negative side effects, including the poisoning of wildlife through the spread of pesticides, algal blooms and subsequent widespread aquatic death from the spread of nitrogen fertilizers, erosion due to tilling, and depletion of the soil’s nutrients at a rate faster than they can be replenished. With the world population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, the majority of farmable land across the globe already in use, and the limits of chemical fertilizers and plant breeding being tested, there is a great need to develop a new technique for increasing agricultural efficiency. The current technological proposition to solve this problem is the genetic engineering of plants to make them grow larger, faster, and more plentiful.
When genetic engineering entered the agricultural scene, it was used primarily to grant plants selective resistance to herbicides and pesticides. Monsanto’s herbicide Roundup, which used glyphosate as"

Investigators: Kevin, Kerstin, Laura
We prepared some chemically competent E. coli XL1Blue MRF' cells for all the transformations we are going to perform during the project.
Friday, May 24, 2013
Investigators: Kevin, Kerstin, Laura
Today we transformed our freshly prepared competent cells for test purposes. We used the plasmids pUC18 and pUC19 to calculate the transformation efficiency. 100 pg of DNA were used for each transformation with 50 µl of compentent cells.  Additionally, competent cells were plated on agar plates containing ampicillin, kanamycin and chloramphenicol respectively to ensure that the strain is not carrying any corresponding resistances. The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight.
Saturday, May 25, 2013
Investigators: Kevin, Kerstin, Laura
Cells from yesterday's transformation only grew on agar plates containing ampicillin. The plates with the additional antibiotics were empty, thus we can conclude that our competent E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' cells do not carry other antibiotic resistances.

Parts designed and constructed
1. Synthesised Ratiometric Luciferase construct in non-standard plasmid (Part:BBa_K911004)
This part was designed as a ratiometric luciferase reporter. The first promoter, hyperSpank, is LacI - repressed and controls the transcription of a (vibrio harveyi) luxA gene that has been fused at the N-terminus to an mOrange gene via a flexible linker. This was described by Dachuan Ke and Shiao-Chun Tu (2011) as having an additional peak in its emission spectrum at 560 nm, whereas the normal peak is at 490 nm. This is terminated by b0015. Downstream, pVEG controls the translation of the entire normal lux operon, which is again terminated by b0015. The idea is that the normal luciferase output acts as an internal control signal, to which the output of the induced luciferase with the spectral shift can be normalised. We designed this to be compatible with our cheap open-source sensing hardware. This part has some toxicity issues preventing it from being assembled in pSB1C3. We contacted iGEM HQ and were granted exemption from the pSB1C3 standard for this part.
2. Fluoride Sensitive Riboswitch (Part:BBa_K911003)
Riboswitch that is highly sensitive to the F- ion. It forms a rho-independent transcriptional terminator in low fluoride concentrations and this structure is removed in the presence of fluoride, allowing transcription. It is sensitive from about 10μM up to around 30mM. Above this concentration the levels of fluoride begin to become toxic and kill the cells. We have characterized this part in three different chassis: TOP10 e.coli, 168 strain bacillus subtilis and a strain of bacillus subtilis with its normal fluoride riboswitch, the crcB gene, knocked out (kindly provided by the Breaker lab in Yale). Results of Miller assays for these three chassis are also provided.

One of the numerous benefits of VINCEnT is that it has a very broad range of applications. A growing concern for Southern Alberta is the spread of the aquatic invasive species zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis respectively). The current methods of controlling their spread are: Zequanox®, a heat killed cell lysate of Pseudomonas fluorescens; and “potash” or potassium chloride (1). Zequanox® has only been shown to be effective in very small, sectioned-off areas of water and is also a very expensive product for wide-spread use. In order for potash application to be effective, it would have to be added to concentrations just above acceptable drinking levels (2,3). Even with these constraints, because of its relatively cheap cost potash is the prefered method for zebra and quagga mussel eradication by Alberta Environment and Parks (see our Human Practices page for more details).

P22 PNC with FitD
Highly specific to Dreissena spp.
Need small amounts to add to be effective
Non-replicating therefore not infectious and easily controlled
More expensive and labour intensive to produce than potash
Through contacting Nicole Kimmel from Alberta Environment and Parks, Ryan Dyck from Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada, and Shannon Frank from the Oldman Watershed Council; we  have found that our system may be an applicable solution to the combat the spread of zebra mussels (see our Human Practices page for more details). This has led us to design a PNC construct from the bacteriophage P22 to encapsulate the Dreissena spp. specific toxin from P. fluorescens strain CL145A, the active agent in Zequanox"
WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"us mirabilis. This bacterium generally colonizes the gastrointestinal tract, the kidneys, and the bladder. Infections will most commonly occur if there is a loss of functionality in the urinary tract. [1] When this happens the incredibly motile P. mirabilis will be able move up the urethra to the bladder and eventually to the kidneys. Once in the bladder it can produce fimbriae which will bind to the surfaces of the urinary tract.
At this stage in the course of infection the bacterium is generally harmless unless kidney stones begin to form. This occurs as mineral buildups form in the vicinity of the bacterial colonies. Further complications occur if the kidneys become infected, which can lead to septicemia. [2] Once this happens the resulting blood infection can be fatal and it is for this reason that P. mirabilis is one of the most widely studied bacterium that cause urinary tract infections.
Infection Types:
P. mirabilis is the primary cause of urinary tract infections in mammals, especially those with preexisting functional problems in the urinary tract. [3] This strain causes 90% of urinary tract infections out of the various Proteusspecies. The initial urinary tract infections are rarely a cause for concern as they can be treated relatively easily with antibiotics.
Treatment
P. mirabilis can be treated with a wide variety of antibiotics including quinolone, trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone and gentamicin. [4] If the infection is relatively minor, the antibiotics can be prescribed for 10-14 days to destroy the pathogens. In more severe cases of infection, antibiotics will be prescribed for as many as 21 days. Complications can ensue if kidney stones begin to form. As the stones form they will be become heavily contaminated with the bacteria. When the minerals forming the stones coat the bacteria, antibiotics will become less and less effective against bacteria. [3] This can lead to a resurgence in the bacteria.
Virulence Factors
P. mirabilis possesses a large variety of virulence factors, making it difficult to prevent its spread once an infection has started.  Known virulence factors include urease, fimbriae, and flagella.
Urease is an enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing urea into ammonia and carbonic acid. [4] The buildup of this ammonia is fatal for the cell. When this urea builds up it can combine with minerals such as magnesium and calcium, forming kidney stones. The buildup of the ammonia and carbonic acid act as a buffer from the ly"

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Nucleotide Design_-_-_TEXT.html," very sequence of DNA as incorporated nucleotides and read during next generation sequencing as a ratio to a reference nucleotide. The ratio of incorporated reference and substrate/product nucleotide is proportional to the catalytic activity of the biomolecule, which catalyses the catalytic conversion.
The spectrum of attachable substrates defined defines the capabilities of such catalysis recording system. Taking advantage of the chemical synthesis, virtually any substrate can be linked to the 2'-Deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate 2’-OH and N4- functional groups. The combination of modifications added to the nucleotide, chemical and biochemical reactions allows to create a dynamic system which can account for almost all of the enzyme catalytic reactions.
1. Oxidoreductases
As the name implies, oxidoreductases catalyze the oxidation and reduction reactions. A range of substrates containing alcohol, carbonyl or carboxylic acid, amine or ether groups with different carbon backbone can be used to measure the catalytic activity of oxidoreductases - alcohol dehydrogenases, monooxygenases, reductases, cytochromes. The main approach, shown below., utilizes the instability or chemical properties of formed reaction products. Covalently linked product molecules spontaneously and easily (beta elimination reaction) are removed from the modified cytosine, switching the state of the nucleotide to accessible.
2. Transferases
Transferases catalyze the transfer of functional group from one compound to the other. The most popular transferases are phosphotransferases and aminotransferases. Cytosine linked substrates bearing carbonyl/amino, hydroxyl groups with a specific carbon backbone are easily synthesized and can be used for specific catalytic reaction activity recording. Image below. depicts main example of such catalytic “activity” recording. Reaction product, bearing carbonyl group takes part in beta elimination reaction to producing accessible 2'-Deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate.
3. Hydrolases
Hydrolases catalyze the transfer of a chemical group from substrate to water molecule. Functional groups of interest present in the substrate can be easily linked to 2'-Deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate 2’-OH and N4- positions and can act, not necessary, as the connecting bond. Utilizing the vast majority of connected substrates, different amidases, esterases, phosphoesterases, glucosidases and sulphotases can be screened. Image below. shows an example reaction cataly"

But, in previous iGEM years, there is already a pREC-LacZ Biobrick constructed (Heidelberg 2012) with convincing functional analysis. In principle, our system could be completed, as a functional pREC-LacZ already exists. By adding the reporter of Heidelberg 2012 to our target strain with the Cas9, we should be able to get a functional sensor. This sensor can detect and report a specific DNA sequence due to a phagemid delivered gRNA that guides the present Cas9 to a target where the Cas9 generates a double strand break, which is reported by pREC-LacZ.
Figure 8: FACS analysis of the pREC-YFP strain. Fluorescence against counts for WT as well as pREC strain unindexed and induced with 10ug/ml MMC after 2h of incubation.
Next steps
As previously mentioned, the reporter didn’t work as expected. This can have several reasons. As our other positive control (beside MG1655), the MMC induced strains carrying the reporter didn’t show any expression, it stands to reason that the reporter itself is not functional. Another reason could be, that the phagemid didn’t deliver the gRNA or not in enough amounts to show an effect of the complete working system.
   To test, if the phagemid delivers the gRNA correctly, we will perform another killing assay as we have done it before with the difference that the gRNA is delivered by the phagemid. The strains are then plated to see, if there is a reduced number of colonies of the target strain with phagemid in comparison to a control strain and without added phages. We expect the results before the end of iGEM.

About Us
Manaus is the capital of  Amazonas State,  located in the middle of Brazilian Amazon rainforest. It is the largest city in the Amazon with more than 2 million inhabitants and a vibrant culture with a gorgeous gastronomy and lots of places to visit. That's the scenario we have surrounding us: Amazon river, rainforest, macaws flying over us and we loving it of course! But we were missing something...why not a little bit of Synthetic Biology in a place full of biodiversity? Yes, we went for it!
Figure 1 - Amazonas Opera House and Negro river as background.
UFAM stands for Federal University of Amazonas, is the largest University and the best ranked in the region. We are from many science fields such as biology, biotechnology, medicine, art and design, computer science, chemistry and engineering.
Figure 2 - Meeting of the Waters, where Rio Solimões and Rio Negro meet, but not mix.
We are here to show just a small part of our rich Science in Manaus, home of our team, and we hope you’ll enjoy as much as we did throughout the process.
The UFAM_Brazil team was created back in 2012 under the name Manaus-Amazonas-Brazil when we participated on the Latin America Jamboree. This year, our team is composed by fifteen students, from high school to undergrads. Our main objective is to use synthetic biology in order to innovate technologies being applied in the Amazon region, with the ultimate goal of preserving what matters the most for the future generations: it's biodiversity!

Lastly, we talked about iGEM and learned that the reason why anything we disclose in the Jamboree (wiki/presentation) cannot be patented is because patent laws generally say anything disclosed in public is already in the public domain and cannot be patented. There is, however, a one-year grace period after public disclosure where the inventor can still file a patent application, but this grace period is available only in the US and a few other countries.

Industrial Scale
We wanted to explore how to implement our project in real life. This includes figuring out how to produce our bacterial product in a large industrial scale. Upon our initial research, we thought about producing our bacteria in a continuous culture system but in reality, we do not know whether this would be financially viable or not. We had a lot of questions regarding production cost in an industrial scale. Therefore, we sought out to contact John Liddell from the Centre Process of Innovation to answer some of our questions. Through a phone call, we were able to obtain information and resources that enabled us to estimate the production cost of our system through a mathematical model .
Phone call with John Liddell from the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) 24/07/2017
To get a better understanding of expanding our project in an industrial scale, we contacted John Liddell from the Centre for Process Innovation , a UK based technology innovation centre that helps companies to develop, prove, prototype and commercialize products and processes.
One of the main things we learned is that it’s hard to accurately estimate the cost of production as there are a lot of different factors that will have to be considered: the type of bioreactor used, the size of the bioreactor, the type and amount of medium used, growth rate of organism and various utility cost (cost to sterilize and maintain). We initially thought that growth medium would be one of the biggest factor for cost. However, John explained to us that for E. coli, the medium may be about  £1000 in a batch system using a 1000L tank. But again, he told us that this will depend on the type of medium and said that molasses and glycerol are among the cheapest sources of glucose.
We briefly discussed our idea of culturing our E. coli bacteria in a continuous culture system. John suggested that"

Introduction
To form different types of synthetic receptor constructs a modular building set was used. We designed the genes of two parts coding for extracellular binding proteins (anti NIP scFv, anti-Flu Lipocalin) and four different components of an intracellular signal transduction reporter protein (Cerulean CFP, Venus YFP, β-Lactamase, and Luciferase). These reporters were designed as split-proteins to achieve activaton only when two receptors come together and form a cluster. With this strategy, a signal is only given by two binding-molecules that are next to each other as it is realized in the DNA-origami structure or the NIP and Fluorescein-coupled BSA.
The whole receptor construct consists out of (i) a signal peptide, (ii) an extracellular receptor domain, (iii) a GGGS-linker followed by (iv) a transmembrane region and (v) an intracellular split-reporter-protein. The signal peptide sequence equal to that of human EGF-receptor erbb1 ensures the transport of the protein construct to the cytoplasma membrane. A GGGS-linker is necessary to create a distance between membrane and the recognition-site to tower cell surface structures as glycoproteins and glycolipids. The sequence of the transmembrane region is taken from the EGF-receptor erbb1 as well. The C-terminal split-parts of Venus-YFP and Cerulean CFP were not directly fused to the transmembrane region. To get a little bit more flexibility in binding to the N-terminal part, a split fluorophor-linker was assembled in between.
Almost all parts were ordered by gene synthesis in a pMA-vector system that is adapted for cloning BioBrick parts. The constructs were designed according to BioBrick 3.0  standard with the modification for fusion-proteins proposed by the iGEM Freiburg Team 2007 ( FreiGEM07_report_fusion"

No: Plastic waste, micro- and macro-particules, will not be easily collected. Plastic production keeps growing and produces a large amount of plastic waste. In order to be an efficient alternative, our bacteria needs to degrade faster than plastic is being produced.  However, this project could still help reduce plastic waste and have a positive effect on the environment.

This enzyme has been successfully expressed in E.coli and its catalysis ability in vitro has been verified. However, the substrates of XylC will inhibit enzyme activity when present in milli-molar concentrations [4] .
In our previous work on XylS, we found that benzaldehyde can indeed induce its response, but the induction ratio is apparent low comparing to its native inducer: benzoate. We speculated that the combination of XylS with enzyme XylC would increase the biosensor’s response to benzaldehyde, and further combination with XylB would enable XylS to detect an originally undetectable compound benzyl alcohol.
After obtaining correct sequence of XylB and XylC via PCR from TOL plasmid pWW0 in Pseudomonas putida, we put XylC and XylB under the control of Pc promoters and expressed them on different plasmids (Fig. 5).
The performance of XylC Adaptor was tested in following protocol. Bacteria expressing XylC protein was cultured overnight in LB medium at 37 °C  and then diluted 100 fold into Minimal M9 medium, growed for 12 hours at 30 °C  to transform benzyladehydes into benzoates. The culture was then centrifuged, and supernatant was taken out to further culture XylS biosensor. Induction ratio was then measured by Flow Cytometry.
The Flow Cytometry test confirmed our hypothesis: the induction effect of 3-methyl-benzaldehyde and 3-chlorobenzaldehyde on XylS combined with adaptor XylC improved significantly comparing to biosensor XylS only (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, the dose-response curves for 3-methyl-benzaldehyde of adaptor-equipped XylS and unequipped XylC (Fig. 6b) showed that the Adaptor XylC could reduce the detection limit (the concentration of inducer at which an output three times the basal single is generated) of 3-methyl-benzaldehyde"

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PHA_-_-_TEXT.html," holin and endolysin inducible under (L)-arabinose. This lysis device was not reported to kill entire populations of E. coli, and we saw this as an advantage for a continuous plastic-production system. We would be able to cause part of the population to lyse and release its P(3HB) into the media, and the rest of the cells can continue to grow. The rest of the population would continue growing and producing plastic. The plastic can be recovered from the media by causing the granules to aggregate, and then requiring lower amounts of solvents and less time to complete the purification process [7]. We were able to obtain preliminary data showing that the lysis system works.
We also worked on an auto-lysis system that would not need to be induced by arabinose. This system furthers the goal of being able to have a culture that continuously produces plastic. This device was made by combining the existing lysis+panK+phaCAB with a quorum sensing system using the lux genes and AHL. When the cell culture grows dense and enough AHL are produced, they will bind to the luxR receptor, which then induces the lysis system. We were not able to test this system due to time constraints, but we confirmed the sequence and submitted the BioBrick.
(3) Improving the qualities of P(3HB)
Our plan to improve the qualities of P(3HB) was to add the gene propionate CoA transferase from Clostridium propionicum (Pct) to the P(3HB) construct. This gene is supposed to cause the bacteria to produce P(3HB-co-3HV), a similar polymer with properties that make it more useful in manufacturing (and perhaps folding). The Yale 2008 iGEM team had a BioBrick for that part; however, after several rounds of unsuccessful assembly and sequencing, we realized that the sequence from the Registry was inconsistent, and was likely why this part didn't work. We did not have time to order the correct sequence of this part synthesized, but this is a promising area for future efforts.
Data and Results
We have improved a BioBrick to allow for E. coli to accumulate more plastic.
Our first set of experiments focused on testing the benefits of adding the S. aureus panK gene in front of the Imperial College 2013 team’s device. We measured the amount of P(3HB) produced in vivo in two ways: by extracting the plastic and measuring its mass, and by staining the cultures and measuring the fluorescence on a"

1-1. Overview
Our team collaborated with iGEM 2016 team KAIT_Japan and other teams, as we were asked to help them with the modeling in an early stage. From iGEM 2016 team KAIT_Japan we were asked to help them create a mathematical model for their project.
1-2. Project
Team KAIT planned on increasing the production of Bacterial Cellulose (BC) produced by the bacteria A. xylinum. To do so, we have to take into account the cellulose synthesis pathway.
Fig. 8-1-1. Cellulose synthesis pathway of an Acetobacter
Based on the mechanisms of this pathway, iGEM 2016 team KAIT_Japan planned to increase the amount of cellulose production by diminishing the amount of G6PDH and PGI enzymes by the antisense method.
1-3. Mathematical Model
Cellulose is produced basically by a series of enzymatic reactions, so in order to create a mathematical model for this project, we have to take into account the principal reactions taking place in this production. By doing this we obtain the following equations .
$$ \displaystyle \frac{d[Glc]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_1}[Glc]}{K_{m_1} + [Glc]} $$
$$ \displaystyle \frac{d[Frc]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_5}[Frc]}{K_{m_5} + [Frc]} - \frac{V_{max_6}[Frc]}{K_{m_6} + [Frc]} $$
$$ \displaystyle \frac{d[G6P]}{dt} = - \frac{V_{max_1}[Glc]}{K_{m_1} + [Glc]} - \frac{V_{max_2}[G6P]}{K_{m_2} + [G6P]}"

This reflects the usage of the oleic acid by the cell's metabolism, therefore, the samples with the presence of oil had a bigger grow rate, taking to account that the cells could have spared energy needed for the oil pathway activation and instead, got it ready to use. It probably also mean that 0.00032M, is probably near the optimal point of oil concentration to stimulate cell growth.
So now, instead of stimulating, we wanted to find out the point in which the rich fatty acid medium would start being toxic for the cells. This meant having higher concentrations of oleic acid. We added in the following quantities: 25uL, 50uL, 100uL, 200uL, 400uL and 1000uL.
Since our medium is also rich in nutrients and phosphates, the addition of higher concentrations of oil would create a biphasic system inside the test tube, some nutrients and composts would go to the oily phase and the solubles would stay in the aqueous phase. The oil now rich in nutrients would also assume a more viscous state and a good chunk of it would stay ""glued"" to the tube walls when staying in the shaker.
The results until the 0.256M oil concentration in the medium presented satisfactory results, but the 0.514M and 1.28M samples were overloaded with the gooey matter and presented a huge distortion in the turbidity and consequently in the reading.
Oleic acid growth. Relative cell density x Time. Source: Personal archive.
As we can see, even tough the cells did have a considerable growth, if compared to the results with lower oil concentrations, the later growth rates are clearly smaller, as the 0.128M of oil is the highest one and it still was outgrown by the control. We believe that the downfall of the 0.256M and 0.064 samples are not directly related to the oleic acid concentration, even tough they did probably contributed to it. It is also very reasonable about the 6h point of the 0.256M sample and affirm that it represents an experimental error and that the value shown in the graphic does not effectively represent the true value./p>

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," mentioned that the USDA facility, where Mango Materials does pilot testing, houses eight different industrial-scale centrifuges. Mango’s original protocols were developed in Stanford research labs, where the team used typical lab bench centrifuges.  They now need to predict which industrial-scale centrifuges best suit their purpose.  The Mango team has run into many such unanticipated junctures while transforming their lab success into a commercial-scale process, and they have had to “wing it” a bit. Dr. Schauer-Gimenez laughed while telling me about one Macgyver-like strategy to filter wastewater for feedstock: the team lined up Costco water filters, connecting them with pipes from Home Depot.  The next scale-up level would require an entirely different strategy by which to accomplish this step.  Dr. Schauer-Gimenez told me that the greatest unanticipated expense for fledgling biomaterials companies tends to be spent figuring out how to extract desired polymers from cells. Typical lab techniques (like using chloroform to dissolve cell membranes) are not scalable.  Companies like Mango Materials develop their own secret protocols to address this problem.
The Mango Materials PHB will need to be price competitive with polyactic acid (PLA) and polypropylene in order to achieve goal impact, Dr. Schauer-Gimenez explained, because 80% of consumers care only about cost efficiency. PLA currently sells for around $1 per pound, while polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), the larger category of biodegradable plastic which includes PHB, sells for about $3 per pound.  Dr. Schauer-Gimenez laughed: “Even our Berkeley friends who are environmentally conscious won’t pay $3 a pound for plastic!”
By the time our meeting was over, I had realized that investment in scale-up was not trivial. Without going through this process ourselves, it would be difficult to realistically project price, yield, and environmental impact of our latex manufacturing method.  This meeting also reinforced the message to our team that we will not be able to influence manufacturing practices unless we can sustainably sell latex at or below prevailing market prices.
We next met with Murthy Konda and Binod Neupane of the Joint Bioenergy Institute (JBEI) Techno-economic Analysis Team to get advice about how to predict and assess the feasibility and sustainability of our latex production. Dr. Konda and Dr. Neupane reaffirmed the difficulty of projecting yields, price points and environmental impact when beginning an unpredictable scale-up process. They explained their strategy: the techno-economic analysis team sets a price point (or carbon emission) goal for"

4th Week (18–24 July)
We finally obtained and amplified pIRES2-EGFP without CMVie and without the gene Rac2, that we discovered was cloned inside the MCS.
We then proceeded to amplify an aliquot of pSEAP of which we received the full sequence, in order to transfect HeLa cells and assay it’s activity.
We amplified and ligated TraI with BBa_B0015 in order to subsequently complete the bacterial construct B3. The construction of A0 and B2 is approaching completion as well, while we finished working on constrct B1: we’ll now need to verify the correctness of its sequence.
Meanwhile we also started working on our bacterial construct A2 by ligating the previously amplified P-TraR into BBa_K081016 (LasI comprising an RBS and a terminator up- and downstream, respectively).
5th Week (25–31 July)
We sent the sequences to have the secreted beta-lactamase (sBLA) gene by synthesis, comprising all the restriction sites needed to clone it into our vectors. It should be here next week
Also, we tested the activity of pSEAP after co-transfection with p65-TraR into HeLa cells. To assay this we employed the Great EscAPe secreted alkaline phosphatase detection kit (Clontech), obtaining promising results confirming the efficiency of the Tra box-CMVminimal promoter sequence. We then proceeded to isolate this DNA sequence and ligate it into pIRES2-EGFP (lacking its constitutive CMV promoter), through a series of sequential cloning steps.
The bacterial constructs A2 and B2 have been completed and sent to sequence, while B1 was control-digested but found not to be of the expected dimensions. The same problem occurred with A0, probably due to the beta-glucosidase we used for both the constructs. We thus sent A0 and B1 to be sequenced as well, and in meantime started working to construct it again from the start. The construction of B3 proceeded with the ligation of the TraI/terminator segment with P-LasR/R"

A coding sequence of iRGD peptide and position it outside the membrane.
Usage and Biology
iRGD is a tumor-penetrating peptide that can increase vascular and tissue permeability. Importantly, this effect did not require the drugs to be chemically conjugated to the peptide. To enhance the accuracy of drug delivery system and improve targeting index of drugs, iRGD peptide was displayed on the surface of the exosome containing our previously designed siRNA, allowing us to target recipient cells in vivo efficiently. Lamp-2b is a protein found specifically abundant in exosomal membranes. So we connect iRGD with Lamp2b by a glycine-linker, and promote the expression using cmv promoter. We engineered our chassis, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, to express iRGD-Lamp2b fusion protein. Therefore, the iRGD exosomes (iRGD-Exos) are endowed with site-specific recognition ability and were purified from cell culture supernatants and loaded with Dox by electroporation.
Characterization
The iRGD-Lamp2b expressing vector was thoroughly described in Tian’s article (Yanhua Tian, et al. Biomaterials, 2013). He showed that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, could deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice. To reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, mouse immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were used for exosome production. Tumor targeting was facilitated by engineering the imDCs to express a well-characterized exosomal membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused to αν integrin-specific iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC). Purified ex"

We gave an overview of current applications of SynBio, from food and nutrition to energy production, but mainly focused upon tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
As we were addressing members of the public with limited science, specifically biology, knowledge, we decided to approach the evening in the same way a teacher might. Upon consulting the literature pertaining to good teaching practices, it was decided that our evening would follow Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning. In this, the various stages of learning, from basic knowledge all the way through to implementation and practice, are ranked in order of which should be covered first. Whilst we had initially planned to grab our audience’s attention by launching into interesting examples of synthetic biology, Bloom’s Taxonomy informed us that we were better starting with the basics. We therefore began our presentation with a quick run though of the vocabulary as well as the basic steps in protein production. We followed this with slides explaining; PCR, restriction digest and ligation, in simplified terms such as ‘copy’, ‘cut’ and ‘paste’. To ensure that we didn’t lose any of our audience, we took regular breaks for questions and to refresh some of the terms used.
After the talk, we encouraged attendees to engage in an open debate on the ethics surrounding synthetic biology; they also considered how the technology can be made useful for both science and society. The discussion was pretty lively at times, especially when the issue of religion in science was brought up, which was very thought-provoking.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala_-_-_TEXT.html," directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.
Survey Analysis
When we had chosen to create a Worm Buster, we wanted to see if there was a market for this kind of product. To gain knowledge about the market we conducted a market analysis together with the human practices group. The modeling group worked with creating a program that could use the information from the market analysis and see if correlations could be found between different variables.
Future Possibilities
The small strongyles’ larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat [2]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and infect the horse after being ingested [3]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle [4,10]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals [7].
Due to this, an efficient diagnostic tool that can be applied to grass samples is necessary to prevent ingestion of large strongyles. This is why we looked into the possibility of a second Worm Buster targeting large strongyles could be possible for the future.
Figure 6. Large strongyles.
Symptoms
When the worms migrate into the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms it may form an embolism which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic [13]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death [3].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection. This makes the need for the second Worm Buster even larger.
Current Methods for Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them. The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [11, 12, 16].
In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure"

Thus, we wanted to address some of these limitations in our project.
What do we hope to achieve?
Since CRISPR/Cas9 systems involve the two main components of the gRNA and the Cas9 protein, it is clear that improvements in these components will enhance the efficiency of gene editing. However, due to the complexity of biological systems, it is challenging to find a ""one-size-fits-all"" method for efficient gene editing. Keeping this and the existing limitations in mind, our team set out to explore methods to improve the efficiency of HDR repair and the delivery of Cas9 proteins into cells. Lastly, we investigated if the utilisation of different CRISPR/Cas proteins has an impact on gene editing, with a project aimed at correcting mutations related to non-small cell lung cancer."

The Bridge Between Microfluidics and Benchtop Biology
Welcome to the 2018 BostonU HW Project: TERRA
Microfluidics allows for the manipulation of small amounts of fluids on the scale of microliters and nanoliters. The application of microfluidics in synthetic biology research would enable scientists to design and implement synthetic biology systems more efficiently and with greater reproducibility.
While microfluidics is not new to the field of synthetic biology, it is not currently widely used or accessible to many benchtop biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic devices are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs embed sensors directly into the chip. Many of these sensors, however, already exist as traditional analytical devices, such as plate readers. These devices could be used for analysis of microfluidic outputs if the outputs were dispensed selectively into a compatible vessel, such as a microtiter plate. If this were possible, synthetic biologists would be able to incorporate microfluidic chips to streamline their experiments without sinking time and money to design and fabricate highly specialized chips.
Our project, TERRA, aims to create an automated system that bridges benchtop biology and microfluidics. Terra is comprised of three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, accessible active XY-plane selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate and automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed."

Cost and DIY Approach
Our goal from the beginning has been to make TERRA accessible and therefore we took a DIY approach to our design. This would keep costs low, but would require more assembly of the system. For that reason we have made all the CAD, STL, and additionally all the code available on the wiki and also our GitHub. This is a bill of materials and the cost breakdown of our entire system.

Harvard_BioDesign,2015,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," replicating, living therapeutic. The exorbitant costs of cancer therapies in the developed world has translated into disparities in cancer treatments compared places of lesser wealth. Such variance is seen even within middle-income countries where there are often higher quality treatments in urban centres compared to less prosperous rural areas. Given this feedback, we realized that the microbial therapeutics we’re proposing are all-the-more desirable they could be produced more cheaply at higher scales compared to small molecule cancer therapeutics. Bactogrip’s customizability and ease of administration could represent a new treatment paradigm which makes cancer therapy more consistent and universally accessible across the globe.
From the lab bench to clinical trials
Dr. Daniel Kronish, the Associate Director of Medical Review at the Harvard Office of Human Research Services (OHRS), informed us about the timelines to bring new cancer therapeutics to market. He told us that the clinical trial process is lengthy and arduous, typically requiring several years for any single drug. Once a potential therapeutic has passed pre-clinical trials in the laboratory, the OHRS must approve clinical trials, review human testing protocols through panels of experts in various disciplines, and ensure that the study design meets rigorous scientific validity standards. This review process ensures criteria including drug dosing are clear and that the study guidelines of those sponsoring the drug are consistent with the care standards set by the OHRS. Dr. Kronish emphasized that our proposed microbial therapeutic would be subject to the same scrutiny as traditional cancer treatments. He made us realize that our microbial treatment might move more slowly through the review process because of inherent differences in its design compared to small molecule therapies.
From this conversation, we desired to learn more about the details of the clinical trial process. We spoke to Dr. Jerome Ritz, the Executive Director at the Connell O'Reilly Cell Manipulation and Gene Transfer Laboratory, in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He emphasized that we should consider in vivo assays in model systems readily adapted to humans in later stage trials to ensure that our work is relevant for when we transition to human subjects. Dr. Ritz also told us about the necessity of setting clear test criteria prior to study of human subjects. He told us to consider which sort of colorectal cancer patients we would enroll in a study because our treatment would only be effective on specific cases of cancer where biomarkers match our customized BactoGrip adhesive protein. We would also have to determine approximate timelines for our therapy to achieve a therapeutic effect so that tumours in patients would be analysed once the microbial anti-cancer agent has had sufficient opportunity to act. Such timelines are critical for recruiting test subjects since individuals"

Our topic is about whole cell biocatalyst that can degrade one kind of plastic, that is Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET). The whole process we strictly dispose the chemicals and toxic substances, such as Ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol can be a mild irritant if it contact with the skin or if it is inhaled, so we have to protect our self by wears gloves, lab coats and always work with ethylene glycol in the confine of a fume hood. Additionally, we designing a circuit in which produce enzymes that will degrade ethylene glycol into glycol aldehyde and then glycol ate. The glycol ate has the potential to be turned in to oxaloacetate, a metabolic intermediate in our device.

Bioplastic Synthesis: Pathway ▼
Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate P(3HB) is a polyester which is naturally produced inside bacteria such as Ralstonia eutropha, where it accumulates as granules inside the cell. In its native bacteria it is produced as an energy store (1).It's properties as a plastic has gained it the attention of researchers and industrialists. In our system, the bacteria will take up organic molecules from waste and use them for P(3HB) production.
We have made P(3HB) in E.coli, transferring three genes naturally found in Ralstonia eutropha into E.coli MG1655. These encode the three enzymes necessary for P(3HB) production; polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase(phaC), 3-ketothiolase(phaA) and acetoacetyl coenzyme A reductase(phaB). These are encoded by the pha CAB operon. We have altered the expression of these three genes to maximise the production of P(3HB) as high yields are required for it to be economically viable.

We used the pha CAB biobrick BBa_K934001 to produce P(3HB) which contains the native operon of Ralstonia eutropha. Inthe future we would like to see our system implemented at an industrial scale. This requires high yields to be economically viable. We created P(3HB) synthesis models to inform our experimental attempts to increase P(3HB) yield. We were especially interested to find out if up or down-regulation of any of the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway could increase yields. To analyse this, we needed to know the reactions in the metabolic pathway and also the relative parameters of the enzymes and their dynamic relationships in order to identify bottlenecks in the flux of metabolites. The results from the metabolic model suggest that the amount of pha B is especially critical and increasing its level should give us more P("

Further negative controls included testing the  reaction without enzyme or ATP. As a positive control to evaluate the method phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) was used. A time-dependent measurement of the aminoacylation  level showed that a maximum is reached after 30 min. To test if other tRNAs except for the tRNAPhe can be aminoacylated using our fusion construct we carried out  aminoacylation assays with five additional Escherichia coli tRNAs (Figure 6). The measurements suggest in agreement with previous studies that all tRNAs were loaded  similarly well.

Improve a brick
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are a most fascinating subject because of the huge amount of biologically  active compounds they produce that show a broad spectrum of clinical applications that even includes their use as  last resort antibiotics, antitumor or antifungal agents and immunosuppressants. These interesting properties especially  derive from the nonribosomal peptide synthetases unique feature to incorporate non-proteinogenic features such as  heterocycles, fatty acids, macrocycles, D-amino acids and other non-proteinogenic amino acids. Last years’ team of the university Heidelberg used nonribosomal peptide synthetases of Brevibacillus parabrevis in order to synthesize a tripeptide by  interchanging modules of an already existing NRPS cluster. The problem of previous applications such as these is  that the size of synthesized peptides is limited. Even naturally occurring peptides synthesized nonribosomally seem to  have an upper limit of 50 amino acids (Caboche et al., 2008). Therefore it would be great to establish a system that  uses these capabilities to introduce non-proteinogenic amino acids but is able to overcome the size limit of the  synthesized peptides. That is why we improved the brick BBa_K1152005 which contains the expression cassette for NRPS synthesizing a Phe-Orn-Leu-tripeptide. In RiboSURF, we improved the A-domain that activates phenylalanine (BBa_K1329005) in that  nonribosomal peptide synth"

Among the death-inducer we can find IPTG, heat, sucrose or arabinose [3]. There is research [6] suggesting that time could be also used as an inducer. This way, the expression of a lethal protein would happen after a determined number of cell cycles.
Although this biocontainment method avoids the problem of environmental supplementation, it does not escape from mutagenic drift and horizontal gene transfer. A genetic modification inactivating the toxic protein would not have any impact to the fitness of the cell and it would greatly be selected by evolution once the toxic protein is active in other cells. Due to leakiness of regulated promoters, an inactivating mutation in the toxic gene might grant a growth advantage even in the absence of the lethality inducer.
Orthogonal life: Synthetic Auxotrophy
The orthogonal life will be a result of the manipulation of the genetic code (the rules by which DNA is read), that will give place to an artificial language that the synthetic organisms will not be able to share with natural organisms. These modifications can be made both at the DNA level or at the protein level.
At the DNA level, artificial bases can be used, as well as artificial backbones with threose or glucose instead of deoxyribose.
At the protein level, synthetic tRNAs can be engineered to recognize unused codons such as TAG (non-sense codon) or to recognize quadruplet codons instead of triplets.
Although these alternatives are quite recent, there are already successful examples of using orthogonal life as a biocontainment technique. Mandell et al. (2015) [4] developed a mechanism called ""Synthetic Auxotrophy"" which consists of re-coding the bacterial genetic code so that the codon TAG can be assigned to an artificial amino acid, biphenylalanine (bipA). For this, a bipA-tRNA synthetase had to be engineered and introduced in the bacteria, so that bipA could be used by the cellular machinery.
Furthermore, essential proteins were engineered so they would require bipA in their amino acid sequence to be functional. The proteins were chosen so that their deficiency could not be supplemented by compounds in the environment.
The synthetic auxotrophy has several advantages over the engineered auxotrophy and the induced lethality:
Resistance to the mutagenic drift: Engineering proteins to require bipA for functionality means that several residues will have to mutate to render a functional protein that does not need bipA. Multiply the slim chances that a single protein mutates for"

Greetings!
Synthetic biology is all about putting engineering into biology. And I think there is a small engineer hidden in each and every one of us. As with the ever-increasing understanding of how the building blocks of the cell function and are put together, so is our capacity to redesign the building blocks and the way they are put together. This has immense potential, I guarantee it can change our society as much as the computer industry has the last decades. This summer, I will do my best to apply existing biological knowledge to hopefully solve a scientific problem, if even a very small one. I am currently in my third and last year in the bachelor program of molecular biology at Stockholm University. As I have not yet undergone any research traineeship or degree project, my time spent in the lab is limited. I therefore find this project as a tremendous opportunity to change that. What makes this even more fun is that my teammates are some of my best friends.

Hi!
My name is Mimmi, right now I’m finishing my bachelor in molecular biology.
I have always been fascinated by the origin of life. By how the genetic code can produce so many different life forms and make the organisms adapt to so many different niches and environments. Now, this competition is about using different traits nature invented and put them together to create new useful functions in an organism. I think this is an amazing way to study and learn more about the complex network of genes and at the same time produce a helpful organism.

Hi,
I'm a Masters student in Computational and Systems Biology at Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and a member of the Stockholm University team for iGEM competition. My first contact with iGEM and synthetic biology wasn't so long time ago. I got introduced to iGEM competitions in 2009. Then Synthetic biology attracted my attention and it became more interesting to me when I started to study about biological circuits and how these circuits are chosen by evolution. Here I will offer all my knowledge and effort to bring our ideas and plans into reality and solve the problem with a great success.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#MIntegration_-_-_TEXT.html," the delay can be linked to the presence of some external initiator such as IPTG.
A different type of cell can be made to initiate the signal. The helper plasmid in these cells would not contain the trigger which starts the delay. An externally triggered kill switch would allow these cells to be removed once the signal is propagating.
A further solution would be to simply take some cells from a culture where the signal is already propagating (although this raises a chicken-or-egg type problem ).
If the delay is long enough this will not be an issue. The requirement would be Delay Time > Culturing Time + Time for 1 Conjugation Event. This solution strictly limits the reset time available and is dependent on a very long delay.
Plasmid Stability
Plasmid stability in our system is an important factor, since the communication medium will only be able to select for the presence of the helper plasmid. R751 has its own plasmid partitioning system [4] so it will remain fairly stable, although this is not an issue since it will be selected for. The issue lies around the stability of the signal plasmid. We can not select for its presence since there will be both cells containing it and cells without it in the medium. Normally if the plasmid is lost there is not much that can be done, but the fact that we are using a conjugation system creates many interesting scenarios. If a cell divides and one of the daughters does not contain the signal plasmid that cell will still be surrounded by cells containing the signal plasmid and looking for receivers to transmit it to. The complication now arises due to the fact that the daughter cell has also inherited trbK entry exclusion protein. Until these significantly degrade, the daughter cell will not accept the signal plasmid from the neighboring cells. Unfortunately no data could be found on the degradation rates for trbK. What we can say is that if the degradation rate is high enough that the self destruction delay time remaining in the neighboring cells starting since the plasmid was lost is longer then the time for the trbK protein to degrade, neighboring cells will reintroduce the signal plasmid to the daughter cell at some point. The consequences of these effects remain to be determined. This is just one of many scenarios which can be envisioned involving plasmid stability issues. We look forward to addressing some of these issues experimentally once the communication system is functional.
Future Applications
We foresee many interesting applications becoming available once the full system is operational. These include everything from logic circuits to the generation of spatiotemporal p"

Our team has created an exploratory model of a metabolic pathway for the enzymatic degradation of TCDD. This model served as the foundation of our project design and the backbone for our lab work. We completed in depth research on enzymes families relevant to TCDD degradation, narrowing down contenders to the enzymes we would eventually use in the lab. While building this model, we utilized a multitude of tools including, but not limited to biochemical analysis, phylogenetic comparison and pathway mapping. Through these tools, we compiled a comprehensive list of enzymes, is strongly rooted in prior academic studies.
The final pathway we tested in the lab, consists of dehalogenase, dioxygenase and hydrolase enzymes. Additionally, Cyp 450 and Lignin Peroxidase enzymes were researched, enzymes have been previously found to breakdown TCDD. Despite that neither of these enzymes catalyze a specific step in the final engineered pathway, both are excellent candidates for TCDD Degradation.

Haloacid dehalogenase
Dehalogenases currently reported are involved in the cleavage of P-X and C-X bonds in the Brenda database. More than 90% of dehalogenases cleave C-X bonds. Such C-X bonds mainly exist in the halocarbons, halohydrins, and haloacids and their derivatives.  2-Haloacid dehalogenases are phylogenetically classified into two groups, those acting on L-2 haloacids, and those acting on D-haloacting on D-haloacids.1
According to the Fig. mechanism, a carboxylate group of the enzyme acts as a nucleophile to attack the a-carbon of L-2-haloalkanoic acid, leading to the formation of an"

Wunderlist
Conversation sharing of Google group became inconvenient as the project proceeded and our work became more and more complicated. So we chose to use Wunderlist at the same time.
Wunderlist is specifically designed for work arrangement. People in charge can create lists for their part of work and invite other users to help them with the work. Specifically, they can assign different members for different tasks and set deadlines. Other members can give feedbacks to the list after the corresponding work is done, and people in charge can delete the work from the list. Another advantage of Wunderlist is that it is available for all platforms, including PC and mobile phone. This way, all team members could receive the latest work notices.
During the project, we created lists based on our work, including iGEM-backend, iGEM-frontend, iGEM-wiki and iGEM-finance, etc. Complicated assignments were distributed to different people. We also used the feedback service of Wunderlist to monitor the work progress. The use of Wunderlist enabled us to assign tasks in a scientific way and keep us informed of the progress of our project all the time to make sure that everything goes according to the plan.
OneNote
For every team, the financial problem is a big one. Of course, you may think of separating money and account easily, but how do you keep two or more financial managers in the same stage? We chose to solve the problem by OneNote.
OneNote is originally designed for instant creation and notes sharing, and so it can be applied to financial management smoothly. We could create notebooks according to different items and mark the accounts that have been cleared or have not yet been cleared. By inviting others, the team leader can supervise the manager about he financial situation timely and make sure about the accuracy of this.

No matter you are in what stage of what project, when you need new thoughts, it is always quite a hard time to get a satisfying result. Brainstorm might be a really nice idea, but in most of the time you have to stare at a whiteboard full of messy ideas on it without action. To solve the problem, you need some kind of software for thought assistance, such as Omni Outliner and Mingmap.
Software like Omni Outliner can help you sort out all the necessary points and arrange your thoughts when you are writing articles, and software like Mindmap"

This year, we collaborated with Team BGU Israel who were working on a kill-switch mechanism. Team BGU had sent us their pUC57 cI plasmid ( BBa_K354000 ) that contains CRB resistance and a cI repressor gene with a Lac/Ara-1 IPTG inducible promoter. The promoter is induced by arabinose and IPTG, while glucose represses it. The cI protien is a repressor for both, holin and lysozyme (toxins) genes which are part of the self-destruct mechanism that was devised by Team BGU. As long as there is cI protein in the cell, there is no expression of the toxins - therefore the cell stays alive. In order to better understand the behavior of this system, it is important to characterize the promoter in regard to how IPTG, arabinose, and gluose concetrations and the induction time have impact on the amount of cI protein the cell synthesizes.
In agreement with Team BGU, we had planned to carry out a HPLC and a bradford colorimetric protein assay in order to determine the cI protein concentration inside the cells.
Unfortunately, we were not able to complete the measurements with their parts because due to long delivery times their parts shipping arrived only shortly before Wiki Freeze.
Nevertheless we were able to help each other out with the planning and execution of the characterization of some parts. We thank the Team BGU for their efforts and the good conversations and hope that this collaboration will continue even more successfully next year!

GFP as a Proof of Principle
We designed the first GFP-Sporobead to evaluate our system and compare different constructs.
This short time lapse video shows the formation of a spore.
To ensure that our Sporobeads show fluorescence on their edge and higher than in wildtype spores, we analysed the microscopy pictures. The following graph (Fig. 6) shows these microscopy pictures and analysis of the strongest of the five constructs integrated into wildtype strain (B53) and the deletion strain (B70).
Fig. 6: Result of fluorescence evaluation of the three strains W168, B53 and B70. The bar charts show the average fluorescence intensity over 100-200 spores. For image analysis we measured the fluorescence intensity of an area of 750 pixel per spore by using ImageJ and evaluated the results with the statistical software R. The 3D graphs illustrate in one spore the distribution of fluorescence intensity across the spore surface.
As shown in Fig. 6, the wild type spore has hardly any fluorescence, whereas both Sporobeads with the integrated construct  pSBBs1C-PcotYZ-cotZ-2aa-gfp-terminator give a distinct fluorescence signal around the edge of the spore. Furthermore, it demonstrates that strain B 70 has the highest fluorescence intensity. For more detailed information have later look at our DATA page
In summary we successfully developed functional Sporobeads that are capable of displaying any protein of choice on the surface of modified B. subtilis endospores.

[1] In the bulk-production, we estimate that the cost of a single device will decrease to 30$
[2] For sale, we suppose that 75$ for a single device is proper, since we can also provide maintainance for users
The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.
Degradation tag is a useful part in synthetic biology. It can be attached to any protein and then help engineer controllable protein degradation. This year, to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K133"
Toronto,2015,Team:Toronto#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," if autoclaved together.
Part 2.  Autoclaving ONLY DONE BY EXECS
Lightly seal the top of the bottles with aluminium foil, or unscrew the caps. Label both with autoclave tape. Include a label with SOC – your name – date - iGEM 2015. Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following steps 2 - 5.
Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the bottles into the autoclave room. Remember to store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for approximately 20mins.
The contents of the bottles will be hot after autoclaving, therefore take necessary measures to prevent burns. After autoclaving, allow the media too cool to 55oC before handling.
Part 3
This part should be done in room WB303, in sterile conditions close to a bunsen burner.
In a sterile environment, slowly add the autoclaved 1.802g glucose and dH20 to the beaker containing the autoclaved 1.016g MgCl2 and 1.234g MgSO4, 10g tryptone, 2.5g yeast extract, 0.292g NaCl, 0.093g Kcl and dH20. Flame the lip of the bottle before transferring the contents. Swirl to mix, and seal tightly to prevent contamination. Flame the cap before sealing.
The SOC broth can be stored in sterile conditions at room temperature, and should be good for a 3-4 months. Flame the lip of the bottle each time the SOC is used. SOC should be handled carefully, as it is especially prone to contamination.
SOC Leaving the Lab
Prior to leaving the lab, you should:
Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
Wipe down your workspace.
Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly stored in the fridge.
