Objectives
We wanted to understand how society perceive GMOs in the world and where our project Softer Shock will be more suitable to be develop. Our goal is to share and communicate a maximum of information to know how GMOs work around the world in an attractive, objective and funny way. The map was designed with the help of iGEM teams through surveys (go to “Dialogue and Education” to see the survey analysis) to respond to society’s need for information and to be open source to everyone (researchers, entrepreneurs, iGEM teams, and the general public).
The first step to creating these surveys was to identify the key issues through a review of current sources of information on GMOs addressed to the general public. The second step was to translate the survey into several languages with the help of friends and family and distribute it around the world.
Several iGEM teams helped us to distribute the surveys in their country. Thanks to them we collected answers from all over the world and got more than 100 responses from key countries such as Mexico, France, Spain, and Brazil. We used these four countries to gauge the major needs of a society with respect to GMOs and develop a general approach for other countries.
The results also reflect the historical and current-events context in health, environment, and agriculture sectors, as well as reactions of regulations and safety directives in place in these countries.
We reviewed the GMO safety and application regulations in 6 countries: Spain, France, Mexico, Brazil, China, and USA. We didn’t"

She had fabricated countless equipments, including clothes, shoes, magic tools and even antipersonnel weapons and so on. Still it was just because she had a red hair that she called herself as the Flame Angel. She always dreamed to save the universe! When she was still immersing into brimless daydream, the siren attached to Little Dot rang up.
“Too naughty…the little guy…Never know where it escapes to!”
Summer accelerated her flying device, which looked like a firefly. Summer steered slowly, watching the ground carefully. ”Oh, it’s here. It’s not far from the house, but why can’t it be back? Wow, who’s that boy?” Summer landed slowly.
“Summer, I’m here!”
“I’ve just caught you. Why do you stay outside so late? I’d better prepare a procedure for you to make sure that you can come back home on time straightforward.”
“Okay…don’t be angry, darling. Look! That’s the little prince.” Little Dot introduced its new friend to Summer, with a little sulkiness.
“He is sleeping. It approaches the time for sleep state. Hey, wake up!” Summer pushed the little prince.
“Go to my home for a break, okay?”
“Ah… thank you.”
“Is this you plane? It seems unlike.”
“I call it as ‘the Firefly’. I just thought an insect was beautiful during my tour. Then I pictured it so that I could design my plane as its appearance. It’s so lovable. Ha-ha, I love it!”
“By the way, I’m Summer. Hello, little prince!” Summer was always so lively. Maybe there was no worry for her in the world. Her happiness seemed completely opposite to the melancholy of the little prince.
“May you stay here longer? I’d guide you in our planet. You must have traveled for a long time in the universe. Stay here to relax. I can help you restore your body too.”
“Summer is really cruel indeed! There are really a lot of pretty places in our celestial.” Little prince aspired.

NCTU_Formosa,2012,Team:NCTU Formosa#Project-sub2_-_-_TEXT.html," The accumulated non-toxic intermediate would be converted into the final product , isobutanol. Therefore, producing an efficient method to obtain the excellent biofuel.
Figure 4.Two circuits of our biobrick of temperature control system.
Figure 4 shows our biobrick. The most important gene of our biobrick is 37°C ribosome binding site gene. There are two circuits in our biobrick. The first circuit is the one encodes 37℃ ribosome binding site gene and the second circuit is the one that encodes kivD gene.
Now, let us introduce how our system works.
Figure 5.The system works in the 37℃ environment.
When being in 37°C environment, the first circuit will be translated and produce TetR protein to inhibit Ptet promoter. So, the second circuit will not be translated. Therefore, we can obtain the intermediate , 2-ketoisovalerate , at this step. (Figure 5.)
Figure 6.The system works in the 30℃ environment.
After having enough of 2-ketoisovalerate , we move E.coli into 30°C environment. This way, the ribosome will not bind the 37°C ribosome binding site and tetR genes will not be translated. Therefore, the second circuit will be translated successfully. In the end , we can get the isobutanol efficiently. (Figure 6.)
Result
Figure 7.Activate our E.coli overnight. Then, transfer it into the new medium with the microaerobic environment until OD600 reached 0.2. After that, measure the OD600 every 4 hours.
We did an experiment to prove the isobutanol is truly toxic to the E.coli. The data shows that the higher concentration of the isobutanol was in the medium, the lower OD600 value could be obtained. (Figure 7.)
We used the fluorescent protein to mark the second circuit of our biobrick. The data tells us that kivD enzyme under 37℃ environment had the lower expression than under 30℃ and the 25℃ environment.
According to Figure 8, our low temperature release system do truly work !

High Fidelity PCR"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," levels were compared to a synthetic GFP construct in an E. coli chassis as a positive control and a non-fluorescing E. coli device as a negative control. The E. coli cells were grown in SOC media at a neutral pH over 24 hours, at 37ᵒC and 220 rpm. Error bars represent standard error.
TOP10 E. coli grown at 43ᵒC, pH 7 in LB had the highest overall level of GFP expression at 1.31x106 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 8.65x104 AFU/OD600 which was during the stationary phase of growth at 20 hours. The second highest overall level of GFP was expressed by BL21 at pH 9 in 37ᵒC SOC media at 1.27x106 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 7.24x104 AFU/OD600.
Conclusions
The results from this investigation confirmed that the presence of sequence scars within synthetic gene constructs have a negative impact on the expression of downstream products. Gibson assembly proved to be the optimum DNA assembly standard, producing a gene construct that had no sequence scars and had the highest expression of downstream products. It was additionally the simplest and least time-consuming manual assembly method. The optimum conditions for the expression of the GFP reporter gene were 31ᵒC LB growth media, at pH 9 using a BL21 E. coli chassis. However, there were some anomalies and unexplained outcomes from the different combinations of variables and these optimum conditions were found to differ from the optimum conditions for the growth of the E. coli chassis.
This research provides the foundations for the development of automated, high-throughput methods of DNA assembly and characterisation of genetic circuits, which will lend itself to a wide range of beneficial applications. There are several competing standards for constructing DNA parts into circuits with various requirements and disadvantages but there has been relatively little previous research into the direct effects of different DNA assembly methods on the expression of genes. Therefore, these findings provide a valuable contribution to a plethora of future developments within the field of synthetic biology.
Further Work
Reporting accurate measurements is crucial, but can prove a challenge. Device operation is often measured against optical density, but this can be affected by various factors, such as the plasmid copy number and variable cell count. The Interlab study used standards such as Ludox and fluorescein, which help standardisation across various labs and instruments, but do not account for natural variation. In order to combat the difficulty of reporting measurements accurately, we decided to design an"

Additionally, to enable steady growth for our technologies market, we will be engaging with key industry players in Alberta’s oil sands production and monitoring market.  Finally, we will be actively engaged in raising capital to continue all stages of development from accelerators, corporate partners, grants, and private investment.
Year Three
By year three we see our oil sands monitoring technology expanding from the prototype stage to a fully functional product.  This will involve considerable engineering and product design to meet industry needs and to ensure reliable and robust detection in varying environments and climates. To this end we will begin the transition from prototype development to meeting the challenges of mass-manufacturing of the technology involving the assessment of manufacturing partners, development of our production facilities, and distribution components.  In tandem, we will begin initial development of sensing elements to detect other compounds in markets outside oil sands monitoring.
Within this time period we see our initial product having moved through the necessary regulatory hurdles in both Canadian and American markets.  These regulatory approvals will help act as both a competitive advantage and to hasten the development of second and third generation monitoring solutions.  At the same time we see our first demonstrations of our system in an oil sands monitoring setting which will be closely followed by our first sale to key industry players who we began engaging within year one. Finally, to continue enabling this rapid development we will have accelerated our strategy of raising capital to include engaging with angel investors, customers, and government grants.
Year Five
Moving into years four and five, we will have seen our first sensing system move into a mass-produced product following our first demonstration and sale.  Our goal will be to begin capturing a growing share of the sensing market in the oil sands monitoring market over these two years (moving toward our goal of 30% market share). With the first product entering the market we will pivot to diversifying the sensing ability of our technology.  This will involve accelerating the development of new sensing elements begun in year three.
By diversifying our technologies applicable markets with new sensing elements we aim to begin entering markets outside the oil sands industry. In deriving these new sensing elements we will apply a similar framework of patenting, trade secrets and legal agreements to protect our intellectual property. To meet our growing capital needs and our goals for growth into new markets we will leverage next stage of capital investments from venture capitalists and revenue from our initial sales.

In this way, they can reduce the cost of heat treatment to eliminate the                                 bacteria before the emission to the environment. Besides, they raised a                                 question about the distribution of inhibitor proteins as well as the plasmids.                                 The random distribution may also lead to the signal delay, which inspire hot                                 discussion among our team members. These considerations give us                                 more possibilities to perfect our project and expand our project into industry production.
The company’s manager said that plasmid instability was really a troublesome problem and encouraged us to polish our project. The staff also complained about the complex processing of pollutions containing antibiotics. All those words came to expand our                                 background and reminded us of the emergencies of unlimited use of antibiotics.
Questionnaires
To further investigate the issues of antibiotic-use and the public                                 acceptance, we chose Internet survey method among scientists,                                 researchers, common students of BIT and general public to collect information of theirs opinions to iGEM,  our project,  plasmid losing problem and antibiotics. We finally gathered 324 valid questionnaires in the end.
Part of the results and questions are shown in fig.7.
From the results, we can say:
a) Over 96.11% of people think iGEM is of help to every iGEMer, 54.77% of them think this competition can improve students’ ability widely;
b) Over 92.72% of people have ever noticed the plasmid-losing problem, 54.27% has been affected by it seriously;
c) Over 95.76% of people is concerned about the use of antibiotics, 69.01% of them think antibiotics are very harmful, and should be treated cautiously;
d) Over 92.93% of people show interests in our project, 54.77% of them would like to try our plasmid-free system in their experiments.

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," that the coding sequence contains only ""fast"" codons. This GFP was designed as one of five variants we optimized at the codon level using different criteria in order to develop a novel method for codon optimization.  Traditional methods of codon optimization rely primarily on the distinction between degenerate codons that are common throughout the entire genome of E. coli and those that are rare. This GFP was optimized instead using only degenerate codons that are more frequent in higher translation initiation regions of the genome, ie fast codons. This criterion is based on the results of a recent project in which all the coding DNA sequences of E. coli are divided into five groups based on the naturally occurring TIR, from lowest to highest. Then, the codon usage profile of each group of genes is statistically analyzed to determine whether a codon is slow or fast. A fast codon is defined as one with high correlation between TIR and its frequency. Otherwise, it is a slow codon.   Ng, C. Y., Farasat, I., Zomorrodi, A. R., Maranas, C. D. & Salis, H. M. Model-guided construction and optimization of synthetic metabolism for chemical product synthesis. Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center Spring Retreat (2013), Berkeley, CA. It is hypothesized that the groups of CDS with high TIR will hold more “fast” codons, which will lead to higher translation elongation rate and thus higher protein expression, whereas the slow regions will hold more “slow” codons leading to lower expression.
Codons whose frequency increases with TIR are defined as fast codons. Those with declining frequency in relation to TIR are slow codons, and those with no correlation are defined as independent of TIR. This can be viewed in the figure above as the slope of the graphs for each codon showing ratio and TIR. If ratio increases with TIR, the codon is fast, and the graph displays positive slope. Slow codons slow negative slope, and TIR independent codons show essentially no slope.

The science behind the project
Martian soil is contaminated with a toxic compound, perchlorate, making human life on mars impossible. For our project we use bacteria, which contain a perchlorate reduction system, to eliminate perchlorate from Martian soil. There are several bacteria that can already reduce perchlorate, one example is Dechloromonas aromatica . In this research we use the model organism E. coli as a host for perchlorate reduction. Using E. coli has multiple advantages. Firstly, a lot is known about E. coli which makes it a preferable host to work with in the lab and in practise, for example a bioreactor. Secondly, E. coli grows easier and faster on less complicated resources which is not trivial when in outer space. Thirdly, the iGEM library is extensive when it comes to E. coli parts, making it favourable to use E. coli as a chassis for multiple functions including perchlorate reduction. This way a combination of genetic changes can easily be achieved to produce the workhorse for martian colonization. Fourthly, E. coli is also a Gram-negative bacterium like Dechloromonas aromatica and the process requires a periplasm, making other hosts such as Bacillus subtillus not an option.
-Since E. coli does not contain a perchlorate reduction system, our goal is to transform E. coli with genes encoding for the perchlorate reduction system derived from Dechloromonas aromatica .
Previous studies have shown that bacteria can behave radically different under microgravity. In our research, we do not only focus on building our genetic biobricks, but also on their function on the place of destination. Martian gravity is different from zero gravity and the gravity on earth. The impact of Martian gravity on E. coli and its capacity to express the build in parts are tested using an random positioning machine (RPM). The bacterial growth under normal gravity and the gravity on mars are compared.
-Since not much is known about gene transcription and bacterial metabolism under Martian gravity, our goal is to investigate differences in expression patterns of genes using the RPM and RNAseq.
Introducing perchlorate reducing genes into E. coli DH5α
We aim to introduce the genes coding for perchlorate reduction in the E. coli DH5α strain 1 . The genes responsible for perchlorate reduction were synthesised by IDTDNA and codon optimized for E. coli K12 by their Codon Optimization Tool. With these genes perchlorate reducing bacteria"

1.2 Procedures of Experiments
     1.2.1 PCR Proliferation
        Due to high content of G-C base-pairs in target gene segments, GC Buffer is required in PCR proliferation. Refer to Takara's protocols to prepare 200μL of system: 100μL of GC Buffer, 16μL of dntp mixture, 4μL of sense primer, 4μL of anti-sense primer, 4μL of DNA templet, 2μL of Taq, and 70μL of H2O. 60°C-70°C is used for Gradient PCR, the sixth bad is the brightest (Figure 9) thus the temperature of such is best for annealing. In new system, PCR is proceeded in that temperature; finally we get the gene segments with gene linkers.
    1.2.2 Gel electrophoresis, purification
    1.2.3 Digestion
        Put NotI and NdeI restriction endonuclease in gene segment and vector pET-28a respectively.

Panama,2011,Team:Panama#TheTeam_-_-_TEXT.html," working in this field.
Research Interests: Life understanding through evolution is my passion. I am an undergraduate student in Biology oriented in microbiology. I have been working those few years with the biology of the fungus growing ants as intern in the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Here in the department of behavior and evolution I start my travel into scientific research, studying how ants interact with microorganisms, how ants work against diseases, evolution of profilactic behaviors in the fungus growing ants, simbiosis, antagonism, co-evolution, bacterias, fungus, antibiotics, ecology are terms with that I have been familiarized. The development of engineered biology became one of my interest when I was studying microbial genetics, the manipulation of DNA brings to us a full knowledge of how life works and I am really interested to be involved of this kind of investigations.  Now with iGEM, the Synthetic Biology appears to me as one step further of biology engineering and I am doing a complete diving in biotechnology techniques with the aim to learn how to design and modify biological systems. I will keep studying and working in this field because it leads us to the full application of biology as a substance.

Overview
Overview
Cells sense the environment, process information, and make response to stimuli. To make cells work well in complex natural environments, lots of processes have to be preset to react to various signals. However, when well-characterized modules are combined to construct higher order systems, unpredictable behaviors often occur because of the interplay between modules. Another significant problem is that complex integrated systems composed of numerous parts may cause cell overload.
We proposed an elegant method to design higher order systems. Instead of merely combining different functional modules, we constructed one integrated processing module with fewer parts by utilizing the common structures between modules. The circuit we designed is a rewirable one and the topological structure of the processing module can be altered to adapt to environmental change. The basic idea is to rewire the connections between parts and devices to implement multiple functions with the help of the site-specific recombination systems.
Based on the design principle we put forward, we built two circuits to verify our idea. Each circuit has three modules including an input module, a processing module, and an output module. The input module receives environmental signal and triggers the rewiring of the processing module. The output module monitors real-time processes using fluorescence intensity.
Our design approach may lead to a revolutionary step towards system integration in synthetic biology. Potential fields of application include organism development, living therapeutics and environment improvement."

We also researched methods to isolate the genomic DNA of bacillus subtilis in order to extract the gene for subtilisin savinase. To do this, we obtained a PureLink Genomic DNA mini kit from the Johnson lab at BYU and will follow the outlined procedure to isolate the bacterial DNA of b. subtilis. We started a 1 mL overnight of b. subtilis in regular LB media broth and left in the 37° shaker overnight.
We also attempted a test run with our biofilm assay to wash the biofilm per the protocol without significantly disturbing the biofilm The attempt was not successful, any attempt to wash the biofilm caused complete disruption of the biofilm and detachment from the well walls. We will research this problem further to see if we can find a solution.
6/5/13
Our SLB was contaminated so we made 500 mL of new SLB. We also obtained fresh Lysozyme to be able to prepare the Lysozyme buffer needed for the PureLink Genomic DNA mini kit to purify/extract DNA from bacillus subtilis.
We also heard back from the Lyons-INSA iGem team. They are currently prepping for finals and will be unable to send us a sample of iGem part BBa_K802001 for about a month. Once they are finished with finals we can contact them again to have them send the part. We are looking into other teams that we might be able to get this part from.
6/7/13
We prepared our lysozyme buffer using the following protocol:
The final buffer should be:
25 mM Tris-HCl - pH 8.0
2.5 mM EDTA
1% Triton X-100
To create 25 mL total buffer volume, we used:
0.0985 g Tris-HCl
0.125 mL EDTA (0.5 M)
0.25 mL Triton X-100
To 200 uL of the buffer, we added fresh lysozyme to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL lysozyme.
We also streaked a new cholera plate and prepped new cholera overnights.

Grinnell,2011,Team:Grinnell#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with TCA, run on a 6-18% polyacrylamide gel, and silver stained. Results show that proteins of the expected size were secreted from the following strains: both DspB and Esp constructs with Pxyl inducible promoter and chimeric Esp with promoter BBa_K081005 .
Figure 3. Relative S. aureus biofilm growth after treatment with different engineered Caulobacter strains (three letters abbreviation for constructs: B for BBa_K081005, R for PrsaA, X for Pxyl, O for optimized, W for wild type, E for Esp,  D for DspB, and CC for WT Caulobacter crescentus). Relative biofilm growth is calculated by subtracting the ODmean of S. aureus only treatment from the OD of each well.
Compared to S. aureus only treatment, most of the other treatments had significantly lower biofilm growth (p<0.001) except XOE construct (p=0.743) and wild type Caulobacter (p=0.085) treatments show no significant differences from the S. aureus treatment. Notably, the ROD construct induced S. aureus biofilm formation to some extent, which is worth further investigation.  The failure of XOE is explainable: xylose, the inducer of the Pxyl promoter of this construct, is usually consumed by the cells after 4h but we incubated cell cultures with xylose for more than 24 h. Therefore, Esp was not likely being produced during the biofilm inhibiting step.
The inhibition effect on biofilm growth of different proteins, the efficiency of different promoters and the expression level of wild type Esp and optimized Esp in Caulobacter were also compared among constructs.
Figure 4. Here the standard group was composed of S. aureus only and WT groups. Both DspB and Esp can inhibit the biofilm growth. Though not statistically significant, the biofilm assay data showed a general trend that Esp, which is known to target S. aureus biofilm specifically, has a better inhibition effect than DspB, which is generally targeting most biofilms.
Figure 5. All promoters were working great in Caulobacter. No significant difference among three promoters were shown.

Workshop for the Finnish International Biology Olympiad team
The International Biology Olympiad (IBO) is a competition organized for talented high school students who are interested in biology. The team is selected based on a national exam that any high school student can participate in. The next event is held in Iran, in 2018, and the team training began in early August, 2017. After the team had gained some laboratory experience in Aalto University laboratories, we gave them two presentations: a presentation about our project and another about Mathematical Modeling in Biology. The topics that we covered were history of computational biology, logic ports in the context of biological systems, ordinary differential equations and a case study of dynamically modeling differentiation of T cells. We hope that our presentations were interesting and useful to the team and wish them the best of luck in the Olympiad! Our presentation slides can be found from here .
Turku
Our last visit before the Giant Jamboree was at the University of Turku where we organized an event 19.10.2017 with Eva-Mari Aro, Pauli Kallio and Eevi Rintamäki. We presented synthetic biology, iGEM and our own project as a lecture, where the main point was to get the students and teachers enthusiastic enough to form Turku’s own team in the future, since currently we are the only team in Finland. The event was promoted to bio students by Pauli Kallio and one of our sponsors, The Union of Professionals in Natural, Environmental and Forestry Sciences Loimu. We provided a flyer to help promoting. Since Turku city actually has two universities, there might also be a possibility that the University of Turku might form a team with Åbo Academi. Only time will tell.
We discussed with a few very interested teachers and some of the students seemed also pretty intrigued by the idea, so hopefully this attempt will prove successful in the future. We shared some of the Biotech Week balloons, collaboration postcards and patches at the"
ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Circuit#Fb MRI Contrast Agent_-_-_TEXT.html,", this can lead to a visible change in contrast. [8]
Bacterioferritin is one of the three forms of ferritin-like proteins found in bacteria. It has been shown that overexpression of bacterioferritin in E. coli Nissle 1917 can lead to a visible contrast change in MRI, which allows for visualization of the bacteria (Figure 2). [7]
Bacterioferritin and CATE
In our design, we make bacterioferritin a reporter of passing through Checkpoint 1 . Once enough bacteria have colonized the tumor and overproduction of lactate has been sensed, the AND-gate of the Tumor Sensor is activated. This leads to expression of the MRI contrast agent and the Anti-Cancer Toxin (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Bacterioferritin in our system. Once the Tumor Sensing has been activated, both the Anti-Cancer Toxin azurin and the MRI Contrast Agent bacterioferritin are produced. Azurin will accumulate inside of the bacteria until it is ready for release. Bacterioferritin will take up iron and produce a change in the T2 signal in MRI.
While the Anti-Cancer Toxin will accumulate inside of CATE until it is ready to be released during Cell Lysis , the MRI Contrast Agent will take up iron and create a change in the MRI signal. The change in the signal will alert the doctor of the following:
the bacteria have colonized the correct location,
there are enough bacteria to produce a full dose of the Anti-Cancer Toxin , so the risk of sub-dosing and eventually producing a drug-resistant tumor is minimized, and
the Anti-Cancer Toxin , located on the same plasmid and under the control of the same promoter as the MRI Contrast Agent, has started to accumulate.

Figure 6: Sensitivity analysis for the binding efficiency parameters of squalene epoxide and lanosterol synthase binding. The more complex that is formed (towards yellow), the more fluorescence will be produced. An optimal value for both parameters can be seen, whereby increasing this value has no significant effect on the fluorescence.
From Figure 6, it can be seen that there are optimal values for both parameters where increasing them has no effect on lanosterol formation. This was further investigated by looking at each parameter individually and the effect on lanosterol formation over time. Consider the effect of \(\lambda\) by setting \(v_{0}\) and \(\gamma\) as the suggested values, (Eq 7) and (Eq 10) .
Figure 7: Complex formation with increasing binding efficiency, defined by parameter\(\lambda\). Increasing complex formation will correspond to increasing fluorescence and in turn allow us to visually detect squalene. The optimal value allows us to calculate the minimum binding efficiency that gives maximum results.
Figure 7 suggests that the concentration of lanosterol does not increase after \(\lambda = 0.28\). Therefore if the value of \(\lambda\) is smaller than the suggested value, \(\lambda = 0.64\), but larger than \(\lambda = 0.28\) the same concentration of lanosterol will be formed. Recall that \(\large{\lambda = \frac{K_{1}SE_{0}}{K_{2}}}\), therefore the initial concentration of squalene epoxide or the binding ratio can be less than the suggested value from literature. The effect of \(\gamma\) on lanosterol formation can be considered by setting \(v_{0}\) and \(\lambda\) as the suggested values from literature, (Eq 7) and (Eq 10) .

Increasing complex formation will correspond to increasing fluorescence and in turn allow us to visually detect squalene.

Haemin Cho
Team Leader
Haemin is a second year student majoring in Biotechnology. She is one of the two leaders of this year's HKUST iGEM Team. In the lab, she works diligently and is very helpful when needed. But most of the times, she looks blank-minded and often makes small careless mistakes. Her trademark quote is ""What did I just do? *blank face*""
BONGSO, Nadia Benedicta
""She is one of the rare team member that does not major in Life Science, she is a year 2 student majoring Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering(but still, Bio is involved). She is one of the 3-man Indonesian gang, which contributes to most of the noise in lab. She is indeed very helpful in the lab, such as helping to fill boxes of tips just after a few hours she landed in HK. She also helped much in Human Practice work.  She is quite absent-minded about her iPad, luckily she does not forget her lab work. She LOVES people calling her surname, and she really likes Hong Kong Disneyland.""
Jordy Evan Sulaiman
Jordy is a year two student majoring in chemical and bimolecular engineering. He is hard-working, diligent, and creative. He also likes to eat, play basketball, and play computer games. Above all, he likes Doyle the most. Though Jordy is very funny, sometimes he can be extremely serious when doing something. The scary part of Jordy is that he is good at everything, even arts. Everyone likes Jordy.

The biological networks are highly nonlinear and exhibit interesting phenotypical behaviour for certain operating conditions. One of such behaviour is the limit cycle in the  mathematical sense, which shows a sustained oscillations of protein levels in the cell. It  is quite interesting as well important to look for topologies which can produce such oscillations for different amplitude, oscillation and shape. Here, we have used a theoretical framework to begin with, for identifying topology based on following theorem.
Then, if the Jacobian of f and x has no repeated eigenvalues and has any eigenvalue with positive real parts, then the system must have a consistent periodic orbit.
To design a squarewave oscillator, we used the theorem to idenify the biological system which can satisfy such condition. One of classical example is Repressillator (Elowitz et. al.) or 5n1 ring oscillator (Murray et. al.). This kind of oscillator is based on negative feedback with delay and able to produce stable limit cycle computationally and as well as experimentally. However, these oscillators are more of a phaselag oscillator matching the sinusoidal umbrella behavior. As philosophy behind our work is to design  square wave, we exploit the system parameters to produce relaxation oscillations. The relaxation oscillator typically works on the principle of level of concentration, where once the level is reached it relaxes there for some additional time and falls back to another level and resides there for some till it jumps back (slowly). The time evolution of such trajectories portray a square wave-ish in state-space.
The dynamical model of the five node oscillator can be written as;
where i ∈ [0 = 5, 1, 2, 3, 4"

Flagellar Filament Model
Introduction
Our plan to display flagellar filaments on the yeast surface consists of mainly three steps:
Display flagellin monomers on the yeast surface.
Put the yeasts obtained in step one in a solution with sufficiently high concentrations of flagellin monomers and certain anions (known as good “salting-outers”) to promote spontaneous nucleation on the yeast surface.
Transfer the yeasts obtained in step two, which have flagellin seeds on their surface, to a new buffer with physiological ionic strength and pH that also has a sufficiently high concentration of flagellin monomers. Under this condition, the flagellin seeds on the yeasts’ surface will elongate into flagellar filaments.
If we want to use this system to display enzymes, we only need to fuse the desired enzymes (often along the same chain of reactions) with the flagellin monomers, and then the obtained yeasts from the above steps will have a much larger number of enzymes displayed on it than ordinary yeasts.
We shall give a brief explanation of the above design. First note that although there is a lot of literature about Salmonella flagellins but very little about E. coli, for safety reasons we can only use E. coli flagellins in our design. However, since the flagellar polymerization of Salmonella and that of E. coli are very similar (Kondoh and Hotani, 1974), we can transfer some of the previous results concerning Salmonella flagellar filaments to E. coli.
Lino (1974) gave a review of the assembly of Salmonella flagellins in vitro. There are several characteristics worth noting. First, in vitro assembly is possible even when the flagellin seed is attached to a cell body, which confirms the fundamental validity of our design. Second, the assembly of flagellins in vitro has two steps, nucleation and elongation. Nucleation forms the seeds upon which elongation takes place. Under physiological ionic strength and pH, flagellin monomers can grow on seeds to form flagellar filaments, but they cannot nucleate into seeds. Spontaneous nucleation can only happen in the presence of"
Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," peptide attached to the SUMO fusion.
Unstructured Peptide (USP) Construct
In the second approach, we designed a peptide which can be functionalised using chemical approaches. This peptide was designed to have flexible, unstructured arms and was termed the USP construct. Unlike the Magainin 1 star, the arms of this peptide serve not as active peptides themselves, but as inert structural linkers.
The arms were designed with the following elements in mind:
Lack of structure. The arms were designed with a bioinspired approach, using the FxFG motif of nucleoporins (where x is a variable amino acid residue). Such segments naturally repeat in nucleoporins and are thought to lead to disorder/lack of stable secondary structure. Nucleoporins are found in mammalian cells, serving as flexible brushes around nuclear pores (Ader et al., 2010).
Water-soluble. The arms were designed with several charged amino acids to improve solubility.
Designed to form a disulfide bond. Although it is difficult to rationally ensure that the disulfide bond will form between two cysteines in our peptide, we incorporated a beta turn between the two cysteines which may encourage the peptide to fold at the apex of the hairpin loop. This may bring the cysteines into closer proximity, providing more probable bond formation.
The ultimate utility of this peptide lies in its ability to be functionalised with other biomacromolecules. For example, the technique of Native Chemical Ligation(NCL) can be used to join peptides, proteins, and other ligands to the arms (Dawson et al., 1994). The idea of attaching enzymes to the star peptide was explored by the University of Oxford iGEM 2014 team in a collaborative effort between our two teams (See Supplementary Project Work at the end of this page).
 
Expression system
In order to successfully express our constructs, we designed our protein expression vectors to include a fusion protein. The fusion protein was necessary for two reasons. First, some of our constructs are very small (e.g. the non-star Magainin 1), and expression levels of very small peptides can be difficult without a fusion partner. Second, two of our constructs code for antimicrobial peptides. Without a fusion partner, it is likely that these genes would be toxic to their hosts upon induction.
To find a suitable expression system, we looked towards the Registry of Standard Parts. We used the SUMO protein expression system designed by TU Delft 2014 (for example, see http://parts.igem.org/wiki"

Our Project
In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.

The plastic waste problem is an issue that already has a great environment detriment records and always a hot topic to discuss about, especially in “Go Green” concept that is currently being developed. Many alternative solutions have been proposed to solve this problem; however, the solution has not been completely effective. Therefore, ITB_indonesia team is eager to make a quick fix through the idea of plastic bottle degradation. ITB_Indonesia team was highlighted by some media, both online and printed media, okezone.com, detik.com, and fokus magazine.
Through the media facilities, ITB_Indonesia team hopes to provide an alternative solution for handling plastic bottles waste as well as introduce the synthetic biology to people.

Unlike our previous activities where the theme circulates around synthetic biology and biosafety, we were invited by         the UCCKE team to share our iGEM experience and general approach on how to design an iGEM project to high school         students. After the sharing, a few high school students actually planned to join the iGEM in future!
For an easier brainstorming method, we introduced “Top-down Design” using summer vacation planning as an example, which         is to build a system at hierarchical level (from large to small). We also mentioned some important issues that they         should pay attention to. For example, biosafety and fundamental knowledges of synthetic biology.

As Jamboree is coming close! We were also prepared to showcase this year’s HKUST iGEM project to the public in Hong         Kong. InnoCarnival is a great platform for us to do this as it combine different projects across different universities with the theme of modern innovation.
We had an interview from the South China Morning Post prior to the InnoCarnival where we could share our iGEM experiences         and ideas. In the booth itself, we had our handmade DNA cloning model, as well as our project’s animated video for         better visualization and understanding.

Submitted a BioBrick consisting of CpxR under Arabinose Promoter ( BBa_K1486001 ). Reporter sfGFP was fused to CpxR's N terminus ( BBa_K1486002 ) and C terminus ( BBa_K1486005 ), to evaluate the expression of our construct and characterize the Arabinose promoter in E. coli.
Submitted four BioBricks coding for CpxR fused to one of the two fragments of the split reporter Infrared Fluorescent Protein (IFP1.4). Fragments IFP1 and IFP2 (corresponding to the N and C terminal of the IFP respectively) were fused at the N or C terminal of the CpxR, leading two four different constructs: CpxR-IFP1 ( BBa_K1486012 ), CpxR-IFP2 ( BBa_K1486013 ), IFP1-CpxR ( BBa_K1486014 ) and IFP2-CpxR ( BBa_K1486015 ). Sequences are under arabinose promoter. These Biobricks are construction intermediates to build our four final constructs below.
Submitted four BioBricks, which are the final constructs of the IFP subproject. Each BioBrick codes for two proteins: CpxR fused to IFP1, and CpxR fused to IFP2. The different combinations with the split at the C or N terminal of CpxR lead to four constructs: CpxR-IFP1 & CpxR-IFP2 ( BBa_K1486056 and BBa_K1486008 ), IFP1-CpxR & IFP2-CpxR ( BBa_K1486009 ), IFP1-CpxR & Cpxr-IF"

Overview
Because of the specialty of our project, we mainly serve iGEMers and synthetic biologists. Via BioMaster, they may find the information they need in an easier way and save more time on the searching for information. We collaborated some iGEM teams and sent our database to them. Some teams indeed need a more convenient way to search and they gave us their feedback to help us further improve our project.
UESTC-China
(University of Electronic Science and Technology of China)
UESTC-China offered many helps in the construction of our project. At our ‘Preliminary investigation’ stage, we communicated with them and they told us their needs for a new biobrick database. When our project has formed into the internal test version, they gave us valuable feedback. Their feedback has become one of the basis for our further adjustment.
We also worked with USETC-China to validate the effects of our predictor. They provided us with the FRE sequence, then we predicted this sequence, and performed promoter optimization to remove unnecessary part. They constructed plasmids with predicted promoter, then transferred it to the host DH5α. The verification proves that the predicted promoter is very likely correct. What’s more, we helped UESTC-China by using our database BioMaster. UESTC-China needed some statistics aiding their experiments, so we recommended our database and they found what they need.

Original function: To decrease germs in minor cuts and scrapes. (This method is created by an unknown individual, so it dose not have any authoritative guarantee.)
III Our Solutions
The current solutions that enumerated above all have several defectives, which make them not the best solution to choose. But with our Pesticide Mate, all these drawbacks could be overcome. Unlike the commercially chemical insecticide, with the help of E. coli and three different enzymes that it produced, we can dissolve the solid shell of scale insects without doing any harm to the plants.
How Did We Design It?
We are inspired by verticillium lecanii, an amazing bacteria that can produce enzymes(chitinase & protease) to degrade scale insect’s hard shell. After being amazed by this, we thought that maybe we can design a kind of genetically engineered E.coli to provide these enzymes. In our design, our engineered bacteria work as a knife which breaks the surface of scale insect, and the ‘sucrose-induced enzyme release’ system makes sure that these enzymes would not harm other plants. Also, we transformed our bacteria into powder that can be easily used by the famers. We have instructions (see our modeling) for them to cultivate the bacteria to certain stage and then spread the solution to the plants suffering scale insect.
IV Our Project's Advantages:
1. Environmental-Friendly!
- It won’t do any harm to the environment. Comparing to chemical pesticides, it is clear that our biological Pesticide Mate would be much easier for the environment to degrade.
- Besides, since our Pesticide Mate would break the hard shell of the scale insects and cause damages on shells, it would be much easier for the pesticide to pass through. Although our Pesticide Mate cannot kill scale insects directly, it can decrease the amount of a huge amount of pesticide use.
- Imagine how much will the soil suffer if a huge amount of pesticide is used, and how serious will the problem be. It is clear that although people might stop their suffering of scale insect problem, the soil actually suffers more. Since chemical pesticides would have a long-term effect on the environment, it is critical that our Pesticide Mate can decrease a huge amount of pesticide use when killing scale insects.
2. Plants & Human-Friendly!
- Because of our “suicide design” inside our E.coli, E.coli that are unfortunately dropped onto the plants will kill themselves instead of causing any problem.

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#Modeling#diffusion_-_-_TEXT.html," are replaced by its approximations as finite differences, resulting in a system of  algebraic equations. This is solved at each node $(x_i,y_j,t_k)$. These discrete values describe the temporal and spatial distribution of the particles diffusing.
Although implicit methods are unconditionally stable, so time steps could be larger and make the calculus process faster, the tool we have used to solve our heat equation is the Euler explicit method, for it is the simplest option to approximate spatial derivatives.
The equation gives the new value of the pheromone level in a given node in terms of initial values at that node and its immediate neighbors. Since all these values are known, the process is called explicit.
$$c(t_{k+1}) = c(t_k) + dt \cdot c'(t_k),$$
Now, applying this method for the first case (with no wind consideration) we followed the next steps:
1. Split time $t$ into $n$ slices of equal length dt: $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{c} t_0 &=& 0 \\ t_k &=& k \cdot dt \\ t_n &=& t \end{array} \right. $$
2. Considering the backward difference for the Euler explicit method,  the expression that gives the current pheromone level each time step is:
$$c (x, y, t) \approx c (x, y, t - dt ) + dt \cdot c'(x, y, t)$$
3. And now considering the spatial dimension, central differences is applied to the Laplace operator $\Delta$, and backward differences are applied to the vector differential operator $\nabla$ (in 2D and assuming equal steps in x and y directions):
$$c (x, y, t) \approx c (x, y, t - dt ) + dt  \left( D \cdot \nabla^2 c (x, y, t)  - \nabla \vec{v} c (x, y, t)  \right)$$ $$ D \cdot \nabla^2 c (x, y, t) = D \left( c_{xx} + c_{yy}\right) = D \frac{c_{i,j-1} + c_{i,j+1} + c_{i-1,j } + c_{i+1,j} – 4 c_{I,j}}{s} $$ $$ \nabla \vec{v} c (x, y, t)"

La propagation des phages dans le système sanguin.
Le déplacement ‘’’en X ‘’’ dépend, uniquement de la ‘’’propagation des phages ’’’ dans le vaisseau grâce au débit sanguin. En effet, on néglige la diffusion qui a lieu également selon l'axe X car elle est 1000 fois inférieure à la propagation des particules dans le sang (liée à l'importance du flux sanguin). Les vecteurs cellulaires se déplacent à différentes ‘’’vitesses réparties de façon parabolique’’’ allant de, Vmax au centre du vaisseau, à V0 contre la paroi du vaisseau.
Les vitesses des phages phages diminuent en se rapprochant des parois du vaisseau à cause des forces de frottements qui s'opposent au mouvement.
On peut donc déterminer en combien de temps la particule ayant une vitesse Vmax, c'est-à-dire la particule au centre du vaisseau, en atteint l'extrémité. On obtient ainsi le temps nécessaire à l’internalisation de tous les phages d’une bactérie .
Haut de page
La diffusion à travers les parois des vaisseaux sanguins
Le déplacement en Y représente la diffusion du phage dans le sang (j(n)). Il dépend de l'équation de la diffusion d'une particule (n) dans un fluide (Loi de Fick).
Avec n, le nombre de particules ( phages ), grad n, la différence de concentration et D, le coefficient de diffusion.
La diffusion des vecteurs cellulaires à l’intérieur du vaisseau sanguin puis à travers la paroi est un phénomène de diffusion avec sortie. Par conséquent, il y aura toujours un fort gradient de concentration du phage dans le sang. On peut donc dire que le gradient est constant (et égal à 1) au cours du temps. Ainsi la vitesse de diffusion (j(n)) est égale à D.

It was easy to tell that due to great possibilities in this field, the topic had fully aroused students' interest.
Then we led the topic to the key of our project – cancer therapy, which ended with a debate held among students, arguing whether it was proper for the patients to choose euthanasia when little chance was left for them to be cured. Discussion went to the extent of ethic and legality, reason and emotion, ideas got exchanged and the understanding to cancer went deeper.
""I support euthanasia, because I believe it is valuable for the patient and the society. As far as I knew, terminal disease sufferers such as patients with advanced cancer always endure enormous pain, some of who even take in Morphine or other drugs to reduce it. At that stage, even the relatives of the patient want to end his life for his sake while the idea was held back by the law.
I think life is our own thing, and our relatives and we have the right to choose what to do with it.""
""I don't agree with the former one.
I think introducing a new law which allows the euthanasia will end up with chaos. Believe it or not, people of ill will might make benefit from this, for it's hard to define in which situation it is allowed to execute euthanasia. Even if we finally define it properly, what if the patients' choice on euthanasia results from impulsion instead of careful consideration? There are lots of things left to be resolved. I just don't approve that it should be admitted now and then.""
""I also come up with some important things of euthanasia to mention.
First, executor, the job itself, is hard to perform, for euthanasia executor will be under great burden mentally when facing with all the death they handle.
Also, they might be accused because of the loophole in law.""
""I think it's better to introduce law of euthanasia as soon as possible.
The previous views on law might be reasonable, but they ignore the fact that laws are growing. If we don't try it at first, progress will never happen and we won't have an advanced law anymore. Just waiting won't change anything.""

For this part of the product development process, we counted with the support from Gustav Notander, our finance advisor and Technology Transfer Manager at KTH Innovation. Gustav was involved from the beginning in the development of our project and we are very grateful for Gustav’s help with our product development structure and how to execute our work.
On this picture you can see Gustav together with Amanda and Sonia, working on PROlung’s Business Model Canvas.
Conclusion and future steps
We in iGEM Stockholm 2017 believe that our project PROlung and lung probiotics are the future, and we aim to be the pioneers in this field. To be able to do so, we spent over six months conducting a detailed product development research, in the spirit of entrepreneurship, including and analyzing all aspects in to ensure PROlung has a place and purpose on the market.
In this search we always kept the final customer of our product in our minds, taking into account their concerns and opinions at all times. In the end were able to characterize what makes our product have the competitive advantage over the rest and to draw the path that our product would need to go through if it was ever to be developed.
If we took the decision to develop this product further, the next steps to follow we would be to file a provisional patent application and start contacting regulatory authorities. These two movements would assure that our product would be able to take a leading position in the market if it had regulatory approval.
Once enough data about pharmacokinetics and toxicology was collected, trials in animals could start, and if animal safety was proven, the next step would be to apply for an Investigational New Drug Exemption in order to conduct clinical trials with our product.
Only if these trials are successful, reimbursement strategies and business models would need to be taken into consideration. In the end, once regulatory approval is taking its lasts trials before being granted, a specific marketing plan would need to be developed for this product. As any other therapeutic product, during this stage patient groups, doctors would need to be targeted in order to make market entry successful and start having a return on the investment made.

1.     Construction of the plasmids
  We constructed five plasmids-pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-6s; pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-2s; pHAGE-pre-miR-21; pSB1C3-miR-21-sponge-2s and pSB1C3-miR-21-sponge-6s. The plasmids of pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-6s and pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-2s were used to monitor the expression of miR-21 in cells. We also used pHAGE-pre-miR-21 to manipulate miR-21 expression in cells. And the plasmids of pSB1C3-miR-21-sponge-6s and pSB1C3-miR-21-sponge-2s were submitted to 2017IGEM (part number: BBa_K2514000 and BBa_K2514001).

We provide few basic parts which are used in our Detecoli, including BBa_K2383001 and BBa_K2383010 .
BBa_K2383001
This chromoprotein from the ""Cnidopus japonicus"" sea anemone, cjBlue, naturally exhibits dark green color when expressed. Compared to some other chromoproteins, such as amilCP (
BBa_K592009
), amilGFP (
BBa_K592010
), spisPink (
BBa_K1033932
), asPink (
BBa_K1033933
) and aeBlue (
BBa_K864401
), the color development is slower. The color is readily observed in both LB or on agar plates after 24-48 hours of incubation. The sequence is codon optimized for expression in ""E. coli"". We add a LVA tag after protein, then proteinases will more likely yo break it down, and wull thus make it degrade faster.
BBa_K2383010
LacI without LVA tag
These two are the basic parts we use in our project.
BBa_K2383003 (PcsiR1)
We are NOT the founder of this promoter. It’s Rice University that come up with it. PCsiR1 is a promoter for UirS and UirR. It is a more effective promoter, compared to Plsir, according to the researches Rice University had done. All credits belong to Rice University. Learn more from the link
We had a difficult time finding the sequence of this promoter, and we don’t want the future team to fall into the same problem in the future. So, here is the sequence of the promoter. Length 109"

Almost fully differentiated SHSY5Y, day 15
Already after 3 days clear differences and a strong increase of cell-cell connections become visible, which allow a prospect in which direction the differentiation will develop. The strengthening neuronal character is well recognizable.
The differentiation is completed after 20 days. 2 days longer than our protocol provides. These are large clusters of cells that look very similar to neuronal primary cell cultures. The accumulated strands of dendritic compounds are also clear, even if it can be assumed that no functioning network has developed. Nevertheless, the morphological transformation of small, irregular tumour cells into huge cell networks spanning the entire well is impressive.
In conclusion, it can be said that our differentiation functions excellently.

Chemistry
The goal of the chemical part of this years project was to alter the sodium channel blocker Eslicarbazepine so it would bind to the light chain of the detoxified Botox. The Synthesis was executed after the following schematic plan.
Schematic reprasentation of the stepwise chemical alternation of the eslicarbamizine.
The step-to-step execution of the synthesis can be found in our labbook. For the first step of our synthesis, we achieved a satisfying yield after testing two different reaction pathways. Mass spectroscopy, as well as NMR-Analysis, showed that the exchange of the carboxy group with a thiol group has been successful. The yield was determined to be approximately 40%. The second step of the synthesis was executed simultaneously with the synthesis of the azide-donor necessary for the last reaction. After some experiments to alter the reaction, we were able to successfully synthesize the azide-donor. The drying of the azide-donor was critical, as the donor decomposes in vacuo and under mild heat. As it’s a non-explosive and air-stable salt, maybe drying it in a desiccator could be a solution. Nonetheless, the Donor is unstable as long it’s not completely dry and must be handled with care. But by using the sulfate salt, the reaction became much safer. The normaly used chloride salt should not be utilized, and the sulfate salt is an easy to make, shock-resistant alternative.
Draft of the sythesis of the azide-donor.
After executing the second reaction step the analytic results indicated that no reaction took place. Mass spectro"

The great advantage that comes with these template pages is that it is much easier to maintain the wiki afterwards. Any member of your team can edit the wiki page without bothering about HTML and the layout of the page. Just let your team members know, that they always have to leave the first and the last line of code on every wiki page since these lines import the templates. Furthermore, with very little effort, the navigation can be changed by editing the page "".../Templates/Navigation"".
The extensive use of templates is not only an advangtage to the every day usage, but also in the process of building the wiki. For example, if you want to add a new banner, you just have insert an <img src=""...""> tag in the corresponding template and after saving the templates all your wiki pages will contain this new banner.
Customize and style your wiki
So far be we created the backbone of your wiki by using templates and a table layout. Besides, every teams wants to have their only style. However, in the case of an iGEM team wiki, the normal way of change the look and feel of a wiki does not work. This is due to the fact, that all teams share one big wiki and changes done to the layout will change all other team wikis as well.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"!!!!! :-) This means that we can prepare another biolector run, this time having all the planned constructs. But first we need to transform pIGR05 into a strain containing pIGR03, and pIGR06 into a strain with pIGR04.
We haven't been able to verify pIGR12, so we will do another attempt tomorrow.
We also did another experiment with Salmonella, but unfortunately this failed. We transformed pIGR03 and pIGR04 into Salmonella strains containing the antirepressors under the control of a pBAD promoter. Cultures were launched from the transformed colonies, and after having reached an OD of 2, some culture was transferred to LB+arabinose. The arabinose should induce the pBAD promoter causing expression of the antirepressor, again causing induction of the prophages, and de-repression of the repressor in the pIGR03/pIGR04 constructs which would finally result in GFP detection. We did indeed see lysis of the cells, but unfortunately no GFP expression could be measured when using the fluorometer. This result indicates that our plasmids produces too much repressor for the antirepressor to de-repress.
Lastly, we registered all our biobricks in the partsregistry, and sent them all to the iGEM headquarter.

Seemed like some of the cultures neither grew in the O/N cultures nor on the re-streaked plates, so new colonies were picked in order to have the 24 needed cultures for BioLector measurements.
Once these had grown to what seemed to be exponential phase, OD was measured using Nanodrop and amounts of cultures needed for BioLector were calculated. This followed by aliquoting the calculated amounts of the cultures (which apart from the new cultures, were in stationary phase) into fresh LB media in order to let them grow from ~ exponential phase and measured using BioLector; each culture was ran in duplicates.
After the BioLector was started, we planned out the next set of measurements to run tomorrow which would be of SPL+RFP, J23100+RFP, J23101+RFP and J23116+RFP. O/N cultures were started of these combinations and will be ready for tomorrow's next BioLector run; the chosen colonies were also re-streaked for future reference.

Cell membrane in particular, appears to be damaged and significantly affect cells viability. Its fluid bilayer structure was originally stabilised via Van der Waals forces and hydration repulsion, which is severely weakened by lose of water [7] .Package default will occur during rehydration process because the regular arrangement of phospholipids is disrupted during dehydration, and this cause leakage of cellular components [9] . Dehydration brought severe decrease in viability of the cells after rehydration and cells’ resilience seems to be a major concern.
Protection by adding protective agent
Three main protective strategies can be envisaged to maintain their Viability after dehydration:
Change the process parameters, like lowering the temperature, or pressure within certain range [10]
Pre-stressing the cell prior to drying, which induces their own protective stress responses [11]
Add protective agents.
Saccharides(e.g. Sucrose, lactose, trehalose) [12,13] is one of the most commonly used protectant and was proved to be efficient in improving resilience of cells, several correlated mechanisms have been proposed. Trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide of glucose, have been widely accepted as a long-time protectant. However, cost of production is significantly increased by artificially adding trehalose, and we are hoping to find a suitable substituent for it.

We ligated those parts to 1C3 backbone and transformed them. Unfortunately, the cells we used the first time were not so competent anymore and the transformations didn't work. So, we repeated the transformations with Bioline cells and let them growing on the bench over the weekend.
After using pSB1C3 for the ligations, we were running short of the backbone to use as template for ligation PCR. So we streaked plates from glycerol stocks, pick colonies and ran miniprep on the other day. Then, we ran a RD, pcr clean up and quantified it.

Part 4Biosafety System
Abstract: With the advent of synthetic biology, genetically modified microorganisms are being increasingly used for bio medical, industrial and environmental applications. Deployment of these engineered microbes in large scales and open environments calls for the development of safe and secure means to restrain their proliferation. An alternative approach to biocontainment is to use gene circuits to maintain essential gene expression or block toxin gene expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions.
This summer, we added mf-lon ssrA tag into 5 essential genes by using CRIPSR/Cas9 technology. By applying gene circuits to control mf-lon protease expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions, we can blocks essential gene expression to kill the cell upon loss of the biocontainment signal.
☞☟ 
Key Achievement
Designed kill switches which could couple a specific input signal with cell survival.
Designed a orthogonal system in E. coli in which mf-Lon protease can specifically recognize and degrade 5 essential proteins with mf-ssrA tag.
Design of biosafety system
Pioneering biocontainment systems used metabolic auxotrophy in which target cells could only grow in the presence of an exogenously supplied metabolite, and the recent creation of an E. coli strain with an altered genetic code enabled production of synthetic auxotrophy strains that require an exogenous supply of non-natural amino acids for cell survival.
Traditional metabolic auxotrophy strains are hampered by the potential for inadvertent complementation by cross-feeding or by the presence of the metabolite in heterogenous environments, and synthetic auxotrophy systems rely on extensive genome-wide engineering that may be impractical for many industrial production and"

UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,") using Dr. Wichelenki's criteria, we managed to narrow it down to xylose and tagatose. After another round of consideration, we ultimately decided on tagatose because of its recent traction on the artificial sweetener market.
Another additional benefit was the length of the biochemical pathway
It confirmed tagatose was good because it was a shorter biochemical production pathway that required fewer enzymes and produced fewer intermediate metabolites
Point 4: Closer Look at Tagatose
Rationale
At this point, we had identified tagatose as the primary source. Although it would not really impact our carbon source selection, we decided to get a deeper understanding of the appeal for tagatose. It would be prudent for when scientists and other individuals questioned us about the rationale for our overall design. Therefore, we turned to Richard Alejandro, director of the Bay Area chapter of the American Diabetes Association .
Exploration
Although Mr. Alejandro was impressed with our idea in the broadest terms, he admitted that his position gave him more credibility to discuss the tagatose and its overall appeal. He also suggested that despite recent traction of tagatose in the artificial sweetener market and its Generally Regarded as Safe status, public perception should become an important factor in our decision. He also gave us helpful advice in constructing a public questionnaire and administering it in an unbiased way as to avoid introducing bias and error into our assessment .
Deliberation
We decided that it was important to carry out a public survey for the sake of thoroughness; thus, the first step was to determine the questions that we were going to ask and word them in an unbiased manner. This was extremely important because individuals were already likely to have a negative bias against genetically modified organisms and any approach with GMOs.  In addition, we had to decide the appropriate medium for the survey to be effective. Thus, we decided to administer it at the Pleasanton Public Library in August, and used the results to assess the efficacy of our approach. Public perception suggested that 37% of individuals were comfortable with our xenobiotics approach and tagatose biosynthesis mechanism; however, only 30% of the respondents were familiar with tagatose and wanted more information before backing our proposal.
Point 5: Discussion for Organism Choice
Rationale
At this point, we had selected the carbon source for the implementation of the ROBUST method. However, we were struggling to decide as a team on which microbe to use for exporting the tagatose metabolizing pathway. Therefore, we turned to Pengfei Gu, part of the pHD program at Washington"

IIT_Kanpur,2018,Team:IIT Kanpur#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"d2) are known for Ecoli through literature.
 
Since SdsA1 (alkyl sulfatase) a extracellular enzyme, it was essential to understand effect of secretion efficiencies of our enzyme from Ecoli cells, in order to determine concentration of SdsA1 in the media, which would be needed to model our enzyme substrate kinetics in order to understand SDS(Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate ) degradation.
 
We tried to model our protein secretion using a empirical secretion law used by iGEM Stuttgart 2017 team.
  
 
rsecretion : secretion rate
[enzyme] : enzyme concentration
s : secretion efficiency
t : time
 
Here the secretion efficiency is a value between zero and one.
 
Since reliable data on expression of SdsA1 and its extracellular expression in Ecoli was not available we concluded that our model could only provide a qualitative understanding various factors on these.
 
 
 
Fig 1.Simbiology implementation of our Model
Fig.2 Effect of secretion efficiency on enzyme production        Fig.3 Effect of promoter strength on enzyme production
­­­___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Enzyme Kinetics
 
We use the simple Michaelis-Menten formula to describe our enzymes’ kinetics.
    
 
Here, Vmax represents the maximum velocity achieved by the system, at maximum (saturating) substrate concentrations. KM (the Michaelis constant; sometimes represented as KS instead) is the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is 50% of the Vmax. [S] is the concentration of the substrate S.
 
Our enzyme (E) being SDS, substrate S being SdsA1 and P being our final product 1-Dodecanol.
Here k1 is rate of forward and k-1 being rate of backword reactions and k2 being rate of product formation.
In terms of specific Michaelis-Menten reaction, these constants are quoted in the literature as:
We assumed an average SDS concentration of 5-10 mg/L in domestic wastewater discharges.

Fig4. Our SDS biodegradation chemostat illustration.
 
In order to understand if our project could be implemented in a real world we decided to check its economic sustainability by trying to estimate the yearly cost of operation of our bioreactor.
 
To do so we implement a model based on previous model developed by iGEM 2017 Manchester team who were trying to estimate cost of chemostat operation for cleaning Phosphate in wastewater.

Mix the ingredients of the running gel and pour the solution quickly (gel starts to polymerize once TEMED has been added) into the gap between the glass plates. Leave enough room for the stacking gel – appr. 1 cm below the bottom of the comb´s teeth. After a minute you can overlay the solution with iso-propanol or ethanol. This excludes the access of oxygen and plane the surface
After polymerization, pour off the iso-propanol and rinse with distilled water. Mix the reagents for the stacking gel and pour it on top of the running gel till the space is completely full. Then insert the comb. No alcohol overlay is needed due to the comb.
After polymerization clamp the gel into the electrophoresis apparatus and fill it with running buffer. Remove the comb carefully and use a pipette or syringe to wash the wells with running buffer.
The protein samples (up to 15 µl) are mixed with SDS loading buffer (2.5 µl) and incubated for 10 min at 95°C.
After heating briefly centrifuge the samples to spin down the condensed water.
Then you can apply the samples on a SDS PAGE with a pipette or Hamilton microliter syringe. Do not forget to add molecular weight marker in one lane.
Run the gel at 80 V until the front has moved into the running gel. Then you can increase the voltage to 120 V. Run the gel until the running front has reached the bottom of the running gel.
Pry the plates apart by using a gel spacer. The gel can then be stained (Coomassie staining, method 56 or Silver staining, method 57) to visualize the separated proteins or processed further (Western Blotting, method 58).

Project Name:Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Project Abstract: Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Synthetic biologists are the next rockstars! Not just me who’s saying that, according to wired.com : ""biologists are the next rock star designers""
Theater or cinema?
Cinema, because it’s for young people. I will engineer my own genes to stay forever young.
What did you work on during the project?
I worked very hard in the lab during the summer, designing and executing the CRISPR strategy for the insertion of the URA3 gene. I helped plan and host a lecture during our BioBrick tutorial, and helped supervising the high-school students in the lab.

MSc. Biotechnology, 3rd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
iGEM is an once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity to be a part of an ambitious team and to develop a project from scratch to the final jamboree in Boston and hopefully contribute to the synthetic biology community.
If you had 50.000 DKK to spend in two hours, what would you spend them on?
I really enjoy traveling the world, so I would definitely use the money to go traveling somewhere! I would probably book a trip to Australia since I have never been there before.
What did you work on during the project?
I was involved in planning and executing our BioBrick tutorial, and was in contact with Novozymes. I worked during the summer in the lab on knocking out PEX10 using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in Y. lipolytica

Outreach
Through our interview process, we realized that many of the diverse experts that we interviewed didn't know too much about synthetic biology.  The goal of the outreach part of our project was thus to interface with a variety of different audiences both within our city and outside it.  We also wanted to do this in a more interesting and engaging way then your typical outreach initiative.  We had five main activities this summer.  We targeted youths in the city, through our video game and the minds in motion science camp.  We targeted an older audience through our spark science centre evenings.  We interfaced with industry and our sponsors through our Genome Alberta blog series.  Finally, we looked to a broader audience through the development of our Ted talk for the upcoming City 2.0 event.
What did our Outreach activities entail?
LAB ESCAPE Videogame
We ventured into new territory this year by developing a video game centered on synthetic biology called LAB ESCAPE. As scientists, we are often asked, “What exactly do you do all day?” Our video game provides an opportunity to educate and entertain the player by guiding them through a routine experiment used by the iGEM 2012 Calgary team.

Our Team
Our team, made up of 11 high school students,
has gone through many tests, as we all started with a small foundation of freshman Pre-AP Biology. Through from the hot days of summer to the crunch times in October, each member has dedicated their time and energy towards the project in order to make it work. Due to the common goal and the amount of time we have spent together, this team is closer then we would have ever otherwise been.

This project also provides an open framework, where other iGEMers can extend our current functionality and collaborate with us to further develop the user interface too. Hence, in subsequent years, the cost of the project will remain almost constant at $700, but it will have better and better software support.

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," 2014, too. We believe that our result are more precise and our model match reality better, since more samples were used in our experiment.
Modeling
    Basing on our experiments, we finally establish three model to support our results of experiments. In our light-control model, we research the light input model and the AND Gate Model. The light input shows the relationship between the previous light intensity and the output of the Ccas/R system by varying the production rate of sfGFP, p (t), and the sfGFP abundance, g (t).
     And our logic Gate Model use the mathematical equations to simulate the AND relationship between the concentration of T7 mRNA, I1, and the concentration of two input substances (In our system, Arbc.), I2.
    Our infiltration model shows how important role our microfluidic plays in our experiment. We derive a formula to express the influence of the main channel’s current speed in our oscillation model by analyzing the fluid dynamical process and get an ideal result.
    Inflating model provides a foundation for our oscillating model, which is the most important basis of our experiments. With the guidance of our pre experiment, we choose the internal AHL concentration to represent the expression of GFP. Basing on the biological reaction process above, we derived the following set of delay-differential equation model for intracellular concentrations of LuxI (I), AiiA (A), internal AHL (Hi), and external AHL (He).
    In our models, we finally get an oscillation period about 3h which can be controlled by the current speed in microfluidics. In our light-dependent experiment, the optical response time is nearly 3h, which supplies the proof of the interconnection between the oscillation and light-dependent control.

The formula has not been thoroughly test and the correlation between OD and CFU is low in for our data. Generally the formula overestimates dilution. Therefore we suggest that both 10d and 10d-1 are plated. A future solution to the problem could be to introduce a calibration constant to the right hand side of the equation. The constant can be fitted by rerunning the experiment with more samples.

Characterization
We characterized BBa_K1333108 as part of the genome wide mutators BBa_K2082116 and BBa_K2082117 .    Our characterization is based on reversion assays , showing the mutation rate of dnaQ926.
Figure 1: Mutagensis rate of dnaQ926 ( BBa_K2082116 ) and M6 ( BBa_K2082117 ) determined by reversion assays. A plasmid carrying a stop beta lactamase was used as a reporter for the mutators. Revertants were counted, normalized on viable cell count and used for calculation of the mutation rate using mutation accumulation (Pope et al., 2008).
Furthermore, we determined precise dnaQ926 mutational spectrum via high-throughput sequencing .

This means that for very low levels of \(3\alpha-diol\) and NADP, the reaction is similar to Michaelis-Menten. In reality, the reaction will increase the levels of both substrates, so we cannot assume the entire reaction is similar to Michaelis-Menten, rather only the beginning of it. As we'll see later, this correlates with our wet-lab results for varying concentrations of DHT.
Compatibility with Michaelis-Menten reversible reaction:
If we assume both cofactor levels are saturated, and are high enough so that the reaction of the enzyme does not change their level much, we can treat them as constants:
\[\begin{array}{l}\frac{{{V_{{m_f}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {NADPH} \right]}}{{{K_1}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}}{{{K_s}}} - {V_{{m_r}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {NADP} \right]}}{{{K_2}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}}{{{K_P}}}}}{{1 + \frac{{\left[ {NADPH} \right]}}{{{K_1}}} + \frac{{\left[ {NADPH} \right]}}{{{K_1}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}}{{{K_s}}} + \frac{{\left[ {NADP} \right]}}{{{K_2}}} + \frac{{\left[ {NADP} \right]}}{{{K_2}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}}{{{K_P"
