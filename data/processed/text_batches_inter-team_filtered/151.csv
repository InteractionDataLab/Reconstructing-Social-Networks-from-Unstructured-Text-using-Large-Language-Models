Then they all went in the shaker (shaking) for 20 minutes, and then OD600 and GFP readings were taken.  A preliminary GFP reading was taken while we were getting the concentration up to double, to check for background fluorescence, and found that the GFP wasn't that high yet. Actual numerical results are in an Excel sheet in ""HSP Experiment-7/21/14""     7/22/14: (Devora)  We poured 2 1.5% gels to use tomorrow  We purified the PCR of the output backbone that had Dpn1 added to it and the nanodropped. We have 47.7 ng/uL and 50 uL.      7/28/14:  We ordered new primers for the input backbone. So we ran a PCR with them on UV and HSP#1 + pACYC184. We used 5uL 1000x dilution of plasmid, 2.5uL water, 2.5uL forward primer, 2.5uL reverse primer, and 12.5uL Q5 McMaster Mix. The settings were:  init denat: 95  300  denaturation: 95  30  annealing: 50  30  extension: 72  300  final extension: 72  350  cycles: 30     7/29/14:  The new primers were run on a gel and it looks like HSP#3+pACYC184 had a band indicating that the input backbone had been amplified. See ""New input PCR gel 7/29/14"" for the photo. We used an annealing temperature of 50 so there were some other bands, but we believe it was amplified correctly as well. So we digested that with DpnI (added 21uL water, 5uL CutSmart, and 1uL DpnI directly to the PCR tube, 37 for 40minutes and 80 for 20 minutes) and then split that into two tubes to digest with KpnI and XhoI (25uL PCR stuff, 3uL CutSmart, 1uL KpnI, 1uL XhoI).  We also digested with KpnI and XhoI the output backbone that we had previously PCR amplified and treated with DpnI."

Digital Inline Holographic Microscopy - An iGEM Approach
Our project aims to construct a low cost Digital Inline Holography Microscope (DIHM). The DIHM features an ease-of-use, lens-less inline structure, and a state-of-art reconstruction algorithm from holograms to 3D visualization with micrometer resolution. The working principle of a DIHM starts with a point laser source, emanating spherical waves, illuminating the object to be observed, and forming a magnified diffraction pattern at the image sensor, followed by reconstruction algorithms. The holograms collected by the image sensor already contain the difference of intensity and phase shifts, compared with the reference part of the spherical wave. Thus, the inline structure without the need of a lens or beam splitter. Our project uses easily accessible hardware components: Huawei P9 lite flashlight as a light source, a 5 µm pinhole, a Pi-cam and a Raspberry Pi for taking pictures, and certain 3D printed parts to assemble the microscope. The open source library HoloPy is then deployed to reconstruct the 3D volumes from the holograms.
Introduction
Digital inline holography microscopy is a special technique to recover object properties from interference patterns. We will explain the working principle in greater detail later on, but first let us show the basic properties of our DIHM setup in a short video. The light coming from a bright LED passes a pinhole, which acts as a spatial filter and emits spherical waves. At small samples, e.g. yeast cells, the wavefront is scattered. Small fringes are created. The unscattered waves serves as reference template. The interference pattern is captured on a camera screen.
The resulting hologram contains the phase and the intensity information, encoding the 3D model. We present  an 'easy-to-use' interface for a commonly used analyzation package in our software section . First, we invite to check-out what we could achieve and then how to get our own DIHM.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#HumanPractices#EducationandEngagement_-_-_TEXT.html," with the innovative idea to create a Virtual Reality (VR) laboratory training environment. In this way, we want to innovate in education for highly interactive, less expensive and more encompassing laboratory preparation. The idea started with one of our team members who had relatively little laboratory experience because this is an expensive component for the education programs. We went into our own lab to measure everything, from the height of the benches to the dimensions of the pipet tips. In figure 1 you can see the result, our lab in real life and in virtual reality compared. We can make people experience our project with an app. Try it out yourself at our stand in the Exhibition Space during the Giant Jamboree. If you can’t wait, you can already take a look at our video shown below!
Figure 1. Left: our lab, right: our VR lab
Advantages of our Virtual Reality Laboratory
There are several more good reasons for VR development in laboratory education that prompted us to develop this, amongst which:
Diverse safety measure incorporation
To identify the usefulness of VR for safety training we had a talk with Erwin van Rijn, the safety coordinator at the Bionanoscience Department of the TU Delft. He recommended to focus on general lab training for beginning life science students. In this training we incorporated safety procedures, which can be extended in the future.
Less dangerous
Fellow students sometimes complained to us that during their first times in the lab they would not always exactly know what they were doing. Therefore, beginning students might experience difficulties with exactly determining the risks involved in every procedure that they carry out. Even though this is what we always try to overcome by good preparation, practicing in the lab is often different. Therefore, practicing in VR is a good opportunity better evaluate the risks involved in real life laboratory practices.
Costs
A talk with the program coordinator of Nanobiology at Delft University of Technology, Serge Donkers, revealed that laboratory education is highly expensive, partly due to the extra laboratory space and equipment that is required. Therefore, often this type of education is kept to a minimum to reduce costs. VR could change this to prepare young researchers better for the future that is awaiting them.
Less waste
Students learn laboratory skills by practice, which means many petri dishes, pipet points, but also chemicals are wasted. With VR, power is used, but much plastic as well as chemical and biological waste is saved.
Teachers can easily and on the spot observe their students’ progress
In VR, teachers can track individual progress and add personal challenges from a distance for optimal learning curves.

Pour into the casting tray (it is easy to assemble the casting but a way to difficult to discribe), put the comb and wait until it polymerizes
To run the gel:
Take out the comb and place the tray with your gel into the electrophoresis chamber (usually already filled with buffer) so that your wells are nearer to the cation, red side.
TBE 1x buffer should be covering the tray, add more if needed
In a PCR tube mix ~10µl of your sample with 1.5µl of loading solution (quantities indicated may vary with the sample concentration )
Load about 5µl of your sample (this quantity varies with the thickness of the comb used and DNA concentration) and DNA ladder onto gel, taking care not to diffuse it and not to displace the gel
Place the cover, red wire to red side and inversely, plug it into the tension/current generator
On the generator set for voltage: constant mode 80V and time: 60min   (faster run with higher voltage as for example 150V may affect the quality of bands separation)
After run is over, take the tray out on some plate, and bring it to visualize DNA bands to a UV lightbox or gel imaging system

Unmask Our Shores
We organized a beach clean-up 17 th June, 2018 at the Marina Beach, near the light house, to                     create awareness about Ocean Acidification to the general public. We asked if the REC                     Chennai iGEM Team and IIT Madras iGEM Team would like to collaborate with us to do the                     beach clean-up. They were very enthusiastic and accepted our proposal.
We, along with the other teams assembled at the location at 6 am, and we bought gloves and                     bags to collect all the garbage. All of us worked diligently for one and a half hours. At the                     same time, we talked about iGEM and our project to all the interested people at the beach                     distributed pamphlets to them too.
After the hard work, we celebrated the birthday of one of the REC Chennai team members                     and went out to a hotel for breakfast as one big iGEM Team!!

In collaboration with their team, we came up                     with a recipe that was healthy, tasty and super fun to make.
All-India iGEM Conference
The iGEM VIT team attended the All India iGEM meetup hosted by the iGEM IISc team.             The All India meet-up included almost all the participating teams from the country including             the teams from the hosting college, IISER Kolkata, IISER Bhopal, REC Chennai, IIT-             Madras, and ICT Mumbai.
Hosted over a period of 3 days from the 27th of July, 2018 to the 30th of July, 2018, the             meet-up provided a platform for all teams to present their project ideas and concepts without             fear of criticism. The meet-up gave us the opportunity to get both positive as well as negative             feedback on the project idea we presented to our peers which greatly helped us develop and             incorporate these suggestions into the project.
This also gave us the opportunity to get various problems troubleshooted and get a whole             new perspective from iGEMers who are facing the same problems"

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," for the iGEM registry. We made overnight cultures of the E. coli transformed with pSB1C3, pET29b(+)-phaCJ, and pET29b(+)-phaCBA. We performed miniprep on the cultures and then digested the plasmids using XbaI. We then ligated them together and transformed them into DH5a.
During these three weeks, the team was busy preparing for aGEM. We had meetings to discuss the aGEM presentation and make revisions to the presentation.   When we got back from aGEM, we focused on cloning our completed constructs pET29b(+)-phaCBA and pet29b(+)-phaCJ into the pSB1C3 plasmid for the iGEM registry. We used XbaI and PstI to clone in our pET29b(+)-phaCBA part (BBa_) and used EcoRI and NotI to half digestion (So not all NotI sites were cut off because then EcoRI would have been cut off the insert) to clone in our pet29b(+)-phaCJ. The parts were sequence confirmed. The DNA from these sequence-confirmed parts were then transferred onto the plate following the iGEM parts submission protocol.

CARD system: Over the course of our work, issues in antibiotic resistance surfaced frequently. In our research into the major contributors to this problem we had to consider agriculture as well as irresponsible prescribing and mishandling of waste.
We reflected upon how we could influence the resistance situation ourselves, both within and outside the lab. This was the origin of CARD ; a simple, portable, easy to follow and generally user friendly guidance note on how to work safely in the lab, with a focus on responsible antibiotic use and disposal. We felt this idea complemented our endeavour to provide teaching materials to a wide range of individuals and groups nicely.
Despite the fact that antibiotic safety is addressed on induction to a new laboratory environment for example, we agreed as a team that the information we received before working at in a BioSafety level 2 lab at our university raised new questions and issues for all of us. We concluded that CARD would have been a great addition to our induction and simple fail-safe for new (and existing) researchers to work to!
Health
Interview: With insights from Professor Rotimi's research into chronic wounds, we continued to model our focus on S. aureus biofilms. This provided us with a framework which was both safe and accessible for us to work with in the lab as well as being clinically relevant to the problem.
Our reflections on the interview with Professor Rotimi resulted in a mindset-shift towards the rapidly emerging problem of antibiotic resistance. Although we had originally concentrated on chronic wounds as a considerable economic healthcare burden that impacts the lives of vulnerable patients in terms of morbidity, this interview really opened up our outlook. We considered how the current therapeutic options for these wounds is actually a driving force to the problem of antibiotic resistance, and considered the issues of continued pressure to combine our new approach with drugs we already know are losing ground in the battle against bacteria.
From this interview we also learned to differentiate colonised from wounds which are secondarily infected. We considered how SMITe could easily have a role in the management of poorly healing wounds which were still vulnerable to infection, but with no systemic features. Since the early biofilm production (especially in diabetic wounds) originates from S. aureus, perhaps SMITe could have an even greater role in preventing secondary infections than treating them ""once the anaerobes have moved in"". In response to this, we discussed the problem with our panel of supervisors and took advice about the incorporation of"

<ref name=""Bezeichner"">Blablablub</ref> Controlling gene expression in a condition and tissue specific manner is a desirable tool for a wide variety of applications ranging from fundamental bioscience research to gene therapy. Having this idea in mind, it is inevitable to consider the starting point of gene expression: the promoter. Most efforts of obtaining any promoter focus on cloning them from nature. In eukaryotes, this approach leads to several problems. The one major issue is the complexity of eukaryotic systems resulting in cross-talk between pathways. In particular, promoters tend to respond to several transcription factors and are thus activated by more than one pathway. That way, one cannot determine which signal originally induced the promoter. Alongside this specificity, induction under a desired combination of conditions and at defined strengths would be valuable implementations.
Therefore, efforts have emerged to synthetically construct promoters. Two concepts of synthetic promoters in mammalian cells co-exist independently from each other. One is the concept of ""genetic switches"" (see [2] for a recent review) - promoters which can specifically be induced by a stimulus mammalian cells and are usually insensitive to, e.g. tetracycline [3] . Much fewer efforts have been put into developing promoters sensitive to endogenous signals (referred to as ""synthetic promoters"" in the rest of this article). Such promoters are of very high value for a broad variety of applications. Three examples should demonstrate this: First, in virotherapy for cancer and other diseases, it has become a desire to express toxic genes only in affected cells (reviewed in [4] ). For example, breast cancer cells are characterized by high levels of estrogen receptor. Constructing a promoter which is active only at high estrogen receptor levels (preferable only in cells which are irradiated, as ER can be very active in other tissues of the female reproductive tract [17] ) might therefore help developing novel breast cancer therapies. Second, biologists studying pathway interactions are in need for transcriptional assays, that being promoters which are specifically activated by a single transcription factor. Third, the concept can be transferred to plants, where synthetic promoters can be very valuable, as plant biotechnology is always in need for novel tissue- or development-specific promoters.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Week 14: August 5th - August 8th
The week all of the representatives that attended the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva Switzerland took time to reflect and review all of the information they were able to learn over the entirety of the experience.  This valuable information will help us create an informed design for our device, and make adjustments based on international feedback we received from a variety of valuable perspectives.  We discussed this experience and what they have learned at the conference and meeting with FIND. More information on the meeting with FIND can be found here
These team members made sure to thoroughly document this experience to ensure that this information will benefit the design and implementation of our project.  The Biological Weapons Convention and the meeting with FIND both provided our team with valuable information and insight into synthetic biology on an international level.
Week 15: August 11th - August 15th
The World Health Organization responded to our email regarding our research and what feedback they have regarding our project.  This is also an opportunity to gain insight in the malaria misdiagnosis information available from the World Health Organization, as the specific department of the WHO that responded to us is a part of the malaria program.
Week 16: August 18th - August 22nd
This week we created a list of all of the diseases that we previously talked about that have similar symptoms as malaria. Then we looks at the specific symptoms (other than fever) of each to see if we can group certain diseases according to similar symptoms. For example, some diseases might have neck pain as a symptom, while other have stomachache as a symptom. If a patient exhibits neck pain and fever symptoms, for example, then a doctor can administer a diagnostic test that tests for the diseases that have these two symptoms in common. So this week was spent looking into this idea and looking at the different symptoms of diseases that mimic malaria.
Week 17: August 25th - August 29th
This week we started writing summaries for different aspects we looked into as part of the Policies and Practiced research. Different components include diagnostic landscape, device implementation, and informed design. The write ups for these sections integrate the interviews with the experts and general facts about misdiagnosis of malaria that we found as part of our research. Information received from FIND during the Geneva trip was also very useful in writing up these sections.

NYMU-Taipei,2009,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Project#Receptor#Antibody_-_-_TEXT.html," to stick to the cell's surface. The cell membrane then engulfs the virus and the portion of the membrane that encloses it pinches off to form a new membrane-bound compartment within the cell called an endosome, which contains the engulfed virus. The cell then attempts to begin digesting the contents of the endosome by acidifying its interior and transforming it into a lysosome. However, as soon as the pH within the endosome drops to about 6.0, the original folded structure of the HA molecule becomes unstable, causing it to partially unfold, and releasing a very hydrophobic portion of its peptide chain that was previously hidden within the protein. This so-called ""fusion peptide"" acts like a molecular grappling hook by inserting itself into the endosomal membrane and locking on. Then, when the rest of the HA molecule refolds into a new structure (which is more stable at the lower pH), it ""retracts the grappling hook"" and pulls the endosomal membrane right up next to the virus particle's own membrane, causing the two to fuse together. Once this has happened, the contents of the virus, including its RNA genome, are free to pour out into the cell's cytoplasm.
Structure:
HA is a homotrimeric integral membrane glycoprotein. It is shaped like a cylinder, and is approximately 13.5 nanometres long. The three identical monomers that constitute HA are constructed into a central α helix coil; three spherical heads contain the sialic acid binding sites. HA monomers are synthesized as precursors that are then glycosylated and cleaved into two smaller polypeptides: the HA1 and HA2 subunits. Each HA monomer consists of a long, helical chain anchored in the membrane by HA2 and topped by a large HA1 globule.
Antibody
Type of antibody:scFv
scFv:
A single chain variable fragment (scFv) is a fusion of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins, linked together with a short linker, usually serine or glycine. This chimeric molecule retains the specificity of the original immunoglobulin, despite removal of the constant regions and the introduction of a linker peptide. The image to the right shows how this modification usually leaves the specificity unaltered. These molecules were created historically to facilitate phage display where it is highly convenient to express the antigen binding domain as a single peptide. Alternatively, scFv can be created directly from subcloned heavy and light chains derived from a hybridoma. scFvs"
Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Model#IntegrationQS_-_-_TEXT.html," Antigen will activate QS (left). QS will initiate cell lysis (middle). Cell lysis will result in a fluorescent signal (right). In green dots an entire fluorescent molecule (GFP) is depicted.
Quorum sensing
We selected an existing QS BioBrick containing a LuxI in a positive feedback motif as the starting point for our project. This BioBrick, BBa_K1913005 , also contains GFP under the same promoter as LuxI. The amount of fluorescence is therefore a reporter for the degree of LuxI production. The more the cells engage in QS, the more fluorescence they produce. Previous experiments have shown that BBa_K1913005 produces fluorescence even at low cell densities. This suggests that leaky expression of LuxI and high basal levels of LuxR will result in a significant amount of GFP production. The goal is to construct a variation on this part that no longer has spontaneous activation, but can be induced by an outside mechanism, for example by Cpx .
Phase 1: Initial testing
To confirm the properties of BBa_K1913005 reported in the repository, we first analyzed the fluorescence produced by cells containing this BioBrick. As a negative control, cells containing pLuxR-GFP, as well as cells containing pLuxR-GFP and pLuxL-LuxR (i.e. BBa_K1913005 without LuxI) were also analyzed (Figure 2).                                                This indicates that cells containing BBa_K1913005 auto-activate and produce the active TF LuxR-AHL dimer. Without LuxI, there is no AHL production and there is no active form of the LuxR transcription factor. Our goal now is to make an inducible version of BBa_K1913005 that initially produces no GFP, but that can be activated. The BBa_K1913005 BioBrick functions properly only as a reporter for QS. As it always engages in QS, it cannot be used in systems that require QS in specific cases. Our goal is to fix the behavior of BBa_K1913005 so that the QS mechanism can be applied as an amplification mechanism in whole-cell biosensors.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Synthetic TKL_-_-_TEXT.html," strong response at m/z = 155.1 ion pair in the RFP  +DEBS1+TE transformant sample. The ion pair of 173.1/155.1 is specific   to the expected product TKL1B, and is in consistent with previous   studies. These results demonstrated that TKL1B was successfully   produced from the transformant.[4]
Conclusion
In this project, we realized the design by standardizing domains from   the gene cluster of DEBSs. To our knowledge, it was the first time to   assemble domains as individual units.
We performed separations of the coding sequence resulted in   standardized domains and assembled these domains in correct order for   generating our target product triketide lactone.[5] Evaluation of   recombinant DEBS+TE expression was performed by RT-PCR analyses,   fluorescence microscopy analyses, SDS-PAGE and final polyketide   product was detected using Mass Spectrometry. Our results demonstrated   that standardized domains could express correctly folded and   posttranslationally modified modular PKSs, we concluded that domains   in PKSs can work relatively independently. Furthermore, RFP may   influence the function of protein, but in our project the product   could be generated via BAP1 harboring plasmids with RFP-DEBS1-TE.   Also, there is one scar (Thr-Arg) every two parts produced in every   ligations because of RFC 23 .We had worried these additional amino   acids may affect the expression of our synthetase. However, the   complete construction with 20 additional amino acids of RFP-DEBS1-TE,   expressed well from the IPTG-inducible promoter present in pSB1C3 in   E. coli strain BAP1. According to these results, we demonstrated the   compatibility as well as interchangeability between different   standardized domains. [6]
Based on investigation of standardized domains coming from semi-  rational separation, the obtained results represented an important   milestone toward the ultimate goal of creating novel PKSs by   assembling standardized domains.Additionally, these results showed   a new approach to generating triketide lactone, which can be an   important source of advanced intermediates of complex polyketides.[7]

NTNU_Trondheim,2012,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a trigger factor is that tumors exists in an environment deprived of oxygen [6] .
Overview
Our goal for this years competition is to create a genetic circuit which enables E. coli cells to detect and attack cancer cells. To do this, the cells should produce a tumor inhibitor or toxin effective at killing cancer cells, and respond to environmental cues indicating the presence of cancer cells by undergoing lysis , releasing the anti-cancer agent into the surrounding environment. In principle, bacteria could be used in ""search and destroy"" missions against cancer inside the human body. We wish to develop our genetic circuit as a proof-of-concept of one such strategy.
A sketch of our current planned design for the circuit is shown below.
A sketch of our planned genetic circuit
Ideally, the toxin should only be released if cancer cells are actually encountered, and never otherwise. To achieve this, the lysis-inducing part of the circuit should be regulated such that it is highly unlikely to be activated in other situations. One possible way is to use a signal molecule that is solely associated with cancer cells to activate the lysis device. Another possibility is to use a combination of environmental cues that together indicate a high likelihood of cancer presence. We have chosen the latter strategy, and the environmental cues we aim to use are low O2 and high lactate concentrations.
Each of the two cues activates a separate gene, which encode different proteins. Together, these two proteins should activate the unit responsible for lysis. Therefore, if only one of the cues is present, the cell does not lyse, and toxin is not released in high levels. (Some leakage of toxin must be expected even under normal conditions with no activation of the circuit). Selective activation in the presence of cancer cells would be crucial for the concept to be effective in a medical situation.
As shown in the sketch, we plan to express the toxin-producing gene with a constitutive promoter. This means that the toxin production is always active. Ideally, the toxin should be maximally effective against cancer cells and minimally toxic to the toxin-producing bacterial cell. We have evaluated several candidate molecules and decided to use the protein Colicin E1 .
Details
Below is a more detailed sketch of the circuit design ( legend ). The environmental cues oxygen and lactate regulate the production of two regulatory proteins, LuxR and LuxI. Oxygen inhibits the production of LuxR, while lactate activates the production of LuxI. LuxI in turn catalyzes the formation of a homo-serine lactone (HSL) compound from S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAM) and Hexanoyl"

As soon as AHL is diffused to the former chamber it induces sfGFP production on the sensor plasmid. The time it takes until we can measure the sfGFP signal and the length of the channel gives us information about the velocity of AHL diffusion.
PDMS millifluidic chip used for diffusion experiments
Three main experiment designs were tested and modified: the agar-design, the liquid-design and the beads-design.
For the agar-design we filled the chamber and channels with LB-agar or in a second attempt with agarose only. Subsequently, we punched a cylindric hole in each chamber. The capacities were filled with regulator/sensor strain culture or AHL/AHL producer strain culture, respectively. After 3 to 4 h at 37 °C we could observe an increase in the sfGFP signal. Since we used comparably high concentration of AHL in our first attempts, we could not detect a delayed sfGFP signal for chambers connected by a longer channel. The experiment will be repeated using lower concentrations. However, conducting the experiment using the agar-design, we encountered a problem: after some hours the LB-agar/agarose started to shrink and dried out. Thus, the agar-design cannot be used without modifications for experiments of longer duration.
In an attempt we only left a small agar fragment in each channel and filled the rest with liquid medium, so as to decrease chance of it drying out, while avoiding at the same time that bacteria from one chamber reach the other chamber.
The bead-design consists of an alginate bead for each chamber and liquid medium in between. The beads either contained regulator/sensor-bacteria or AHL.

1 Safety
1.1 Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
1.2 Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
1.3 Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.
Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of E. coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored into the"

Basic Part
Plux
Promoter activated by LuxR in concert with HSL
This part involves the -10 binding site, the -35 binding site, and the twenty nucleotides between that constitute the lux box. With this part, LuxR functions as a acyl-homoserine lactone-dependent repressor. LuxR resonds to the HSL produced by LuxI, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-HSL. The Lux box is positioned such that it partially overlaps the consensus -35 and -10 hexamers of an RNA polymerase binding site. A quorum-sensing system involving LuxR, the transcriptional activator, and an acyl-homserine lactone signal regulate the lux operon in vibrio fischeri. In vibrio fischeri, the lux box, which is a 20-base inverted repeat unit, is positioned 42.5 bases upstream of the transcriptional start of the lux operon and is required for transcriptional activation.
Background information
Quorum-sensing bacteria such as Vibrio fischeri, are able to detected their own population density and implement density-based decision-making，Using the luxI/luxR quorum-sensing system, synthetic biologists have designed a large number of devices in prokaryotic microorganisms.Inevitably, high performance is required from such devices, and this includes reliability, sensitivity, Hence, to improve the properties of population-density switches, we design of ultrasensitive responses base Part:BBa_R0062 use Point mutation

Heat shock each transformation tube by placing the bottom 1/2 to 2/3 of the tube into a 42°C water bath for 30-60 seconds (45sec is usually ideal, but this varies depending on the competent cells you are using). Put the tubes back on ice for 2 min. Add 250-500μl LB or SOC media (without antibiotic) and grow in 37°C shaking incubator for 45min. Note: This outgrowth step allows the bacteria time to generate the antibiotic resistance proteins encoded on the plasmid backbone so that they will be able to grow once plated on the antibiotic containing agar plate. This step is not critical for Ampicillin resistance but is much more important for other antibiotic resistances. Plate some or all of the transformation onto a 10cm LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic. Note: We recommend that you plate 50μL on one plate and the rest on a second plate. This gives the best chance of getting single colonies, while allowing you to recover all transformants. Incubate plates at 37°C overnight.
6. Transformation of Lactococcus lactis
(1) Preparation of competent L. lactis cells
To obtain competent cells, the cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 to 0.8 and then diluted 100-fold in SGM17 (M17GS containing 0.5 M sucrose) supplemented with glycine. After growth at 30 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2 to 0.4, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C at 5,000x g. Following two washes in ice-cold 0.5 M sucrose containing 10% glycerol, the cells were suspended in 1/100 culture volume of washing solution and then stored in aliquots at -85 °C until use.
(2) Transformation by electroporation
The cell suspensions were thawed on ice. Portions (40 μL) were mixed with 1 μL of DNA and then transferred to an ice-cooled electroporation cuvette (2-mm electrode gap) and exposed to a single electrical pulse. The pulse was delivered by a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad, Calif.) set at 25 μF and normally at 2.0 kV. The cuvette was connected in parallel to a 200-"

Note that this does not imply that the polymers are of equal length. What we will now do is make use of the so-called “lattice model” to represent our solution. In this type of model, the solution is represented as an infinitely large grid (we do not care what happens at the boundary), in which each square can be occupied by part of a polycation, polyanion, or by a single solvent molecule of volume $v$. This $v$ will be our basic unit of space in the lattice, and we define the effective chain length $N$ of the polymer to be its volume in units of $v$: $$N=\frac{V_{polymer}}{v}$$ In the graphical representation of our lattice model below, the sites occupied by polycations and polyanions are represented with + and - respectively, and the sites occupied by solvent are left empty.
Figure 1: Lattice model. In a lattice model, a solution is represented as a lattice of which the sites are occupied by any of the components of the solution. By calculating the energies of the interactions between different sites, this leads to an expression for the free energy of the whole system.
In this lattice model, one can now define interaction energies between all different neighboring pairs of sites, and calculate the energy of any configuration of the whole system (Figure 1). We are particularly interested in the Helmholtz Free Energy, since we have assumed constant temperature, pressure and volume. The full derivation of this energy ranges beyond the scope of this description, but the interested reader is encouraged to read references Doi 2013 ; Perry & Sing 2015 ; Veis 2011 .
The Helmholtz free energy per lattice site $f(\phi)$ in units of $k_B T$ for a solution containing polycations and polyanions is given by what is known as the Voorn-Overbeek model ( Qin et al. 2014 ; Qin & De Pablo 2016 ), and reads: $$f(\phi) = \frac{\phi}{N} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)+(1-\phi)\cdot \ln(1-\phi)-\alpha \cdot (\sigma \phi)^{3/2}$$ Here $\alpha$ is the interaction strength from the Debye-Hückel theory, and $\sigma \equiv Z/N$ is the charge density"
Guanajuato_Mx,2016,Team:Guanajuato Mx#ResultsAndDiscussions_-_-_TEXT.html," (no addition of HCl), all samples were able to form an elastic film, when drops of water were added the film tended to soften and with an excessive amount of water, the film became softener. In experiment 2 (wherein HCl was used as a catalyst), sample with only 100 μL of HCl appeared to be harder than samples from experiment 1 but it displayed more air bubbles within its structure. With 200 μL of HCl, the film showed less softening compared to those from the experiment 1. Even though the addition of HCl conferred waterproofness to the film, air bubbles were a major issue, so it was decided that the use of this acid was unnecessary. Therefore, for future assays, the mixture was heated at the conditions of time and temperature of the experiment 1 (60°C for 40 minutes), and afterwards it was poured all over an aluminium foil and kept at room temperature for 24 hours. With this procedure a firm and promising film was obtained to be used in the biopatch. On previous studies where the stability of PVA films were tested it was shown that the use of additives such as HCl affects the stability of the film altering its properties in the presence of different chemical compounds such as ammonium bisulfate (NH4HSO4), NaOH and formaldehyde (Koo et al., 2011), which supports our choice to work with the conditions of the experiment 1.
Selection of agar medium concentration
    The culture medium is an essential part for the product that we are trying to develop because it is going to provide the nutrients demanded by the microorganism; furthermore it is a matrix where our sensor and machinery will be placed. We observed cell motility of E. coli and appearance of agar concentrations of 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4 and 4.5 g/L. All of them presented good cell motility but the one that seemed to be more consistent was 3.5 g/L; 4 and 4.5 g/L had a solid consistency instead of a semisolid (data not shown) and lower concentrations looked more liquid (Table 1).
Selection of PVA medium concentration
    For greater preservation of the culture medium which will contain the genetically modified bacteria, we used a combination of culture medium (optimal agar concentration of 3.5 g/L obtained in this work) and various concentrations of the polymer PVA (5, 10 and 15%, v/v), from the PVA obtained under the conditions determined in this work as"

It was decided that the process should begin with the lysis of our bacteria. This process will facilitate the extraction, and will also help as a biosecurity method so that they are not released to the environment.
The wasted obtained in all the processes that were presented before, can actually be redirected to a biodigester for the production of methane. This energetic compound can be used after a combustion, into electric energy that can maintain from the triturator in the pretreatment of bagasse, to the bomb that adds oxygen to the bioreactor in which the PHA is being produced. Inside the effluents obtained from the digester it can also be found biol that at the end of the process can be turned into agricultural fertilizer.

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

We had some very unusual weather here today.  Normal Davis summers are very hot and dry and today should have been around 90-100F but it was rainy and cold! Global climate change perhaps?
--Wednesday--
We realized today that we needed to test some carb plates that we made last week.  Our suspicions arose when 16 ligations that had previously been transformed successfully failed to grow on our new plates.  We did a quick test by streaking a couple plates with a part in an AK backbone.  We streaked the same part on both Kan and Carb plates and only the Kan plates had any growth on them.  We will make some new Carb plates tomorrow and hopefully they'll work!  Today we also designed the rest of our Gibson assembly primers for constructing our screening plasmid.  We'll order tomorrow and in about a week be able to assemble everything fairly quickly.  In the meantime we'll continue using biobrick assembly.
--Thursday-- We did PCR of E0240 with and without B0034.  We wrote our formal letter to Novozymes and set up digest with E and P of E0240 modified with and without B0034.  We also got a new strain of E. coli, BW22826 which is F-, Δ(araD-araB)567, Δ(codB-lacI)3, &lambda-, rpoS396(Am), rph-1.  This strain will be helpful for us since it is both araBAD and LacI negative.  This means we won't have to put an arabinose repressor in our plasmid which will cut down on construction time and allow for more testing time!  We also needed the strain to be ∆LacI since we will be testing the Lac repressor and operator.
We also made carbenicillin plates and diagnosed the ""bad"" carb plates as chloramphenocol plates.  Our mistake came when we used an older stock of carb which was labelled only with a 'c'.   Lesson learned; don't assume anything!
--Friday-- Transformed all of our LacI mutants again along with E0240+psb1k3.  All of the LacI mutants were plated on newly made Carb plates.  Hopefully they have the correct antibiotic this time!  We also got a new strain, JS006, which we requested from another lab.  We'll make"

The decarboxylation, the dissociation of carbon, will lose carbon equivalent and limit the product’s theoretical carbon yield. The Formula 1 show you how to calculate the efficiency of a pathway.
We assume that non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG) as a model mechanism to develop our software program. NOG is one of the complete carbon yield pathways that starts with sugar to acetyl-CoA. It needs conjunction with carbon dioxide or assimilation with other one-carbon (C1) source to produce desirable fuels and chemicals (Bogorad I. W., Lin T. S., Liao J. C. 2013).
While simulating the NOG pathway, we achieved complete carbon yield. So without losing any of carbons, we are able to obtain desirable results. During the reaction, there are lots of chemicals that result in carbon loss. The program ‘Gil’ calculates the CO2 reduction to calculate the carbon loss. This is due to the fact that CO2 is less likely to be utilized unless it is fixed compared to other chemicals.

Received Pcambia 1281z and 1201 vectors from Dr. Gu’s lab. Plasmids we transformed and amplified. Received Pseudomonas putida KT2440 from Dr. Salis’ lab. Genomic DNA extraction was performed on the Pseudomonas putida.  Genomic DNA was confirmed by Nano-drop. Primers for PCR of the enzyme 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase (HCHL), were ordered through IDT.
June 3 – 7
Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using phusion polymerase and following manufacturer instructions, in order to amplify the gene of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase (HCHL). The PCR amplified product was run on an electrophoresis gel and a  ~ 800 base pairs was observed.  DNA was purified through gel extraction.
June 10-14
HCHL gene was ligated to pCambia vectors, and then the ligated vector were transformed. No colonies were observed.  A new approach was developed and new primers were ordered.
June 17 -21
A new approach and corresponding primers for amplifying the 35s promoter, HCHL gene and NOS terminator with sticky ends interconnectable between them and the Pcambia vectors were developed. These primers were ordered through IDT.

Policy
In an attempt to maximize the impact of our iGEM project we concluded that for synthetic biology to truly move forward, more acceptance is required in Europe. Europe has some of the strictest policies regarding GMO´s. A GMO product made using mutagenesis techniques is readily accepted under the law whereas the same product made using conventional cloning techniques has to undergo strict and often cripling safety procedures. Start ups suffer under expensive testing requirements, some safety validation procedures can last up to a decade. Aside from the fact that the policy is not sensible, it conveys a distorted image to the general public. Portraying genetically modified organisms as something inherently unsafe. Though safety measures are necesary, overregulation can stifle innovation [1]. In order to confront this issue it was decided that a top down approach was required. Different institutes advice the government regarding policy in the Netherlands. The main advisory body in the Netherlands is the National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) . A government funded institute concerning policy and research about issues concerning health and environment.
On April 17th the Wageningen iGEM team contacted the RIVM about issues concerning safety and environment. Having heard about the potential of synthetic biology they were very interested to learn more about projects involved in the discipline; specifically the possibilities and the potential safety aspect linked to both the projects and the eventual application.
On June 10th a meeting took place at the RIVM in Utrecht that proved to be highly successful. Two of our team members and a former iGEM participant (now supervisor of our team) met with Jaco Westerink and Cécile van der Vlught from"

Operation  ECHO | Collaboration with other teams
Operation ECHO, by Tsinghua-A Team
More Details
During the season, we will dedicate in pursuing the goal of the construction of a biological oscillator, which we call ‘ECHO’, the abbreviation of ‘the E.Coli Homochronous Oscillator’.
With two Escherichia coli populations expressing gene one after another, they give red and green fluorescent light alternately. E.coli populations communicate bi-directionally by a class of signaling molecules involves in bacteria quorum sensing, that is, N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), to regulate the gene expression of each other. By engineering their gene circuits, two groups (name as CELL-A and CELL-B) will form a network, with B inducing A and A restricting B, thus able to realize oscillation. A mechanism is set up to change the rate of an AHL expression, allowing us to control the period and the phase of the oscillatory cycle.
What’s more, we establish a mathematical model to analyze the dynamics of the system, and computer simulation software is introduced into the process. The comparison between the wet lab experiment and the simulating outcome contributes to a contemplated and well-planned designation of our project.

Skype call with an iGEM Alumni - Dr. Ben Reeve from CustoMem 17/07/2017
We wanted to know the steps required to develop our project into a real business so we reached out to CustoMem , a spin-out company from iGEM (Imperial 2014) that specializes in developing a membrane for water filtration. We talked to Dr. Ben Reeve, an ex-iGEM team member and supervisor that works within CustoMem. He shared a lot of his experience with iGEM and CustoMem and we gained some useful feedbacks and comments in regards to our project and its implementation in real life. In addition, we also discussed legislative issues surrounding iGEM and received some tips and advice about the competition.
Key point summary of our talk can be seen down below:
1. Municipal water treatment is very conservative about trying new technologies. It is difficult to get into municipal water treatment and selling our project idea to them if it were to be implemented into a business. Therefore, the market for water treatment would be around industrial water treatment. It is easier to get into the market for industrial water treatment because different industries have different waste. In this case, our customer will be companies from different industries that handle their own waste water.
2. Selling our idea: It will be great if we can provide a proof of concept to the water companies, specifically a lab proof of concept using wastewater from each specific water company. Water companies also like the technology to be tested on site. Perhaps we can use their wastewater to design some simple experiments. People will be interested in our project if we can prove that it is able to treat phosphate with minimum space and time more efficiently than existing processes.
3. Legislation: CustoMem are using parts that are in the BioBrick registry but they do not patent the BioBrick. Everything that is in the wiki or presented in the Jamboree cannot be patented. If we were to patent our project, it will be on the specific process and application of the parts that are not disclosed through the competition. At this point, we should not be worried about any possible patent issues in our project.
4. Business Development: Business models often change through interactions with different stakeholders. CustoMem were made more aware of the problem specifications that they are trying to address through stakeholder interaction. It’s important to consider how to scale up the business from the lab into an industrial scale. For our project, we would have to think of the solutions to some questions: What concentration of phosphate"

Valencia_UPV,2018,Team:Valencia UPV#Integrated Human_-_-_TEXT.html," our main concern was how to fulfill the different stakeholder demands. Following our interdisciplinary spirit, we searched for continuos input from professionals with different backgrounds and non professionals, so we could ensure we were designing a useful synbio device.
This year we have decided to divide Integrated human in three parts:
Kano model
An engineering way to integrate feedback.
Expert dialoge
How experts point of view changed the way we did Printeria.
Safety desing
How safety specifications changed Printeria
Kano Model
Kano model is a methodology, which supports the development of products taking into account the needs of the customer. It helps you to understand the importance of functions or features to a customer[1]. We have used it to improve Printeria and we want it to be a guide for future iGEM teams, thats why we are going to present our work as an example of using it.
Kano model is made up of three stages:
Pick up the user's voice
In this phase you have to present your project to an audience and then ask them for criticisms or suggestions. We did it in the Mustang Art Gallery (MAG) in Elche (Alicante). After showing them Printeria we gathered all the students and teachers and we asked them for demands, improvements or criticisms.
Create your paired questions quiz
With those demands that we will call necessities you have to make a questionaire based on paired questions. This questions have the next grammar: ¿How do you feel if (a necessity exists on your device)? and ¿How do you feel if (that necessity did not exist on your device)? As you can observe, it is the same necessity but expressed positively or negatively. Check out our questionnaire to see an example:
QUESTIONNAIRE
Classify your demands
Once you have all the answers, you have to complete a series of tables to conclude if that necessity is really important or not. If it is, you should include it in your design because that will increase the satisfaction rate of the user. If it is not, do not waste time and money implementing something no one will appreciate!
Study case: Kano model in Printeria
When using the Kano model you can easily combine public engagement with integrated human. Taking advantage of the fact that we went to MAG (Mustang Art Gallery) in Elche (Alicante) to present our project in front of students and teachers, we decided to demand feedback. The most important necessities were included in the questionnaire we described above, and then we sent it to the students and teachers who filled it.

3.Kill Switch
When we use engineered bacteria to treat IBD, we need to do biocontainment work to avoid the release of engineered bacteria into the environment. Therefore, in our project, we designed a cold shock kill switch based on the toxin-antitoxin system mazEF, so we can kill our engineered E. coli when it escape from human body. We inserted the reporter gene amilCP into the pColdI plasmid to characterize the performance of the cold shock promoter PcspA (Figure 9A). Then we inserted maz-F into the pColdI plasmid to build our kill switch (Figure 9B).
A, the construction of PcspA-amilCP plasmid. B, the construction of PcspA-mazF plasmid.
We transformed the PcspA-amilCP plasmid into DH5α and cultured overnight at 37℃. The overnight culture was diluted to OD = 0.2 and allowed to grow for 2 h at 37℃. It was then divided into different concentrations of IPTG at 16℃ and 37℃ for 6 h (Figure 10). It can be seen from the figure 11A that the reporter gene is efficiently expressed at low temperature, which indicates that the effective expression of the toxin gene mazF and the closed expression of the anti-toxin gene mazE at low temperature can kill our engineered bacteria in time. Although the cold shock promoter PcspA has a certain leakage at body temperature, the toxin is neutralized by the anti-toxin expressed at body temperature, so the effect is not significant. However, it is best to add a lacO site in the future to suppress leakage.

In synthetic biology communication, framing was found to be a big issue. The term GMO was found to be so “contaminated” in public perception that its use should be averted altogether. The term synthetic biology scores a bit better, but still evokes negative associations. An important goal should be to find a term with a very positive ring to it. Another solution could be to sell something which evokes good associations (a particularly good synbio application like a cure for ebola) while stressing that it is synthetic biology, to change the perception of the term.
The main conclusion of the discussion was that in order to get synthetic biology accepted, a clearly beneficial real-life application is needed. Our ELECTRACE system could play a big part in this by enabling biosensors to be used outside the lab. To make such an application possible, a change in legislature, a different innovation process, and a different way of communication, is needed.
Report NPA meeting
Summary: Mr. Justin Brady, senior adviser for Norwegian People's Aid, explained to us that manual mine detection using metal detectors is still the most used methods. He saw a great opportunity for the ELECTRACE system to discard possibly contaminated areas, a process which is currently very expensive and time-consuming.
To learn more about the current methods used for landmine detection and to understand better the upsides and downsides of these methods, we got in contact with NPA. Mr. Justin Brady kindly accepted our invitation and visited our office on 3rd of September.
Mr. Justin Brady is a senior adviser for NPA and is based now in the Netherlands. Previously he was the head of the United Nations Mine Action Service in New York, having a vast experience in this field. The NPA in active in different countries, covering: Asia, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and South America. They got a lot of advocacy work to prohibit landmines and cluster munitions. Furthermore, their works expands also to explosive remnants from war (ERW).
They rely primary on manual demining, using metal detection methods, partially also due to costs. In countries where they are active the labor is quite cheap and this represents also a productive way to put people back to society. In addition, they have also a very large dog program, being one of the leaders in using the canine detection.  They also used to supply dogs to other program. Yet, dogs have several limitations, mainly due to the environmental conditions (eg. heat as well as the terrain where they are working on).
There are also other efforts for landmines detections. There is a tool sensor"

Sharing and  collaboration are core values of iGEM, and our team also devote ourselves to  expanding the influence of synthetic biology with others. In this part, we have been help Guangdong Experimental High  School’ students to build a team (GDGDSYZX-United ) to participate in the iGEM  competition.
1.We helped them distribute of tasks to  everyone  according to their intention and talent,  such as experimenters, art designers,  editors and speakers.
2.We introduced  the purpose and overview of iGEM competition and explained  the rules to the them in detail.  Also, we showed some excellent wiki to let them know how to start their work and how to achieve their goal.
3.We showed  them how to use equipment to do experiment.  Since their chassis is plant cell, which is similar with us, so we could give  some guidance to their project. We also provide some plasmids  to them.
We lead them to  design their own logo and  team uniform. And we also send two teammates  (Wang Rong and Lin Yunping) to Guangdong Experimental High School for several months to be their art and modeling advisor to help them build web page and design poster .
We hold a meeting to communicate about project progress and team construction,  sharing experience and learn from each other.
Since the iGEMers  from team GDSYZX-United are all high school students, most of them know little  about mathematical tool which can help optimize biological experiments.So we  talk to them and try to make them to comprehen the usage of mathematical tool  in biological experiments by giving some examples of mathematical modeling in  iGEM projects. What’s more, we give them some advice when they are analyzing  the experiment results."

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rectify misconceptions. We tried to ask students and parents questions like - “do you think it is dangerous to work with bacteria” or “is genetic modification safe?” Initial responses were generally negative, but the questions gave us a platform to address the issues.
The concept of toehold switches had also proved extremely challenging to explain. We subsequently developed the analogy of a knot to explain them. The knot prevents a protein making factory (ribosome) from reading the instructions (mRNA) to make a protein that glows (GFP). Through diagrams, and use of animations, we were able to explain the concept of our project. We delivered an assembly where we used this analogy to explain our project and sent out a quiz. To our delight people understood most of our project and a few understood nearly everything. 109 completed the quiz and the majority scored over 75%. Find out more on our engagement page .
We thereby vastly improved our education and public engagement programmes, learning from how people to develop an approach for explaining difficult concepts in an accessible and interesting way. We improved our presentation and communication skills throughout the project. We were delighted that rest of the open days, as well our assemblies and workshops went so well and got people interested in synthetic biology.

Philosophy of science
Philosophy of science is concerned with what makes hypotheses strong and how one can confirm theories; Should they be verified, confirmed, disconfirmed or falsified? Verification is rare in natural science since it requires a set of observations that logically lead to the hypothesis in question. Underdetermination will always interfere and make it possible that it’s a different hypothesis that explains the observations. Underdetermination is strongly linked to induction – it isn’t possible to know all the logical possible empirical observations. There is always room for unforeseen observations or explanations. A set of observations can almost always be explained by several different hypotheses. This is exemplified by the story of Horror Vacui. The observations are the same and can be explained both by nature having a fear of empty spaces and that the atmosphere creates a pressure. Therefore, we need more criteria for accepting a hypothesis other than that it explains the observations.
Underdetermination was one of Popper’s concerns with verification as the scientific method. He therefore believed the most secure and productive method was falsification. By falsification he meant constantly trying to prove a theory or hypothesis to be wrong. Every time a scientist doesn’t succeed in proving it wrong the hypothesis or theory has been confirmed. This doesn’t entail it being verified but only that it now is more likely to be true than before – Popper called this that the hypothesis or theory had been corroborated. But falsifying a hypothesis isn’t easy and it is important to remember that there is no form of ‘final’ falsification. It is always possible that our hypothesis is falsified by a mistake we made, and not because it is wrong. That is one of the reasons why it’s important to have an overview of the auxiliary hypothesis that are in use – sometimes they are the ones that need change or the ones being falsified VINCENZO, C. 2016. Confirmation. In: ZALTA, E. N. (ed.) Standford Encycplodia of Philosophy. Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University. .
Science has philosophical prerequisites since scientist works on the foundation of an empirical and objective world searching for an objective truth. Philosophy of science is working with these assumptions arguing why they are necessary for science - and arguing why they are not sufficient. A scientist has to be a fallibilist, meaning that there shouldn’t be premises above criticism.

From the image, we can see that there is little difference among 0.1mg/L, 0.2mg/L and 0.3mg/L                             of                             antigens. It showed that the antigens in this concentration range have almost no effect on                             the                             vertical alignment of liquid crystal. The number of bright spots increased, but not more                             differences among 0.5mg/L-4mg/L. It suggested that the molecular weight of antigen may be                             too                             small to affect the vertical alignment of liquid crystal. Therefore, the effect of antigens                             of                             0.5mg/L concentration on the vertical alignment of liquid crystals is good.

10 Sept: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 500 ng/ml.
After the experiment of suitable antigen concentration, we found that the effect of antigens                             of                             0.5mg/L concentration on the vertical alignment of liquid crystals is good. Therefore, we                             take                             the concentration of antibody solution as 0.5mg/L as the premise to investigate suitable                             nanobody concentration. An appropriate amount of 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 1.5mg/L and 0.5mg/L concentration                             of the nano-antibody solution was sequentially added dropwise to the slide to which the                             antigen                             was immobilized.

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#PowerCell#NutrientSecretion_-_-_TEXT.html," secrete is sucrose. The major inspiration for our project was the paper Engineering Cyanobacteria To Synthesize and Export Hydrophilic Products . This work was done in Dr. Pamela Silver's lab, and describes a glucose/fructose secretion device, achieved in the single-celled bacterium S. elongatus.
Sugar secretion Engineering Cyanobacteria To Synthesize and Export Hydrophilic Products. Niederholtmeyer et al.
In a nutshell, S. elongatus were forced under salt stress to produce sucrose, which was broken down into glucose and fructose by the glf enzyme, then transported out of the cell by the invA transporter.
At the Fifth International Conference on Synthetic Biology, SB5.0 , we spoke with a member of Dr. Silver's lab, Danny Ducat. He advised us that one of the problems with the glucose/fructose secretion system is its low yield. He suspected that because glucose and fructose are directly metabolizable by the cell, much of these sugars are consumed by the cell before they ever have a chance to be secreted. For this reason, it may be better to directly secrete sucrose, which is not metabolizable by the cell, and worry about breaking it down later. This is what we did, although the choice does have some ramifications.
Because E. coli is the a primary host species for genetic modification, it is likely that many biological tools for space exploration will be designed in E. coli. The most common laboratory strains of E. coli , TOP10 and K12, cannot directly metabolize sucrose. For this reason, they cannot make use of PowerCell's output directly. In order to utilize this output, sucrose will need to be broken down into glucose and fructose , or biological tools that intend to utilize PowerCell should be hosted by a strain that can directly metabolize sucrose. E. coli W is a safe and easily transformable laboratory strain with this ability, and, as outlined in The genome sequence of E. coli W (ATCC 9637): comparative genome analysis and an improved genome-scale reconstruction of E. coli , may confer some other advantages to biological tools to be used in space, including including fast growth, stress tolerance, growth to high cell densities. Furthermore, there is some indication that sucrose as a feedstock can confer other benefits, such as oxidative, heat, and acid stress ( Development of sucrose-utilizing Escherichia coli K-12 strain by cloning β-fructofuranosidases and its application for l-threonine production ).

Stereoselective Synthesis
Next we approached the University of Sydney's Professor Paul Groundwater to discuss the potential applications of our scaffold in drug synthesis. His research into the synthesis of novel agents made him an excellent candidate to ask for suggestions on which aspects of the pharmaceutical synthesis industry our system could benefit, and which ones we should particularly target.
Professor Groundwater highlighted the significance of stereogenic centres as a key candidate for metabolic engineering tools, something we had not previously considered. Many drugs available to consumers have an inflated price due to the industrial synthesis of these compounds requiring ineffective and costly separation of the required enantiomers from those with undesirable or potentially toxic chiral structures. Synthesising these drugs through a biocatalytic pathway would remove the need for resolution of the desired compound, potentially reducing the cost of synthesis. We continued to thoughtfully consider this suggestion throughout the rest of our project.
In particular, he mentioned the synthesis of paclitaxel (brand name Taxol), a semi-synthetic anti-cancer therapeutic which is very costly to produce. He prompted us to look further into this pathway, which was significant in catalysing a turning point in the design of our project; away from the indole-3-acetic acid pathway towards paclitaxel side-chain synthesis.
He also suggested that we look into the synthesis of the antimicrobial agent, Levofloxacin, which is also costly to produce, and therefore costly to purchase. Levofloxacin contains one stereocentre, and by reducing the number of different enantiomers produced, our complex could also benefit its production as it may do paclitaxel production - by greatly reducing its cost of production. Through discussing pharmaceuticals that are hard to synthesise, the team was able to further brainstorm other pathways where stereogenic centre conformation is important, such as the metabolic synthesis of Astaxanthin, a pink pigment which is extensively used in the fisheries industry.

Human Practices
In order to integrate our work with the community around us we divided our human practices in 3 different fronts:
Contact with experts
from different fields
During this year, we contacted a variety of experts in tropical diseases and GMO regulation both inside and outside Brazil! This has helped us shaping our project from many different perspectives, not only technically, but regarding the social impact and the regulatory and legal implications of paratransgenesis! You can check the details in our Integrated HP page, which contains excerpts from many interviews, insights about brazilian regulation and our ponderations on the subject.
Education and engagement of general population
But we didn't limit our approaches to people experienced on the subject. We realized that education on science and, specially, synthetic biology, is mainly conveyed through english speaking material, so we engaged on activities to change this panorama.
We translated a game by Exeter 2016 team and brought a high quality synbio game to the portuguese speaking community. Also, we organized the first edit-a-thon of the wikipedia for synthetic biology in Brazil (and maybe the world), editing and creating many articles in the portuguese wikipedia.
Check it all out here !
Integration of the iGEM community in Brazil
Our human practices also targeted a growing and influential community: the iGEM community! We organized a local Jamboree meeting for people all over Brazil. In this event, we got together to  discuss regulatory, economic, ethical, social, legal, philosophical, ecological and security aspects of our project, the"

Fig14 Cellulose binding assay.
The binding efficiency was determined by measuring the optical density (OD600) of cell suspension before and after incubation with cellulose, as well as its washing buffer.
Fig15 Changes in OD600 before and after incubation with cellulose
The y-axis is the OD600 of the cell suspensions. +/- indicates the presence or lack thereof cellulose during incubation. INPNC-ctl is the negative control, expressing only the INPNC domain. The linearity of OD600 and cell concentration was predetermined, with results confirming linearity in the range of about 0.04~1.00.
Unfortunately, we could not observe significant differences between the binding of INPNC-His-CBDcex to cellulose and binding of negative control (without CBDcex) to cellulose under this assay condition. This experiment was performed essentially in accordance to previously reported assays (Wang et al) [15][16]. However, there are a few differences between the two assays. They expressed CBDcex with Lpp-OmpA surface expression modules, instead of INPNC-His, to conduct cellulose binding assays. Lpp-OmpA is also a well-characterized surface display system .We concluded that our CBD's binding to cellulose under our condition was not as efficient as their reported system.
2. Observing the binding of E-coli to cellulose with fluorescence microscopy
We next conducted fluorescence microscopy to directly observe E. coli cells bound to cellulose. This would allow for detection of binding with increased sensitivity (Fig16).

Single-Domain Antibody Development and Screening
The data obtained by sequencing allows first responders to identify areas of concern within their vehicles and monitor their cleaning habits over the course of several months. However, a more rapid approach is clearly required for day-to-day monitoring of cleanliness in emergency medical vehicles. In order to accomplish this, our team sought to use synthetic biology to evolve single-domain antibodies utilizing a modified bacterial-2-hybrid system. Our construction employed a two-plasmid design, with one plasmid harbouring both an RNA polymerase alpha subunit fused to a target of interest and fluorescent reporter constructs and the other containing a randomized library of single-domain antibody sequences fused to lambda cI.
Figure 3: Dual plasmid design for selection of novel single-domain antibodies. One plasmid contains lambda cI protein coding sequence fused to our generated single-domain antibody library. The second plasmid contains fluorescent reporter proteins as well as the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase fused to a target of interest. This facilitates the identification of tight antibody binding which is detected as a fluorescent signal.
Gene fragments were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Each was successfully amplified and inserted into pSB3K3 and pSB3C5. These plasmids were transformed into DH5α E. coli cells.Single domain antibody generation was informed by bioinformatics analysis and sequence alignment.We were able to identify common motifs within coding sequences for single-domain antibodies termed CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. Each of these were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and subsequently cloned into pSB3C5. All of these CDRs were introduced into an invariant single-domain antibody scaffold by overlap-extension-PCR. We were then able to overexpress the lambda cI fused to the CDR library. This overexpression is designed to facilitate the selection of a multitude of different single-domain antibody variants.

This year we conducted our project brainstorming and development in 3 parts to incorporate the entire team. Since our team consisted of 34 students we decided to first narrow down our potential projects amongst the project director and 4 sub-team leads in February. Through internal brainstorming among our leads team, the first iteration of our “OFF to PriON” project was established.
The foundation of the project idea was then further developed in the second phase of our brainstorming with the rest of the students on our team in early March (click here to learn more about our team). Our team consists of students in programs ranging from biochemistry to nanotechnology who each brought a number of perspectives and knowledge bases.
The third phase of our development consisted of detailed design of the execution of our project which consisted of experimental design, modeling"

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Project's background
       The area near Qiantang River has a profound history of wealth. Hangzhou, in the heart of this area, situated many astonishing lithic cultural relics. Most of them were made during The Ten Kingdoms (A.D. 891-A.D. 979) and Song Dynasty (A.D. 960- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time, but also they"

Offering a new course: Introduction to Synthetic Biology
Related to iGEM opportunity to apply knowledge of synthetic biology, our instructor Liza Figueiredo Felicori Vilela created a new course, called “Introduction to Synthetic Biology”, which students might apply. Therefore, this was an important step to academically set the participation on the iGEM competition and disclosure more and more about SynBio.
UFMG & Escolas Project
In order to introduce children to synthetic biology universe (literally… virtually travelling to Mars!) of present and future applications, we have created and applied a didactic (and, please… fun!) game for middle school students. This opportunity and public arose from a preceding, very prestigious project (called “UFMG & Escolas”, literally UFMG & Schools; http://www.icb.ufmg.br/biq/ufmg-escolas/ ) from the Biological Sciences Institute (ICB) of our university, whose intention is presenting compulsory school students to scientific life. Along a week, students participate in many activities related to what academic community produces. They also have the opportunity of developing and presenting a proposal of an empiric project that they have to idealize and execute.
According to our planning, a short presentation tought students about the concept of synthetic biology, the biological structures, and the iGEM competition. Once students had this basic information, they were oriented to separate themselves into seven groups, dispersed along the room where there were monitors from iGEM_UFMG team. Each group received a card deck and chose an initially secret mission to explore by engineering a genetically modified organism (GMO).
On a first moment, the card game (BRICKARD) was played among the group mates: each student should individually try joining the set of cards that he/she judged propitious to form the GMO able to solve the problem presented in the group mission.
At this time, they only knew details about their own mission, while there were cards related to the other missions, whose utility they ignored. Whether no one could show a complete and congruent set approved by all group mates at the end of 5 minutes, the group together should elect one. On a second phase, independently from how they achieve the set, the whole group should present its mission and chosen solution to everyone, justifying why their set of cards could be used to construct a GMO in order to complete the mission.
The boys and girls were always stimulated to speculate, trace hypotheses and show arguments (for or against), but direct answers"

Haveing finished my bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.) I've started my studies at the Technion's graduate school. The essence of the iGEM competition for me is the development and establishment of a startup company. Besides lab work and science knowledge, it gave me the tools of marketing and the chance to believe in an idea and push it forward to success.

I just finished my bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc) and will begin my research in drug delivery. When working on our project in the iGEM competition I learned many things about myself and about interacting in a group. I met some amazing people, whom I wouldn't get to know otherwise and I'm grateful for this amazing experience. PS I also found out I was too clumsy for those tiny PCR tubes.

I'm about to finish my undergraduate studies in the department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.). To me, iGEM was a sobering experience: it meant peeking out of the undergraduate crib, and catching a glimpse of the real world. Apart from the scientific facet (brainstorming, working in the lab) I've learned a lot about my own abilities. Instead of trying to match up to other peoples' skills, I learned how to identify and harness my own unique strengths (such as my crazy imagination!), while conquering my weaknesses. Another important thing that I learned, is how to work as part of a team (each team member has his own unique perceptions and ideas)- while enjoying the company of some great minds! I am truly grateful for this experience!

pCusC RFP
The design of part BBa_K1980007
We received a copy of pCusC mKate (a form of RFP) from Tom Folliard, one of the PhD students in our lab. This sequence had a biobrick-illegal Spe1 site in the RBS region meaning we could not deposit in the registry. We performed site directed mutagenesis to swap a C in the Spe1 site for G, and moved it into the shipping vector. This part was then deposited. We also amplified the promoter region only and deposited this separately.( BBa_K1980004 )

pCusC CusR RFP
The design of part BBa_K1980009
We also designed a version of the part with CusR expressed before mKate forming a positive feedback loop. This sort of system was shown to be more responsive in a paper by Ravikumar S et al.(5). However after many attempts at cloning our only full length construct had a point mutation (Val to Ala) in the CusR gene. We tested this part to see if this mutation was tolerable, but found no evidence for a more sensitive system:
Plate reader data for BBa_K1980009 after 4 hours
A BspH1 site was included at the start codon of the sfGFP so that other proteins with a compatible start (such as the copper chelators we ligated into our pBAD vector) could be ligated into this location.
Composite Parts
These are parts we produced with a copper chelator under control of a copper-sensitive promoter. If these behave as expected then, if a small concentration of copper is added to cells containing this part, copper will induce expression of the chelator, which would then chelate free copper. If free copper is reduced then chelator expression should be reduced until a stable equilibrium is reached. This copper buffering is dependent upon both the copper promoters behaviour and the copper chelator expression and affinity (see our modelling page ). In practice the level of copper concentrations upon which these systems would operate was below our copper absorbance assay detection limits.

This time, a new idea was proposed by Xiaonan Guo, which is to make a phone-based game in order to popularize synthetic biology and concept of biobricks. People can learn some knowledge on synthetic biology in their leisure time. The proposal interested us a lot and we need to check more information. Before we began to realize this idea, there are a lot of tasks to be done.

For the implementation of the idea we discussed last time, we also need to do a lot of work, and in which deep research is essential. We learned a lot from the game--USTC 2010 IGAME, such as the interface design, understanding a good sense from the perspective of a player. We also discussed AMDL (automatic modeling database language), the smallest gene design software. Last but not the least, we made the plan for the refinement of the game idea proposed last Friday, and discussed the direction and so on. Projects are in progress.

We continued to discuss some software we’ve collected, including Plasmid Automatic Design Software. And from its idea and approaches we can think about how to combine our game and the concept of synthetic biology. Other pieces of software we discussed are BioBricks jtools, which is a small set of utilities; Biomortar, EvoGents, focusing on how to make gene circuits stable based on genetic algorithms; and Agent Based System. Then, we determined agenda for the next meeting. In addition, the coach told us that Gil-- MIT judger -- would come to communicate with  us in our college.

Software we discussed are: Lachesis, a visualization tool based on parametric models. We talked about a literature which introduced how to choose a route from massive biobrick parts by scoring and the feasibility of the parts in the database. Biodesign is a program which automatically connects the selected parts, but it only supports IOS Systems. ABCD which was made by the USTC in 2009 can automatically generate the designed circuit. We also discussed Gil’s trip and our presentations.

The assumptions that we have made are as follow:
The entire root system is assumed to take the  shape of a long cylinder. Hence, a cylindrical coordinate system will be used.
The system is axisymmetric and there is no  variation along the vertical length of the root. Hence,
The system has reached steady state and is  time-independent. Hence,
Degradation of chemoattractant is first order  and is described by f = ks where k is the degradation rate of the  chemoattractant.
Bacterial cell growth and death are neglected.  Hence, g(b,s) = h(b,s) = 0
Applying the assumptions above, equation (1) becomes
Rearranging,

Equation (3) is in the form of the modified Bessel equation.  Hence, the solution of equation (3) is given by,
Where K0 is the modified Bessel function.
Since it is unrealistic for the concentration to increase to  infinity, A=0. And applying the boundary condition, the solution becomes,
