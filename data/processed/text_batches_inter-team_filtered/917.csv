Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Society#Questionnaire#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," organisation to be sustainable over an extended period of time, it is crucial that there exists a continuing influx of people willing to participate in running it. We looked to find out whether or not iGEM alumni chose to be such people, since this would show that the participants enjoyed the experience to such an extent that they would willingly take part again, and perhaps believed in the effectiveness of the outreach programme. If a sufficient proportion of alumni were to contribute further to the iGEM community, it would also make the community self-sustaining, in that solely alumni of the programme itself would be required to keep the organisation running, with no other recruitment necessary (although also possible, and likely to be very welcome!).
Graph 8 shows that almost half of the respondents have participated in iGEM beyond being a student team member. The extent of involvement varied widely, from passively following the progress of new iGEM teams (and communicating with them via social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter) to working at iGEM HQ and becoming a member of the judging panel at the jamboree. Every level of administration seemed to have been covered, though the most popular means of participation was supervising/advising new teams. If this statistic were representative of the entire population of iGEM alumni, which looks to increase by several thousand students each year, then it would seem that iGEM is successfully self-sustaining. However, once again caution must be made against such sweeping statements due to the small size of our sample.
Conclusions
At the outset of our study, we sought to find out how successful iGEM has been as an outreach programme attracting students to the field of synthetic biology, and deduce what lessons could be learned in order to improve such efforts in the future. Though our research has been by no means complete, we do believe that we have garnered sufficient data to draw some tentative conclusions.
Generally, the iGEM alumni who responded to our questionnaire have indeed been influenced by their experiences in the competition. Almost half went on to work in synthetic biology in their future careers, and several more worked in closely related fields. This included many students who were not even studying a biological subject as an undergraduate.
Many of the projects were also continued well beyond the jamboree, with some findings published in highly-regarded scientific journals. This reflects the significance of the scientific findings that have been found or inspired within the context of iGEM projects, and shows that participants can not only learn about the field, but also contribute actively in the science.
These alumni also often went on to contribute further in the"

BIOBRICKS
1 BBa_K124003 – This part is the DNA received from John Mekalanos’ Lab at Harvard Medical School, pvj4. The sequence, 1273 base pairs in length, codes for three different proteins. These three proteins, commonly known as the S, R, and Rz genes, encode for cell lysis. The three genes packaged together are regularly called the “Cell Lysis Cassette.” The S gene is a holin and the R gene is an endolysin. Little is known about the function of the Rz gene in cell lysis but it is involved in many cell lysis processes.

2 BBa_k124014 – Received from Ry Young at Texas A&M. S105 is a mutant of the single S gene in the Cell Lysis Cassette. It’s purpose is to create a hole in the cellular membrane, hence the name “Holin.” This variation of the S gene induces lysis at a faster rate than the Wild Type. The length of time required for complete lysis is much shorter due to the deletion of the antiholin product, S107. The first 6 base pairs of the Wild Type sequence are the N-terminus residues of S107. S105 does not have these first 6 base pairs enabling it to be more efficient at membrane-permeabilizing activity.

Hallo ich heiße Anna und studiere wie die anderen Teammitglieder ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" in Göttingen. Hier eine kleine Geschichte wie ich zur Biologie kam: In meiner Schulzeit hatten wir ein Genetikpraktikum mit einem Professor von einer Universität. Durch diese Laborarbeit habe ich mich damals entschlossen Biologie zu studieren um Wissenschaftlerin zu werden! Ich habe dann meine Bachelorarbeit in der Abteilung für molekulare Strukturbiologie in Göttingen absolviert, wodurch sich mein Interesse an Proteinen verstärkte. Teil des diesjährigen iGEM Teams Göttingen zu sein, bedeutet mir sehr viel, denn ich freue mich darauf eigenständig zu arbeiten und neue Ideen im Team zu entwickeln und umzusetzen.

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Noyes, a fish pathologist at Rome Hatchery, spoke extensively with us about the devastating effects of BCWD on-site.  He mentioned that the disease alone affects roughly 10-20% of fish at 8 out of 10 fish hatcheries in the area. We were able to better understand the process that fish farmers take to treat their fish through our conversations with Andy. Once our prototype was ready, we sent our device to Rome Hatchery for implementation, to gather feedback, and to improve upon the design of fishBIT.
Noyes was very supportive of the fishPHARM system and believed that the application of the fishBit to a few hundred adult fish could benefit several hundred thousand offspring.
“These [fishBIT] would be ideal for broodstock, where numbers of fish handled are only in the tens or hundreds.  And brood should be the target group for something like this because 90% of our infections stem from vertical transmission (mom passes to the egg) … we [fish farmers] may all be using something like this someday.” After his feedback, we were inspired to redesign the prototype with a smaller fish tag for specific use with broodstock.
Cornell Biological Field Station
Background: The Cornell Biological Field Station in Bridgeport, New York is an extension of Cornell University that participates in a government-funded effort to better understand fisheries and aquaculture, with a focus on Oneida Lake and other bodies of freshwater in the state of New York. The station was developed to analyze aquatic population dynamics in Oneida Lake as well as to conduct biological research in many of the surrounding natural aquatic ecosystems and fisheries in upstate New York [3].
Collaboration: Thomas E. Brooking, an aquatic animal employee at the Cornell Biological Field Station,  was able to try out our prototype and has given us more insight on the effectiveness of fishBIT. He found the fish tag component to be fairly flexible and prone to yieldig under stress  when it came to tagging fish with tougher skin. He believed that the “the barb needed some reinforcement to be less brittle.”  We took this feedback into account by modifying our prototype design to be more durable.
Economic Analysis
Oxytetracycline (branded as Terramycin) costs roughly $0.70/gram. Since the total amount of antibiotic required for a 10-day treatment is 25 g/100 lbs, treatment of a fish stock with Terramycin costs about $0.025 per dollar of fish [4]. However, Terramycin is already becoming obsolete as a treatment protocol due to the rapid formation of"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," iron cores were unloaded. Moved onto magnetoferritin synthesis, but the resulting product contained a lot of particles in it, we fear this may be due to synthesis of magnetite crystals in addition to magnetoferritin.
We did our tested heavy ferritin as ordered from the synthesis company for expression on an SDS-PAGE. The J04500 LacI induced promoter was induced with 0.8mM IPTG for four hours at 0.6OD for the cultures. The protein was either not expressed or was too difficult to distinguish from the background proteins in the cell. Protein trials will be repeated once we assemble construct two in iGEM’s pSB1C3.
Also continued on with the ABTS kinetics experiments. We were able to create graphs showing the effectiveness of our catalyst under varying pH.
GAPHPPHPHPH
Week 16: August 12 - August 16
Finished off the ABTS kinetics experiments for prussian blue ferritin, which involved finding the optimal temperature for the reaction. But the spectrophotometer available to us is limited to 25-45C. This limitation is still within our expected prototype temperature and therefore it is not a big worry. We will then continue on with determining the kinetics for TMB and find out which substrate is better for our system.
Week 17: August 19 - August 23
Due to multiple failures of the plasmid switches of both ferritin and other parts, we conducted tests on multiple aspects of our procedures, including ligase, phosphatase and buffer. None of these parts were determined to be problematic, therefore we attempted higher DNA concentrations on controls, which worked. Therefore we will attempt the plasmid switch of the ferritin parts at some other time.
We also began initial tests with TMB, but realized our stock concentrations were at 1mg/mL. As these results would be incomparable to our ABTS experiments, which were at 10mg/mL, we remade the TMB stock solution to 10mg/mL and redid the experiments.
Week 18: August 26 - August 30
Our first attempts at observing one of our fusion proteins on SDS-PAGE were conducted, although the bands do not appear to contain the protein. We’ve read about a technique that can stain iron, which is essentially the same as the creation of Prussian Blue ferritin. Using this method we could exploit the iron core of ferritin by running a native PAGE and staining the iron core. This would then confirm the presence of our protein, therefore we ran initial tests of this method by running dilutions"

They were plated only in KAN, CRB, and CAM. There was a second transformation that involved a positive control provided by the Vmax kit. Colony growth was seen only in KAN and CAM plates. No type of reporter color was seen in any plate. The KAN plate has two size colonies growing.
Figure 3: Transformation of One-Tube Reaction Into Vibrio natriegens. Using a single-tube plasmid mix, non-model organism, Vibrio natriegens was transformed. Growth can be seen on this kanamycin-containing LB plate. It should be noted that two distinct colony morphologies are present. Neither showed distinct colored or fluorescent phenotypes — some colonies were lightly colored.
Transformation into Vibrio natriegens was only really seen in the KAN plate (Figure 3), to which three assembly plasmids contain the antibiotic resistance gene. The protocol for transforming into Vmax cells (electrocompetent V. natriegens) sites the presence of two types of colonies as evidence for successful transformation, the smaller size colonies being the ones with the extra burden of expressing the additional plasmid. This would lead us to believe that the transformation was succesful. We received the positive control from the Barrick lab who told us that the quality of controls was not optimal, which might explain its lack of functionality. There were hints of color in the smaller colonies that grew in KAN, but what was observed could not be considered conclusive evidence of reporter genes being expressed. This lack of color in the KAN plate, and lack of growth in other plates could be due to the inefficiency of the promoter that is currently present in the completed assemblies. Up until this point, we had been making our assemblies with the GlpT promoter. However, this promoter does not have a particularly broad host range, which may explain why the transformations did not appear to be as successful. The lack of reporter expression in V. natriegens has led us to begin transitioning to using the CP25 promoter in our assemblies and bridge parts, because it is considerably more broad host range and has a higher expression rate, and therefore will be more compatible kit design and use. .
We have several options for next steps. These involve picking colonies and plating them on new plates to see if they grow normally, and/or sequencing colonies for their bar"

Marty McFly: “What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?”
Dr. Emmett Brown: “Well, I figured, what the hell.”
We have shown that it is possible to make Bacteriorganic Rubber.
The stated goal of our project was to prove the concept - that it was indeed possible for E. coli produce rubber. Although not a part of the project, we also considered the possibilities and challenges a continuation of our project would bring.
The next steps are to optimize the bacterial rubber production. Then, if  resources were available, a scale production could be tested. The bacteria would be cultivated in a big container, possibly underground to not take up arable land, and rubber synthesis would be induced. At the appropriate time - after bacteria die from rubber poisoning -  rubber would be available to harvest, and the system would be ready to make a new batch.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Description
In order to engage the community, we presented our iGEM 2018 Living Battery project along with a DNA Code Game to a middle school innovative underwater robotics program– also known as The SeaPerch Program. The SeaPerch Program provides students with the opportunity to learn about robotics, engineering, science, and mathematics (STEM) while building an underwater ROV as part of a science and engineering technology curriculum.  Our purpose is to educate the youth about the risks of a damaged global environment due to the greenhouse gases in our community, in addition to enlightening them on a different discipline in STEM- in this case, synthetic biology.  In order to engage the students, we taught them our DNA Code Game found in the iOS App Store.  The students had a lot of fun playing the game and learning about DNA.

Here is a screenshot from the App Store where you can download the game for free.

In the lab
Tiff finished the last day of the diffusion assay
Nelly and David performed some adhesive experiments. They experienced problems and they are as follow:
The adhesive did not stick to the liner completely
Uneven distribution of adhesive on liner
Wednesday, August 3rd
Christine did the data analysis for the diffusion assay
Nelly and David are testing adhesive. There were different methods used in doing these tests. They are as follow:
Rolling pin test
An amount of adhesive was applied to the release liner.
A cut out of EVA membrane was placed onto the adhesive.
Place another layer of the release liner on the membrane to prevent the adhesives from sticking to the rolling pin.
Roll the pin on the layer to distribute adhesive.
Let it dry.
Film application test
An amount of adhesive was applied to the release liner. The adhesive must be applied I a straight line.
Spread the adhesive using a popsicle stick to form a thin film.
Wait for a minute before placing a cut out of EVA membrane onto the release liner to dry
Two - release - liner - sandwiched - together test
An amount of adhesive was applied to the release liner. The adhesive must be applied in a spiral manner.
Place another layer of the release liner onto the initial liner.
Spread the adhesive using a rolling pin, by pressing, etc. until you see a clear film (meaning, no air bubbles, no accumulated glue anywhere, etc.)
Wait for 20 minutes to let the adhesives settle for a bit.
Peel the liners apart.
Place a cutout of the EVA membrane onto the liner.
Let it dry.
Results from the adhesive tests:
Rolling pin test: Opposite to what was expected, the adhesives were unevenly distributed. Air bubbles and bumps of glue were present. Some had not completely dried up, forming webs when peeled, some had.
Film application test: The adhesives were unevenly distributed.
Two - release - liner - sandwiched - together test: The adhesives were unevenly distributed, but this method was the most effective one. See pic below!

Summary
Bacterial transformation is a commonly used protocol in synthetic biology. It can be used for a variety of functions, such as testing whether or not a genetic circuit is functional. Transformation allows bacterial cells, such as Escherichia coli, to take in and express external DNA fragments. Transformation consists of heat shock to damage cells and promote the taking up of external plasmids, recovery to prevent cells from dying, and a final culturing. From there, cells are analyzed.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform transformation. Suspended cells and plasmid are metered on the chip and are then mixed together. The solution then undergoes heat shock in a time-dependent mixing element for exactly 30 seconds. The solution can then be pipetted out from the chip into a recovery tube on ice.
This chip has been milled and tested, but not deemed fully fluid functional as of this time. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," complexity below the surface. Even though animal models suggest that intervening with ageing has had a positive impact on the healthy lifespan of the animals, we are still not able to guarantee the same effects on humans. Biosynthage wanted to make sure that even though we are proposing novel synthetic biology products to solve a real world problem, that we are still addressing the negative issues that our products also raise. Therefore, it was even more important that we have incorporated safety into the design of each idea.
After designing our SOD3 system, we wanted to find out what the experts in the ageing field think of our ideas We talked to William Bains, who is an ageing researcher and knows a lot about emerging therapies within the field. He told us that he thought that the gene therapy was a good idea, rapid and interesting. We also discussed that research indicates that oxidative stress is actually good for the body, and that we neede to conside this in our design. William bains suggested that it would be a good idea to titrate our system in a way in which SOD3 is only released when it senses high levels of oxidative stress. Therefore, in the future we would change the design such that our system will be activated by nfkb induced promotor. Nfkb is a transcription factor that is only released when it senses reactive oxidative species.
It is possible that we could add more nfkb binding sites to the existing promotor in the registry made by a previous 14_ATOMS-Turkiye team such that high levels of nfkb are required to release SOD3.  This would make our gene therapy safer for the body, and more controlled.
Why did we chose to do gene therapy
There has been attempts of making an oral supplement with pure SOD enzyme to act as an ageing therapy, but it's been found that the SOD protein molecule is easily deactivated by harsh acids and enzymes contained in the digestive tract. No-one has yet made a SOD gene therapy. Also the lungs is highly susceptible to oxidative stress hence we combined the two ideas for a novel approach.
The generation of free radicals and their involvement in ageing have been a concern in the past years. These agents are atoms or molecules with an unpaired electron in the outer shell, which makes most of them highly reactive towards several relevant biomolecules. The proposed free radical theory of ageing establishes that the progression of ageing is because the accumulation of damage caused by these radicals, over a period of time. One example is the free radical called superoxide (O2-), which is a by-product of the respiratory cycle in every aerobic organism. The unregulated presence of"

Construction and Application of AI-2 Response Device
In order to further demonstrate whether our AI-2 Controllers can actually work in real environment, we designed a simulated collective behavior scenario in which the expression of fluorescence protein GFP is controlled by a promoter which could respond to AI-2. We co-cultured the Response Device with Controllers and used fluorescence microscopy to directly observe the GFP fluorescence of the cells in the media. The GFP fluorescence results were in line with our expectations.

Transportation of petroleum-containing micelle by magnetotaxis
By using magnetotaxis, we can concentrate the microorganism at a certain place once the organism consumes petroleum (Formation of a micelle by using hydrophobic outer membrane is a difficult task, however.)
Additionally, the possibility of drug-detecting E.coli. Fluorescing upon detection.
Dealing with automobile exhaust
Incorporation of a gene that enables the microorganism to perform denitrification. (Removal of NO2, SO2)
Formation of a semi-permeable membrane that only allows passage of gas.
With this membrane in-between, exhaust and the liquid containing the microorganism will flow in opposite directions.
Rare-earth-metal-detecting microorganism
Microorganism that can detect lanthanides.
Formation of a porphyrin that can bind specifically with a desired ion size. Porphyrin will bind with lanthanides.
After binding, recollect the microorganism and extract the metal.
Bacteria for drought preparation
Expression of a polysaccharide with many OHs on bacteria’s outer membrane.
These OHs can bind exceptionally well with water, enabling them to hold a relatively large amount of water.
Once drought begins, bacteria will form an endospore, allowing them to survive the drought, and plants will be able to absorb water from them.

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,"yncratic needs and hence expertise, it proposes that community-based libraries will outperform individual companies. The industry will probably have a large number of small, distinctive customers, meaning that patent licensing will be less attractive and the open-parts initiative more so5.
Normally, the value of a patent depends on the inventor’s initial R&D investment, but with synthetic biology parts it would depend on that as well as how many researchers have subsequently used that part. According to the law, this allows patent owners to capture both sources of value, which can be unfair to society as they must deal with high prices without getting anything more in return. The open-parts initiative sets the price of parts equal to zero, so it is naturally able to solve that problem. There are two incentives that will draw companies to an open-parts initiative. The first would be the opportunity to share R&D investments among multiple firms and secondly the opportunity to produce parts faster due to shared insights6.
Barriers and Disadvantages
About twenty years ago when software became standardized, it opened the path for Microsoft to come in, take over the industry and monopolize it. Can something similar potentially happen in the synthetic biology industry? At the moment, synthetic biology is what is called a ‘tipping market’. It is unstable and prone to monopoly. Building on this, the tipping dynamic is indifferent to whether or not the dominant parts constellation is open or closed. If for instance a mature industry is able to grab a hold of these shared parts, it can work towards this open-parts initiative. Though on the other hand, companies, out of necessity will also pay for closed parts, both solutions are equally viable.
Some other issues include an agreement on standard nomenclature for the parts, therefore when actually designing a database, controversies might come up. As well when collaboration occurs there must be adequate legal infrastructure. This must include a license specifying the rights and duties of members. One of the main legal problems is that gene data is unlike software, it cannot be copyrighted.
Many pessimists towards the idea say that it is now too late for synthetic biology to use an open-parts collaboration. Now with Amyris’ advancement in the field it seems that this industry might monopolize and follow the path that Microsoft had. The fact that commercial synthetic biology receives so much government support shows a bit of laissez faire attitude. In America’s Department of Energy $350 million biofuel initiative there was no open-parts requirement at all. It is said that at least when Bill Gates cornered the software market he did it with private money7.

For the first time in the history of evolution, a species has flipped the tables. They routinely outdo the evolution that made them. They haven't killed it, but they could. There is no technical barrier for human genetic modification. They've levelled up.

""Motivation in Scottish academic excellence""
Veronica Valentina Rezelj was born and raised in Argentina. She moved to Slovenia during high school, where she completed the international Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Now she studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, which has a strong reputation for academic excellence.
In the three years of her studies she was included in the University Dean’s list, and she is now involved in a undergraduate team taking part in the iGEM synthetic biology competition. Competitors construct and operate biological systems in living cells. ThisiGEM team seeksto use the combined dynamics of synthetic biology, computer science and engineering to create both a novel precious metal recycling scheme as well as a renewable source of essential fatty acids Omega-3. They are planning to recreate an Omega-3 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in E. Coli, while also trying to produce a series of metal-binding proteins, through which they intend to create a new way of recycling them. By representing her Scottish university in this competition, she is not only gaining experience and knowledge in laboratory research, but she is also able to contact the global scientific community and with Slovenia, where she is planning to return after her studies.

Fig.1  Farmers release nutrient (graphed in green) into surrounding grids
Placing Warriors
When placed, warriors eject AHLs to surrounding 3×3 grids, and the amount in each grid increases by 1; Then the amount of AHL molecule will hold on until the farmer is removed. When warriors being removed, the amount decreases by 1.
Fig.2  Warriors release AHLs (graphed in red) into surrounding grids
Iteration rules
In the i_k-th iteration, our program traverses the whole mesh grid and checks for two missions: death penalty and probabilistic growth based on states of the i_(k-1)-th iteration. We may call the grid which the program is checking ‘present grid’ for convenience.
Death Penalty
There are two and only two cases which causes cell death: nutrient in present grid is depleted; or there are enemy AHLs in present grid. It is noted that farmers cannot die of case I because they create nutrient themselves. As for case II, when AHL-I and AHL-II are in adjacent grid and the colony inside the grid is warrior, one of them will be killed (randomly).
Another mission during iteration is to simulate bacterial growth. Concentration of AHL is excluded in this section, because it only functions in Death Penalty part. Since nutrient contribute to cell growth, a natural idea is to set a probabilistic model of any empty grid, described by a linear equation:
Where (x,y) are coordinates of present grid, P_k (x,y) is the probability an adjacent cell can grow into present grid in i_k-th iteration, C_k (x,y) is concentration of nutrient in present grid in i_k-th iteration, α is a coefficient that remains unchanged during simulation. We have tried different values of α and eventually set α=0.013 to fit experimental results well.
This equation helps our program to judge whether or not an adjacent cell can grow into present grid in i_k-th iteration; after this judgement is settled, we choose randomly from surrounding grids that have cells in them, supposing we select cell A, and inherit its cell type to get clone cell B in present grid. Now we see cell A successfully ‘grow’ into present grid and has its duplicate cell B. Note that when B is generated, aforementioned placement rules will be applied according to B’s type and position.

Introduction"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", our results for the comparison between tetp with and without the PhlF transcription unit (Figure 5.) showed that the fluorescence activity driven by tetp with the PhlF transcription unit was higher than that without the PhlF transcription unit. This is unexpected and further investigation is needed to explain this phenomenon.
To investigate crosstalk between lacp and TetR:
To investigate crosstalk between lacp and PhlF:
We compared the fluorescence activity of the two constructs above against a GFP generator driven by lacp (the construct that was used to characterize lacp promoter strength).
Figure 6. Comparison between the fluorescence expression levels of lacp with and without TetR transcription unit. Negative control represents BBa_E0240. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bar present SD from 3 biological replicates.
Figure 7. Comparison between the fluorescence expression levels of lacp with and without PhlF transcription unit Negative control represents BBa_E0240. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bar present SD from 3 biological replicates.
Due to the high error bar generated from our results, we could not make a reliable inference regarding the interaction between TetR and lacp despite the mean fluorescence output of the lacp driven GFP generator being much lower than that of one with a TetR transcription unit upstream to it. Unfortunately, we could not repeat this set of characterization due to time constraint. With regards to PhlF interaction with lacp, our results seem to suggest that PhlF may have a repressing effect on lacp. This needs to be taken into account when fine tuning our design to ensure that the crosstalk doesn't result in instability.
Performance of Promoters under Full Workload
We were also interested in studying how well the promoters perform when they are driving the expression of two repressors on top of the reporter gene just like how they would be in the full Tristable Switch construct. To visualize how well the promoters would perform under full workload, the following constructs were built:
To investigate performance of phlFp:

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

-The wetlab is having trouble with their ligation protocols
-Problem with calculation and concentration, should be fixed soon
-Items and equipments in the wetlab is now more organized and labeled
-Jenhan is taking on a new project, DNA security using invertices
Meanwhile I am working on getting the restriction digest / ligation connection working. Before Swapnil headed out for the TASBE meeting, he wanted me to try to get PuppetShow working on my computer. I had no problem getting it to work on my Mac but installing it in the virtual machine was somewhat troublesome because I kept on encountering errors upon building. In the end however, I finally got PuppetShow to build. I then spent the rest of my day trying to get PuppetShow's stack configuration to run all pieces of the project so that pressing the execute button will run all three pieces of the project and start Evoware. We had trouble doing this because we only have one line to execute each piece of the project and we cannot 'cd' since the root directory is reset after each command to the PuppetShow project directory. We managed to get RM running with the right command.

The iGEM Team Tübingen provided us with a construct coding for the Spy-Tag.
For the establishment of a specific surface on the glass slide of the DiaCHIP we followed different approaches. Among others, we planned to test a surface with SpyCatcher immobilized on top of an activated silane layer. The SpyCatcher would then interact specifically with Spy-tagged proteins. In order to be able to verify the predicted function of our surface before performing cell-free expression , the iGEM Team Tübingen kindly provided us with a purified carboxyfluorescine labeled SpyTag .
Unfortunately, we were not able to establish a SpyCatcher surface and test the corresponding SpyTag we received from Team Tübingen due to time constraints."

So we don’t have to cut the annealed primers, because the sites should appear with correct annealing of FW and RV primers. The goal is to clone the different promoters, the PCR products with the different laccase genes with His-Tag in pSB1C3 in one ligation step. Furthermore we want to exclude the possibility that the His-tag is the reason for no activity, so we also want to clone the gene sequences without a His-tag under control of a constitutive promoter in pSB1C3.
Additionally we want to produce the constructs with a new T7 promoter. After our laccases were not expressed we now think that maybe the RBS <partinfo>BBa_B0034</partinfo>, which we changed in our primers from originally 5' aAagaggagaaa 3' to 5' aGagaggagaaa 3' is not or poorly recognized from the ribosomes in the cells.
We have a primer pair from last year with the T7 promoter sequence with the RBS BBa_B0034. The primers can be annealed to an oligonucleotide. After boiling the primers and cooling down there should be an oligonucleotide with an EcoRI and a PstI restriction site. We now want to assemble the promoter the laccase genes and the pSB1C3 vector in one step. The pSB1C3 backbone was digested with EcoRI and PstI, the laccases with XbaI and PstI, and the promoter has the restriction sites SpeI and EcoRI (we have to digest the promoter with SpeI, because the original restriction site is PstI).

Purification of tvel35 PCR product and digestion for cloning in pSB1C3 backbone.
Ligation of tvel5 laccase with pSB1C3 backbone.
Team Site Directed Mutagenesis: Plated four colonies per dish of tvel-t243g and tvel-t1161a for plasmid-isolation.
Test-restriction of the xccl-mutants showed that no colony was mutated correctly
The second site directed mutagenesis of bpul-g2317t could not be rated by test-digestion, since the mutation at 2317 is not because of a illegal restriction site, but a amino acid alternating mutation.

Creating the Pathway Architecture
The models for our formate and fructose pathways each consist of two compartments, four reactions and 14 or 15 species, respectively. The initial goal for our project was to produce a co-culture of cells consisting of “sMMO Cells” that produce methanol and “Formate/Fructose Cells” that detoxify methanol, all in an effort to completely biodegrade methane. The first compartment in our model shown below is the “sMMO Cell” that converts methane to methanol, which travels to the second compartment of our model, either the “Formate” or “Fructose Cell.” Each species represents a different molecule involved in our pathway. The architecture for our Formate pathway displays a progression of compounds starting at methane and ending at carbon dioxide. In all, this pathway is facilitated by four enzymes.
The first half of each pathway is identical. The first enzyme used in each pathway is sMMO, which catalyses the oxidation of methane to methanol while simultaneously oxidizing NADH to NAD+. Both pathways then proceed to oxidize methanol to formaldehyde, which is a reaction catalyzed by the MDH2 enzyme.
Once formaldehyde is produced, the two pathways begin to differ. In the Formate Pathway, formaldehyde is first oxidized to formate, which is then oxidized to carbon dioxide by FALDH and FDH enzymes respectively. In the Fructose Pathway, formaldehyde is incorporated into a 5 carbon sugar by HPS to make D-arabinose 6-phosphate, a 6 carbon sugar. PHI then converts D-arabinose 6-phosphate into D-fructose-6-phosphate, which is a substrate of glycolysis.

A 555 µl cuvette sample was transferred to an eppendorf tube and incubated for 40 min at 37°C.
A 100 µl sample was spreadplated onto agar plates containing carbenicillin and incubated O/N at 37°C.
A 20 µl PCR reaction was set up using a GG level 1 acceptor as template DNA containing the primers P1: 0349(PRO+5U) and 0353 (3U+TER) and P2: 0350 (PRO+5U) and 0354 (3U+TER).
A TBE buffer 1% agarose gel was poured for diagnostic purposes to check the amplification of the PCR products.
PCR product purification
Pre-percipitation to remove TAQ polymerase and protein was completed followed by phenolchloroform extraction (x2). Aqueous layer is removed and discarded leaving DNA.
Precipitation to remove buffer was carried out by adding Na acetate (10%) and ethanol causing the DNA to come out of solution. Aspirator was used to remove buffer, salt and ethanol.
A salt wash was completed to remove the acetate and ethanol.
Sample was incubated at 65°C for 2 min to evaporate the ethanol.
Thursday
Checked Dig-Lig tranformation plates grown O/N and poor blue white selection observed with many blue colonies.
Selected 2 white colonies from each plate and colony PCR performed to check whether DNA corresponded to the DNA expected.
Following colony PCR, amplified fragments ran on gel to determine size and therefore whether they contained the construct.
Decided to repeat the 11 Dig-Lig experiments.
Ran digested PCR product from 25.06.2014 on a diagnostic 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer and determined that LacZ had internal restriction enzyme cut sites and product was split into two bands.
Friday
Found poor blue/white selection on dig-ligs from 26.06.14. Suspected to be due to either the enzyme used or PCR block settings.
Set up a new set of dig-ligs to test the source of this problem.

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," Switch
We choose toehold switch as our miRNA detector. The structure of toehold switch is similar to hairpin, except it has a loop at the top as ‘toehold’. Toehold switch functions as riboregulator through linear-linear interaction between RNAs. When target RNA appears, it will bind one of the toehold switch stems and open the loop, exposing the RBS.
Toehold switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the switch and trigger. The switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. Upstream of this coding sequence is a hairpin-based processing module containing both a strong RBS and a start codon that is followed by a common 21 nt linker sequence coding for low-molecular-weight amino acids added to the N terminus of the gene of interest. A single-stranded toehold sequence at the 50 end of the hairpin module provides the initial binding site for the trigger RNA strand. This trigger molecule contains an extended single-stranded region that completes a branch migration process with the hairpin to expose the RBS and start codon, thereby initiating translation of the gene of interest.
Our Circuit to Detect miRNA-144
There are 3 parts in our circuit in total.
Part 1 includes toehold switch for miRNA-144 and GFP coding sequence. When miRNA-144 exists, the switch is on and mRNA for GFP is transcribed.
Part 2 contains toehold switch for GFP mRNA and T3 RNA polymerase coding sequence (BBa_K346000). Note that, since the maximum length of trigger RNA for toehold switch is about 25nt, so we analyzed GFP mRNA’s structure and choose a small piece from it which ensures binding specificity and stability.
Part 3 is simply a GFP generator (BBa_E0840), with T3 promoter. As we know, T3 promoter can only function when bound with T3 RNA polymerase.
So now it’s clear that, part 2 and part 3 are designed for amplification. They form a positive feedback loop. So the whole process is as follow: when miRNA-144 exists, it triggers part 1 and GFP mRNAs are transcribed. These mRNA on the one hand can be directly translated to GFP and show green fluorescence, on the other hand, can trigger part 2 and T3 RNA polymerase is transcribed and translated, which enables part 3 to work, thus transcribe more GFP mRNAs. And these GFP mRNAs can also be used to active more part"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Toxicity Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," the nanoparticles (Hwang et al., 2008). The toxic effects of silver salts have been known since antiquity. Even Hippocrates recognized its antimicrobial properties in water (Magner, 1992). The toxic effect of silver ions relies on the same chemical features as those of the AgNPs. When being exposed to silver ions, the bacterium experiences several forms of oxidative stress, mainly ROS which arise from Fenton chemistry. Ag(I) disrupts metabolic pathways that drive Fenton chemistry and lead to the overproduction of hydroxyl radicals and cell death (Morones-Ramirez et al., 2013). At a concentration of 18.9 µM, all bacterial growth comes to an end (Zhao & Stevens, 1998). Silver is toxic in both of its forms: as a nanoparticle and as dissolved ions. Therefore, an approach to decrease the toxic effect on the cell is needed.
Figure 2: Toxic effects of silver nanoparticles and silver ions on the cell. Silver nanoparticles and silver ions lead to a rising level of ROS which cause oxidative stress and damage to the DNA, proteins and the membrane.
Copper
Copper is known for its toxic and bactericidal properties and is often used as an antimicrobial agent in form of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) (Cioffi et al., 2005). Recent studies revealed that the inactivation and bactericidal activity works in a size-dependent manner. The smaller a CuNP is the higher is its inhibitory potential to bacteria. Furthermore, the toxicity is probably elicited in a strain-specific manner in E. coli obtained from different sources (Alum et al., 2018). CuNPs’ toxic properties appear to result from oxidative stress and protein damage, DNA damage and membrane damage. The generation of hydroxyl peroxide by CuNPs is assumed to be the reason for the toxicity of CuNPs. Li et al. reported 2013 the release of copper and the production of Cu(I) ions. Copper is considered to be essential in small amounts to both human and bacteria (Burgess et al., 1999). It plays an important role in electron-transfer reactions (Kaplan & Lutsenko, 2009). Yet copper ions can induce cell death and exhibit toxic effects. This is due to copper ions interfering with the cell proteins or enzymes by chelating sulfhydryl groups and peroxidizing the lipids of the cell membrane (Yeager, 1991). A broad variety of microorganisms, such as E. coli, are inhibited in growth"
WITS-CSIR_SA,2011,Team:WITS-CSIR SA#Project#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html,"   Functionality such as graphical user interface integration was provided and allowed more time to be dedicated to the modelling of the bacterial motility.
The Movement Algorithm
Chemotaxis in E. coli bacteria is achieved by the altering of a signalling pathway to the bacterial flagellar motors [1].  The flagella of the bacterium are capable of both clockwise and counter-clockwise motion.  The former leads to a reorientation of the bacterium: a tumble [1,2].  The latter leads to a fairly straight propulsion of the bacterium through the medium: a run [1,2].  By altering the frequency of tumbles and runs, the bacterium effectively undergoes selective locomotion towards more favourable regions.  This so-called biased random walk [2] is simulated in the program with a two-state model.
Effectively, each bacterium is associated with the particular chemoattractant that dictates its motion (specified by the functioning of the riboswitch).  The diffusion of this chemical is simulated by the inverse square law; the point concentration decreases with time, whilst the spread (or radius) of the chemical increases.  The first state of the model occurs when a bacterium is outside this chemical radius.  In this instance, a bacterium’s movement is dominated by tumbles.  The second instance is when the bacterium lies within the chemical concentration gradient.  In this case, the frequency of runs is higher and dictated by the distance between the bacterium and the chemical point-source.  Again, an inverse square relationship was used.
Inputs and Outputs
The simulator allows users to specify the experimental setup.  Alterable variables include:
The number of bacteria to simulate
The bacterial speed
The bacterial sensitivity to the chemoattractants
The initial concentration of attractants
The diffusion rate constant of the attractants
The distribution grid resolution and size (see below)
The simulation program models the bacterial motion and creates useful measurements of the scenario.  These include:
A discreet probability density function of bacterial location (as in the figure below)
The maximum and average times of flight it took a bacterium to reach each attractant
Verification
In order to verify the model, it was necessary to determine the extent to which the directed chemotaxis varied the bacteria’s motion from that of random movement.  To this end, the number of bacteria in the toggled state (after coming into contact with the chemoattractant) over time, as a function of the initial chemical concentration was determined.  A number of runs of the simulation tool under the same initial chemical concentration were performed. "

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," third lane is the original protein solution and the forth is the protein solution which used ATPS to purify. We can see that some bulk proteins have been removed. This fusion protein is GFP-sJanus. The first and second lane are GFP-sJanus, because we didn’t dilute the protein’s solution, the concentration of protein is so high (about 3mg/mL) that they overflowed. The next is 100ug/mL and 50ug/mL.
Figure 2. We used Bandscan5.0 to analysis the gel. We can see that other proteins have been removed all in the third and fourth lane. Meanwhile, we can see that other proteins have been removed to some degree in the fifth and sixth lane.
We calculated the efficiency of this experiment. It is 18.93% in the third and fourth lane and 46.17% in the fifth and sixth lane. The efficiency is a bit low and we analyzed the reasons. We added 10uL of Berol 532 in this system to extract the target protein. However, the total amount of protein is so large that our detergent can’t extract them all.
Formal experiment using Berol 532 as detergent and MCAC0 as buffer
Process of this experiment
In our first formal experiment, we changed some conditions. We increased the speed of shaker to 300r/min in order to make them mixed totally. Meanwhile, in the pre-experiment, we found that we didn’t need to use centrifuge to make them separated because they can divided into two phases automatically in few seconds at the room temperature(Berol 532, article says that its low solubility does not allow cloud point measurement). We used 20% (v/v) Berol to extract our fusion proteins. If less detergent used in this system, it will increase the final concentration of proteins, but it will decrease the efficiency of extraction because detergent is lacking in combing the fusion protein.
The volume of our system is about 5mL (We used original solution which got by centrifuge and high pressure after suspending by MCAC0). We added 1mL Berol 532(20% w/w) in our original solution. And then, we used shaker to make them mixed at the speed of 300r/min and 20 centigrade working about one hour. We put the tube at the room temperature and the mixture was separated into two phases in few seconds. We got the upper phase (2mL) and added water saturated butanol (5mL). Then we used centrifuge to"
TU_Dresden,2017,Team:TU Dresden#Project#Secretion_-_-_TEXT.html," Wild type supernatant is shown as a control (pink). Excitation wavelength for sfGFP was set to 480 nm and emission was recorded at 510 nm and for mCherry excitation wavelength was set to 585 nm and emission was recorded at 615 nm. The fluorescence was normalized by the optical density (OD600). Graph shows mean values and standard deviations of at least two biological and three technical replicates.
Figure 5: Endpoint measurement of the fluorescence obtained under different conditions. B. subtilis strain WB800N with a single copy of mCherry- mini. SpyCatcher is compared to the wild type after 16 h of incubation and initial induction with 1% xylose. Pink bars show the harvested supernatant, purple bars refer to pelleted cells resuspended in fresh medium and blue bars to non-processed cell solution. Excitation wavelength was set to 585 nm and emission was recorded at 615 nm. Graph shows mean values and standard deviations of at least two biological and three technical replicates.
To check the efficiency of the secretion process, we also determined the fluorescence of the cells. The supernatant was separated from the cells by centrifugation.
The pelleted cells were resuspended in fresh medium, immediately followed by a fluorescence measurement (assuming the recorded fluorescence exclusively derives from FPs still inside the cells). We compared the relative fluorescence of both samples and also included untreated 16h old cell culture in this assay.
Figure 5 shows data generated for one strain (mCherry-mini. SpyCatcher) as an example. While the relative fluorescence in the unprocessed cell culture and the supernatant do not differ significantly, the emission of the fresh-resuspended cells show a clear drop of fluorescence (comparable to the wild-type level).
This clearly demonstrates that indeed the measured fluorescence intensities derive from secreted FPs.
Fluorescence assay of supernatants derived from strains with multi copy genes:
To further increase the secretion capacity, three constructs were sub-cloned into the pBS0E vector which is a medium copy number B. subtilis specific vector. When performing the same fluorescence assay as bevor, we obtained eight to ten times higher fluorescence intensities in the supernatants when compared to the supernatants derived from single copy (Figure 6).

The next figures show the switch from 42º to IPTG for two different experiments:
The next figures show the switch from IPTG to 42º:
As is it shown in the charts, the switch engaged by temperature is quicker and stronger than the one elicited by IPTG. Temperature changes the structure of all the cI repressor instantly, while the IPTG takes some time to enter the cell and bind to the lacI repressor.
We’ve only tried the stability of only the RFP state, finding out it last 16 h at least. This effect is very noticeable when the growth takes place in a plaque, where you can see the change of colour without UV-light.

Southern California iGEM 2015 Meetup
On August 6th, our team met with 2 iGEM teams -La Verne and UCLA- at the first Southern California iGEM meetup held at UCLA.  Our whole team attended along with two of our advisors, Phillip and Bart.  We discussed our projects and how to make iGEM a sustainable program at our respective universities because we were all relatively new teams.  Fundraising and garnering support from our academic departments were significant.  Also, we considered the possibility of starting a smaller synthetic biology conference in California.  Overall, we had a great time meeting new people over pizza and cookies!
TP_CC San Diego iGEM Team Mentorship
We ended our week by meeting up with the Torrey Pines and Canyon Crest San Diego high school iGEM team on September 4th.  The team shared with us the aim of their project and their progress.  Also, we offered input about several applications that they mentioned.  Both teams talked about our approach to Human Practices and we informed TP_CC San Diego about how we tackled funding and gained sponsorships from laboratories and biotech companies.
TP_CC San Diego presented issues they were facing: Since minimal research had been done on LbCHI31-chitinase before, they had difficulty mapping the effectiveness of the encoding gene against varied concentrations of purified chitin. A few of us helped troubleshoot. Due to the limited amount of time left, they wanted to run the trail in silico but did not have experience with modeling.  Therefore, we gave insight on modeling and how the results should relate to laboratory work.
Before they left, one of our team members sent a guide on wiki editing to help expedite the designing process for TP_CC San Diego.

MSU iGEM has succeeded in inducing current from induction of a selected chemical.
We measured the results using both IPTG and current.
Below is a video showing the working bioreactors outputting current.

The earlier graph compared to the one above. Shows how viability of cells earlier on produces a larger current increase compared to background expression.
Multiple Strains
Induction occurring at around 22 hours showing a doubling in current. The background control strains are shown here which display how little current is produced when mtrB is not present.
Contaminant Induction
Nitrate GFP Induction
Induction displayed very clearly by optimal concentration levels of nitrate. It appears that contaminant levels > .5µM prove to be toxic to the cells. IPTG was added at the beginning at 100µM concentration.
Paraquat GFP Induction
Induction displayed very clearly by optimal concentration levels of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide was used as an inducer instead of Paraquat for safety so the promoter appears to be sensitive to multiple reactive oxygen species. It appears that contaminant levels > .5µM prove to be toxic to the cells. IPTG was added at the beginning at 100µM concentration.
Copper GFP Induction
Induction displayed very clearly by optimal concentration levels of copper. With increasing concentration of copper added up to the toxic level determined to be .1µM, GFP fluorescence increases with increasing inducer concentration. IPTG was added at the beginning at 100µM concentration.

The signal peptide of the N-termini of this fusion protein targets the protein to the membrane while the transmembrane domain of OmpA serves as an anchor. MBP is on the externally exposed loops of OmpA, which can be anchored to the outer membrane. As the method shown in mercury bioabsorbent construction, we directly fused the PbrR-MBP at the C-terminal of Lpp-OmpA protein through a flexible SG rich linker (Fig 8).
Fig 8. Result of 3D modeling for our fusion protein construction. The transmembrane domain of OmpA serves as an anchor and MBP is on the externally exposed loops of OmpA.
Fig 9. Procedures of the construction of standard plasmid with Lpp-OmpA-MBP as the insert.
Fig 10 Procedures of Construction of Commercial Plasmid.
After the construction of the plasmid with the fusion protein gene Lpp-OmpA-MBP, We prefixed T7 promoter and BBa_B0030 upstream of Lpp-OmpA-MBP. Additionally, a strong terminator BBa_B0015 was suffixed.  When the construction of three proteins was completed, T7 promoter+RBS and terminator were prefixed or suffixed to each protein coding sequence, respectively. T7 polymerase from T7 phage was designed to be constitutively expressed, thus to constitutively activate transcription at T7 promoter, in order to guarantee the expression of MBP regardless of the genetic background of bacteria strain.
For the same reason as in Hg (II) MBP construction, we assembled the three modules [Fig. 11]: MBP, DsbA-MBP and Lpp-OmpA-MBP, which would translocate MBP to the cytoplasm, periplasmic space and on the outer membrane in pSB1C3 for further function test.
Fig 11. The lead absorption device we designed to guarantee the maximum of Pb absorption. Top: The final overall structure of lead absorption device as an insert in pSB1C3. Middle and Bottom: The production of T7 RNA polymerase is constitutive. T7 polymerases will active high rating transcription at T7 promoters. Thus Hg (II) will be highly effectively accumulated by substantial amount of MBPs which are translocated to cytosol, periplasm and cell surface of the bacteria. All the components were assembled together and cloned into pSB3K3.

Introduction to Synthetic Biology
Bacterial Reporters
Introduction to Synthetic Biology
The term Synthetic Biology has been used to describe a number of different disciplines since its first appearance in literature in the decade of the 1970s. Waclaw Szybalski has been credited as the person who coined the term in 1974 to refer to the modification of organisms through the subtraction and addition of genes. (Benner S. , 2008) In 1980 Barbara Hobom used the phrase in a similar fashion, mainly to report advances in recombinant DNA technology. (Benner & Sismour, 2005) The logic behind the use of Synthetic Biology for this type of situations was that the genetically modified bacteria were natural organisms (biological) that were modified by human intervention (in other words, synthetically). Today, however, we tend to refer to the genetic modification of bacteria and other organisms as “genetic engineering” or “bioengineering”.
In the year 2000 Erik Kool used the term Synthetic Biology during a conference in San Francisco in reference to the synthesis of unnatural organic molecules that have functions in living organisms. This use of the term Synthetic Biology was applied mainly to scientific efforts to “redesign life”, and it was considered an extension of the area of “biomimetic chemistry”. The larger goal of this branch of science is to construct systems (synthetically) that behave following Darwinian rules of evolution (biologically) with the hope that these artificial systems will permit a better understanding of our own natural world. (Benner & Sismour, 2005) However, new uses of the term Synthetic Biology have become more common and relatively few people still apply this phrase to refer to these artificial chemical systems.
In recent years, the engineering community has adopted a new use for the term Synthetic Biology. This group of scientists and industry professionals seek to create standard interchangeable parts from living organisms that might serve as construction units for the development of living devices that carry out functions"

Insights
Waste water levels of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have increased to levels that influences the behaviour of fish and birds. SSRIs are pharmacologically active in vertebrates, as they use similar serotonin systems. Thus, SSRIs potentially affects other smaller animals in lower concentrations.
WSSRIs are soluble in water and will not easily evaporate. Therefore, we should study the effect of the SSRIs on the aquatic environment first.
The receptor might not be as selective in ditch water as in filtered water.
Methodological analyses is needed to investigate the effect of waste water on false positives/negatives.
E. coli is common in the human body and can survive and multiply easily in various circumstances. When a strain gets pathogenic by accident and released in the environment, it could have severe outcomes for society.
Applied
Find more on the social relevance of SSRIs and their impact.
We will apply a purification step before measuring to lose lipids and other substances which disturb the outcome.
In the end product, there have to be measures to make sure the bacteria can only survive in the device to prevent bacterial leak into the environment.

Insights
Drug use and thereby the concentration of drug residues in surface water has increased steadily over past years and will continue to grow in the future.
Water quality is also checked at treatment plants to measure the efficiency of water purification.
Dutch surface water is a source for drinking water. Therefore, compounds in the surface water end up in the drinking water, posing a threat for public health.
There is a purification obligation in horticulture.

UCL,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#mrnaDisplay_-_-_TEXT.html,"The Mtd protein is the scaffold for our mRNA display experiment. Most proteins are not capable of undergoing the large number of mutations necessary to create a large library while still maintaining their structure and function.  The Mtd is unique in that it has a structure that allows it to be mutagenized in certain sites and still remain stable.  The Mtd has evolved in the natural system of Bordetella bacteriophage to have precisely this property.  Therefore, it acts as an effective scaffold because the majority of the protein is able to remain constant and stable while a small localized region of each protein gets mutagenized (Yuan).
Other approaches for directed protein targeting?
Phage display:   An in vivo technique similar in principle to mRNA display in which bacteriophage are allowed to  replicate to create a diverse library with different binding affinities.  The DNA from the bacteriophage that corresponds to the protein that binds to the target can be isolated and then sequenced.
Ribosome display:  Another in vitro technique that fuses the RNA transcript to the protein that it codes for.  Instead of a puromycin linker between the transcript and the protein, it is the ribosome that links the protein and the template that codes for it (Smith).
What are the advantages of this route / why did we choose this route for our project?
One of the major advantages of the mRNA display approach is that it takes place completely in vitro.  This eliminates the limitations and complications that come with working in vivo and gives us more control over the entire process.  Also, using an in vitro method allows us to create a more diverse library.  Generating the library in vitro can potentially yield several orders of magnitude more protein variants than in vivo systems such as phage display.
With respect to ribosome display, which is also an in vitro method, mRNA display has an advantage when it comes to screening for protein binding.  The disadvantage of ribosome display is that the linker between the protein and the template DNA is the actual ribosome.  This is an issue because the ribosome is a very large protein and it has the potential to interact with the target protein, thereby throwing off the selection process. In contrast, the puromycin link in mRNA display is much smaller and is not likely to interfere in any way with the target protein (Lipovsek).
Issues with using this route?
What we are essentially doing with this project is taking the Mtd protein which comes from an in vivo system (the BPP-1 phage) and using it as the scaffold in our in vitro protein selection system.  We know"

The Surface Response Method in Modeling
Due to the failure that wet-lab experiments could not provide the subjective map despite the design and optimum methods of experiments, therefore it is not right for us to judge the optimal point merely by intuition. Though the optimal value is available, it is barely for us to tell the optimum area. In this circumstance，we utilized RSM（Response Surface Method）to analyze our formerly collected data and optimize the fundamental culture medium of the co-culture system.
Here are what we  principally concerned about when we designed our RSM modeling:
First, we hope that our RSM modeling is able to target and solve out the obstacles which the PH reduced too much by the end stage of fermentation.
Second, we hope that the yields of BC could be improved by the culture medium modified by RSM.
The following introduction will introduce how we implement the RSM modeling to achieve our goal.
First of all, our team set up the upper and lower limit value of carbon source and the quality of enhancing factor——ethanol according to the relevant literatures we formerly read and the results from pre-experiments. With these statistics，we have confirmed how should we design our experimental samples below:
(Figure 1. experimental samples)
By means of wet-lab experiment, we have obtained the PH range of culture medium residues at the end stage of fermentation, then we used multiple regression equation to analyze results from RSM. (Figure 2~4.) After that, we confirmed the range of optimal factor by parsing and estimating the effect of the PH  from interactions through the group dynamic figure for any factors affecting acid fermentation end stage production.
(Figure 2. RSM space diagram of Glycerol and 50% EtOH)
(Figure 3. RSM space diagram of Glucose and 50% EtOH)
(Figure 4. RSM space diagram of Glucose and Glycerol)
From figure 2~4, despite regression model flatten out, it is obvious that the optimal value does exist for the analysis of various factors on the"

All our iGEM members wandered through the festival and found strangers interested in learning about iGEM. We received an influx of people viewing and interacting with our social media pages throughout and after the festival. Throughout the 3-hour event, we got several hundreds of students excited and interested about participating in iGEM. We can't wait to see what the UCSC iGEM 2019 team has in store!
TEDx SJSU Presentation
In early September, our team came across a TEDx talk in San Jose looking for presenters. The TEDx SJSU theme was ""breaking ground"", and our team felt that our iGEM idea was perfectly on theme. A few of our teammates wrote a sample itinerary for the TEDx talk and sent that to the coordinators as our application. We were accepted as one of the presenters only a week later. From then on, we chose one iGEM member, Laura, with a strong public speaking background to write a speech detailing our project, human practices work, and how our project ""breaks ground"". Laura worked for weeks practicing and writing her speech and attended a dress rehearsal days prior to the TEDx talk. She gave an extraordinary 15-minute presentation to all types of audience members: Harvard professors, high school students, SJSU staff and professors, and college students. She also participated in a brief Q&A after the presentation where the public asked her more questions about our iGEM project. The audience was excited and impressed by our team's work and the way Laura portrayed it, and we are so thankful for the opportunity to share our scientific ventures with the surrounding community. We are so proud of Laura!"

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#HP-content_-_-_TEXT.html," are more interested in the use of synthetic biology for medicine. Although these differences might not be significant one can still assume that the age influences a person’s priorities. Preservation is a relatively new issue which might explain that younger ones seem to be more interested in it. This is probably not to the same degree the case for older people who instead wish for progress in more conventional areas like medicine, which also have a more direct influence on humans.
In general, however, there is a discrepancy of opinions. On the one hand, many people want to preserve the environment, but on the other hand, only few would be willing to change their diets to achieve this.
Public Discussions
Public discussions and presentations offer a high degree of information exchange, and therefore we tried to present our project in this manner whenever possible. For example, we gave a presentation to students of biological disciplines during a regular lecture. This possibility was given to us by Prof. Dr. Stefan Dübel who is the head of the Institute for Biochemistry, Biotechnology and Bioinformatics at our university and, most notably, our sponsor and supporter. During a series of discussions at our university's auditorium, we joined two of them which were related to synthetic biology and livestock farming. We got alternative views on synthetic biology and became aware of some important questions which might come along with it: Might genetically modified organisms be in danger of getting in the wrong hands, for example of biohackers? Is conventional breeding already synthetic biology? How can we control the spread of genetically modified organisms? The discussion on livestock farming, moreover, made us realize the importance of the animals' well-being which we planned to take into consideration for our project. Thus, we found that in order to broaden one’s horizon it is not only important to give talks oneself but also to attend talks by others, this way providing one with different views and new impulses.
Media
Besides getting in contact with people by the above-mentioned means we also kept the public up to date via social media. We mainly used our Facebook page to inform our followers about our progress in the lab, events like the European Researchers’ Night or several iGEM meetups we attended, and sometimes just to keep them entertained with little games or a specially designed E. coli soccer World Cup oracle.
On our Facebook page, the number of “Likes” rose to about 500 during the course of our project, which we attribute to different factors. Firstly, to general appreciation of working in a self-organized team, which is one of the main ideas behind iGEM, and secondly to a rising interest in questions concerning synthetic biology."

Validation of co-expression of mRuby2 and eGFP in CT26 eGFP cell line
Goal: A preliminary experiment to validate we can visualize the co-expression of both mRuby2 and eGFP in CT26 eGFP cell line using confocal microscopy.  Method: 20,000 cells were plated in each well of a chamber slide and incubated for 24 hours at 37?c. 4 wells were transfected with pcDNA3-mRuby2 using Lipofectamine 2000 (protocol), and incubated for 48 hours at 37?c. The other 4 wells were mock transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and incubated in the same conditions for negative control. After 48 hours, the transfected cells were viewed at the confocal microscope.  eGFP: excitation - 488 nm, emission - 509 nm  mRuby2: excitation - 559 nm, emission - 600 nm
Results:
Co-expression of mRuby2 and eGFP. All three pictures show the same cells. Picture A shows only eGFP expressing cells, picture B shows only mRuby2 expressing cells, and picture C show all cells.
Conclusions:
mRuby2 and eGFP were co-expressed in CT26 eGFP cells and viewed successfully using confocal microscopy.

Safety has always been an important concern in our laboratory, both in project design and operation during experiment process. This year we used two kinds of Escherichia coli (DH5α in part construction and MG1655 in project). According to the official iGEM guidelines of Risk Groups, E. coli is categorized as a Risk Group 1 organism that ""do not cause disease in healthy adult humans"" when used properly. Also, the risk group level of E. coli is correspondent with our laboratory safety level (Safety Level 1). To make sure that everything is safe enough, we have seriously managed Individual Safety, Environmental Safety, Biological Safety based on project as well as Safe Shipping.
Individual Safety
1) All members participating in the iGEM project this year have taken safety training courses given by the department experiment center that we acknowledged general safety managements such as fire-fighting strategies, disposition of biochemical materials, proper usages of microwave oven, laminar flow bench and other apparatus.
2) All members have carefully read Safe Project Design, Safe Lab Work, Safe Shipment and other requirements proposed by iGEM Safety Committee. We filled up the Final Safety Form according to the real situation in our laboratory.
3) Nitrile gloves, masks, closed shoes were strictly required in laboratory to prevent potential threats of personal health.
4) Resting area and Experiment area were clearly separated to confine eating and drinking strictly in resting area.
Environmental Safety
1) Biological materials were not allowed to be taken outside the laboratory without sterilization. All of the used materials (bacterial samples, plasmids, reagents, agar, etc.) after experiments were sterilized before leaving the laboratory and collected altogether for further management.
2) Regular cleaning of the laboratory trash was arranged every day to maintain a clean and tidy laboratory environment.
Safe Shipping We sent our BioBricks through the standard shipping process required by iGEM headquarter.
The design of our project
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.""
—Peter Carr, Director of Judging
iGEM projects involve important questions ""beyond the bench"" and teams' efforts are often well integrated into the technical aspects of their project, which has a significant influence upon design decisions.
This summer, we had held many activities in education, public engagement, dialogue and biosafety. These human practice activities not only broadened our views on synthetic biology, but also had a significant influence on our project designs.

Goals
Early on, we decided to create a computational model of our pattern generation system. This would allow us to accomplish several important goals:
Demonstrate that the circuit logic was sound
Test the viability of our construct given realistic parameters
Probe the effects that different parameters would have on the system
Identify potential failure modes, and the events that might trigger them
Evaluate alternative designs of the construct
With these goals in mind, we set about formalizing the system.
Equations
To start, we generate equations for all of the transcription reactions:
From there, we came up with the equations for each binding/unbinding reaction:
We can now see some interesting behaviors of our gene circuit. For instance, the transcription of lambda cI mRNA is dependent on the concentration of promoter I12006 that is bound with lambda cI. However, we can also see from the second set of equations that this promoter may be complexed with 434 cI, which acts as a repressor, removing some of the I12006 which would otherwise be available for transcription. It is important to note that the binding of the repressor ""overrides"" the activity of the activator; this has important effects on the system, and this behavior reflects the reality of the part.
Not shown here are various simple translation and degradation reactions for the protein species; these equations are straightforward and don't merit much mention here. For our purposes, it is assumed that the translation rate is the same for all proteins.
There is an added level of complexity for our construct. Because the device is intended to exhibit behavior at a multicellular level, and some of the species produced (specifically, quorum sensing molecules produced by las and lux pathways) must will be diffusing throughout the plate, we need a way to model diffusion of species. In general, molecular diffusion can be modelled by Fick's 2nd Law:
Implementation
After we had derived the necessary equations, we began evaluating various packages that would allow us to compute the solutions to these equations over a large array of cells. Unfortunately, this quickly led to problems; we had decided early on that the best way to incorporate the diffusion component into our model was to discretize Fick's 2nd Law as a 2D Gaussian convolution:
We could then compute the diffusion step as a second pass during each time step, after the ODEs had been evaluated - thus skirting around the issue of having to solve thousands of simultaneous P"

The FerriTALE System:
As seen in the video above our goal is to develop a strip based assay that can alert us upon detection of pathogen specific DNA sequence, namely stx2. We will treat our sample collected from the supershedders with a TALE-Ferritin complex  (a FerriTALE!). This DNA-TALE-Ferritin complex would then be flown over our strip that contains a second, immobilized TALE that recognizes yet another 18-20 bp region on the stx 2 gene. This second TALE will immobilize our DNA-TALE-ferritin complex on the strip. Following immobilization we will add substrate to our strip. Only in the presence of both the EHEC sequences we get a colour change on the strip. If there is only one of the sequences present, the colour change does not occur either due to lack of immobilization or due to lack of presence of a reporter.
Figure 1. Our system is composed of both an immobile element on the strip that will capture our target DNA and a mobile element that will report the presence of our target DNA.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer2_-_-_TEXT.html," strategy to reach this goal, we aim to increase the torque power and flagellar speed by replacing the MotA and MotB proteins which make up E. Coli’s rotor (they form a H+ channel) with proteins PotB59 and PomA from V. Alginolyticus(they form a Na+ channel).
Background
HNS/HNST108I
Many species of bacteria have flagellar motility that is achieved by rotating surface-exposed organelles The rotation of the flagella is controlled by a motor complex embedded in the inner membrane (reviewed in Refs. 2 and 3 The motor region of E. Coli’s flagella is composed of several parts. The stator complex, made up of the proteins MotA-MotB, has a transmembrane characteristic and ensures the generation of a proton channel (4-6).  The rotor complex involves the interaction of three other proteins, FliG, FliM, and FliN(7,8). All three rotor proteins are involved in the processes of flagellar assembly, switching, and rotation (9,10). However, FliG is predominately involved in torque generation (8, 10, 11), whereas FliM mainly functions in switching rotor direction (12). The precise role of FliN is the least well defined, but it may participate in flagella protein-specific export and assembly (13,14)
HNS is a transcription factor that plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in E. Coli. It plays an activator role at the level of protein synthesis for many genes involved in bacterial motility.  . . In many studies it was shown that HNS is essential for the synthesis of proteins that make up the rotor and stator. The flhCD operon is a positive regulator of HNS which is responsible for the synthesis of many proteins that composes the structure of the bacterial flagella. Studies show that knock-out of the gene that codes the HNS protein results in non-motile E. Coli.
Above, we mentioned three proteins that make up the stator portion of the bacterial flagella.. These proteins are FliG, FliM and FliN and these three proteins have different activities. FliM is a regulator protein that is responsible for determining in which direction the bacterial flagella will be oriented. Although the role of FliN is not precisely known, it is thought that it acts as a guide for the assembly of the flagella’s membrane/for attachment of flagella to the membrane. As for F"

All the plates seemed to have been completely or almost cleared by the phage, leaving no visible plaque sizes. Also, the plates were contaminated.
5) Large Plaque Confirmation 2
No abnormally large plaque detected. Plaques are actually smaller than the ones we originally picked from. This could most likely be due to differences in agar concentration.
VI) Conclusion
We decided that mutagenesis did not occur properly again because there was no evidence of phage death with increasing mutagen concentration and the large plaques that we isolated did not retain their size once they were replicated. Poor mutagenesis probably occurred because we only incubated the phage for 30 minutes. In order to attempt to fix this, we will redo mutagenesis, but this time we will incubate the phage until clearage.

Summary
Our iGEM project intends to reduce the ability of lactobacilli to metabolize glucose. A possible approach is to knock-out genes along glucose-consuming pathways. However, the absence of the knocked-out genes must not jeopardize the bacteria's ability to live and proliferate. Such sets of genes could be identified either by educated guessing or by systems biological analysis.
Systems biological studies are capable of inferring the response of cells—or more generally: systems—under consideration of all genes and their network of interactions (Hine & Martin, 2015). In our project, we are interested in the rates of metabolism for fructose and glucose. Because we investigate gene knock-outs, we do not consider the time-course of metabolite concentrations (in contrast to last year's project). Instead, we analyse the flow of metabolites through the metabolic pathways of a system (Orth et al., 2010). Such a flow is computed with a flux balance analysis (FBA).
FBA assigns to each possible reaction a quantity, called flux value, that specifies with which rate the reactants are converted into the corresponding product in correct stoichiometric proportions. However, these fluxes are subjected to the following constraints:
Mass conversion must be respected. Metabolites may only enter/leave a system over explicitly defined in-/outbound fluxes.
A flux has a maximal and minimal rate
Metabolites have a lower and upper bound amount
These constraints are mathematically formulated as a set of inequalities. Furthermore, FBA optimizes specific fluxes, which are called objective functions. A possible objective it the maximization of the growth function. Concrete flux values—that fulfill these inequalities and optimize the objective—are easily computed by an algorithmic approach called Linear Programming.
In order to construct these inequalities, knowledge about the pathways is needed, which comes in the form of a systems biological model. Comprehensive databases for models are the BioModels (Li et al., 2010) database hosted and maintained by EBI and the San Diego BiGG project (King et al., 2016).

BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#investigation.html_-_-_TEXT.html," McfQ and McfR do (Parales, et al.) . McfQ responds to citrate and fumarate, and McfR detects succinate, malate and fumarate. To compare with the work what 2011_Imperial_College_London had done, we chose McfR which also responds to malate. The mechanisms of prokaryote chemoreceptors are similar, so we designed a plasmid to express chemoreceptor. McfR in the E.coli makes the bacteria have the ability of chemotaxis towards TCA intermediates. As our experimental condition is limited, we just did experiments on chemotaxis towards succinate and malate. What’s more, in an attractant gradient, the chemoreceptors monitor chemoeffector concentration changes as they move around. And they use that information to modulate the probability of the next tumbling event. And we searched the pattern of their chemotaxis towards a concentration gradient of attractant using capillary assay. The results are demonstrated below.
Results
We did both agar assay and capillary assay to detect the response of E.coli to different attractants and different concentrations of each attractant. Because the agar assay (Fig.3) is difficult to replicate and collect the data from, we just show the results of capillary assay (Fig.4) . We made a negative control using washing buffer and five concentration gradients (100mM/10mM/1mM/0.01mM/0.0001mM) of attractants. These E.colis were divided into three groups based on the plasmid they have been transformed into. The plasmids are biobricks, BBa_K608003 and BBa_K515102 (they are from 5A and 8F wells in plate1), and the McfR plasmid was designed by us. BBa_K608003 (5A) only has a strong promoter and medium RBS, so it doesn’t have specific chemotaxis towards TCA intermediates. BBa_K515102 (8F) is a biobrick from 2011_Imperial_College_London, which responds to L(-)malic acid (HO2CCH2CH(OH)CO2H).

The flagellar motor complex has high affinity for phosphorylated CheY (CheY-p), and binding reverses the mode of movement from run to tumble [ 7 ]. CheY-p is continuously dephosphorylated back to CheY by CheZ [ 8 ]. A receptor sensing an attractant might instead switch from the default active CheA state to an inactive state when it’s ligand is bound, thus decreasing CheY phosphorylation [ 6 ].
Photosensor
In our system we want to be able to control the amount of flow in the channel, through a remote signal. The signal we have chosen is light since we want to avoid altering the chemical composition of the fluid running through the channel. Having looked at previous iGEM work on light sensitive systems which have all been focused on transcriptional regulation ( e.g. I15010 ), we realized that we would need a different approach for the fast response times our system requires. We have therefore focused our work on proteorhodopsins that integrate into the chemotaxis pathway, giving us very fast responses to light stimulation.
Our construct centers around a synthetic protein created by Spudich et al. [ 9 ]. It is a fusion chimeric protein that consists of an archaeal proteorhodopsin SopII (Sensory Rhodopsin II) and its transducer protein HtrII, both from Natronomonas pharaonis. These are coupled to a Tar domain from a transmembrane receptor from Salmonella enterica. The Tar domain is the part of the receptor that couples with CheA and CheW, and although it is taken from a different species, it has been shown to work in E. coli as well [ 10 ]. In the construct we are working with light acting as an attractant, reducing the tumbling rate upon illumination (see picture). This might help us to control our pumping power, by decreasing the fraction of bacteria tumbling in the channel by increasing light stimulus, thus promoting linear drive. The photosensor should be most active in light with a wavelength of about 500nm, according to the original article. We have used DNA sent to us from the original authors to isolate the coding sequence for the protein generator.
Note that although the bacteria will be stationary in our system, since they are glued to the inner surface of the flowchannel, our construct in reality confers a phototactic ability to E. coli.

METU_HS_Ankara,2016,Team:METU HS Ankara#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," We used RPMrel like HKUST Hong Kong iGEM Team to target specifically cancer cells and used their experiences to improve our project . Also we choosed to use the arabinose promoter which Team Harvard Biodesign used in their 2015 project.
iGEM survey in an international context
As an another collaboration we prepared an online survey to see what people know about colon cancer. Some of the iGEM teams as iGEM XMU- China shared our survey on their social accounts and helped us to reach more people . This event showed us that not only people in Turkey but also all around the world people do not know much about colon cancer and it’s treatments . So we decided to do  human practices on giving information about colon cancer.
Spreading Survey of the Aachen Team
We collaborated with Aachen 2016 iGEM Team in Order to disseminate their survey. With Aachen team's survey we collected information about different countries' point of view to genetic engineering and compared them. We are interested in how much people know about genetic engineering and how they inform themselves. They want to compare the knowledge and the experience about genetic engineering in different countries.This is the reason why we collaborated with Aachen Team and other teams for  the survey.
Reflection
Our iGEM journey gave us many opportunities. One of them was to contact with order teams from all over the world and collaborate with them in order to share ideas and knowledge about many different subjects. We utilised previous projects and made them useful for our work. Furthermore, we had a chance to get opinions and feedbacks from different perspectives. It was a great pleasure for our team to collaborate with other iGEM members."
