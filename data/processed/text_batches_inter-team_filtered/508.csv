Grinnell,2011,Team:Grinnell#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," inoculated in chloramphenicol broth and the overnight culture was used for a miniprep of the plasmid.  The plasmid was then digested with Eco RI and XbaI and ligated with the BBa_K081005 fragment.  This was transformed into E. coli Top10 and successful colonies were streaked and used for colony PCR to see if the ligation was successful.
PCR amplified PrsaA , a constitutive promoter in Caulobacter and Pxyl , an inducible promoter in Caulobacter.  We purified our PCR product ( protocol ), but we lost our DNA in the process ( Figure ).  We re-PCRed the two promoters ( Figure 4 ) and performed an ethanol precipitation DNA clean-up ( protocol ) instead and received a low concentration of DNA yield.  This product was digested with Eco RI and Pst HF and ligated into pSB1C3 that had been previously digested with Eco RI and Pst HF.  The ligations were transformed into E. coli Top10.
After realizing that the combination of esp and rsaA created a stop codon between the two parts of the gene, we decided to start from scratch on the plasmids containing those genes and the plasmid containing them together.  We ordered new primers that solved this issue.
We performed PCR from chromosomal DNA again using the new primers and ran them on a gel, showing that our fragments had been amplified ( Figure 5 ).
Week 4 June 19-25
We started the process of recreating esp and rsaA C-terminal from template DNA and new primers that would not create an in-frame stop codon.  Template DNA from colonies was used for PCR successfully. PCR products were then digested for insertion into pSB1C3 individually and together as a three part ligation.  Colony PCR of the transformation products showed successful individual insertions, but unsuccessful three-part ligation.  Overnights and plates of successfully transformed strains were made.  Digestions of previously made PCR products and minipreps of esp and rsaA were made and used in ligations with each other and blank plasmids, pSB1C3 and pMR10, that had previously been digested.  Insertions of esp PCR product into rsaA C-terminal containing pSB1C3 were the most successful.
The transformation of promoters PrsaA and Pxyl were successful.  We picked 2 colonies from each transformed promotor, inoculated overnight cultures, and Miniprepped them.  We then performed a test digest"

Overnight cultures of the submitted parts expressed in E. coli TOP10 illustrated a clear gradient of increasing red fluorescent protein (RFP) expression correlated with the strength of the promoter, as seen on Figure 2.
Figure 2. Cultures of E. coli TOP10. From left to right: WT, the weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , the two medium promoters, BBa_J23110 , and BBa_J23106 , and the strong promoter, BBa_J23102 .
On the basis of the data obtained by fluorescence microscopy, the strong constitutive promoter, BBa_J23102 , was chosen to control the photocontrol device. For still inexplicable reasons the photocontrol device emerged difficult to clone with the strong constitutive promoter. Although the molecular cloning of these parts was optimised several times very few successful clonings were accomplished, and the few times correct assembly was obtained, the BioBrick was not reproducibly purifiable. By sequencing, it was deduced that a region of the plasmid containing both the promoter and the BioBrick prefix had vanished. To circumvent this inconvenient cloning two other promoters, that are constitutive in E. coli, were examined, namely the PenI-regulated, BBa_R0074 , and the Mnt-regulated, BBa_R0073 , promoters. By performing fluorescence microscopy on composite parts of the promoters controlling yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), BBa_I6102 , and BBa_I6103 , respectively, the expression levels were assessed. The obtained results revealed that the PenI-regulated promoter facilitated very strong expression of the marker gene, whereas the expression controlled by the Mnt-regulated promoter was noticeably lower. Based on these findings, the photocontrol device was placed under the control of the PenI-regulated promoter instead of the strong constitutive promoter from the constitutive promoter family. As it turned out, this cloning likewise emerged difficult. After several attempts, it was decided to focus on the other aspects of the dormancy system.
Regulation of the OmpR-dependent Promoter Required a Low Copy Vector
The first construct containing the genes required for the light-induced dormancy was designed as shown in Figure 1. As the conducted modelling clarified, the necessity for stringent regulation of the RelE and RelB expression, the properties of the OmpR-regulated promoter were studied thoroughly. To assess the functionality of the OmpR-reg"

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," offer ‘upcycling’ services – turning waste into valuable products – and it is easy to imagine Ambercycle scaling into paper or Upcycled Aromatics scaling into textiles. Similarly, Hyasynth Bio will produce natural molecules that can be used in medicine, whereas PVP Biologics will produce therapeutics for food allergies. It is possible that some potential allergy therapeutics are natural molecules, especially given that “natural molecules or derivatives make up more than half of the current drugs on the market with applications to nearly every disease known to humans,” (Hyasynth Bio, 2015). Synbiota and Benchling are both currently operating and are likely already competitors given that they both offer software to support synthetic biology lab work.
However, cooperation is a far more prominent theme in all of these businesses. Every industrial firm depends on building partnerships with firms in the industry that they offer their services to, and supposed competitors could find that overlap in customers is minimal compared to overlap in areas where information sharing is beneficial. It could be that there is no overlap between the compounds that Ambercycle and Upcycled Aromatics will upcycle and that they can discover natural compounds and allergy therapeutics better by cooperating. The same is true for Hyasynth Bio and PVP Biologics. FREDSense and CustoMem  could offer a combo deal- A water filter form CustoMem and a sensor from FREDSense to ensure it is working properly. It’s possible that the next generation of synthetic biologists will start their training with Labster’s lab simulator before moving on to Bento Lab’s beginner synthetic biology lab. That young synthetic biologist could work in a lab that is supplied DNA libraries by Lab Genius, is connected to customers who desire DNA tests through Gene Advisor, 3D prints with a BioBot 1, receives bioinformatics support form Morph Bioinformatics, and is funded by Experiment.com. Ambercycle and Upcycled Aromatics could partner with the same municipal government to upcycle that lab’s waste. In the emerging synthetic biology economy, the potential gains from trade and cooperation are enormous.
Section Five
In this paper, we have sought to collect and centralize information on three main benefits of to society of iGEM. First, there is the educational benefit to the emerging synthetic biology workforce as shown by our literature review. Then there is the related benefit to synthetic biology academia from giving team members an opportunity to produce work worthy of publication, preparing them for academic careers and strengthening knowledge-generation capacity. Third, there is the direct economic benefit of assisting in the creation of dynamic, young firms that will put the"

Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
No issue of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety were raised during Debrecen's iGEM 2011 project. We only worked with non-hazardous, non-infectious, commonly used and accepted bacteria strain (DH5α) and mammalian cancer cell lines (COS-1). When working with toxic chemicals (e.g. ethidiumbromide or estrogen), nitrile gloves, and white coats were worn. All of the work was conducted in a biosafety level S1 laboratory. Rules of the best microbiological practices were applied.
2.  Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
All material handled or distributed are non-hazardous and non-infectious. It agrees with all safety standards requested biosafety level 1, therfore the project get a full supports for the work done by the iGEM team. We developed synthetic LBD's for use in mammalian cells in fusion parts. These parts are completely harmless, no matter what organism they are transformed / transfected into.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
All of our work complies with the University of Debrecen's local biosafety and bioethics regulations. Our project leader and team instructors oversaw the biological safety issue throughout the whole working time this year. There is also a biosafety supervisor who supervises the overall laboratory work biosecurity-wise. All team members who worked at the bench this summer have had proper safety training. We received approval from all overseeing groups.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
An important tool to raise interest and knowledge in safety issues is education. Open source"

As our project is related to biotechnology, we were interested mainly in the legal protection of biotechnological inventions. First, we familiarized ourselves with the basics of governing laws and procedures related to patent applications for different regions. However, we all study in Finland for longer term, so we looked closer into the procedures in European Union, where the rules on the scope and limitations of patent protection for such inventions are governed by Directive 98/44/EC . This regulation defines biotechnological inventions as products consisting of, or containing, biological material, or processes by means of which biological material is produced, processed or used. To patent such inventions, the general requirements for patentability must be fulfilled, i.e. novelty, inventiveness and industrial applicability.
In general, an European patent shall be valid for 20 years from the date of filing the application. However, renewal fees must be paid to the European Offices in respect of pending applications and later to the national offices in every contracting state in which a granted patent is brought into effect. More information can be found from the European Patent Convention .
Although first patents related to dermcidin were filed not earlier than about 15 years ago, some of the granted patents expired due to failure to pay maintenance fee. A few of granted patents are still in force in individual countries and several new applications are still pending. We listed the patents relevant to our project and described their legal status and most important claims in the separate document.
The document with the current patent situation can be found here .

Creation of a Product Using Synthetic Biology
Trust over Technology
Using our production strategy, we were able to scale up from a 5 ml batch to a 500 ml batch. For details on the design process for production and success with the small scale and large-scale production, please check out our Laboratory pages .
Prototype Development and Formulation
Prototyping comes into play when the design of the product needs to be verified during product development, because it demonstrates or proves the design. Our main motives for a prototype design were to:
a. Show the new product to investors.
b. Test an idea to see if it really works.
c. Test the design to see if it passes certain requirements.
d. Evaluate necessary improvements.
e. Get customer feedback.
There are  2 categories of prototypes:
1. ""Looks Like"" - Prototypes that look and feel complete but do not essentially function.
2. ""Works Like"" - Prot"

The BAIT Switch project was conceived and designed by the entire Nevada iGEM team with the help of our advisors, Ian Wallace and Veronica Zepeda. We all worked throughout the summer with both individual tasks and group projects. We attended weekly meetings on Mondays to inform everyone where we were individually and what the next steps would be as a team.
Khurram Fahim and Janice Bautista focused on the TIR1 system. They modified and engineered new plasmids for integration into yeast. These included plasmids containing the IAA17 degron and GFP reporter. Some methods they performed are tagging of TIR1 with a Myc tag; primer design to create the insert of pTEF-GFP-IAA17; and later, work with JAZ6 in the COI1 system.
Matthew Hawn and Zoe Meraz focused on the COI1 system. This included modification and engineering of appropriate plasmids to be joined to those of Khurram and Janice for the goal of a bioorthogonal system using auxin and coronatine in yeast. Matt also created many of the infographics and web design, as well as performed yeast growth assays.
Zoe focused on the synthesis of the construct of pTEF-GFP-JAZ1 and moving it from E coli into yeast. She also completed all safety form requirements.
Tori Speicher was responsible for all things parts registry related! She also performed many lab procedures such as gel electrophoresis, PCR, miniprep, etc.

The final step required to make pVU14006 is changing the multiple cloning site (MCS) to have the biobrick prefix and suffix. In its current form, the plasmid has a functional MCS but it does not yet have the specific order of EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI sites required by RFC10.

Collaborations
In addition to our own wetware project, our team led fruitful collaborations with a total of three other iGEM teams. First, we played a major role in assisting Vanderbilt's microfluidics division with the genetics aspect of their project. We prepared the biobrick parts they tested in their microfluidic device, including transforming the E. coli they used to study their quorum-sensing fluorescent oscillator circuit.  Second, we provided feedback to Vanderbilt's software division about their own project involving a program to aid in the manipulation of genetic sequences. We used the program as if it were for a real project and gave them suggestions on how to make their program easier to use and more useful to biologists.
Last but not least, we provided significant assistance and guidance to the Ravenwood Raptors high school iGEM team. In a series of conversations with Dr. Amanda Benson, we planned a smaller scale version of our own project that involved only a single terpene synthase gene. After visiting the high school and presenting our idea, the students voted to choose it for their project. We also provided the primers and sage genomic DNA template they used in their experiments.

The interactions with the promoter, keeps the amount of free RelE at a very low value outside starvation and stabilises the system Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 . In our simulation the shift in equilibrium is made by introducing additional translation of RelE.
We used two model in two ways. First we saw how a given configuration of relB and RelE production increased the relE concentration and if it could cause dormancy within 2 hours. Second we investigated for how long each configuration
Rates and reactions
In the units off all reaction rates we use the approximation that in an E.coli. with a size of 1-2 μm, 1 molecule in the cell = 1nm. Thus we convert all units to be measured in molecules, as this fits the premises of the gillespie algorithm.
To simplify the model all rates for relB are for relB2, that is we use the high affinity of relE and relB, to look at all relB as alreadry in dimers UniProtKB - P0C079 (RELB_ECOLI) Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N.

Finally, our integrated human practices strategy helped us to think a step further about our design, regarding, for example, the costs involved in our device and what it should actually look like; what kind of ‘kit’ will it be and what will it contain? We also looked at the feasibility of our device in the context of whether or not farmers would actually be allowed to use such a device and what needs to be done considering legislation to make this possible.
Only veterinarians can prescribe or change antibiotic treatments.
Engeline van Duijkeren (veterinarian)
Stakeholder interactions shaped our final design and made it feasible to transform our detection method into an application, resulting in a toolbox with which the farmers can perform the resistance test themselves on-site, instead of being dependent on slow lab processes. Simple, cheap and safe methods - for example the hand-powered centrifuge and boiling method during sample preparation, together with an optimized readout - make our device applicable for rapid frontline diagnostics. We developed our toolbox to detect the most relevant multiple antibiotic resistance genes, expanding the impact of our product to achieve better animal and human treatment strategies, see our applied design page for more info!

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html,". From these results we can conclude that the formation of coacervates is inhibited above an RNase A concentration of 10-4 wt%.
Figure 20: PolyU/spermine coacervates with (left) and without (right) RNase A. As is directly visible to the naked eye, coacervate solutions of 0.1 wt% polyU and 1.0 wt% spermine are cleared upon addition of 0.05 wt% RNase A. This serves as a first proof of principle that coacervates can be used to indicate RNase activity.
Figure 21: Titration of RNase A. Various amounts of RNase A were added to polyU/spermine coacervate solutions and after 5 minutes of equilibrating to 27 °C, the absorbance of 500 nm was measured over the course of 30 minutes. In the case where no or only 10-5 wt% of RNase was added, significant absorbance could be measured throughout the full period of time. For higher concentrations, the absorbance fell to that of the background within the equilibration time.
Proof of the coacervation method with activated Cas13a
In order to transfer the results obtained with RNase A, we tested the effect of spermine on Cas13a. A fluorescence assay with RNase Alert (as described on the Cas13a design page) was done with the addition of 1.0 wt% spermine, demonstrating that Cas13a did not show collateral cleavage with this condition. The effect of spermine was tested with and without the presence of the target RNA. The control consisted of a regular Cas13a assay with and without target RNA. Figure 22 shows the results. We can conclude that spermine inhibits the activity of Cas13a, whereas it does not inhibit RNase A activity. For our purpose, this means that spermine always has to be added after sufficient time has given for Cas13a to collaterally cleave enough RNA.
Figure 22: Collateral cleavage reaction is not compatible with 1.0 wt% spermine. The fluorescence assay with and without active Cas13a, and with and without 1.0 wt% spermine indicates that Cas13a does not show collateral cleavage activity in the presence of spermine.
Finally, the functional Cas13a had to be integrated with CINDY Seq, to achieve a full proof of principle. First tests revealed that polyU/spermine coacervates form in the reaction buffer"

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,"A, a flavin-dependent L-tryptophan oxidase and VioB, a heme protein, work in combination to oxidize and dimerize L-tryptophan to an IPA imine dimer. Hydrogen peroxide is released as a by-product of the VioA reaction. Next step by VioE is the rearrangement of the IPA imine dimer to protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, which can non-enzymatically oxidize to prodeoxyviolacein or, by VioC via deoxyviolaceinic acid, oxidize to pink deoxyviolacein. The flavin-dependent oxygenases VioC and VioD require interaction with the oxidized form of flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (uniprot, uniprot) . The two enzymes act sequentially: first, VioD hydroxylates protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, leading to protoviolaceinic acid. Second, VioC creates the oxindole at the 2-position of one indole ring, leading to violet violacein (Balibar CJ et al., 2006) (Janis J. Füller et al., 2016).
Relocating the pathway into the peroxisome enables proximity of the enzymes and substrates. Furthermore the yeast cell is protected from the toxic substance hydrogen peroxide. Yeast peroxisomes have no problem with this as their main function is the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the detoxification of the thereby produced H2O2 (Erdmann R. et al., 2007) . Because VioC and VioD are FAD-dependent, it is additionally an evidence for FAD availability inside of the peroxisome, if the synthesis of Violacein works. Otherwise the two enzymes would not be able to catalyze the reaction.
The genes for VioA, VioB and VioE were amplificated via PCR with Golden Gate compatible overhangs from the biobrick VioABCE (Part: BBa_K274004).
By Golden Gate cloning the peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1) was attached to the C-terminus of every pathway protein. Combined with the other necessary parts of the toolbox they represent the level 1 plasmids.
The PTS-tag marks the proteins for the import into peroxisomes. This should first of all point out the functionality of the yeast’s natural import mechanism and also be the basis for demonstrating our own"

Week 5: May 27 - May 31
Modelling sub-team formed. Currently we do not know if our method of using ferritin to identify and separate DNA of interest will be successful. I was in charge of finding alternative reporter genes that will indicate the presence of DNA of interest. Specifically Lisa and Rai came up a list of interesting and widely used reporter genes that I should look in to, in the hope that eventually a differential equation based model can be developed. The differential model would help us predict their signal strength for any given input conditions of cells etc. This week I mostly did qualitative research, where I found out how the genes work, what equipment is needed, and started on learning their kinetics.
Those reporter genes can be divided into two categories: enzymes or proteins. β-galactosidase, luciferase and horseradish peroxidase all report promoter activities by reacting with a substrate that will either emit light or undergo color change. I have found that between the two enzymes luciferase has superior sensitivity and linear response range over GFP and β-glactosidase (Nakajima and Ohmiya, 2010). On the other hand GFP, FRET and BRET behave similarly but themselves don't catalyze substrates. GFP is able to fluoresces on its own. For FRET two things (nanoparticles or FPs) acting as donor/acceptor are required; when they are close enough and an external source provides excitement, the donor transfer light received to acceptor which emits a"

Overview
Due to the complex circuit design of our subject, the numerous combination of promoters and gene elements lead to the effect on the whole system in case of the malfunction of any parts, making it difficult for us to locate the malfunction. Therefore, we decided to adopt the method of debugging the program usually employed by computer programmers.
1)Verify the function of each part.
2)Combine the parts into two large modules of upstream and downstream circuits to verify the function.
3)Assemble the upstream and downstream circuits to verify the function of the whole system.
However, due to time constraints, we cannot complete such detailed and complete functional verification of various combination designs in just a few months. We have completed the functional verification for most parts and some of the upstream and downstream circuits, but time does not allow us to combine the upstream and downstream circuits for final functional verification. This is undoubtedly regretful, but we have provided concrete ideas for future experiments to help us complete the improvement of the subject. We also put these future experiments on our Wiki.
Demonstrate
Upstream circuit
The upstream circuit mainly designs a signal path to enable cells to receive specific external signals and activate the downstream core circuit to realize the threshold function.  Therefore, the upstream circuit can be replaced considering different situations. Here, we provide an upstream circuit design as a reference and other researchers can design their own upstream path to their own needs.
Customizing the signal path of cells in response to external signals
There is a wide type of extracellular signals. Cells receive extracellular signals and respond to the signal molecules accordingly. We hope to customize a kind of receptor so that it can recognize the signal molecules and regulate downstream gene expression [1]. We choose synNotch as an ideal receptor.
Similar to some signal molecules, take Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in our realistic system as an example, the GFP is also protein but more stable and has no impact on the system. As for visibility and operability, cell surface-expressed GFP as a model of extracellular signal molecule is a better choice. Therefore,"

Transformation of B.S. IA771 (glycerol stocks)
- Nothing! Problem with the storage of competent IA771???
August 18th
Test Ery efficiency
Since all Ery plates grew, we want to check the antibiotic stock.
- New Ery plate of IA751 (they should die)
- New LB stock (Ery5) with IA751
Single colony plates
- New plates (Cm5 + Amp100) with single colony of ECE188 (from 14/08), ECE189 (from 13/08) and ECE190 (from 14/08)
- Grow the same single colony into LB with antibiotic
Transformation of glycerol stocks of B.S.
The result from the last transformation of glycerol stocks was negative> We tried again with two different protocols.
First protocol
- Spin the glycerol stock, throw out the supernatant (just keep about 100μL), add 0.5μL of Medium B
- Incubate about 1h15
- Add 0.6μg of ECE166 (because we managed to transform BS with this vector)
- Incubate 1h30
- Plate on Cm5 plates (DNA less control and transformed cells)
Second protocol
- Spin the glycerol stock, throw out the supernatant (just keep about 100μL), add 0.5μL of Medium B
- Add 0.6μg of ECE166 (because we managed to transform BS with this vector)
- Incubate 30min
- Plate on Cm5 plates (transformed cells)
- Plate cells after 10min of incubation (without DNA) on blank plates (to see if they are alive)

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Team#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Biology, this thesis theoretically analyzes the distinct areas of focus and specifies those insights with applied-oriented examples. In addition, this work describes the basic principles of the unique International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition and focuses on the importance of an innovative contribution made by the iGEM team of undergraduate students from the Technical University of Munich. Eventually this thesis conducts a critical evaluation of both, the internal strengths and weaknesses of Synthetic Biology and the chances and risks which the synthetic biology community will likely to be faced with.

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Madrid-OLM,2018,Team:Madrid-OLM#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
Activities
The event began on Friday the 14th in the afternoon with the main course. In it, after the reception of the attendees, we gave way to a series of very interesting expert presentations. We were able to count on the attendance of the following personalities:
Victor de Lorenzo
He is one of the Spanish most relevant researchers in the Synthetic Biology field. He works in the National Biotechnology Center (CNB) a part of the Superior Council of Scientific Investigations (CSIC). His laboratory is specialized in solving environmental issues using genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida. He gave us an interesting talk about ""Synthetic Biology in the rescue of the planet Earth"".
Saul Ares
He is a researcher of the CNB too. His work is central in the mathematical modelling of Synthetic Biology systems. He has also collaborated with previous iGEM teams. His presentation talked about ""How do cyanobacteria count to ten"".
Krzysztof Wabnik
He is a Young Investigator Researcher of the Center for Biotechnology and Plant Genomics (CBGP) at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). The group he is leading uses multilevel computer model simulations, synthetic biology experiments and microfluidics. The name of his presentation was: ""Combining computational and synthetic biology approaches to understand the dynamics of plant hormone signalling circuits"".
After the presentation of the three speakers, we had a space of time in which attendees could discuss and exchange points of view with them on how the field of synthetic biology would evolve.
After the talks a social event was held in which the attending teams could relax having dinner in the centre of Madrid with one of the most typical activities here: go out for tapas.
The second day was inaugurated with a visit to the university to show the facilities where our team works. Also it was explained which procedures are used in each of the sections that were visited.
Subsequently, the presentations of the projects were made. A simulation of the presentation was carried out as it should be done in Boston, to learn how to take the time and try to correct the excesses or lack of time in each section that was exposed.
In the afternoon there was a tour around Madrid, where the most iconic places in the city were shown. And although there were activities scheduled for the next day, this was the activity that closed the meet up, since the attending teams had organized to return to their cities after this tour.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," plastic(see below). However, without further qualitative data, we can only speculate as to why, this is the case.
Additional RBS - largest increase in PHB production ( Top )

Figure 10 display the different E. colistrains on the x-axis. The promoter and RBS are marked with corresponding affinity: “s” = strong, “W” = weak and “MS”=medium. The y-axis displays the average intensity on the flow cytometer detected by red fluorescence. The intensity of the red fluorescence is calculated due to a mean value of the intensities detected in Figure 9.
Figure 10 display the different E.colistrains on the x-axis. The promoter and RBS are marked with corresponding affinity: “s” = strong, “W” = weak and “MS”=medium. The y-axis displays the average intensity on the flow cytometer detected by red fluorescence. The intensity of the red fluorescence is calculated due to a mean value of the intensities detected in Figure 9.
Equally surprising is the fact that the additional RBS is responsible for the largest increase in PHB (Figure 10). The additional RBS for the phaCAB genes is not followed by a start-codon and as a result, ribosomal attachment to the specific RBS will not be able to initiate transcription. We suggest that a strong RBS will bind the ribosome with high affinity and thus it will not detach readily.  For a medium RBS, the affinity will be high enough for ribosomes to be attached to the RNA frequently, but due to the lower affinity, they will also detach more frequently. The event results in an increase in the local concentration of ribosomes. For the weak RBS the affinity will be too low for the local concentration of ribosomes to be effected.
The strong and weak RBS thereby generates less plastic, relative to the medium strong RBS. We speculate that this tendency is caused by changes to the local concentration of ribosomes, due to the presence of an additional RBS, upstream from the translational RBS.
We used the medium strong RBS for further analysis.
Examining methods of PHB extraction

- Add 2 ul of template DNA from the supernatant of step 1 into their respective tubes (nothing in the control tube).
- Add 1.5 ul of TAQ Polymerase into the centrifuge tube (master mix).
- Pipette 48 ul of master mix into each PCR tube.
- Run 35 cycles with temperatures of 95 C, 50 C, and 72 C with an extension time of 1.5 minutes.
- Leave overnight at 4 C.
- Remove and place in the freezer (5.21 at 9:45am).
3) Check with Agarose Electrophoresis (5.22)
- Make a standard 1% gel using 75 ml of 1X TAE buffer  and 0.75 grams of agarose (regular agarose, not low melt).  Put into the microwave for about 90 seconds or until the agarose is completely dissolved.  Pulsing the microwave may be necessary to prevent boiling over
- Let the flask cool until it isn't burning hot.  Add 1 drop of ethidium bromide and swirl to mix.
- Pour the liquid onto the gel bed and let it cool.  Insert the appropriate sample comb (need 4 slots).
- Move the gel into the proper orientation (DNA runs towards the red electrode) in the gel box, cover the gel with 1X TAE buffer and load 8 ul of each of the PCR products with 3 ul of loading dye mixed in.  Add a DNA ladder as a reference.  Turn on the power supply and run at 150-175 volts.  Let it run for 25 minutes.
- Visualize the gel in an Alphaimager.

iGem T7 F: 2uL of ""5"" PCR product + 1uL of forward primer (BI257)
iGem T7 R: 2uL of ""5"" PCR product + 1uL of reverse primer (BI258)
V) Results
The bands from the ""5"" and ""10"" PCR tubes showed bands at around 1600 base pairs.  This confirms that proper PCR was accomplished and there was no contamination.  Also, the ""10"" band was brighter than the ""5"" band and the control slot had no bands.

C. Two areas are on the same bench with separated sections.
D. We practically do not separate those two areas.
E. Other situation
There are more and more young scientists returning to China from abroad, which is encouraged by the government. Also, many students choose to seek a higher degree in China and professors are encouraged to supervise more students. Accordingly,  many institutes have run out of room for laboratories and the laboratories are sometimes crowded with too many students and equipment. Though many laboratories have set a separate room for resting purposes, many laboratories cannot provide a living room for students. They have to set a special area in the room for living purposes and they agreed not to do experiment near the living area. They will remind each other not doing this. However, some reagents are easy to evaporate and some microorganisms can spread into the air. Things like that would still cause harm to the students. The slight harm can accumulate in the long-term lab work.
Also, there are some labs that don't care about this issue. In some microorganisms labs, the two areas have to share a bench or even do not separate with each other.
Different types of resting area in different labs.
Q2. How frequent do you have meal in lab (excluding the situation if you have the meal in a separated resting room)
A. I had meal in lab almost every day.
B. I often had meal in lab.
C. I only have meal in lab when I have no alternative choices.
D. I have never had and never will have meal in lab.
E. Other situation
Some experiments have special requirements for time management. Sometimes experiments can last for so long that students have little time finishing their lunch. For the labs without a separate room for resting, students might choose to have lunch in the lab. However, most of them know that it's harmful. 38.75% of the students had never had and would never have meal in lab. 30% of the students only do this when they had to.
However, there are still 1/3 of the students unaware of the harmfulness. Usually the leaders of these labs are so strict that they favor students who spend the longest time in the lab. When doing the research, we saw a student having lunch near a mice cage. (The smell is really unpleasant-we wondered how he could do this.) In some cases, students left the snack packages open in the lab while conducting experiments.
We also saw that several labs have a little kitchen in it. In one lab, the ""kitchen"" is just located beside the experiment bench.

Sorbonne Université Paris
One of our team members has a friend at Sorbonne , who kindly put us in contact with their iGEM team. As they knew we have architecture students in the team they asked us to produce a visual for their human practices.   They sent us over an initial sketch, once this was received we used our imaginations and attempted to visualise this part of their project for them. The image shows a semi-permeable membrane which would contain their genetically modified bacteria, anchored to the sea bed - but not so deep that they wouldn’t receive any light. This would prevent their bacteria from being released into the environment.
University of Warwick
To aid Warwick in their project we collected a series of water samples from bodies of water in areas surrounding Newcastle.

Qualitative Checklist | Dylan, Sarah, and Dinithi
The qualitative portion of the fluid functionality checklist consists of various failure modes. These are visual cues that something has gone wrong while running a chip, such as liquid leaking out of a channel or primitive. If a chip passes each of these qualitative checks, it is deemed “fluid functional.” If a chip does not pass each of these qualitative checks, the user moves to the quantitative analysis to determine why the chip failed.
Quantitative Analysis | Dylan and Sarah
The quantitative portion of the fluid functionality checklist consists of various quantitative analyses. Two forms of analysis are included in this portion of our evaluation system: physics-based primitive analysis and image processing-based analysis. Physics based analysis helps to determine if a qualitative failure occurred because the incorrect primitive dimensions and/or flow rate were used. Image processing analysis is used to evaluate the functionality of primitives such as mixers. Using these analyses, a user can both determine why their chip failed and evaluate the functionality of key primitives.

1 PyeaR + LacZ Construct
1.1 Motivation
1.2 Procedure
1.3 Notes on experiments
The original plan was to use the BBa_K216009 part to characterise the PyeaR promoter, through a β-galactosidase assay to determine the activity of the PyeaR part. Having struggled to get a workable result through Edinburgh's BioBrick, we decided to set about designing our own.
The plan would be to take the BBa_K216005 part and use this as a base for the new part containing a full functional copy of the LacZ part - for this part an ideal BioBrick in the registry already existed, containing a good Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS) plus the full length LacZ sequence: BBa_I732017 . Combining the two existing biobricks into one should have been a simple procedure, though through error and plain bad luck, after to consecutive attempts no working product was forthcoming, and with just two weeks before the new term was due to start we abandoned the construction of the PyeaR + LacZ construct in favour of getting the best data we could from Edinburgh's BBa_K216009 part.
The rest of this page is dedicated to the procedure followed"

Deterministic models
Our software aims to simulate the complex biological system and introduce interdisciplinary method to solve problems. We learned from the models adopted by our team last year, and developed new models to further illustrate the relations between parts and circuits.
We look into these basic processes and find that biological process is actually the result of activation or repression between proteins; in other words, we can use the activation and repression to further represent most biological processes. So we look up the related reference to find out formulas for the activation and repression. We utilize the basic Hill equation as following, and improve the equation.
  Basic Hill equation:     
where θ represents the fraction of the ligand-binding sites on receptor proteins occupied by their specific ligands; [L] is the free (unbound) ligand concentration; KA is the ligand concentration in which half of the ligand-biding sites are occupied. This is also the microscopic dissociation constant; n is the Hill coefficient;
Since biological processes are the results of activation and repression between proteins, they also display similar results in the equations form and we therefore deduce their ordinary differential equations[1][2][3][4]:
  Repression:      
  Activation:      
where [P] is the concentration of the target protein; [R] is the concentration of the repressor protein; [A] is the concentration of activator protein; α is the maximum rate of protein synthesis; β is the degradation rate of the protein; γ is the leakage rate; K is the reaction constant equivalent to the concentration at which the protein is half-activated or half-repressed; n is the Hill coefficient
These models capture the main features of biological processes and therefore achieve relative accuracy. We further adapt these equations into different biological structures such as toggle switch and oscillator in order to allow the researchers to design circuits at the structural level and therefore gain an overall and comprehensive insight.
1. Toggle Switch[5][6]
The behavior of the toggle switch and the conditions for bistability can be understood using the following dimensionless model for the network:
where repressor1 and repressor2 mean two outputs of the toggle switch. α1, α2 is the effective synthesis rate of two repressor proteins, and β, γ, reflects the extent to which two proteins repress each other (See Figure 1).
Figure 1. A toggle switch, The presence of Repressor1 can repress the transcription of Repressor2, but such repression can be"

UVA Meet-Up
The University of Virginia iGEM team invited us along with William & Mary, University of Delaware, UNC-Asheville, and the University of Maryland to the Virginia Mid-Atlantic Meetup event. Each team gave a short presentation on their project. After every two presentations, there were break-out sessions. Most of the collaboration took place during the breakout sessions. Due to this opportunity, we were able to discuss and ask questions to the other teams about their projects.  The discussions helped us think about our project on an introspective level.  Through our conversations with William & Mary, we realized the importance of the rate of protein expression in a vector and its relation to our protein expression rates.  Analyzing how each group presented improved our overall presentation technique. After every presentation and break out session the Community Bio Labs from Charlottesville presented and then we had one final breakout session. This break-out session was the most important because we were able to speak directly with someone who had used HCG and pregnancy tests as a detection device. The conversation made us think about the concentration levels pregnancy tests detect and how we may need to alter our detection mechanism.
Emory
Emory, this year, had a cool project that focused on an issue faced by water refinery plants. Emory found during their visit to their local WaterHub that a primary concern was to come up with an efficient way to deal with constant fluctuating orthophosphate levels. Emory, to address this problem, decided to experiment on increasing the efficiency of organisms to eat phosphate. We assisted Emory in this endeavor by working with four strains of Bacillus subtilis. Two of the strains were wild-type isolated from water donated by the Emory Waterhub, and two of the strains were commercially available Bacillus subtilis. The goal of our work was to see which strain could uptake the most phosphate.  To test the bacteria we the protocol provided by Emory, see tab labeled Emory protocol. Then we modified the protocol, see modified protocol. And, finally, because we were lucky enough to visit the Georgia Aquarium"

Where MP is the multiplicity of the microstate – the number of possible arrangements of ligands in the system.
Counting microstates
We'll notice that for every arrangement of type A ligands, there are numerous possible arrangements of the other ligands. Also, there is redundancy in the total possible arrangements – since all ligands of type A are the same, it does not matter which one occupies which cell. Same thing for particles of types B, C and D.
For example, the number of microstates of the system for the macrostate in which none of the ligands are bound to the receptor is:

Week3: Monday 15th - Sunday 21th August
Tuesday
Today, August 16, is a very important day for the people living in Kyoto, because the historical fire festival called 'Gozan-no-Okuribi' is held. The original purpose of this festival is to pray for the deceased. Just five months ago, about 20,000 people died in the devastating earthquake and tunami. And so many people are still struggling to live in the affected area. Moreover, the situation of Fukushima is also totally unresolved. This disaster robbed us of a lot of precious memories, lovers, and peaceful daily lives. However, at the same time, it reminded us of the importance of the bonding with friends or families, and also gave us the good opportunity to rethink about nuclear power plants. Now, all we can do is to do our best for the recovery.
We would like express our heartfelt gratitude to all countries which gave helps to Japan, and would like to pray silently for the victims.
Wednesday
Rakunan high school is the second place we visited for the lecture of Human Practice. The number of the participants were small compared with the first lecture at Todaiji-Gakuen, but the students listened hard to our lecture.
Thursday
Team Capture assembled the first experimental system to research the phototaxis of flies.  However, the response of flies against LEDs was not clear and we could not get respectable results. It seems that we have to improve the way to experiment.
Week4: Monday 22th - Sunday 28th August

Today, an important meeting of iGEM Japan was held at Kyoto University. Members of iGEM Japan got together at Kyoto from Osaka and Tokyo! The participating universities were the University of Tokyo, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Osaka University, and us, Kyoto University. Each participants made presentation on the progress of their projects, and discussed each others very animatedly. We learned a lot from talking with each other.
After the presentation, we enjoyed a dinner party! During this party, we forgot the fatigue of researching and felt refreshed. Let's go MIT together!

SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour53_-_-_TEXT.html," where cellulose containing materials, e.g. plant material, can be added, and through which the tank can be cleaned. In the  bottom of the tank there is a tap where the final product can be tapped.
The cellulose tank functions as an autoclave when closed and heated. For this purpose the tank has a valve, with which the pressure can be regulated.
Figure 2: Process diagram of Nutrition Generator. To start the expression of proteins and fatty acids by Edible coli, a small amount of the bacteria is transferred from the bacteria tank to the cellulose tank. Then cellulose is added into the cellulose tank  through the lid. The bacteria will now begin to degrade cellulose and express ω3 and ω6 fatty-acid and  OneProt, a protein that contains all the essential amino acids in the right ratio, as well as all the  nonessential amino acids. After a while the bacteria is autoclaved, so the end product does not contain  any living bacteria.
Before the final product can be tapped, a small amount must be pumped through the bacteria reflow tube  into the bacteria tank. The final product functions as media for the living bacteria in the bacteria tank.  Now the final product can be tapped and enjoyed.  The Nutrition Generator is available as both electric and non-electric version, for which the non-electric version  requires heat energy from e.g. a campfire. Specialized staff is only needed when the product is set up.  Afterwards the use of the product is very simple and even children can operate the tank. The wear and tear  that might appear after long term use can be fixed with simple handyman skills.
Edible coli - The core product
Edible coli is a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli bacteria that is genetically modified. The bacteria is designed with a plasmid, containing the genes for OneProt and ω3 and ω6 fatty acid biosynthesis. The  promoters are activated in the presence of cellulose.  OneProt is a protein that includes all the essential and non essential amino acids in the right ratio  recommended by WHO (World Health Organization).  For those wanting Edible coli with taste, the bacteria is also available with a high expressed lemon flavor  gene.
Safety
The Nutrition Generator is a safe and closed system and without any risk of bacterial infection.  When Edible coli is transferred from the bacteria tank into the cellulose tank, the lid and tap are closed.  Furthermore, before the end product is tapped from the tank, the entire contents of the cellulose tank is"

(Fig4-2-2)
After 4 hours of arabinose and IPTG induction, the fluorescence intensities of the cultures were measured by fluorometer (FLA5000, FUJI).
LacIM1 shows weaker repression to lac promoter than LacIWT
We confirmed that LacIM1 (BBa_K082026) represses lac promoter but the repression is weaker than that by LacIWT (BBa_I732820).  Figure. 4-2-2 shows that in the presence of arabinose and the absence of IPTG, the fluorescence intensity of the cell with LacIM1 was higher than that of the cell with LacIWT.  This result shows that the repression by LacIM1 to lac promoter is weaker than that by LacIWT.  In the absence of both arabinose and IPTG, the fluorescence intensity of the cell with LacIM1 was about 1.8-fold higher than that in the presence of arabinose and the absence of IPTG. From this result, we concluded that the GFP expression was repressed dependent on the LacIM1 expression induced by arabinose. In other words, the fact that LacIM1 represses the GFP expression was confirmed. Moreover, increase of GFP expression by addition of IPTG, with or without arabinose induction, also shows that the repressions are dependent on LacIM1.
Leaky expression of LacI proteins from Pbad promoter
We confirmed that leaky expressions of LacIM1 and LacIWT occurred respectively in the absence of arabinose.  The fluorescence intensity of the culture with LacIM1 in the absence of both arabinose and IPTG was lower than that in the absence of arabinose and presence of IPTG.  Without arabinose, the repression of GFP expression should not occur because the expression of LacIM1 does not occur.  This result shows that the leaky expressed LacIM1 repressed GFP expression in the absence of IPTG.  This leaky expression could also explain the results for LacIWT.
Overexpression of LacIWT inhibits the expression of GFP even in the presence of IPTG induction
We confirmed that the overproduction of LacIWT with arabinose induction inhibits the GFP expression even in the presence of IPTG.  Although arabinose induces the overproduction of LacI protein that represses the GFP expression, the repression by LacI protein can be inhibited with IPTG induction."
FAFU-CHINA,2016,Team:FAFU-CHINA#page4_-_-_TEXT.html," by ourselves independently. We focused on ear caring and called on public awareness on hearing loss.
Investigation
We designed a questionnaire on the internet (link: sojump ) and investigated about whether people know about iGEM, and their experiences related to hearing-impaired people. We collected about 500 answers and did data analysis shown as below.
Question 1: Have you ever communicated with hearing impaired people in your daily life?
Despite the large amount of hearing-impaired people shown in the statistical data, fewer people have communicated with people with hearing loss. The communication difficulties may make them never have chance to come into contact with normal people.
Question 2: Do you know how to use sign language to communicate with people?
We found that very few people can use sign language to communicate, even simplest words. The reason could be the lack of attention to hearing-impaired people, or the lack of sign language spreading itself. Whatever, popularize sign language is impending.
Question 3: Do you find it difficult to communicate with people with hearing difficulties?
For those who have communicated with hearing-impaired people, about 80% feel it difficult. Undoubtedly, this is the truth. To eliminate this trouble, on one hand, sign language should be popularized. On the other hand, hearing aids and cochlear implants and clinical therapies need to be improved and pervaded.
Question 4: If sign language classes is added in general education as optional courses, would you like to learn some simple sign language?
More than half of the people expressed their interests into sign language learning. Actually, most people hold their kind heart to treat people with inconvenience.
Question 5: Do you know iGEM? (before answering this questionnaire)
Actually, because our questionnaire was spread to the public, half of people investigated have not heard about iGEM before. We have the necessity to make more people know synthetic biology and know iGEM, for these really change our world.
Consultation
To obtain more information about the life of people with hearing impairment, we consulted specialists who work in various areas, as well as some relevant local charity or official associations. From the dimension of Policy, Law, Medication, Philanthropy and Research, we consulted lawyers and judges, doctors, professors and managers of several charity organizations. At the same time, we introduced our project and received suggestions to promote our project.
Law
We are curious about laws that about the rights of people with hearing loss and the investigation process in case of surdomute criminal suspects. We consulted a Justice Liu and a legal practitioner, Miss Zhao.

Lethbridge Conference
On June 26th and 27th, Alberta Innovates Technology Futures had invited us to attend their student workshop in Lethbridge, Alberta. Throughout the weekend we were given insight on several areas of our iGEM project. These included marketing, media relations, presentation skills and project ideas and troubleshooting.
Presenters included:
Joey Hundert – Marketing/Sponsorship
The first guest speaker at Lethbridge was Joey Hundert. Joey was an amazing resource because of his expertise in entrepreneurship specifically on the field of sustainable development. He broadened our understanding on approaching companies for sponsorship, especially when marketing to companies about the new and innovative field of synthetic biology. This was incredibly useful for our group as none of the undergraduates had prior experiences with marketing and sponsorship.
Erin Prefontaine and Bob Cooney - Painless Publicity
The next presentation was a joint presentation by Erin and Bob. Erin is the Communication Officer of Alberta Innovates Technology Futures, and Bob is the Communications Officer of the University of Lethbridge. They offered an insightful presentation on the precautions necessary when speaking to the media. They provided us with advices on how to approach the media while remaining careful with the choice of our words. Our aim is not to scare the public, but to show them why we're are doing what we are doing and what the benefits to the public are, from our findings. They also suggested we contact Grady Simmons, who is involved with the media relations for the University of Calgary.
Anne Marie Downey - Communication
On June 28th, our first speaker was Anne Marie Downey. She was a gracious, talented guest speaker who gave us constructive ideas regarding presentation skills. Some of the keypoints of the presentation were communication skills, developing the content in PowerPoints, the purpose of using visuals and managing the response of the audience.

In the industry this algae  has been used on different areas such as: biofuels production (lipid  for biodiesel), biorremediation (heavy metals subtraction from  water), pigment production (carotenoids) and bioreactor for  production of recombinant proteins for medical use. This is due to  some of its features as easy and cheap culture, great capacity of  store biomass and because commonly it is considered non harmful for  human beings.

Genetic circuit:
The designed genetic circuit is very similar to    the one that is employed at co-culture project. In this one the    psbA promoter regulates λ production; and this production of λ regulates the expression of lux operon.
During the day the presence of CI repressor    inhibits the expression of lux operon because alga does not emit    light.

During night λ product is not present and that    allows the expression of lux operon and the following light    emission.

Software
We built a nanoparticle customizer, which allows you to track the concentration and rates of drug delivery to any part of the body using nanoparticles. You can customize your own design of nanoparticles, and analyze its function inside the body.
This computational software can be used by future iGEM teams who are interested in using nanoparticles to efficiently deliver their synthesized proteins. The calculational tool is programmed on a Google Spreadsheet. Click the button below to visit the spreadsheet. Please make a copy of the spreadsheet to freely use it.

Conclusion
The models allowed us to extrapolate short-term experimental data to the long-term, to over 50 years, the duration for cataracts to form. In Models 1-2, with the Cataract Lens Experiments on our synthesized protein GSR (and CH25H), we found the amount of synthesized protein needed in the lens over 50 years. In Models 3-4, with the experimental results of a single dose of nanoparticle release, we simulate multiple doses to see the overall change in GSR concentration in the lens over 50 years. We calculate the exact concentrations of our eyedrop prototype, to prevent a LOCS 2.5 cataract from developing so surgery is not needed. With our predictions and simulations of cataract treatment, we offered insights into how the product should be manufactured and used in clinics. We also programmed a nanoparticle customizer to allow the results of these models to be generalized to all drug delivery iGEM projects.

The test for influence of chromium on the specific cell extract, illustrated in figure 7 showed that the influence of chromium at low concentrations is not significant. But the graphic shows that high concentrations of chromium induce fatal damages to the cell extract.
Figure 9: Chromium specific cell extract made from E. coli cells which already expressed the repressor before cell extract production. Induction with different chromium concentrations. The data are normalized on chromium’s influence to the cell extract. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Taking the influence of different chromium concentrations under consideration measured fluorescence can be normalized on chromium’s influence on the cell extract (figure 9). Normalized data suggest, that higher concentrations of chromium induce fluorescence in relevance to chromium’s influence on the cell extract.

Data are normalized on chromium’s influence to the specific cell extract Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological replicates.
In addition to the measurements of our chromium sensor in CFPS we measured our chromium inducible promoter with the repressor of team Dundee (figure 10, 11), which works similar to ours. In contrast to our repressor only first 15 codons of their repressor are codon-optimized. Measurements with their repressor showed tendencies similar to our measured repressor. After normalization induction with higher chromium concentrations showed a detectable fluorescence response for both measured datasets.
To summarize
Our chromium sensor detects the presence of chromium in vivo, but the outcome differed from our expectations. We would have expected an increase in fluorescence by increasing chromium concentrations. Our in vitro data suggest that these decrease in fluorescence could be explained by chromium’s influence on E. coli which is not reflected in growth but shown by chromium´s influence on the cell extract. Before normalizing the in vitro data the same pattern as in vivo could be observed. After normalization an increase in signal is noticeable. Therefore with optimization our chromium sensor would be compatible to our cell free sensor system.

Nanjing-China,2015,Team:Nanjing-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," technologies encounter the problem of sediments which contained a variety of heavy metal such as lead. The combination of our two teams not only identified the significance of collaboration, but could solve some real-life problems as well.
2.SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
This year, we were very close with Nanjing-China team. They are dealing with heavy metal problems through biofilms. When we talked about collaboration, we first thought about binding two projects on seawater desalination field. Thus, we discussed an application with this two project combining. Our team is responsible for explain this application and its supporting fact. Nanjing-China team will explain the details which needs to be discussed to make this working for real.
First, we start with the features of seawater and the end purpose of the combination project. Most of the seawater desalination plant use open-water intake near costal to avoid intake costs. This also means that the factories can’t avoid to deal with different pollutions in costal seawater, including heavy metal pollution.
The main source of coastal heavy metal pollution is runoff and atmospheric sedimentation. From 2006 to 2007, Oceanic Administration of People’s Republic of China did a massive-scale offshore detection for water condition. In its report, the concentration of lead, copper, zinc and mercury in seawater which is over the first seawater class at some monitoring spots. Among them, average lead concentration in the Bohai Sea is over the first seawater class, and some of the monitoring spot detect a number over the second seawater class. The natural degradation of heavy metal is very difficult. Also, the offshore is relatively big water body which makes the pollution hard to increase as well as decrease. Overall, the heavy metal pollution of Chinese offshore cannot be overlook when we use seawater as material.
In normal desalination process, even normal resource water has to go through some sedimentation processes. In fact, one of the safety concern of general seawater desalination is what do we do with those sediments. The idea of cooperating two project is to merge Nanjing-China team’s project to achieve a new seawater recovery and utilizing system.
The word “circular economy” should be familiar to most people. In China, this is one of the guiding ideology for the economic and society development. The core of the concept is to maintain the balance between resource and waste. To balance the rapid consumption of resource, man should not only depend on nature but also ourselves to turn wastes into resources.
Unlike water has a strong nature balance itself, heavy-metal’s nature circulation is much slower. We need to use"

Integrated design of peristaltic pump
4.1Working principle of traditional peristaltic pump:
A peristaltic pump consists of a motor-driven wheel with peripherally placed rollers and an adjustable compression cam (or band) which is squeezed against the rollers. One or several pump tubes are affixed so that they rest on a minimum of two rollers at all times . The successive peristaltic movements of the tubes force various fluids through the tubes[6]
Fig.11 Schematic diagram of the working principle of peristaltic pump[6]
4.2 Chip design:
With reference to the traditional peristaltic pump construction, we integrate the rotor and hose into the inside of the chip. The driving part is composed of a rotor, a hose and a nut, wherein the nut is a bonding point of the chip and the screwdriver. Rotating the nut with a stepper motor control screwdriver can drive the rotation of the rotor. When the rotor rotates, it squeezes the hose and drives the liquid to flow.
4.3 Advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages: Compared with the electromagnetic interference that may exist in electromagnetic driving, the magnetic strength is difficult to quantify, etc., the integrated peristaltic pump has fewer potential influencing factors, better working stability, short manufacturing cycle and mature process.
Disadvantages: The volume of the integrated peristaltic pump chip is relatively affected by the driving area, and the function is not as flexible as the electromagnetic driving function. The micro-valve is required to complete the control of the liquid flow.
4.4 Detailed steps to make the chip
PMMA chip production process
Draw a designed chip map using SOLIDWORKS and export it to DXF file format;
Use RDWorksV8 to import the drawn print files into the laser cutting machine.
Place a 2mm thick acrylic plate in the laser cutting machine, set the cutting speed to 5mm/s, start the laser cutting machine, and wait for the chip to be cut.
After cutting the layers of the chip, wash and dry with deionized water;
Arrange, align and align the layers of the chip according to the design;
Clamp the chip with two aluminum plates to make the layers of the chip closely fit together;
Put the aluminum plate and chip into the oven at 170 °C, control the temperature change within ±5 °C, and heat for 14 min.

4) CsCl gradient (8.15)
Phage Purification Team was able to finalize their procedures for performing CsCl gradient on T7 phage. For specifics please refer to 8.16 CsCl Gradient
The finished gradient was aliquoted into 27 eppendorf tubes, each containing 0.5-1mL solution. We will need to determine phage characteristics in each aliquot before proceeding with dialysis and TEM.
5) Characterizing post-CsCl phage (8.16-8.18)
Spot test was performed to determine which aliquots contain viable phage. Specifically, after plating 0.5mL of E coli B overnight and 5mL of x1 agar onto each plate, 10uL of each aliquot was spotted onto the plates. Plaques formation would indicate a phage concentration of at least 10E2 pfu/mL.
All 27 aliquots formed plaques. Thus, further spot tests are needed to estimate the concentration of phage in each aliquot. 1:100 dilution series were performed for each aliquot to generate a -2 and -4 dilution sample for each. All dilution samples were spotted (5uL) onto plates overlaid with 0.5mL of E coli B overnight and 5mL of x1 agar.
Results from concentration spot test was superimposed on the deduced gradient. Reconstructed CsCl gradient is drawn below. 13 aliquots were selected for plating. Each aliquot was plated using the lowest dilution (-2 or -4) that showed plaque during previous concentration spot test. Specifically, 0.5mL of E coli B was infected with 50uL of phage sample for approximately 15 minutes before they were plated along with 6mL of x6 top agar.
Variation exist on every plate. Generally, aliquots with smaller number showed the smaller plaques correlating with bigger phage that migrated to the bottom of the gradient. In contrast, aliquots with bigger number showed bigger plaques correlation with smaller phage that didn't move too far down the gradient. 12 small plaques and 12 big plaques are the respective end of the spectrum were selected (see picture below for more graphic description"

MySQL
  Our first choice of database
  We have used MySQL as our relational database management system (RDBMS). The MySQL database has become the world's most popular open source database. Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations including Facebook, Google, Adobe, Alcatel Lucent and Zappos rely on MySQL to save time and money to power their high-volume Web sites, business-critical systems and packaged software. Given these considerations, MySQL has many attractive features to offer:
  
Speed. MySQL is fast. Its developers contend that MySQL is about the fastest database system you can get. You can investigate this claim by visiting http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/benchmarks/ , a performance-comparison page on the MySQL Web site.
  
Ease of use. .MySQL is a high-performance but relatively simple database system and is much less complex to set up and administer than larger systems.
  
Query language support. MySQL understands SQL (Structured Query Language), the standard language of choice for all modern database systems.
  
Capability. The MySQL server is multi-threaded, so many clients can connect to it at the same time. Each client can use multiple databases simultaneously. You can access MySQL interactively using several interfaces that let you enter queries and view the results: command-line clients, Web browsers, or GUI clients. In addition, programming interfaces are available for many languages, such as C, Perl, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby. You can also access MySQL using applications that support ODBC and .NET (protocols developed by"

In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR, whose expression is repressed at an extream low level and the system enters into its 'LacI' state. Similar analysis will do for TetR and the system will enter into 'TetR' state if its quantity dominates. To show transition between the two states, IPTG is added in 1s after the system enters into 'LacI' state completely. The assembling of parts are construcuted as follows:
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli .
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate the state transition:
State of system has changed to 'TetR' state from 'LacI' state after adding inducer IPTG at 40000s.
The legend used in the figure is not clear. 13:DNA;(lacI153)4, 11:DNA;(tetR154)2, and 14:DNA;(lacI153)4;(tetR154)2 means binding products of initial plasmid with lacI tetramer at site pLacI gene, with tetR dimer at site pTet gene, and with lacI tetramer and tetR dimer both, respectively. At the beginning, initial plasmids are all bound with lacI tetramer and the system is in its 'LacI' state. After adding inducer IPTG at 40000s, concentration of tetR dimer increases and plasmids bound with lacI tetramer start to bind with tetR dimer and form complex of plasmids, lacI tetramer, and tetR dimer. At about 70000s, all plasmids bound with lacI tetramer are further bound with tetR dimer. At about 85000s, due to repression of expression of lacI, plasmids bound with LacI tetramer and tetR dimer both start to unbind to form plasmids bound with tetR dimer only and the system steps into its 'TetR' state gradually.

Low-fidelity Prototype
How It Works
The Level 0 workspace contains a library populated with over 2000 biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The user can utilize filters or search for a specific part using the part’s common name or registry id to browse the library. Each biological part is color-coded based on its type.
A data sheet and multiple publication abstracts for part BBa_K658008.
Drag-and-drop functionality is used to transfer information from one workspace to another.
Within the Level 1 and Level 2 workspaces, the user can utilize two methods of construct assembly: manual assembly and automatic assembly. Manual assembly allows the user to create specific constructs from specific parts whereas automatic assembly will generate all possible constructs from the selected biological parts.
Information for each part is easily accessed by pulling up a data sheet and publications list from the element menu. The data sheet is populated with standard information about the part from the parts registry. The publications are fetched from Pubmed and parsed for abstracts and publication info.
At any point in the design process, the user can launch the primer designer. Similar to the Level 1 and Level 2 workspaces, primers can be created manually or automatically. By including a built-in primer designer, the MoClo planner efficiently encompasses all steps of the design and build process.
Results
We conducted several user studies this summer and refined our evaluation and design to reflect the user feedback with each study. We had six groups of Wellesley undergraduates (who had exposure to introductory biology classes) (overall 12 users, all undergraduate students), the BU iGem team (overall 4 users, 2 undergraduate, 1 graduate, 1 postdoc), and four pairs from the MIT iGEM (overall 8 users, all undergraduate students) team working collaboratively. During our testing session users constructed a multi-gene network using MoClo Planner – the BU and MIT teams, each used the system to construct the biological parts they designed for their project. We collected data through observations and post-task questionnaires. We utilized three questionnaires: 1) a standard NASA TLX questionnaire to measure subjective task workload; 2) a standard engagement questionnaire to measure  task engagement; and 3) a subjective satisfaction questionnaire where users reported on their experience using the system.
In general, users found the interface of the layered workspaces to be intuitive. This was"

A Simple Pharmaceutical Protein Production & Purification System on Mars
""In order to truly explore space, astronauts will need the capability to produce needed                             medications during their mission"" - Virginia Wotring (Adjunct Associate Professor,                     Center for Space Medicine and Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Baylor College of                     Medicine).
The race to the Red Planet has started and colonization could be in the near future! To make the                     colonization of Mars possible the first people will, of course, need to be able to survive and be                     self-sustaining in a place far from Earth. Astronauts will need access to medicine, but bringing it                     from the Earth is unsustainable. With our project, we aim to make a Portable Protein Production and                     Purification System that will solve the astronauts need for pharmaceutical protein by letting them                     produce their own medicine on site - no need to depend on the supply from Earth!
How does our system work?
Our protein production system uses the bacterial injectisome (Type III Secretion System) as a                     molecular syringe. Some pathogenic bacteria use the injectisome to secrete toxic proteins into                     mammalian cells, an example of such a bacteria is the Salmonella bacteria. When the bacteria want to secrete a protein through the injectisome, only specifically tagged proteins carrying an                     injectisome secretion signal will be able to be secreted. This means that only proteins tagged with                     that signal are able to get secreted through the injectisome. We want to take advantage of that                     feature by making the bacteria produce useful proteins for us and inject it out through a                     biomimetic membrane into an isolated collection                         chamber . When the protein enters the isolated compartment it will theoretically be 100%                     pure and ready be collected and used for therapeutics.

In our outreach initiatives we have taken advantage of different talent programmes in Denmark in order to reach students from our target group, able to understand the complexity and potential of synthetic biology. These include Science Talents at the Mærsk Science Center and Academy for Talented Young Students - one of the largets operators for talent development of students from upper secondary school in Denmark.
Our outreach initiatives were diverse within the set frame and involved participation in a documentary movie, conduction of workshops and participation in conferences among others. Each of the activities are described in further details at our achievement page for Policy and Practices .
In addition to the target-group specific initiatives, we prepared and hosted a BioBrick Workshop in the spring for the Danish iGEM teams, in order to provide a good foundation for each of the teams to start their experimental work in the summer. A description of the BioBrick Workshop and the outcome can be found here .

With Team Linköping University: Peanut allergies
This team´s objective is  to analyze food and drink to detect the Ara h allergen, helping peanut allergic consumers to make healthier and easier meal decisions. Their survey was held to examine how mexican society handles the needs of peanut-allergic people.
With ETH Zurich Team: Complexity patterns in nature
We distributed and participated on this team´s survey to help them have broader demographics of the general public´s thoughts about complexity: either on handling the intricacy of many abstract concepts all together or finding this mystification in nature. All this involves a different perspective on how we find ourselves expressing and understanding complex patterns through our daylife. And relates to the project of this iGEM team by finding areas of opportunity where people are able to see patterns of their interest.
Wtih VirginiaTeam: Synthetic Biology Public Acceptance
We interviewed 22 pedestrians in Queretaro to help the  efforts of this team to understand how SynBio is regarded by the general public. Most of the questions were generally about GMOs, how the interviewed people would feel about consuming them and the implications that they would find the most compromising for safety.
With Team France: Weekly Newsletter
The effort of this team is to recompile the updates of every iGEM team, making collaboration easier. Thus we send a brief description of our project to this team to collaborate on this weekly effort.
Media Communication
We have shared information about synthetic biology such as recent news, TED talks and articles. With this work we have also created multiple relations with iGEM teams and people sharing the interest of science and technological innovation.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Collab_-_-_TEXT.html," paper titled 'Synergistic action of azoreductase and laccase leads to maximal decolourization and detoxification of model dye-containing wastewaters' [1] was the fundamental inspiration for our Goodbye AzoDye project. We are truly grateful for their initial support and guidance, and for sending us the following plasmids for our experiments:
pAzoR (pLP-1) containing the FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductase 1 gene. [2]
pCotA (pLOM10) containing the Spore Coat Protein Laccase gene. [3]
p1B6 containing the mutant FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductase 1 gene [4]
pBsDyp (pRC-2) containing the Dye Decolourising Peroxidase BSU38260 gene. [5]
pPpDyp (pRC-1) containing the Dye Decolourising Peroxidase PP_3248 gene. [5]
Central St Martins
We approached the Central St Martins textiles department with our ideas of synthetic biology and science and they asked ‘When does technology like this become accessible?’ This question yielded a set of beautiful visualisation of the way our bacteria could be used to create art if controlled by light.  These pieces by second year Textiles Design BA students Cameo Bondy and Barbara Czepiel exhibit the textiles that could be created if our bacteria contained optogenetic biobricks that switched their dye breakdown capacities on and off via light cues.

Implementing our Investigated Project
Our team has identified the potential collateral damage of having an exponentially growing population of genetically modified E. coli. We realized that we did want our colonies to widely grow in order to achieve their maximum plastic degradation threshold, but are unsure of how their introduction to an aquatic ecosystem might affect its environment, aquatic organisms, and the people that live off these lifeforms. In an attempt to evade such detrimental repercussions, as a team, we’ve decided to concoct a kill switch of sorts- one that acts upon programmed changes in temperature so that it can accommodate the seasonal changes of Baltimore.
During the summer, when tourism is at an all time high, is when the E. coli will be most active. This is to combat the increases in pollution that follow in an increase in human activity.  During the winter, when people are mainly indoors is when it can be inferred that pollution in the Inner Harbor will be at its annual low because of the deficit of human activity. Since there is a relatively low need for our plastic degrading organisms during those winter times, a kill switch can be activated to control the population. By having a more wholesome controlling of the E. coli cells we, as a community, can better monitor them and prevent them from seriously harming our harbor if plans go awry.
Ex: We implement our E. coli cells into the Inner Harbor 1.5 months before winter conditions that would cause our E. coli to self-destruct. We study the aquatic conditions to observe the changes that our G.M.O. may be responsible for.
Say, we notice that there our E. coli cells are making the local crab population sick and its population has decreased by 10%- we now know that our G.M.O’s are incompatible with the Harbor so we won’t reintroduce them after the winter. If we do decide to, they will be further modified to try to solve the crab problem.
A Functional Proof of Concept for the Baltimore BioCrew's BioBrick Device
Based upon our rigorous research efforts, our proof of concept is based upon the meticulous construction of our BioBricks, one of which being the BioBrick for the lipase gene (BBa_K2187001). This BioBrick serves to replace MHETASE, a"
Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#calendar_-_-_TEXT.html,".subtilis Transformation
Aim:
To transform B. subtilis with Groningen 2012 integration plasmid.
Methods:
Please refer to July 17th for the first part of the protocol. The B.subtilis transformation was carried out again to see if it would successfully integrate the Groningen plasmid when a higher concentration of the plasmid was used. The plates used include:
pGFP (positive control)on 5µg/ml Cm and 12.5µg/ml Cm
Groningen plasmid 30 µl on 5µg/ml Cm and 12.5µg/ml Cm
Groningen plasmid 45 µl on 5µg/ml Cm and 12.5µg/ml Cm
Groningen plasmid 60 µl on 5µg/ml Cm and 12.5µg/ml Cm
Water (negative control) on 5µg/ml Cm and 12.5µg/ml Cm
Results and Discussion:
Please see July 19th for results and discussion.

B.subtilis Transformation
Aim and Methods: Please refer to July 17th .
Results and Discussion:
The results of the last transformation of B.subtilis with Groningen 2012 integration plasmid look promising. Everything has worked as expected. The insignificant difference in the number of colonies grown on plate with cells inoculated with different amount of plasmid indicates that the transformation occurred as efficiently as it could at around 9ug of DNA per reaction tube. The reason why nothing grew on the plates with 12.5ug/ml of chloramphenicol may be the inefficiency of the promoter used. The colony counts are recorded in a table below.

Forum calculates the popularity of bricks in real time. The most popular ones will be displayed on the home page:
Plenty of data will be generated in Forum every day, and Biohub will use them to correct the deviation of bricks ranking. For every 30 minutes, the system will recalculate quality of the bricks with the help of data such as star numbers or popularity.
Plugin System
From the very beginning, Biohub 2.0 is designed as a plugin system. Such idea is originated from the project of USTC-Software 2016, which had a defective plugin system. Compared with theirs, the plugin system of Biohub 2.0 has these new features:
Hot Reloadable All components of Biohub 2.0 are designed to be self-reloadable, which means servers need not to be restarted while installing or uninstalling plugins.
More Utilities Biohub 2.0 encapsulates varieties of modules to simplify plugin development, including URL routing, background tasks, websocket dispatching, file handling, and so on.
Full Access to the System Biohub 2.0 doesn't have sand-box mechanism, which means plugins can take all advantages of th operating system. But uploaded plugins should be checked manually by us as a consideration of security.
By default, Biohub 2.0 carries 3 plugins, you can find them in the ""Plugins"" page.
BioMap
As a demonstration of how to use bricks data in plugins, we build BioMap. BioMap is a gadget to analyze the relationship between different bricks. Simply type the brick name you want to analyze and click the corresponding button, a graph will be shown to visualize the relationship:
Since the result set may be very large in reversed relationship querying, we will compress them by only displaying a portion of them as you can see.
You can select the nodes inside to perform further analysis:
BioMap have preprocessed and cached the relationship network while deploying, so it will not consume much time to accomplish the analysis.
ABACUS
ABACUS is a tool to design amino acid sequence from a given protein. Proteins are specified in Protein Data Bank format. The uploaded .pdb will be evaludated by simulated annealing algorithm, and another .pdb file representing the result will be returned. To upload a sample, simply click the ""Upload and Compute"" button and choose the file:
The computation will take several minutes to accomplish. You may browse other pages during this time, and an notification will be sent after the task done. ABACUS"
