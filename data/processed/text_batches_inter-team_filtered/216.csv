Pasteur_Paris,2016,Team:Pasteur Paris#medals_-_-_TEXT.html," Synthetic Biology. (evidence) 3. Human practice: (evidence) - Ethics and safety: we followed safety training for general lab safety. We also learned how to handle nonhazardous organisms not exceeding level 2 (safety requirements BHSL 1/2, no manipulation of NSB 3 and 4 pathogens). GMOs were confined into the lab, and strict waste disposal protocols as established by Institut Pasteur. For the immunology part, mosquitoes used for experiments were not sampled from the environment, but from the Insectarium facility of Institut Pasteur, rated-as pathogen free, and we only handle a part of the viral protein which is not pathogenic. We complied with the safety requirements in the laboratories. (evidence) - Security: We had restricted access to our lab by Id badges.  We further, in the application part of our project, used symbols to determine the targeted pathogen by the patches to guarantee anonymity by experimenters.Institut Pasteur abides to strict security protocols at the National level for arboviruses, and is a reference center for the World Health Organization (WHO). - Sustainability: our patch is biodegradable, no expensive, ergonomic, which only needs a small amount material (mg), thus produces a minimum amount of waste. The trap is washable and reusable by following standard decontamination procedures established by the center for rapid intervention at Pasteur (CIBU). (evidence) - Social justice: Our trap and patch are easy to use, and is aimed at not being expensive, by having no motorized parts, requiring batteries or electricity. We thought about two kinds of application scenarios: for developed and developing countries in terms of infrastructure and cost. We also thought about education of young people coming from areas with different income. Thus we explained our the Mos(kit)o device, and educated about mosquitoes to both Parisian children (Collège Germaine de Staël, Mosquito chase game, Paris 15 arrondissement), and suburbs (“Jouer à Débattre”: Debate game on synthetic biology in Bobigny, Seine-St-Denis). (evidence) - Intellectual property rights: account of state of the art, no infrigement of IP laws. (evidence)

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#BeeLab_-_-_TEXT.html," which were 15 mL disposable centrifuge tubes with one to three holes drilled at the ends. When filled and capped, a vacuum is created which prevents the feed from pouring out while still allowing the solution to drip out slowly so that the honeybees are able to feed.
Figure 3: Depicted are several of our custom bee cages with our vacuum feeding tubes, filled with sugar-water, inserted.
Check-in Procedures
For all our experiments, our members performed daily check-ins on the bees. Each day, the number of dead bees was counted and then removed from the cage. If the feeding tubes had a volume of less than 5 mL, they were refilled with the appropriate feed. The number of dead bees per cage and the initial and final feeding tube volumes were recorded.
Honeybee Termination
Our termination protocols prioritized the welfare of the honeybees. Through our conversations with bee-researchers, we found out that honeybees are classified to have no experience of pain, only a reflex to pain stimuli. However, our team still decided to create termination procedures that both reduce any pain stimuli the bees might experience and are consistent with established methods. Termination, by instantaneous decapitation/physical destruction, was conducted swiftly in order to eliminate the possibility that the bees might experience a pain stimulus. Our termination protocols were only used when the honey bees had fulfilled their intended purpose for our experiments, meaning that we plan on terminating no bees unless we can obtain quality measurements from them.
Nosema ceranae Spore Counts
After dead honeybees were collected, or live bee sacrificed, N. ceranae, spore counts were conducted when appropriate. Individual or multiple bees were homogenized in 1 mL of PBS per bee and depending on the spore load, the liquid fraction was diluted further with PBS. 10 uL of each sample were then loaded onto a hemocytometer and Nosema spore were counted using a phase contrast microscope at 400x magnification.
With our bees specimens collected and with our four ultimate goals in mind, we designed several experiments to answer the following questions:
Experiment 1: Is PPIX toxic to E. coli?
Given that APIS is based on increased production of PPIX above natural levels in E. coli, it was necessary to test whether high concentrations of PPIX would have adverse effects on our chassis. Therefore, before commencing on live bees, we conducted an PPIX minimum inhibitory concentration assay for E. coli which is further detailed in Wetlab.

Purdue,2008,Team:Purdue#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," available, and uvrA is not part of the Registry, so we do not have access to it currently.  Ideally, the phr pathway would be preferable for this application, as NER will fix any DNA damage, whereas phr focuses specifically on the dimers formed by UV-B radiation.
Other than the lacZ/X-gal reporter combination, other options were explored.  Initially, we were attracted to the red color of Lycopene (the red pigment in tomatoes), a gene put in the Registry by Edinburgh.  Unfortunately, this part cannot effectively produce any visible pigment in a timely manner.  The next option we looked at was MacConkey agar, which works similarly to X-gal: a lactose-fermenting E. coli will turn red on MacConkey agar.  Therefore, if supplied with lactose and a lacZ gene, lac- E. coli would change colors if attached to the correct promoter.  Unfortunately, this system would require us to create 2 different strains of bacteria (which would have to be kept separate) because they would both be using the lacZ gene.  The next possibility for a color promoter was an RFP gene.  RFP is distinctive from other fluorescent proteins because it turns bacteria a visible red color.  Upon further study, both standard RFP and the its successor mCherry require several hours to be produced to an extent to make them visible without fluorescence.  Again, this timescale is too long for our application.  Our last idea for a visible reporter was the prodigiosin pigment, a pigment naturally made in several strains of bacteria.  When constitutively produced, prodigiosin appears blood-like: bright red and shiny.  Unfortunately, the prodigiosin pathway also requires more than 20 separate genes, all of which would have to be transformed into E. coli.  This is not very feasible for this project.
Future Plans
Upon successfully creating an SOS biosensor, we would like to continue the project in several ways.  First, we would modify the system to improve the speed of color changing.  This could be accomplished by creating an NER- mutant, which would necessarily skip over NER and activate the SOS system almost immediately following any significant UV damage.  As stated before, we would like to add a secondary color system which would probably utilize the uvrA gene of the NER pathway.  Another goal of this team would be to adapt the biosensor to a marketable device, such as a wearable patch.  This way, the true effects of sunscreen could be tested:"
USTC,2017,Team:USTC-Software#implementation_-_-_TEXT.html," To avoid it, we improved ABACUS and enable it to run in two ways: locally or distributedly. If no available executable file is detected, ABACUS will connect to remote slave servers and distribute the computation tasks. This design can largely save the expense of master server, and makes ABACUS infinitely scalable.
About Biocircuit
The Quine-McCluskey algorithm is a method used for minimizing of boolean functions that was developed by W.V.Quine and extended by Edward J.McCluskey.
Espresso heuristic logic minimizer is a computer program using heuristic and specific algorithms for efficiently reducing the complexity of digital electronic gate circuits.
Because Espresso is more efficient than Q-M algorithm, especially when inputs are more than 6, we choose Espresso for our software.
NetworkX is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation and study of the structure, dynamics and functions of complex networks.
We use directed graph to characterize biocircuit, and NetworkX has make it more convenient to operate with graphs.
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Pyeda is a Python library for electronic design automation. We once used pyeda to simplify Boolean formulas. However, we found bugs in the process, so we got in touch with its author Chris Drake and submitted the issue. Therefore, we didn't use pyeda directly but make some changes to his espresso model. We are very grateful to his excellent work.
Frontend Part
To improve the user experience, we build Biohub 2.0 as a single page application (or short for SPA), using the advanced MVVM framework Vue.js . Vue.js relies on webpack (not forcibly, but recommended) for pre-compiling, which encapsulating everything into a single file. This is inconvinient for a website with a plugin system, so we analyzed the code generated by webpack and developed an approach to load components dynamically. It is the theoretical basis of Biohub 2.0's plugin system. You can refer to Main.vue to see such mechanism.
About UI
We choose Bootstrap 3 as our basic framework. Bootstrap is a UI framework developed by Twitter team, with multiple elegant components and the ability to prototype quickly. Based on it, we added many customized styles and components to provides better experience.
To visualize the data, we use serveral data representing frameworks. For example, d3.js for DNA sequance displaying in Forum and ngl.js for protein structure illustration. Such frameworks transform certain data into graphics, and make it easier for users to learn the content.

Background
Potatoes all over the world are in danger and this is not the first time in history. In the late 1840s, potato late blight epidemics caused the Great Famine in Ireland and one million people were starved to death. This devastating disease is caused by the plant pathogenic oomycetes, Phytophthora infestans. Even now, when potatoes are widely grown in 135 countries and consumed by 1 billion people, late blight is still causing serious problems, including food insecurity, economic losses, and environmental damages.
Fig 1. Worldwide distribution of potato late blight caused by P.infestans
Potato late blight costs an annual loss of 6.7 billion USD. Although late blight have only little impact on the food supply in some areas, crop loss can still force farmers out of business. To control late blight, fungicides are frequently used, up to once every 3 days. These fungicides have enormous costs financially, at $200 per acre of farmland. Moreover, these chemicals often seep underground or escape to nearby streams and contaminate water sources. Water samples from over the U.S. show that 75% of surface waters and 58% of groundwater wells contain at least one of the 33 potato fungicides.
In modern agriculture, the use of fungicides and genetically modified potatoes are inefficient in fighting against potato late blight. Most strains of P. infestans have developed resistance against fungicides used nowadays. P. infestans secretes some enzymes and form high turgor pressure inside its cell to penetrate and colonize in potato cells. P. infestans infect potato leaves and tubers; eventually the entire plant rots and dies. The 2015 NYMU-Taipei i"

MEDAL FULFILLMENT
HUMAN PRACTICES
Both Wellesley College and the Tech Museum have a history of addressing issues of gender, class, and education privilege in their work. Thus, BacPack for New Frontiers was designed with the goal to educate members of the community while remaining cognizant of social issues. We identified several key factors that influenced our design and work process and helped us create an installation accessible to the general public. We separate these factors into two categories: those pertaining to social accessibility, such as gender, class, and education; and those pertaining to raising awareness of synthetic biology, such as public perception and engagement.
Social Issues
There is a well known gender gap in the STEM workspace, with women holding less than a quarter of STEM jobs in the US economy*.  The Wellesley_TheTech Team is committed to working towards gender balance in predominantly male areas.  Our mostly-female team of Wellesley College students and three female interns meant that we designed with this in mind and worked on making an inviting exhibit that could be engaging and exciting to anyone regardless of gender.
There is also often disparity in socioeconomic status in users engaging with products, and often technologies and educational devices are not mindful of this in design.  In response, our team was careful to involve students from a variety of socioeconomic status to prototype, including students from Framingham High School and the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound Program, an educational program serving low-income and first generation high school students from the Cambridge area.  In addition, we were sure that all users should be able to approach and engage with our exhibit regardless of prior scientific knowledge.  As part of this process,  we were careful to label resources in our exhibit such as the flasks or petri dishes that not all users may have interacted with before.
One major goal for BacPack is that it would provide an accessible platform for education and introducing synthetic biology concepts to people of various backgrounds. As it is a museum exhibit, it provides an opportunity for informal education that is more flexible and approachable than a structured academic course, for example. Therefore, more people have access to the project, and there is no requirement for any pre-existing knowledge and education for interacting with and enjoying BacPack.
Looking at public engagement is important because it"

ELECTRACE
In this section, we will first describe one of the areas of synthetic biology with the most promising outlook for applications: microbial biosensors. A number of criteria for a commercially successful microbial biosensor will be determined. We will then show that the ELECTRACE system we have developed meets these criteria. To do this,  we will describe the application of our system in detail.

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
IGEMers should set up a common clear biosafety regulation in iGEM competition and establish a systematic guideline of education about biosafety. This education should include information about biohazard and biotechnology risk assessment and risk analysis.
Backgrounds of iGEMers have become wider and wider, from high school students to graduate student in biology and from major in physics to major in molecular biology.  For some students, iGEM is the first contact to genetic engineering and they have little knowledge of biohazard and importance of biosafety.  Each iGEM teams, of course, teaches the knowledge to their members.However, a systematic education way of biosafety will help students to understand biosafety and to conduct their experiments more adequately.
From these reasons, we recommend that iGEM establish a systematic guideline of education about biosafety.
We work together with KAIT_Japan on issues of safety.
Cooperatively with KAIT_Japan, We iGEM Kyoto placed icons on our Wiki, which immediately enable you to see a risk of parts. The icons are as follows:

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"i War ( Game Overview ) to satisfy our needs.
    Despite of the research values of our system, we found that as it is very simple and even kind of fun, it can be easily understood by the public. Therefore, we use our game to make more kids learn more about synthetic biology in an enjoyable way. To our surprise, when they were playing these games, they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. ( Exhibition at National Museum and Game Discovery ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
II Gene circuit
    In our system, E.coli is divided into two groups, with each group having three characters. Warriors attack the enemies, farmers provide nutrients for everybody, while beggars sit there doing nothing.
    Concretely, the gene circuit of each character is displayed below.
Fig.1 Principles of this circuit can be seen at Design of characters .
III Invertase assay
    In our system, we hope farmers can produce invertase and secrete it outside the cell to help other E.coli survive. To test if invertase can work as we expected, we transformed invertase and its transport system to E.coli and co-cultured it with cells that can express RFP. We found that E.coli that can produce invertase can truly support the survival of other E.coli. (Fig.2)
Fig.2 The number of cells expressing mRFP
More details can be seen at Invertase assay
IV Orthogonality test
     Because of the similarities between AHLs and between their receptors, warriors may be not only killed by the AHL secreted by the warriors from the other side, but also by itself, if the circuits are not well designed. This is a serious problem we faced when choosing the AHL-receptor-promoter pairs. This problem has been discussed by many groups in iGEM, like ETH_Zurich 2014 . However, all previous results are obtained by adding AHL artificially to test the respond of specific receptor-promoter combination. In our project, we let E.coli to secrete AHL itself, so different concentrations of AHL in our system may make the previous studies unsuitable for our system here.
    Therefore, we did Orthogonality test to fit our own needs to help us design gene circuits of warriors. Results are shown below.
Fig.3 Results of Orthogonality test
    However, we failed to choose an orthogonal gene circuit from our results. We can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should"

BGU_ISRAEL,2016,Team:BGU ISRAEL#EthicsAndSafety_-_-_TEXT.html," of our main guide lines is to create a safe and controlled work environment. Therefore, we followed strict                                 safety rules that enable us to ensure minimum mistakes and ideal conditions during our work.
Safety
Safe Lab Work:
All of our project's lab members received safety training by our advisors, and had to partake in a lab safety online                                  course offered by the Ben Gurion University safety department. In this course, we learned about emergency protocols,                                 safety classification of biological labs, and working with new chemicals.                                 In the lab, we wear protective clothing and gloves at all times (unless working with fire). In necessary cases,                                 we also wore protective glasses and face masks, worked in fume hoods / biological hoods etc. All experiments were                                  done considering all appropriate safety protocols, after consulting our PI and advisors.
In our project, we preformed multiple growth experiments using different intermediates in the PET degradation                                  pathway as carbon sources. Some of the chemicals have specific safety instructions according to their MSDS,                                  which were printed out and stored in the lab for all of the members to read and work according to.                                 (For example, at times, it was necessary to work with a chemical like Catechol, or to handle Ethidium                                 bromide waste, in a fume hood).
Working environments:
Regular work area
Chemical fume hood (EtBr and Catechol)
Safe Project Design (Safety Risks to the General Public):
Our final goal as the BGU iGEM team is to create an operating biofuel cell, which will break down polyethylene                                 terephthalate (PET) using E. coli and P. putida. We chose to work with these bacteria, as they                                  are known chassis organisms, are easy to manipulate, and are risk group 1 (P. Putida - DSMZ) – they                                 do not cause diseases in human. Moreover, we use the P. putida KT2440 strain, which is the first                                  Gram-negative soil bacterium to be certified as a safety strain by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee                                  (Federal Register, 1982(3)) and is the preferred host for cloning and gene expression for Gram-negative soil                                  bacteria (Nelson, K. E., et al. 2002(4)).
With the safety of the environment in mind, we designed a metabolic cascade to degrade the toxic intermediates                                 in the PET degradation pathway, to non-toxic compounds that can be used by the bacterium for energy in the TCA cycle.                                 This way, the degradation process does not release"

11th Week (5–11 September)
Constructs A1-A2 and B2-B3 were successfully cloned into pBBR and verified through control digestions. After that, we transformed with these constructs the competent bacteria containing A0-RFP and B1-GFP obtained previously. The bacteria containing B2-B3 were then tested for the production of OC8, giving positive results, while we also started analyzing the production of OC12 from A1-A2-containing bacteria on TLC.
Meanwhile we further verified the activity of our eukaryotic construct, detecting through Western blot the beta-lactamase secreted in the culture medium following p65-TraR-mediated OC8 induction. Finally, we cloned this construct into pSB1C3, but had some problems cloning into this vector several other parts we need to submit.
12th Week (12–18 September)
After having several problems, we finished cloning all our BioBricks and set out to further validate the glucosidase-producing ones in a glucose-free medium supplemented with cellobiose. Meanwhile we kept assaying our bacteria for the production of AHL through TLC.
Finally, much work has been done to complete our site and all the documents for our submissions to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. For this purpose we also created to each BioBrick its own datasheet, so that their properties and characterization could be more easily accessible to the whole iGEM community and any other synthetic biologist.
Last Month (4-28 October)
In these last weeks following the European Jamboree we focussed on the parts we needed to fix in our system. We modified and optimized the parts needed to engineer bacterial strain A, while we also tested the two strains together to have further evidence of the communication between them.
On the eukaryotic end we're still trying to expand a stable cell line cotransfected with the two eukaryotic constructs. In particular, we finally got p65-TraR synthesized without all the ""illegal"" restriction sites hindering us from submitting this key part to the Registry.
Working hard on perfecting the wiki, re-designing the poster, rehearsing the presentation and much more till the very last minute!

Overview: The red light sensor
The red light sensor was first engineered by UT Austin in iGEM 2004 . In this project, we will try to use it as one of the photo-activated sensors for our FORTH framework . The maximum response of the sensor is at a wavelength of 660nm.
The red-light sensor (Cph8) contains three parts:
PCB - Phycocyanobilin, coded for by HO and pcyA, required for light sensing
Cph8, a combination of Cph1 and EnvZ which, together with PCB, form a transmembrane, histidine kinase-based light sensing system
OmpR, a natural E. coli protein which couples with EnvZ and, when phosphorylated, activates genes downstream of the ompC promoter
In the absence of red light, phosphorylated OmpR activates EnvZ, which in turn promotes transcription from the ompC promoter and represses transcription from the ompF promoter, thus leading to the expression of LacZ (in this case under the regulation of the aforementioned promoter). This catalyses the formation of a black precipitate from S-gal(3,4-cyclohexenoesculetin-β-D-galactopyranoside).
When exposed to red light, an isomerization in the Cph1 and a structure change in the phycocyanobilin (PCB) part of the photoreceptor inactivates the histidine kinase acitity of EnvZ ( Figure 1"

LCG-UNAM-Mexico,2008,Team:LCG-UNAM-Mexico#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," important roles in the analysis of biochemical reaction  networks. In particular, we have analyzed the null space and the  left null space of the stoichiometric  matrix of the system ( Suppl. 1 ). The null space of S contains all the  steady-state flux distributions allowable in the network. The  left null space of S contains all the conservation  relationships, or time invariants, that a network contains5.
The  null space of S was calculated for the system ( Suppl. 1 ). It  shows that to reach the steady-state of the system we need to meet the following conditions:
v4=v3.1+v3.2,  which means that the total synthesis of CI should be equal to its  degradation;
v6=v8, the synthesis of RcnA equal to its degradation; and
v7=v9, the rate of nickel uptake equal to its efflux rate.
The  left null space of the systems shows 4 metabolites with constant  concentration, AiiA, ρ, ρCI and Unk, and two mass  conservation cycles (moieties), Niint+Niext and  LuxR + AHL:LuxR + 2((AHL:LuxR):(AHL:LuxR)).
 
Steady states
The steady state of a system is defined as a nonequilibrium state through which matter is flowing and in which all components remain at a constant concentration6. We defined the time taken to reach the steady state as the time when the variation in the concentrations of all components cease to be biologically relevant (here defined as variation in less than one molecule). We can have two initial states in our system:
With no AHL. In this case, the only reaction that takes place is the uptake and efflux of nickel, which instantaneously reaches the steady state.
With AHL. Here, all the regulatory steps in the cascade take place and the steady state is reached when all AHL has been degraded and the signal has faded.
In both cases, the steady state reached is the same. The reason for this is that the system is a regulatory cascade and does not have any feedback loops, so it is expected to have only one steady state. Here we present the simulation in 100,000 seconds, you can click on in to see a larger version:
The concentrations at which it is reached are the following:

Appropriate biocontainment measures form a significant part of the BeeT project's Safety aspect. BeeT is intended to be used outside the lab, in beehives, where it will be in close contact with nature. As we cannot be sure about the effect on existing ecosystems if BeeT would be released in the environment, it must be engineered to die if it leaves the beehive. Our first measure to achieve this is a light-induced kill switch that relies on the balance of a bacterial toxin and an antitoxin that are expressed simultaneously. In the dark beehive, the system is unaffected. In the presence of blue light, a component of sunlight, the balance is disturbed in favour of the bacterial toxin. This will kill the bacterium"

Regulations on use of Mercury in the Amazon
Getting Closer to the Environmental Secretary of Amazonas State (SDS)
With the Environmental Secretary of Amazonas State (SDS) we fought together against Mercury (Hg) contamination proposing an applicable solution to this, using Synthetic Biology. Although the use of mercury in mining is regulated by the Environment State Council (CEMAAM) by resolutions 011 and 014 published in 2012, Mercury is still being used in a very precariously way in the gold activity throughout Amazon.
Our project caught the chairman’s attention (in the pic above at the center with red shirt!) and reopening the debate on the use of Mercury element in the gold mining industry in the State of Amazonas.
For that reason the UFAM-BRAZIL team was invited to discuss the subject at the SDS office and together evaluate the environmental impact caused by indiscriminated use of Mercury in our region. In that occasion we were given the regulation documents for Hg use in gold mining. We invested time analyzing the papers and verified some points of fragility in the law such as:
1)Very broad scope of the law – the legislation has the same weight to individual or small mining groups and large mining corporations.
Our suggestions – Law enforcement should be light to individuals and small groups without licensing, and must be harder over large corporations. There is a need of miners register conditioning to a bearable area, avoiding over mining and consequent environmental   contamination.
2)Limits of Hg per area – Limits are based per person and not on the mining area range. Our suggestions – Limits of Mercury should be based by scientific means and conditioning by the exploration range.
Other aspects pointed out:
3) Lack of inspection and impunity – There is few inspectors in charge, and the size of the Amazon make the task nearly impossible. The small numbers of irregular miners caught are released and not fined, generating a sense of impunity, therefore encouraging them to get back to illegal activities.
Our suggestions – make partnerships with legal private big companies to support inspection by providing boats and small hydroplanes for the task force. Rearing people inside"

It was fascinating and inspiring to once change the point of view and to approach complexity from new positions. For the priest, Josef Fuisz, the struggle of men with complexity might be represented by the following psalm (42.5):
Why, my soul, are you downcast?
Why so disturbed within me?
Put your hope in God,
for I will yet praise him,
my Savior and my God.
Other interesting interviews were done in various fields. For example a philosophy teacher, a physicist, a nano-technologist and a theoretical computer scientist were partners for talks. From these interviews we expect to gain insight into the diversity of complexity. It became even more clear than before that complexity can be found in many different fields.

Week 15 : Integrase parameters retrieved from Bonnet's paper, problems with integrase experiments
Monday 1st September
We finally managed to retrieve integrase parameters from Bonnet et al.'s [9] paper steady state behavior curve. You can check the corresponding article for more details. We can get Hill function parameters this way, but still need dynamic data from our own experiments to retrieve dynamic parameters (i. e. degradation rates).
Integrases don't seem to switch the terminator at the moment, maybe because of a mutation that we found in their sequence.

Integrase parameters
Friday, August 29th
In order to predict accurately the experiments we designed, we defined two different strategies to retrieve parameters for the integrase system.
As we did not find these parameters on the web, we used the data given by Bonnet et al.'s paper ""Amplifying genetic logic gates"" [9] . The figure S4 is particularly interesting, even if it does not give any information on the dynamics of the system. We modeled and wrote the equations corresponding to Bonnet's experiment.
At first, we try to fit the dynamic parameters of the system with only the steady states values.  To fit the parameters with the data, we first try to use a minimum search for the difference between the data and the parametric function. Then, using these first approximations, we tried to do a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to find a more suited curve. As these two methods are strongly prior dependent, we planned another step of screening in order to have meaningful results. However, our knowledge on the parameters, the number of data points compared to the high number of parameters did not give any meaningful results.
We then decided to simplify"

Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"We needed a bacteria which not only had the EnvZ knockout, but also had the genes for the Phosphate acetyl transferase (pta) and Acetate kinase (ackA) enzymes which are involved in the acetyl phosphate pathway (Heyde, Laloi, & Portalier, 2000)
Unfortunately we had some trouble finding a strain with the deletions we needed so we decided to make one ourselves.
How did we do this?
Lior Zelcbuch and Elad Hertz from Ron Milo’s lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science suggested we take the E. coli strain JW3367-3 (ΔEnvZ) from the Keio Collection and use the Lamda Red technique to delete the genes for ackA and pta.
Since the genes for ackA and pta are adjacent to each other on the E. coli chromosome, we decided to delete them in one go.
With Lior Z. and Elad’s guidance and help from Edna Kler from the Technion, we attempted to delete the genes.
We tried several times, once we even went all the way to the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot where Lior Z., Elad and Sagit Yahav helped us.  But to no avail!  We just couldn’t manage to knock out the genes!

For 2-nonanone, similarly, the total time cost is 3.1s.
It demonstrates that our microfluidic device is precisely controlled.
The Calculation of Diffusion Coefficient D
The diffusivity of a gas in an organic solvent, polymer, or zeolite can be calculated by simulating the molecular dynamics process and calculating the mean square displacement of the gas in the material. This allows us to calculate the self-diffusivity coefficient of the gas and gives an insight into the overall diffusivity. As we are performing a molecular dynamics calculation, we can analyze the effect of temperature, pressure, density, and penetrant size and structure on diffusion. We used force-field method to calculate the D in PDMS by Material Studio® (MS) a software for material calculation. [6] [7]
Set up the initial structures
First, we set up the initial structure of the PDMS and the chemicals (Fig.5 and Fig.6).
Fig.6 The structure of PDMS
Fig.7 The structure of diacetyl
Build an amorphous cell
Then, we put the two molecules in to an amorphous cell (Fig.8).
Fig.8 The amorphous cell
Relax the cell
When we generate an amorphous cell, the molecules may not be equally distributed throughout the cell, creating areas of vacuum. To correct this, we must perform a short energy minimization to optimize the cell. After the minimization, we should run a short molecular dynamics simulation to equilibrate the cell.
Fig.9 The cell after relaxing
Run and analyze molecular dynamics
Export data and calculate the diffusivity
Then we can got the D of 2-nonanone and diacetyl:
D(2-nonanone) = 6.78*10-6cm2/s
D(diacetyl) = 6.78*10-6cm2/s

This map is based on publicly available data from official websites, scientific literature, government reports and records, and newspaper and journal articles. Synthetic biology is, however, a growing field, and therefore, the map is still in the progress fully depicting synthetic biology all around the world.
The map identifies 20 entries in Mainland China, 7 in Hong Kong, and 6 in Taiwan in year of 2013. The entries include universities involving in synthetic biology researches, Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) laboratories, and companies. All of the entries lie in the east coast in China, where the economy is relatively more prosperous than those of the central and western regions. Also, regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau are more globalized than mainland China. These regions can provide the public and academia more opportunities to communicate with experts from other countries such as the United States.
Compared with leading countries in synthetic biology such as the United States, China has far fewer entries. The most significant difference can be seen in private companies. This may be caused by insufficient information about synthetic biology for the private investors. Overall, SynBio map reflects China’s position in synthetic biology development. Prospectively, Chinese government will put larger capital on synthetic biology and attract more and more high-tech talents to devote themselves into synthetic biology in China.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Thousands of college students from Mainland China who want hand on experience in synthetic biology participate in the iGEM competition. In recent years, there have been teams from Peking University, Tsinghua University, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Tianjin University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) participating in the iGEM competition. They have made remarkable achievements. For example, in 2007, Peking University team won the world championship. (""Research results of,"" 2010) Trying to meet this standard, more universities are devoted to do better in the competition by increasing the fund and having more students and faculty involved in the iGEM competition.
Biotechnology Industry
From the start of last century, China had made great efforts to apply biotechnology in industries, agriculture and medical science. Because of these efforts, there are currently five main industries under the larger biotechnology industry: agricultural biotechnology industry, biological pharmacy industry, industrial biotechnology, biological resources technology and environmental biotechnology, respectively (Liu, 2006).

Week 1 - May 4 to 8
On week one, we focused on finding literature about the specific chemistry of silver staining. In general, we did not find any literature about the specific, molecular interactions of the silver stain dye with proteins. Many of the articles even stated that the exact mechanism of silver staining remains unknown.
Week 2 - May 11 to 15
This week, we researched on the scientific basis of color. More specifically, we looked into how the interaction between silver, protein and the polyacrylamide gel produces a certain color. We found that the size of silver nano-particles and the refraction of light is how we perceive different colors.
We also tried to look into the electron cloud and how electron excitation produces certain wavelengths of light

Using the same procedure from the first experiment, the team ran a second induction experiment on these colonies to observe whether red fluorescence increased with aTc concentration. The results from that experiment are shown below.
The colonies exhibited no remarkable fluorescence regardless of the aTc concentration. At this point in time, the team hypothesized that the colonies from the first transformation were simply different than the colonies from the second transformation, perhaps as a result of homologous recombination. The team decided to run a third induction experiment, with the same protocol used in the previous two experiments, to determine the validity behind this assertion. Two colonies were picked from the first transformation; one colony was picked from the second transformation. The results from this experiment are shown below.
Values for each colony are consistent with what was obtained in their respective experiments. While the team didn’t sequence the parts in each colony, it suspects that two separate strains had been produced, in which the part had been mutated in some manner. Regardless, the team holds little confidence in the effectiveness of this part.

The diagram below traces the light pathway to its origin and shows its progression into the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. This diagram allowed us to understand how the light pathway redirected metabolites from the growth pathway.
Figure 4. Flow Diagram detailing the upregulation of flux leading to the Lux pathway.
Finally, to confirm our results, we ran a robustnessAnalysis on flux through the light pathway versus that through transketolase, an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. We were expecting to see the flux of light monotonically increase, as predicted by the previous sorting algorithm. However, we observed a peak in the graph of the flux through light and a subsequent decline in light with increasing transketolase activity. This effect can only be explained by the lack of constraints on the flux through the growth pathway. From this, we conclude that past a threshold value, the metabolite produced through this pathway is redirected into the growth reaction.
Figure 5. The relationship between light and transketolase activity shows a peak when the growth is unconstrained.
Future Directions
We can use experimental data to further validate and refine predictive capabilities of our model. A measured growth curve, as well as values for nutrient uptake and secretion can be used as constraints on the flux of their respective reactions. We can also compare the flux value for light units given by the FBA function to that of experimental results.
Dynamic FBA is a technique that solves for the mathematical model at certain snapshots in time instead of at steady-state. It can also factor in concentrations of reactants and kinetic rate constants, which can make the predictive results of the model closer to experimental values8.

Synthetic gene switch shows adaptation to DNA copy number variation
Background:What is Gene Regulatory Network (GRN)? Gene expression is the most basic but complicated process in living system. The interactional connection and regulatory effect among genes make up a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). People have done great research to figure out the mechanism and rules behind gene regulatory network. Typical gene regulatory networks can achieve bistability, state-switch, biooscillation and so on. Also, some specific network structures have been designed and synthesized to realize artificial control.
What is Adaptation? In order to function reliably, any network needs to keep expression efficiency and accuracy when molecular components fluctuate. So the ability to robustly function and keep the same level of expression despite the fluctuation is called adaptation. In our project, the specific fluctuation is the DNA template abundance (copy number) variation. How did the idea occur to us ? Our project initially originated from medical treatment of cancer. Specific therapy to kill cancer cells greatly demands an effective method to recognize cancer cell. Hela cell is a kind of cancer cell that contains a large amount of endogenic mir-21, while the amount of this microRNA in normal cells is rather low. This remarkable difference inspired us to design a network of which the output protein value is related to the input value of mir-21. So a rational GRN is needed to sense input signal and to distinguish cancer cell from normal cell. Previous research has offered some functional GRNs successfully sensing the difference between high input and low input. We hoped to find out similar network topologies that may also achieve corresponding high-low switch. However, there exist many complicated factors that may arouse noise during the expression of gene, which leads to instability and lack of efficiency. We noticed that the number of DNA template (copy number) has a great effect as a noise on the expression intensity. Since the actual amount of copy number involved in gene expression process is hard to measure or control precisely, we have to consider adaptation to DNA copy number variation as a key character of a network. So our goal is to search for a rational GRN that can sense the input signal, realize the switch function and show adaptation to copy number. Besides, GRN consists of"

USTC-Software,2011,Team:USTC-Software#model_-_-_TEXT.html," which means an agent is the basic unit of its composition. In MoDeL, the basic unit, however, has been expanded horizontally to be a sequence and different sequences, also separated by `.' in the representation, constitute molecules by forming bonds between them. The concept of sequence is not limited to DNA or RNA chains, but can be generalized to proteins and non-BioBricks in which cases each sequence may have only one agent. One example is Isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). It has a binding domain \textit{laci} for Lac repressor and thus can be represented as i0001(laci), where i0001 is not a valid identifier in MIT registry since IPTG is not a BioBrick part but a conceptual part in our extension, which can be represented using the same syntax of BioBrick definition. In a short summary, sequences are chains composed of one or more parts, which are not limited to BioBrick parts or even not corresponded to any actual entities.
There is a problem brought by the use of registry identifiers as the name of BioBricks: in principle, protein coding sequences should also have both RNA and protein representations and other type of BioBricks, such as promoters, ribosome binding sites and terminators, should have RNA representations. Each BioBrick, when transcribed or translated possibly, cannot be distinguished from its DNA, RNA and protein representations simply by its name and a qualifier is needed to tag a sequence explicitly to tell whether it is a BioBrick and if it is, which type of representation it belongs to. This can be easily done by adding a type qualifier preceding a colon character `:' to the head of a sequence representation to distinguish the four cases. In the current version of MoDeL, the four permitted types of sequences are DNA(d), RNA(r), Protein(p) and Non-BioBricks(nb), where the character in parenthesis following each type is the type qualifier used to tag sequences. For example, the tet repressor (tetR) can be represented as p:c0040(dna), which is totally different with d:c0040(dna), the protein coding sequence for tetR protein.

Using three constructs ( BBa_I20260 , BBa_K523013 , and our biobrick BBa_K1423005 ) we used fluorescence microscopy to test the efficiency of cell surface localization of fluorescent proteins using two cell surface anchoring motifs :BclA and INP. We hypothesized that BclA would be a more efficient cell surface protein anchoring motif than INP. The E. coli containing each of the constructs were incubated overnight at 37degreesC with shaking. 20µL samples of each culture were dropped onto microscope slides and allowed to air dry.  Slides were then fixed in methanol for 10 minutes, dried, and wet mounted with a coverslip in a 50% glycerol solution. Slides were imaged on a Zeiss AxioVert miscoscope with an 100x oil immersion lens, and imaged with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera. Images were acquired using Zen software, and processed with Adobe Photoshop. All images were exposed for 2 seconds. Brightness and contrast adjustments made during processing were applied equally to all panels within the figure.
We first analyzed an internal expression of GFP using BBa_I20260 . Figure 1 below shows the images captured from the microscopy. The figure shows that the YFP is being expressed throughout the entire cell indicating that it is not localized to  the cell surface. The image on the left is E. coli expressing GFP internally at 100X magnification and the image on the right is this same image contrast normalized and zoomed in on a few E. coli.

Although MFC is high efficiency of power output and environment friendly, most of the power generation MFCs are still in laboratory and not come into massive scale of industry.
One major drawback is the output power density is far less to adapt the standard in industry. electron transfer rate is determined by the potential difference, the reorganization energy and electron donor and receptor distance, main factors to determine the output power density of the microbial fuel cell is related to the electron transfer process, that is to say, the biological system of slow electron transfer rate is the bottleneck of the development of microbial fuel cell.

Riboflavin
Riboflavin, a yellow-orange solid substance with poor solubility in water, was originally recognized as a growth factor in 1879 and named vitamin B, according to the British nomenclature system.
Its IUPAC name is 7,8-Dimethyl-10-[(2S,3S,4R)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxypentyl]benzo[g]pteridine-2,4-dione[8]. Riboflavin has two active coenzyme forms, riboflavin 5'-phosphate (R5P; flavin mononucleotide [FMN]) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)[9], which can both transfer electron.

Photo-Bleaching of iLOV and GFP
To test the effect of photo-bleaching on iLOV and GFP two measurements were carried out. The first to determine how exposure time to exciting photons affects protein fluorescence, the second will measure the ability to recover and recovery time from prolonged exposure.
Samples were grown as previously stated, in a 96 well plate and for this experiment E. coli expressing GFP was included as a direct comparison.
The measuring conditions from the detailed scan where be repeated, only without changing the excitation wavelength. This was only repeated for iLOV and Top 10 wells. The repeat would allow for any photo-bleaching effect to be observed minus the bias from changing wavelength. Three scans, in quick, succession, were completed at an excitation wavelength of 449nm and emission was measured from 460nm to 550nm in 2nm intervals to increase the exposure time to 4.5 ms per scan.
To determine how fluorescence is effected by exposure time the scan was repeated. Only three wells were scanned at a time, rotating there use to give the protein more time to recover between experiments. The number of reads per measured emission wavelength was decreased to 1, 20$\mu$s integration. This cut the exposure time by a factor of 10. Triplets of scans were then taken with increasing number of reads (up to 20) to increase the exposure time yet further.
The energy of the photons was not changed as the highest energy available bleached the sample only marginally more than 449nm photons. This is shown in figure 6, the result of preliminary test to determine whether it was best to change the energy of the photons or the exposure time. This test was completed using the same samples used in the intensity experiment, changing the wavelength of the emitted photons and measuring the florescence drop. Using 449nm photons to excite the protein produces the maximum fluorescence output whilst bleaching the sample.
To measure the recovery rate of the iLOV the protein was exposed to exciting photons for 40 ms. The fluorescence of the protein was then measured with 5 20$\mu$s reads at an excitation wavelength of 449nm and emission wavelength of 494nm. This only exposed the protein for 100 $\mu$s at a time, hopefully not affecting the recovery rate greatly. The fluorescence was measured in triplets with 10 second intervals between measurements.
To expose the difference between the effect of photo-bleaching on iLOV and GFP, the two previous experiments were repeated for the E. coli containing"

Furthermore, there is even one person from NEAU coming with us to the competition this year. So we could wait for the first-hand information about our corporation during the trip later in Hong Kong.
When it comes to the fall semester, representatives of the HIT team went to NEAU to deliver a speech, spreading the idea of iGEM. The lecture lasted for about 2 hours and about 100 students and teachers came to it. It was such a success that many people came to ask for details or later communication afterwards. The university also decided to augment their support of this project.
Communications as a source of inspiration
In summer vacation this year, members of our team went to summer schools and conferences in Peking University and Tongji University in China as well as King Mongkut's Institute of Technology in Thailand. They exchanged their ideas with iGEMers across China and also to people working on synthetic biology around the world. A broader vision would be a precondition for a better work, and we prove it during the project this year.
Postcards as a symbol for friendship
For enjoying our trip to Hong Kong and share our pleasure during iGEM competition, we have designed a series of lovely postcards about iGEM and Escherichia coli for other iGEMers around the world. Access to our E-album for downloading shall be placed later. We also plan to share these lovely gifts during our jamboree this year, and we are waiting for your coming!

Where the initial values and description of variables are shown below (Fig.3).
Fig.3 Name, initial value and description of variables.
(2) 5.0＜pH＜7.0 : With the pH decreasing, both P-atp2 and P-asr are repressed and production of LdhA is stopped. However, remaining LdhA mRNA will continuously translate LdhA till the mRNA is degraded. Environmental pH keeps decreasing.
Where the initial values and description of variables are shown below (Fig.4).
Fig.4 Name, initial value and description of variables.
(3) pH＜5.0 : P-asr promoter is induced and leads production of GadA. GadA will catalyze Glutamate to generate GABA to neutralize hydrogen ion.
Where the initial values and descriptions of variables are shown below (Fig.5).

The final simulation results of model are shown below (Fig.7). In acidic condition, the acid regulation device will produce GABA and decrease the extracellular pH. When environmental pH turns to be higher than 7.0, alkali regulation device will let lactic acid to neutralize the outside pH. Eventually, the environmental pH will be constrained between two promoters’ responsive range (but with a fluctuation).

To increase the possibility of the insertion of the unnatural bases, we used 100 µM dNTPs and 200 µM isoG and 200 µM isoCm for each reaction. After variations of template concentrations from 1 ng µL-1 to 50 ng µL-1, the best concentrations to acquire high-quality bands were 1 ng µL-1 for the M.A.X targets and 25 ng µL-1 for the UBP_target template.
Figure 7: PCR with Titanium Taq polymerase of pSB1C3_RuBisCo with the inserts mutA, mutT, mutG, mutC (5 ng µL-1) and UBP_target (25 ng µL-1). The expected fragment is 351 bp long.
To quantify the efficiency of the incorporation of isoG and isoCm, all PCR products were tested/restricted with the M.A.X system. In order to achieve complete digestion, different incubation times from 1 h to 15 h were tested. The best results with BsaI and MnlI were achieved with an incubation of 15 h overnight. For the less stable enzymes EciI and SapI, a 2 h digestion with an addition of further enzyme after 1 h turned out to be optimal. Nevertheless, EciI and SapI could not digest the complete sample even if the concentrations are lowered. Therefore, we expected undigested bands in the M.A.X targets mutA and mutG for the whole experiment.
After the first successful PCR, we tested if the presence of isoG and isoCm has any influence on the efficiency of the polymerase. So, we added both unnatural bases to every PCR reaction with the M.A.X targets as template to see if the intensity of the bands decreases.

The template is pSB1C3_RuBisCo with the inserts mutA, mutT, mutG, mutC (5 ng µL-1) and UBP_target (25 ng µL-1) after the restriction digest with EciI (mutA) and SapI (mutG) for 2 h and BsaI ("

Testing Parts
Before we were able to test parts we created 2 base testing plasmids (vector 01 and vector 02).  Vector 01 is designed to test Open Reading Frame parts, or parts that code for proteins.   The part is flanked by a promoter and the start codon on one side and a stop codon and terminator on the other.  Vector 02 is designed to test linker parts, or parts that control the expression of the Open Reading Frame parts they are next two.  In Vector 02 the part is flanked by two distinct reporter genes, that by comparing the relative expression of the 2 reporter genes we can determine the behavior of the linking part.

Outreach Events
In order to expand the field of synthetic biology, education is essential. Our outreach events were able to expand to a variety of age groups. Our team is passionate about fostering a love for science and engineering in younger members of our community and engaging with parents about how iGEM research can produce cutting-edge solutions to real-world problems. Every year, we volunteer at local science fairs and STEM events, sharing our work and promoting interest in the biological sciences.
This year, we hosted exhibits at the Shoreline STEM Fest, Bennett Elementary Science Fair, and UW's Engineering Discovery Days. At the UW Engineering Discovery days, local elementary schools visit the University of Washington to learn about more events in the STEM fields. At this event, we created a Strawberry DNA Extraction demo. After mixing a strawberry smoothie with some detergent and isoproply alcohol, students were able to see the DNA rise to the top of our test tubes. During this activity we were able to ask kids what they thought about DNA and gave them the opportunity to visualize it and touch it. We also took the time to answer questions and explain our project. Many parents and teachers were also interested in our research on campus. For those unfamiliar with our project we were able to explain the essence of our field, and go into more detail about our project on campus.
Our exhibits at Shoreline STEM Fest and Bennett Elementary Science Fair allowed students to try their hand at DNA purification from strawberries, identifying fluorescent proteins and chromoproteins in yeast and bacteria, and performing a pH test. At each event, our activity was well-received and allowed us to inform both students and parents about synthetic biology and its applications. We were also able to adapt our curriculum for different audiences, downsizing for smaller fairs and emphasizing different aspects of our experiments for different age groups. At some events, such as the Shoreline STEM Festival, we were able to reach out to high school students"

Development of a Tailings Pond Clean up Kit
Project Description
Managing byproducts of the extraction and refinement processes is a common problem in harvesting natural resources, such as oil. In most cases, tailings ponds are used for storing the toxic water byproducts, which not only have severe negative environmental impacts but also by using current methods can take decades before they can be reclaimed. The current remediation methods need to be improved to provide economical, effective and efficient processes to decrease the negative environmental impact of the tailings ponds. The tailings ponds contain toxic organic compounds, heavy metals and fine clay particles, all which require improved methods of treatment. We will produce a tailings pond clean up kit that uses environmentally safe methods to accelerate the decontamination of toxic organic molecules, heavy metals, and settle the fine clay particles at an increased rate. Toxic compounds will be degraded into metabolizable compounds at increased rates by using proteins that act within a common degradation pathway co-localized within a microcompartment in the form of an easily distributed dry powder. Removal of heavy metals, such as iron, from samples of tailings ponds water will be achieved by inducing the formation of iron nanoparticles, which can be removed together with the generated biomass. The rapid formation of fine clay sediments will be facilitated by the use of bacteria cell aggregates, increasing sedimentation rates from many decades to days or even hours. The kit will consist of either cell-free components or genetically modified organisms (GMO) that pose no threat to the environment as they will have been programmed with a method of rendering the cell inert and destroying its DNA once the desired action is completed. The methods within the tailings pond clean up kit will be applicable for large-scale treatment facilities as well as in situ tailings pond treatment.

We do not have a department's safety in our school. However in the laboratory that welcomed us, there is a committee that is responsible for validating any new project.
During various experiments, a strict physical containment of our microorganisms was achieved and all the rules in the laboratory were followed. (Fume hood for handling dangerous substances, sterile containers, sorting waste, contaminated waste discharged into biological bins...)
Good laboratory practices for the experiments on mice were also followed. (Renewal of litter, respect of the animal, reducing the number of animals used...)

Mission: Co-hosting and participating a meetup with SZU-China and TU Delft iGEM team
Date: July 27, 2018
Location: Conference room, Shenzhen University
Through the Eurasian communication conference, the students gained many valuable Suggestions. We communicated with TU Delft university team, who had organized the iGEM competition for 11 years, and got many comments and opinions about the project. Therefore, in order to better learn from such experienced teams, our tutor invited the iGEM team of TU Delft University and the iGEM team of Shenzhen University to have a deeper communication with the iGEM team of senior middle school in Xili campus of Shenzhen University.
The meetup was held at Shenzhen University's Xili campus. Dr. Mo, the instructor of iGEM team of Shenzhen University and iGEM team of Shenzhen senior middle school, gave the opening speech for this communication meeting. Dr. Mo briefly introduced Shenzhen University, a comprehensive academic university, and put the fresh dragon eyes in front of everyone's seat at the conference table for everyone to taste.
In the following link, each member of our three iGEM teams made a self-introduction in order to facilitate communication. After that, each team once again introduced their own projects and gained a lot of valuable questions.
Afterwards, the friendly competition team from Holland visited the deep laboratory under the guidance of the teacher. In addition, the team of SSHS-Shenzhen iGEM also followed the route and visited the Xili campus of Shenzhen University together. They experienced the beautiful campus environment in the high summer and took photos to commemorate the event.
At last, we had dinner together and talked about each other's countries. Our team members were also very enthusiastic to teach them Chinese.
The tripartite communication meeting was finally a success. Not only did we get the opportunity to communicate with other teams, we also had close contact with one of the judges in the iGEM contest. After that, our team will continue to improve their ability and strive for good results in this competition"

In a first step, the core sensor was amplified from a circular DNA template.
n two PCR-based steps, the recognition and hairpin region was attached to a LacZ reporter element, using primers specifically designed for each individual sensor.
In a third PCR step, the sensors were purified and a t7 promoter region was added.
Nested PCR
Goal:Combining two PCR steps into one PCR cycle (increased time-efficiency)
DescriptionAs mentioned above, the assembly of the RNA sensors via extension PCR usually requires two PCR steps in order to amplify the core sensor and furnish it with a LacZ reporter element. The approach of nested PCR can reduce this to one PCR cycle, reducing time and the amount of non-specific PCR products. The approach of nested PCR consists of two processes:
In a first run of PCR, the DNA is amplified with a first set of primers. As alternative/similar primer binding sites cannot be fully excluded, a fraction of PCR product will be non-specific.
In a second step, the product from the first reaction undergoes a second PCR with a second set of primers. The likelihood of any unspecific product containing binding sites for this second primer set is low, reducing overall contamination.
In a third PCR step, the sensors were purified and a t7 promoter region was added.
Colony PCR
Goal:Determine which transformed colony contains the plasmid with the correctly integrated insert.
DescriptionA colony-PCR is a variant of PCR used to directly amplify specific regions of vector DNA from bacteria without having to extract and clean the DNA beforehand. Thus, instead of adding a clean template DNA strand to the PCR reaction mix, whole bacteria from the colonies in question are used. This requires the following steps
Primers are chosen in a way that ensures a PCR product containing both vector- and insert-sequences. This allows for monitoring for inverted inserts by checking the size of the PCR product.
Colonies are picked with a pipet tip and transferred into purified water, where they get osmotically lysed – this step ensures that the bacterial cell wall is broken and genetic material is accessible
Then, PCR master mix is added to the bacteria lysate
Finally, PCR is performed in a thermocycler
Gel electrophoresis
Goal:Evaluating the result of a PCR
DescriptionIn order to characterize the product of a PCR, gel electrophoresis can be used to determine the length of the resulting DNA fragment. This is achieved by the following steps:

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,".  This has been regardless of the effects of mass urbanization and industrial agriculture throughout much of the developing world.  You cannot seriously argue that business and a degree of self-interest are inherently bad of course, but neither can they be expected to lead an ethical society.  After all, there is no inherent relationship between logic or rationality and ethics.  There is certainly not an inherent link between self-interest and ethics, nor technological advances and ethics.  For example take IBM Hollerith punch-card machines, ‘Throughout the 1930s it helped us streamline our aging nineteenth-century administrative methodologies.  It helped us organize policies for a greater number of citizens and could be seen as a handmaiden of egalitarianism.  It was also used throughout the Nazi regime to streamline the identification, listing and deportation of Jews.  At Auschwitz, prisoners kept for labour had their forearms tattooed with five-digit, IBM Hollerith-machine identification numbers.’ (Saul, 2001).  On the other hand, it is often noted that more egalitarian societies show lower levels or costs of crime, obesity, health care etc, examples include (Nord et al, 1995) (Richardson, 2001), (Islam et al, 2006) and (Kagamimori, 2009).  Indeed it is common that ethical principles will be aligned with those of self-interest, that the cost now will be worth it in the end.  But that must not be confused with being the nature of ethics.  ‘But if you believe that ethics pays, what are you to do if it doesn’t? Marginalize it? Abandon it?  Fall back on charity and pity?’ (Saul, 2001).  On closer analysis, the concept that ethics pays cannot truly be deemed an ethical one.
A great deal of the ethical arguments come from non-governmental organisations (NGO) such as ETC, some of whose work I have utilised.  However, as interesting and perhaps admirable as the recent flourishing of NGOs and the many young people engaged in them might be, they cannot be held free from criticism themselves.  Aside from the obvious criticisms of the crass and the stupid, for example pro-life groups in the US murdering doctors, there is a perhaps a more general criticism to be made in terms of the ethical implications faced in biotechnology and many other areas of controversy.  A sample of articles containing criticism of biotech initatives and of the critics are in the references below under the heading ‘Criticism and Critics’ to illustrate this idea,"

Media Outreach
We have been extensively featured in the media, through great effort on our part in the beginning but later by virtue of public interest and lively debate.
We regard this to be confirmation that our project has gripped the community and sparked interest that has come to stay. That our project has transcended its scientific background and entered the community as an idea, a journey and a goal. Our concrete results are displayed below.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer2_-_-_TEXT.html,"RESULT FOR TOEHOLD-GFP
RESULT FOR TRIGGER RNA
In order to make And gate work, Toehold-GFP and Trigger RNA must be transformed into the same bacteria. Origin incompatibility prevents us to transform two different originated plasmids in the same bacteria. Therefore we decided to clone Toehold-GFP into a ColA originated plasmid and clone Trigger RNA into a ColE originated plasmid. PSB1C3 plasmid has a ColE origin so we cloned Trigger RNA into it. We designed this ColA originated plasmid for cloning Toehold-GFP sequence and named it ‘pColA’.
pColA-Toehold GFP CLONING
After cloning Toehold-GFP into PSB1C3 vector successfully, as we are planning to transform this gene into the same bacteria with Trigger RNA, we cloned it into pColA plasmid.  In order to do cloning into this vector, we removed the gene from PSB1C3-Toehold GFP plasmid by cutting it with NotI enzyme. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with ColA Forward and ColA Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 192 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, Toehold-GFP’s band should be at 1196 bp line.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check as a second control of cloning. We used NotI restriction enzyme for cut-check.
PSB1C3-Trigger RNA/pColA-Toehold-GFP Cotransformation:
To show And Gate system works properly, these two plasmids with different origins should be transformed into the same bacteria. T7 is the promoter which produces Trigger RNA and Toehold-GFP mRNA’s , so we assured that they were cotransformed into a bacteria strain including T7 RNA polymerase. BL21 served this purpose, and after cotransformation, we observed grown colonies.
Functional Assay:
We designed a functional assay setup in order to figure out if Toehold-Trigger RNA system is functional. The main goal of this setup is to show that; Toeh"

Markers of HIV, including HIV antibody and nucleic acid.
Markers of HBV, including HBV antigen and nucleic acid.
Markers of HCV, including HCV antibody and nucleic acid.
Markers of Treponema pallidum, including antibody and nucleic acid
ALT detection
From the interview with the expert, we also know that: ① Not all the people would like to donate blood, and the blood bank is frequently in shortage of blood supply. Today’s blood donation is facing a serious situation. ② HCV infected blood in window period have not been detected using nucleic acid method for HCV antibody detection negative samples for 4 years all over the Shandong province, although the window period is short viewed from nucleic acid level detection. However, the detection efficiency of HIV is 0.3 ‰ in the same condition. It means that there is a high possibility that some HCV infected blood in window period was delivered to the hospitals. It is very dangerous.
Combine with the interview and the questionnaire results, we focused these two things: ① We disseminated the blood donation knowledge since the public’s perception of blood donation is biased. We visited the government officials to know some policy and persuaded them to make a good policy for unpaid blood donation. It is that organizing unpaid donation blood is a required condition for evaluating advanced organization. ② Our project was decided to develop a biosensor for detecting HCV by nucleic acid aptamer, and the specific detection of trace HCV could be realized by rolling circle amplification, which has great significance to shorten the window period of HCV in clinic transfusion.
So, we distributed many leaflets (pictures showed as follow) to publicize the knowledge of blood donation and encourage more citizens (including team members’ parents) to join in the blood donation. We held a small lecture just beside the blood donation bus. The lecture was about the advantages of blood donation, and some preferential policies that made by the government to reward the blood donors. These activities were successful, there were many people came and donated their blood (shows as follows), and they said they would share these knowledges to their families and friends. We solved the blood supply shortage to some extent.

Overview: the way from synthetic biology to real life
Several iGEM teams have tried to tackle the cholera problem, but none succeed so far. So, we decided to try something different: creating a synthetic consortium to detect and eliminate Vibrio cholerae in drinkable water. We modified three different organisms in the course of this project and the results are very promising. We managed to establish synthetic communication between Escherichia coli and Vibrio harveyi. We also successfully engineered the yeast Pichia pastoris to produce efficient antimicrobial peptides from crocodile! Modeling also provided promising informations regarding the global behavior of our consortium.
Fig. 1: the way from synthetic biology to real life: an integrated engineering procedure.
And this was not the end of it. We thoroughly investigated how our innovative solution will be used in the next future. We designed a device taking into account pieces of advice from NGOs, professionals and the general public. Safety, ethics, delivery and lifecycle constraints have been addressed in an exhaustive Scope Statement. iGEM is only the beginning point of this project since the Sunwaterlife Company has already mentioned its interest to develop our system.
The design of our strategy evolved all along the project. This process started during the initial brainstormings and was enriched by our activities in human practice and integrated human practices, such as testimonies and discussions with citizens. Wetlab, experimental and modeling aspects also influenced the project. Our entrepreneurship effort was a determinant contributor to the design and the resulting 3D-printed prototype also impact some aspect of our technology.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Project#Glucosemodel#MeS_-_-_TEXT.html," Another one is that there is a lack of chorismate present in the cell. We have attempted to increase the productivity of the MIT 2006 brick by using stronger ribosome binding sites. Also, we replaced the lac promoter by a TetR-repressible promoter, so the lacI produced in our system doesn't interfere with the transcription of pchBA..
Figure 3 | The original methyl salicylate biobrick BBa_J45700
The Chorismate Problem
Since chorismate is the precursor for three amino acids in E. coli, we believe that there is not much of the chorismate left to be converted to MeS.
To overcome this problem, we looked at a study by Sun et al. (2011), in which a synthetic pathway was introduced for the production of mandelic acid from chorismate. They achieved this by deleting different genes encoding enzymes that catalyse competing pathways, as well as by introducing a feedback-insensitive DAHP synthase mutant to increase the carbon flow down the shikimate pathway. This last method gave us inspiration to overcome our own problem.
If Tyr, Phe or Trp are present in the medium, the conversion of chorismate to these amino acids will be inhibited allosterically, as wel as the production of DAHP (Figure 2). Our plan is to mutate the aroG gene in a manner that the enzymatic function still remains, but that it is insensitive to allosteric inhibition by phenylalanine. We only mutate the aroG gene since this isoform is responsible for 80% of DAHP synthase activity (Hu et al., 2003).
Figure 4 | The different pointmutations of aroG and their effect
Necessary Mutations
It is proven that a Pro150Leu point mutation is Phe-insensitive. This mutation is used as a positive control in a study by Hu et al. (2003) in which they compare the effects of different mutations in the aroG gene on the specific enzymatic activity. The results showed that a Leu175Asp mutation also lead to a Phe-insensitive enzyme. Leu175 is located at the bottom of the possible inhibitor binding pocket, and it is believed to be a critical residue.
For reasons still unknown, L175D mutation showed an increased specific enzymatic activity compared to the wild type. In more recent studies, L175D is mostly used to obtain a Phe-insensitive DAHPS (Lin et al., 2012). That is why we will try to introduce a pl"

(8th - 14th August)
The operon containing the genes pLac-ChlI-ChlD-GUN4-ChlI2-CTH1-pLac-ChlH (Super Operon) was re-transformed into DH5a strains of E.coli and cultured on ampicillin media overnight at 37oC.
This was done in order to increase the amount of available operon needed for further experimentation.
Following this, digestions and ligations of the genes YCF54-ChlM-POR-ChlP-DVR1-ChIG and an ampicillin resistant backbone (Mega Operon) was performed in preparation for transformation into DH5a E.coli cells in the following week.

(15th - 21st August)
The Super Operon containing transformant cells did not grow on the media due to experimental errors, fortunately, quantities of the Super Operon previously prepared were found, and used for the remainder of the experimental series.
Complete ligation mix was double digested and electrophoresed to confirm the presence of the Mega Operon according its expected size 6.2kb.
The results of the electrophoresis showed consistent bands around the 5-6kb region, indicating a successful ligation of the genes compiling the Mega Operon.
Following this, the Mega operon was transformed into DH5a and plated onto LB ampicillin media, and incubated overnight at 37oC.
The Mega Operon transformants showed growth on the ampicillin media, in preparation for plasmid mini prep and digestion in the following week.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," design of Winsulin did not encroach on any existing patents. From this discussion we were made aware that we would need to consider all insulins on the market and all of the production methods associated with them, if we wanted to make a patent of Winsulin and/or its production. This inspired us to pursue a study of the current patents.
Neil Donelan
A member of the board of Insulin For Life, a tax-exempt, not-for-profit organization focused on obtaining excess insulin and insulin related products for distribution to countries where many diabetics cannot afford their treatments. He alerted us to the reality of insulin transport – that insulin can be transported even without refrigeration. This ultiamtely made us feel more confident than any insulin we produce will be stable enough to not require cold-chain transportation.
Mike Nichols
Entrepreneur and mentor at INCUBATE, an award-winning startup program at the University of Sydney, and team member of CSIRO’s Main Sequence Ventures fund. Mike alerted us to the issues of purely open-source ventures – particularly the issues of sustainable income and start-up costs. He also inspired us to develop a potential business model that is not purely open-source, and encouraged us to consider venturing into countries where insulin is highly in demand. This advice and expertise informed our potential business model development to include this option.
Anthony Di Franco
Anthony Di Franco is a board member of Counter Culture Labs , and founder of OpenInsulin project – an open-source research project aimed at developing new methods of producing insulin to increase its affordability and accessibility to those in need. As a Type 1 Diabetic himself, understands the needs of diabetics reliant on insulin for survival. He is one of the individuals that sparked our interest in producing an open-source insulin solution, and so was a main instigator in starting the project.
Jeni - Our Local Pharmacist
Jeni identified the issue with biosimilars as seen by endocrinologists prescribing insulin to diabetics: once prescribed, an insulin user must remain on the same analogue, lest there be issues with allerginicity from other analogues. We applied this information by ensuring our human proinsulin sequence is the exact same as it would be in the body.
Edwina Wang
A friend of ours, and a Type I diabetic, Edwina gave personal experiences about her use of insulin and gave us feedback on the functionality of the insulin we produce, saying that it is crucial to know if it will be long or short acting. We applied this advice by modelling our Winsulin construct to predict its physiological activity, and found that it will most likely be"

  As we want the project to elevate to the level of commercial project, this human practice activity aims to communicate with biotechnology companies to obtain their advice about our subject. Moreover, we visited Chengdu Biology Maker Space and got their device support and contacted the Fab Lab which held by MIT.
Go Well, Learn Well
Purpose:
This year the UESTC iGEM team undertook our project with human practices in mind. While we have established a detailed safety system in our experiments, we wanted to ensure that our system was sufficiently complete and qualified. Besides, sufficient theoretical preparation is helpful for us to talk with enterprises. Therefore, we wanted to ensure that academic and government professionals’ concerns were taken into consideration during the design process of our system. In order to best accomplish this, we conducted interviews with the professor of the Hong Kong University Medicine School. His experience allowed us to better ensure our experiment safety system.
Members of the Hong Kong University Medicine School visited UESTC Life Science and Technology School. We iGEM experiment team took the opportunity to talk about our project with Professor Zhaoyi Hu. Knowing the main processes of our project, Prof.Hu said, ""It seems that the competition not only requires you players have a certain professional basis and innovation capability, but also is a test of students' learning and thinking comprehensive ability."" Then he put forward his concerns especially in biosafety aspects, namely, whether the bacteria source itself is safe or pathogenic, and if gene modified organisms are safe.
In the aspect of biosafety, our project have achieved three aspects as following:
1. The safety of bacteria source: DH5α and BL21 ( DE3 ) we used are common bacterial strains;
2. The safety of transgenosis: The genes we will transfer are nonpathogenic and nonpolluting. There are little adverse impacts on environment and rare probability of transgene escape.
3. The safety of experimental operation: We players have formed a strict operation habit, such as sterilization of transgenosis bacterias, protection of experimenters.
In the end, Prof.Hu told us the general processes of sample treatment in medical research as well as separation and preservation methods of some bacteria"
Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Water Report_-_-_TEXT.html," people, we require more than 200 million litres of clean water per second (Waterwise no date). 67% of this is for agriculture, 22% for domestic, and 11% for industrial use.
Our overstretched resources are very unevenly distributed. Areas with high natural resources are rarely near the urban centres of high demand and this is becoming more severe. For example the top countries for fresh water supplies, Brazil, Russia and Canada, with 30% of the world supply between them, are not areas of highest population growth, India, China and Nigeria take the top spots there (Cohen & Siu 2013).
Water Stress - An Increasing Problem
Water stress occurs when the demand for water exceeds the available amount during a certain period or when poor quality restricts its use (EEA no date). Water stress usually occurs in places with low rainfall and high population density or in areas with intensive agricultural irrigation. It means deterioration of the available freshwater supply both in terms of quantity (from aquifer over-exploitation or drained rivers and lakes) and quality (from eutrophication, saline intrusion, organic matter pollution, heavy metal contamination and other problems).
Causes of water stress and scarcity
Climate Change
Climate change, due to an increasing greenhouse effect, has a direct impact on the hydrological cycle (IPCC 1996). Increased evaporation from water bodies leads to an overall increase in precipitation, but the changing climate also causes this to be distributed more unevenly. This can alter the durations of wet and dry seasons leading to droughts and floods with severe repercussions for water resources (Arnell 2004) . The changing climate makes our need for sustainable water scarcity solutions ever more pressing.
Pollution
Water sources contaminated from agricultural runoff, domestic wastewater, industrial pollutants and from atmospheric pollutants as a result of burning fossil fuels are at risk of eutrophication. Less dynamic water resources, such as lakes, are more susceptible due to longer water residence and through their action as integration sinks for multiple polluted water sources. The high-nutrient load (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus), causes algal blooms which may be toxic and complicate many methods of water purification.
Another increasing issue with water quality is the influx of personal care products and pharmaceuticals. Examples of these pollutants include painkillers, antibiotics and female hormonal birth control (UNEP, ERCE, UNESCO. 2008). Certain compounds may be long lived so accumulate in recycled urban wastewater.

In Vivo Characterization
In vivo Main | TetR-RFP System | TetR-LacI-RFP System | Ptet Characterization | Plac Characterization | Plasmid Details
Since we are using the Ptet promoter in combination with TetR in our reporter systems, it was useful for us to characterize the Ptet promoter only. This characterization was done with the J61002 Ptet-RFP plasmid.
We added increasing concentrations of ATC in order to evaluate whether the DH5alpha cells that we used for the transformations expressed TetR; we also wanted to know the highest RFP expression we can get when Ptet is fully induced.
ATC induction
The DH5alpha cells can still exhibit a basal level of TetR expression, even if the plasmid we transform doesn't contain TetR. By adding ATC, we are able to inhibit this basal expression of TetR, revealing the full power of Ptet as a promoter sequence.
Cells without ATC:
Cells with ATC:
Experimental results:
There is a clear difference between cells untreated or treated with high doses of ATC. Still, this difference is not enormous, showing that our DH5alpha cells don't normally express much TetR. The basal expression of RFP is about 23'000 normalized RFUs, whereas with ATC we go up to 28'000 normalized RFUs.
Dose-response curve
The dose-response curve doesn't seem to saturate at the highest values of ATC added, indicating that some TetR proteins were perhaps still acting on the Ptet promoter. However, it is nice to see that TetR does have a quantifiable action on the promoter; it means that we can use it in our first readout system .

From the pollution map we can see the following:
1 The pollution in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is more serious than that in the United   States and Europe: Although we don’t have comprehensive data for Africa and Latin   America, but we still can find this phenomenon.
2, the distribution of pollution is not uniform or normal, but most of the region   at a good level of the environment at the same time, there are some serious   polluted areas.
3, many countries and regions are still lacking of investigation of copper and cadmium   pollution and supervision, so there may be more areas having serious copper and cadmium   pollution.

Modeling
We developed several models to help design our biosensor to maximize output variation (i.e. the difference between a person with cancer and a healthy person) and to maximize the overall output so the fluorescence can be detected more easily with cheaper equipment, which would drive down net cost of using our sensor in a medical setting.
These include:
NUPACK modeling : Used NUPACK to model the secondary structures of the toehold switches in their closed and open states to maximize dynamic range.
Mass action kinetics modeling : Built a mass action kinetics model to identify the most important parameters to optimize in our design. We ported this model to JavaScript to make it easier for our design team to use and to explain the model to others.
Stochastic modeling : We collaborated with Oxford to validated our mass action kinetics model, by stochastic modeling of the uncertainties of the parameters.
We also built a cost model to provide insight into using our device as a mass-screening tool, which we tied into our human practices work.
NUPACK model
NUPACK is a software tool that can model the secondary structures of RNA systems. [1] We used NUPACK to optimize the design of our toehold switches.
We ran our simulations at 37°C, with 100 picomolar of miRNA, 20 nanomolar of DNA and 500 picomolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.

With this financial assessment and our annual predicted revenue from the product once it has reached the market, it will take approximately 2 years to recoup the cost of investment and break-even prior to the company becoming profitable.  Beyond this timeline, our group aims to establish international connections in other areas of the world where this technology would be useful.
Several assumptions for this analysis were made:
This assumes we only capture the monitoring market that is established in the government regulation framework.
No sales costs because we don't have people who would get commission.
Shipping costs are billed to the customer.
Shipping costs were determined based on US Postal Service rates for pallet shipments Internationally with DNDC destination and five cartons.  Assumed that one shipment a month occurs at $150 per shipment.
Final Packaging Costs were estimated  based on packaging per cartridge cost was estimated based on bacterial addition definition in manufacturing section of being an additional $1.10
In 2013, the majority of expenses will be legal fees, in terms of patent application fees,incorporation fees and the drafting of legal documents, such as release forms and non-disclosure agreements.
In 2014, legal fees increase significantly due to regulatory costs and increasing consultation with legal experts./p>
Travel costs are minimal, however will increase in 2017 for promotional related events. These will increase as sales increase in order to visit potential customers.
Company Evaluation
In order to estimate our potential company evaluation today and in the future, we have performed a Asset Valuation for our company.  These were based on the following criteria:
Team Evaluation - Based on the technical abilities our team has acquired we valued these skills as a valuation towards the company.  As we continue to attract talent this is assessed.
Sweat Equity - As many of our team members will be unable to be reimbursed for their time in the company we have made an evaluation for this contribution.  This was based on the commitment level that the team member is making and their role overall in the progress of the company.
Patents - Patents provide a clear advantage to the company.  We have assessed a value of a provisional patent to be $50,000 towards the company's value and a full utility patent at a $1,000,000 contribution to the valuation.  We plan to have a series of patents to protect our technology by 2018.
Manufacturing - Establishing appropriate manufacturing contacts, facilities, prototyping development, and distribution are critical in the success of the company.  These were taken into consideration in this analysis.

St_Andrews,2010,Team:St Andrews#project#ethics#DissoiLogoi_-_-_TEXT.html," energy-production [3] which will inevitably become available after further research and many further years of strict testing have been done on the safety and feasibility of such applications. It is certainly a case of when, not if, these technologies will arise. The question raised is however, could the benefits of such technologies be realised in a more immediate, more economical and more sustainable way. And the answer is irrefutably yes. This issue is one of both moral and logical foundation. A new technology takes time to research, it takes money to develop, it takes further time and money to test, and it eventually comes to the market under the ownership of a highly powerful commercial company whose ultimate aim is to make a profit. Consider some of the major technological innovations from the current era: the Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner (MRI); the pacemaker; the heart rate monitor. All clearly revolutionary inventions which have saved lives in the developed world, and inventions into which millions of pounds is spent – the UK spending on research & development in the 2010 fiscal year was £0.9 billion [4] – but which the majority of those in poverty in the Third World will never reap the benefits. Given time there will no doubt be an artificially synthesised bacterium which can be grown in a bottle in a lab in America, sold to an aid organisation for a healthy profit, and flown half-way across the world to Africa to be administered to a patient suffering the effects of cholera. But surely the same end result could be achieved by installing a well in the patient’s village to provide clean water. The typical cost of this is $21 per capita [5]. The idea is to cut out the source of the disease entirely, and in doing so prevent upwards of a hundred thousand deaths globally on a yearly basis [6]. Developed countries researching technologies which are then only used for the benefit of their own healthcare will globally improve nothing. The key point to be made is prioritisation. Should billions of pounds be spent on research in fields such as Synthetic Biology while similar benefits could be achieved with more immediacy and greater economy? And who could say that one of the lives saved could not then play a part in the next breakthrough in modern science?
Open to debate
There is a frequent comparison made between the ethos of Synthetic Biology and the Open Source Software community. The premise is that Synthetic Biology is a science that can be performed by anyone who posses sufficient interest and either money (or failing that, ingenuity) to do so. Such a mentality became true in the second half of the 20th century when the personal computer began to become a commercially"
