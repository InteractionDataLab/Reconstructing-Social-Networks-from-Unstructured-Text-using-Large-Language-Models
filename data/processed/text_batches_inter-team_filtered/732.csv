WHAT IS
Quantifly ?
(VOC)
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Nowadays, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are commonly found pollutants that have been proved                         present in a wide variety of everyday life situations. Though they are dangerous and present                         almost everywhere, VOCs are not efficiently detected. Usual detection devices are very unprecise                         or requires a very long exposure time.
Bacteria
Biosensor
This is why we developed the Quantifly project : a combination of a bacterial biosensor,                             perfectly adapted to on-field measurements, and an innovative drone that will allow us to                             easily and rapidly quantify the amount of VOCs in the air. The biosensor relies on                             bioluminescence, a biochemical phenomenon that is commonly used in cell imaging. We are trying to develop a new application for bioluminescence that should allow us to create a                             biosensor of a new kind, entirely different from the existing devices.
If you’ve followed along and done the steps above, you’ve created a good                             starting place. You’re going to need to make sure your pages are optimized properly.
Bacteria
Drone
Concerning the drone, it is designed to safely contain our organisms and carry them on the                             field, thus acting as a mobile detection platform.

Timetable of this year’s winter training is shown in figure 1. Students in winter training mainly are reserved team member selected before. The training is not obligated to reserved team members. Though our materials are not available to all students in our college, people who are not in our reserved team but want to participate the training is welcomed. Training material is totally available to them, too. Students will be grouped before the training, including people who are not in our reserved team. Brainstorms were held every night based on groups. On the last day, we will hold project defense to show our primary ideas about project. During this year’s final defense, we held a live on www.bilibili.com and invited team members from Shandong to watch it.
Figure 1. Timetable
From Marth to June, we held group meeting almost every week to study the outstanding projects in 2017 iGEM. Students were required to do presentations in the group meetings to help themselves understand the design and experiments, and A comprehensive test was used to determine the team member and reversed team member in this year. Experiments were started in July and continued to the last day before wiki freeze, with human practice and collaboration keeping in line with it.
Thanks to the attempts at standardizing team structure did by former SCU-China iGEMers and the help of our instructors and college, we generally form an inheriting structure, though it may cause that we have many team members every year. After a whole year’s competition, several junior students become group leaders who take control of the team organization, experiments and so on. Most sophomores in the team are developed form the reversed team member in the last year and they become the main part of our team if they determine to remain and pass the test mentioned above. Freshmen were encouraged to participated in winter training and were required to attend the group meetings. Experiments were mainly completed by juniors and sophomores while human practice was mainly accomplished by freshmen under the leadership of senior grades students.
Nowadays, SCU-China is not just an iGEM team but also a platform for students in Sichuan University to practice the experimental skills, to learn and understand the synthetic biology, to work together and to complete the project designed by ourselves. With the encourage of college, our education parts of human practice become easier to accomplish (see human practice). By integrating the competition into undergraduate education of college, we receive the great support from our Life Science College every year and we sincerely hope such"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Picelli et al, 2018 ). This variant is an excellent choice for the component responsible for integrating the adapter sequences. This protein forms a dimer and is able to pick up specific DNA (transposon) flanked by mosaic ends (ME) sequence (CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT) and integrate it randomly into DNA. It can integrate a single DNA, extending the target DNA by the length of the transposon utilized for in vivo functionality, or it can integrate two individual DNA molecules, inducing a double stranded break to the target DNA.
Linker
The Tn5 transposase ( BBa_K2643002 ) and the dxCas9 ( BBa_K2643001 ) were fused using a Glycine Helical peptide (GHP) Linker. The flexible linker is composed of 18 amino acids (K L G G G A P A V G G G P K A A D K) ( Cadinanos & Bradley, 2007 ). The GHP linker was selected as a high potential candidate due to its successful use in linking transposase with other proteins, for example to fuse piggyback transposase with ERT2, a ligand-binding domain ( Cadinanos & Bradley, 2007 ), or to fuse sleeping beauty transpose with zinc finger DNA-binding domain ( Voigt et al, 2012 ).
pACYCDuet-1 vector
The pACYCDuet-1 (Novagen) is designed for coexpression of two genes. The plasmid contains two multiple cloning sites (MCS), each of which is preceded by a T7 promoter/lac operator and ribosome binding site (RBS). The P15A replicon is present to sustain plasmid replication and the chloramphenicol resistance gene allows for applying selective pressure to cells for maintaining the plasmid. Additionally, after the T7 promoter a HIS tag is implemented for purification purposes.
3.2 Fusion Protein Plasmid Construction
Aim: Design and construct the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ) into pACYCDuet-1 seen in figure 7.
Figure 7. Schematic overview of our fusion construct. The coding sequence was delivered in three parts: dxCas9 (blue), Tn5 (green) and Linker (red). The pACYCDuet-1 vector is also annotated.

This next part will describe the kinetics of such complexation. The kinetics will be modelled by simple mass action rates. We only need the parameters of LuxR and cI, because the Hill function found for PenI was already adapted for the protein in monomer form.

Protein production kinetics
Our models comprises two product forming enzymes: LuxI and Transaminase B. LuxI is the enzyme responsible for AHL production and Transaminase B is responsible for leucine formation. Therefore, we need to describe the following reactions:
$$ \text{acylACP} + \text{SAM} \rightarrow \text{ACP} + \text{MTA} + \text{AHL} $$ $$ \text{glutamate} + \text{aKIC} \rightarrow \text{aKG} + \text{Leucine} $$
For LuxI kinetics Schaefer et al. (1996) found a value of 1 molecule/minute as Vmax. Since we assume that LuxI is fully saturated with substrate, we take this value as the synthesis rate of AHL. [12]
Transaminase B synthesizes leucine from aKIC and glutamate. In this reaction glutamate is converted to aKG."

High School Lectures
  In order to promote the concept of synthetic biology, iGEM teams from SUSTC went to several high schools to popularize synthetic biology and iGEM competition. Here is their performance in Shenzhen Foreign Language School.
  
  Yicong Tao and Zishan Wu did most of the presentation. Here's what Yicong felt after his speech:
   ""I went to Shenzhen Foreign languages school with iGEM - Shenzhen B's team members to introduce synthetic biology to high school students. We gave a presentation that was carefully prepared in order to make it as easier to be understood as possible. Though the students there didn't know much about biology, even genetic engineering, they were very interested in our presentation and asked a lot of questions about synthetic biology and our participation in iGEM. In short, our trip was a huge success.""

    Human practice is one of iGEM’s most important features that makes the competition very different from the other. This year, Team Tsinghua-A organized a series of activities based on their own understanding of what human practice is. All the activities share some common characteristics.
    Interaction oriented——Team members engage all stakeholders by idea exchange.
    The thought of “all”——We want to create science culture for the whole society to help community members to stay creative and productive. Therefore, our activities include people from all generations.
    Balance between “rigorous” and “interesting”—— the nature of science is rigorous, while we can make it as interesting as possible to make science accessible for ordinary people. How to balance between those two aspects can be a meaningful question to explore.
    Tsinghua-A has been thinking about what their projects can bring to the world before they picked up the first pipette in lab. As one of our initial goal stands, we would like to make science a resource beyond universities and institutes and create science culture for our community. To reach this goal, we put forward our interesting project to the public and are curious to see what effect can be sparked out of the interaction. What can science bring to the public and what science gets in return is an interesting topic that we would like to explore.

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," under different concentrations of arabinose and used the results to derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit.
In order to know the exact concentration of inhibitor under the different concentrations of arabinose. In E.coli Top10, we used the RFP to replace the inhibitor gene (Fig. 5), so we can use RFP to reflect the inhibitor when we added the same concentration of arabinose.
Fig.5 The circuit constructed to measure the inhibitor concentration, inhibitor is replaced by RFP.
At first, we also use the modeling to simulate this circuit get the curve about relationship between the arabinose added and protein intensity. We got the curve below (Fig. 6):
Fig. 6 The concentration of inhibitor expressed by PBAD changes with different concentrations of inducer.
From this curve, we can clearly see the concentration of arabinose have positive relationship with protein intensity in a proper range. Before we have achieve the threshold of the inhibitor concentration under the 0.003％concentration of arabinose. The point of inducer’s concentration (0.003%) can cast on protein intensity coordinate axis, and the corresponding intensity is about 24.42 units.
In the wet lab, after the pre-experiment, the arabinose concentrations we chose are listed in table.2. The negative control is the strain containing the empty pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the device in Fig.6 on pSB1C3 without adding the arabinose.
Table. 2 the arabinose concentration used in pre-experiment
Firstly, the two strains containing empty pSB1C3 and the device in Fig.6 separately overnight (12 h) growth in the LB medium. Then the overnight culture was diluted 1:100 into new LB medium while add the certain concentration of the arabinose.
At first, the overnight culture’s OD600 and red fluorescence intensity were measured. And then we measured the OD600 and red fluorescence intensity every 1-2 hours.
We draw the diagram about RFP intensity/OD600 and time under different concentrations of arabinose (Fig. 7).
Fig. 7 The relationship between the fluorescence/OD600 and time
From this diagram we can see that the concentration of inducer will affect the expression of downstream RFP, more inducer added, more RFP will be expressed.
Then we collect the data after passing 11.3 hours from Fig. 8 to draw the diagram about the relationship between RFP intensity/OD600 and arabinose concentration ("

There were three cultures for each brick however we discovered that the labels had rubbed off from the tubes, so we decided to do restriction digests and run all 6 samples on a gel separately to determine their identities. As the BioBrick inserts both have similar lengths, we decided to run them on a 1.2 agarose gel to get the best resolution.
For the miniprep:
We followed the miniprep protocol for Prof. Aldridge's lab.
We spun all 6 samples in 12 eppendorfs to make sure we had at least 3ml. Using 12 eppendorfs also meant that there was only one spin step. (e.g. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B...)
After adding solution one to both tubes we resuspended and added the tubes together again resulting in 6 samples. (Added all Bs to As)
We used the Solution I + RNAse that had been ready made and put in the fridge.

The Wechat survey showed that 30.83% are accepting of synthetic biology whilst a shocking 30.83% do not agree and 15% think you are playing with god.
4. Genetically modified organisms and human ageing
When asked if the respondents wanted to live longer, fewer people answered yes then compared to when they were asked if they want to live healthier longer. This can be seen on the pie charts below, where more people would rather live healthier for longer than just live longer. This shows that our project is relevant to the needs of the general public. 67.5% of the respondents would be more accepting of synthetic biology if it made them live longer. The Wechat survey showed that 84.17% of the Chinese population are want to live a longer lifespan but a larger population (95.83%) want to live a longer healthier life. Also, 70% of people are more acceptable of synthetic biology  if it made them live longer.
5. Synthetic biology and education
75.3% of the general public think that they have not been educated about synthetic biology whilst 81.67% of the Chinese population on Wechat also agree. And a large proportion of the population would like children to learn synthetic biology as a part of their curriculum. 83.1% of respondents also agreed that primary or secondary school should be educated about synthetic biology as a part of the curriculum.
Based on the results, it is apparent that respondents felt like there hasn’t been sufficient education related to Synthetic Biology. Considering a vast majority of respondents consider GM organisms safe (81%) and beneficial (81%), we have decided to take on outreach program's for school-age children to expand their knowledge and consciousness of Synthetic Biology. The results of the survey has inspired us to think about what we can do for each age group of children/students (from primary, secondary and sixth form students) to get synthetic biology widely known.
A project that is shaped by the general public
We initially wanted to find out if the general public would actually want a solution to the ageing issue of the population. So to do this we conducted an international survey (above) to reach out to many people as we could in order to get a good snapshot/ representation of the world populations needs. An image summarising the findings can be seen below

Methods
We used a Tecan Infinite M200pro plate reader to measure OD600 and fluorescence values. Excitation wavelength is 485 nm, Emission wavelength is 530 nm, and the Firmware is V 3.37. OD600 measurements were taken in Corning 96 well assay plates (black with clear flat bottom). The experiments were performed at the College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, under supervision of our instructor. We followed the standard protocols including LUDOX Protocol, Microsphere Protocol, Fluorescein Protocol, Cell Measurement Protocol and Colony Forming Units Study, etc (Detailed protocol information can be found here ). During the whole InterLab study process, everyone, instructed by the team PI, studied the protocol carefully and worked on providing accurate and reliable experiment data to the Measurement Committee.
Results
We submitted the completed spreadsheet and four online forms to the iGEM measurement committee before the deadline (July 27), and received confirmation that the results were accepted on the August 16.
Calibration
1. OD600 Reference Point
2. Particle Standard Curve
3. Fluorescein standard curve
Cell Measurement
1. Transformation of the devices
In the first day, we transformed the required plasmids (all in pSB1C3) in Escherichia coli strain DH5α.
2. After transformation, cell growth, sampling and assay, we collected the raw plate reader measurements including Fluorescence raw readings and Abs600 raw readings. Then the experimental values were gained as follows:
Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
Following to the protocol provided by iGEM measurement, we accomplished this part and the result is as follows.
Collaboration
Our interlab study was done in collaboration with two other teams ( HFLS_ZhejiangUnited , Worldshaper-XSHS ). Before beginning the experiment, we carefully studied and discussed the official protocol provided by iGEM measurement together. Worldshaper-XSHS lends us their 96-well plates when ours are not adequately prepared. Moreover, when our first submission was failed, we together with worldshaper-XSHS and HFLS_ZhejiangUnited to analyze the data and find what is the problem is. Thank you for their help given to us. On the other hand, we offered the plate reader for them to do the InterLab study.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html,"Cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems are capable of performing transcription and translation of exogenous DNA in vitro. CFPS systems have been in use for many decades (Nirenberg & Matthaei, 1961), however the field of synthetic biology has resulted in a CFPS renaissance (Lu, 2017; Lee & Kim, 2013). Commonly, CFPS systems are based on cell extracts, which provide the transcription/translation machinery, as well as enzymes required to generate ATP required for protein synthesis. While CFPS systems have a lot of potential, they also suffer from some drawbacks. Two of the major issues are the large variation in CFPS activity between cell extracts (Katsura, et al., 2017), and the high costs compared to whole cells (although cost have been reduced significantly in the past decade) (Carlson, et al., 2012). These issues can hinder the uptake of CFPS systems as an alternative chassis to whole cells, and as research tools.
Show/hide more information about the CFPS premix
Cells extracts being used in CFPS systems tend to be supplemented with a cocktail of compounds and molecules to aid the process of transcription and translation (Figure 1). Although exact supplement solutions can vary from protocol to protocol, most have the same basic composition; salts, nucleotides, tRNAs, co-factors, energy sources, and amino acids (Yang, et al., 2012). The supplement solution used in this study is based on the Cytomin system (Jewett, et al., 2008). For the cytomin supplement solution, the major energy source is sodium pyruvate, which is converted to acetate through a series of reactions catalysed by enzymes in the crude cell extract. The first reaction, pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, requires nicotinamide diphosphate (NAD) and Co-enzyme A (CoA) as co-factors. Both of these are components of the premix and hence added to the system to enhance flux through the reaction. The acetyl CoA is phosphorylated by inorganic phosphate, and then de-phosphorylated to produce ATP from ADP. The ATP is used as energy to drive translation of mRNA.

Energy can also be derived from glutamate in the supplement solution (Jewett, et al., 2008), which is added in the form of magnesium glutamate and potassium glutamate. Glutamate is a metabolite in"

June 28th, 2018: Advice for Entrepreneurship
We met Guillaume Boissonat, co-founder of the society Pili. An entrepreneurial brainstorming started, thanks to relevant advice about the creation of a company and the approach to be carried out.
A fundamental question then arose: do we sell a service, a technology or a product?
LOGBOOK: JULY
July 5th, 2018: Cellulose time!
We were excited to register for the Munich meetup. This was a great opportunity to create a first poster about our project! We managed to produce dry freshly produced cellulose with G. hansenii and we optimized the production conditions so that we could now send it to other teams that needs some!
July 7-8th, 2018: From Paris with love
During this weekend, we participated to the Paris meetup! We used the meetup to develop our oral skills and the presentation of our project. On the program: meetings with the other French teams, sharing our first experiences and many laughs!
July 12th, 2018: Entrepreneurship in progress
For the Entrepreneurship side, our business plan began to take shape. We thought that the product design had to meet the wanted need. We also wanted to see if customers were interested, for that we thought about pricing aspects. We were still in needs of advice so we contacted companies such as CRITT and GTP biotech.
July 21-22th, 2018: Meeting european iGEM teams
Second meetup for our team! This time, Callum and Gaëlle went to Munich to present our project to many European teams. Through our poster, we exchanged with the other teams on our respective experimental adventures ... We also talked with them about the ethical aspects of our iGEM projects such as the ecological impact.
On the entrepreneurial side, we met Françoise Ouarné, director of CRITT-Bio-Industries in Toulouse. Her wise advice allowed us to define our offer: our linker protein that we simply named Cerberus. We also discussed the problems of co-cultivation. She graciously supplied us with plant cellulose from CIMV.

In this simulation, it can be seen that the knockout eﬃciency of Cre is around 95% after around 5000 seconds (around         83 minutes). Without the reverse reaction, this would eventually approach 100% over time. However, it should be noted         that our model deliberately ignores the reverse reaction with may occur in reality even with lox66 and lox71.

In this simulation, due to the high values of reaction constants, we needed to use a very small time step in the simulation         which led to a long simulation time. In order to make it feasible to simulate further models, we will attempt to         ﬁt the progress of the module with a simple system of diﬀerential equations.
Particularly, because the rate of the forward reaction is only dependent on the amount of unrecombined plasmid in the         system, and the reverse reaction is only dependent on the amount of recombined plasmid, we will simplify the system         to have only S and P where S is now the proportion of unrecombined plasmid and P is the recombined fraction. We thus         attempted to ﬁt it into a diﬀerential equation of the form
which would correspond to having the reaction system
We ﬁtted the values of r+ and r− using MATLAB, which resulted in the following graph for S and P.
Fig. 3 Comparison of fitted and simulated kinetics
As can be seen, the ﬁtted values of r+ and r− result in a curve that follows the results from the simulation of the         actual kinetic system quite closely.

Fatty Acid Sensing Mechanism
Overview
In 2009, Prof. James Liao's research group at UCLA published their findings that mice expressing synthetic glyoxylate shunt had increased resistance to diet-induced obesity. To engineer this behavior in mice, they introduced glyoxylate shunt genes to mouse liver cells, employing a constitutive promoter for expression of the said genes.   Though not demonstrated in mice, we worry that this glyoxylate shunt, when constantly turned on in human cells, could incur a fitness cost by continuing to burn off energy when the environment is not so energy rich. Thus, we are working to put this glyoxylate shunt under regulation by an inducible system, which would allow tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. Such a system should reduce the risk of energy or fatty acid deficiency when the surrounding fatty acid concentration is not too high.  To construct this inducible system, we searched for candidates that could regulate gene expression on the level of transcription while responding to fatty acid levels. Four different fatty acid induced promoters were then investigated, namely:
1. Liver Fatty Acid Binding Protein 1 (FABP1) Promoter;
2. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) Promoter;
3. Glucose Regulated Protein (GRP78) Promoter; and
4. Fatty Acid Metabolism Regulator Protein (FadR) and FadBA Promoter.

We attempted to amplify Cro through PCR and cut it out of a gel. Cro will be used to induce the lytic cycle of lambda. We believe that when there is an abundance of Cro, there will be an increased lysis of lambda.
Daily log
May 15 - May 26
Moving right along, we cloned the CRO gene from bacteriophage lambda into pIG12, a vector with the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter. We transformed the ligated plasmid into our target strains, TT9901, TT9907 (which have bacteriophage lambda integrated into their genomes as a prophage) and TT25281 (our control without the lysogen) by electroporation.
Daily log
May 27 - June 9
We did not see any plaques when we plated our transformed strains on arabinose!  We wondered: is CRO not actually ligated into our vector? CRO, when overexpressed, downregulates itself; is there too high a concentration of CRO? Or is it possible that CRO alone isn't a sufficient factor to induce lysis? We learned by sequencing that CRO was not in our vector, and furthermore, that our primers to amplify CRO for another organism, not CRO from bacteriophage lambda!  The correct primers we designed, and arrived.
Daily log
June 10 - June 23
With the correct primers, DMSO, and fresh template, we performed a successful PCR reaction of CRO.  We continued the cloning process by digesting pIG12 and CRO, ligating them together,"

UI-Indonesia,2014,Team:UI-Indonesia#Human Practice#Expert Talking#aroem#_-_-_TEXT.html,", preclinical (animal), and even clinical (human) for the last object.
Is it ethical if you’re inserting bacteria to human body?
Well, ethics depends, but most importantly every project needs preclinical and clinical research so we could know the side effect of the Synthetic Biology application. In Indonesia, some bacteria like Lactobacillus acidophilus have been commercially used to cure diarrhea. These products have been sold for several years until now and the acceptance is actually good.
In Synthetic Biology, people change the resistance of bacteria. People force a plasmid to be inserted in bacteria. In short, changing a natural existence of a life, is it allowed?
In Synthetic Biology and Recombinant DNA, it is allowed because it has been regulated in:
1. NIH Guidelines For Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines)
2. UU 21/2005 about Genetically-modified Product Safety
3. For pharmacy product:
• Ministry of Health Regulation 1010/2008 about Drug Registration
• National Agency of Drug and Food Control Republic of Indonesia HK 03.123.10.11.08481/2011
How if the bacteria in our project is really applied in life? Could it cause changes in the environment?
It depends; you should do a preclinical and clinical research. Then, you should seek more about what you’ll use in your project:
• Do you use only some types of proteins or genes? If yes, many of this type of project have been commercialized, so you should only conduct the preclinical and clinical research.
• Do you use the whole bacteria, inserted with genes? If yes, you need to find out more about the virulence factor of the gene and bacteria itself. If it’s considerably safe, you could follow the preclinical and clinical research. Or maybe before preclinical research, you could test it by in-vitro in cells.
How about Synbio in Indonesia?
In Indonesia, there have been researches conducted in Synthetic Biology. GMO have been used in the diagnostic in medical devices. There’s only one company in Indonesia that has been producing vaccines and biosimilar product. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to a U.S.-licensed reference biological product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product (U.S. Food & Drug Administration, FDA). Biosimilar product that currently been commercialized is Erythropoietin Stimulating Drug."

Fitting of the figure S4 from Bonnet's paper with the model 1. The assumption is the fact that the degradation of the dimer of Bxb1 is neglected with respect to the dimerization reaction rate.
By considering reasonable order of magnitude for other parameters present in the lumped parameters, we find that the value of the dissociation constants are both of the order of 10-4. This order of magnitude is not surprising at all, as we know that the binding of integrases to DNA is very specific (which is underlined by the low value of the dissociation constant of this reaction) and that integrases are more stable as dimer than as monomer.

Diffusion Experiments
Monday, 25th August
Now that we tested the different constructs for leakiness, dose response and cross talk, we are investigating in the diffusion rate of AHL. Therefore we designed a chip with chambers connected by channels of different length (see figure). In one chamber we added a strain containing a regulator and a sensor plasmid, to the second chamber we added AHL or an AHL producer strain. As soon as AHL is diffused to the former chamber it induces sfGFP production on the sensor plasmid. The time it takes until we can measure the sfGFP signal and the length of the channel gives us information about the velocity of AHL diffusion.
PDMS millifluidic chip used for diffusion experiments
Three main experiment designs were tested and modified: the agar-design, the liquid-design and the beads-design.
For the agar-design we filled the chamber and channels with LB-agar or in a second attempt with agarose only. Subsequently, we punched a cylindric hole in each chamber. The capacities were filled with regulator/sensor strain culture or AHL/AHL producer strain culture, respectively. After 3 to 4 h at 37 °C we could observe an increase in the sfGFP signal. Since we used comparably high concentration of AHL in our first attempts, we could not detect a delayed sfGFP signal for chambers connected by a longer channel. The experiment will be repeated using lower concentrations. However, conducting the experiment using the agar-design, we encountered a problem: after some hours the LB-agar/agar"

These untranslated regions can change translational efficiency of the downstream protein,          leading to inconsistent expression between different combinations of promoters and coding sequences. Figure modified          from figure S1 of Lou et al. 2012.
Characterization was done on 07/26/16 using flow cytometry, which means that our data shows single cell resolution of the          impact of various RBSs. Characterization was done in BL21 E. coli, which is a standard protein expression strain. A high          copy plasmid (1C3) containing one of the pLacO1 RiboJ RBS variants (ex. Bba_K206636) was co-transformed with a low copy          plasmid (3K3) which contained a constitutively expressed LacI (Bba_K206616) to repress the promoter. Individual colonies          were picked from antibiotic selection plates, and colony PCRed to ensure the correct plasmids were contained. For each RBS          variant 3 colonies containing both plasmids were inoculated in M9 and incubated till midlog growth was reached. At that          point the cells were induced with various concentrations of IPTG until steady state was reached. Cells were then FACSed          and their fluorescence was reported in MEFL calculated using Spherotech calibration beads. (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Average (3 biological replicates) population level fluorescence of RBS library over different induction conditions.          Note the wide range of RBS strengths in the library, and that the strongest RBS B0035, is not actually the strongest until          induced at a concentration of 1000µM IPTG. This illustrates the importance of evaluating over a transfer function, not just          at an arbitrary steady state.
All of the individual RBS plots are available on our measurement page, but here are a few examples of individual RBS measurements.

Finally, We analysed XOR1 switched plasmids by sequencing. The sequences correspond to the expected switches.
XOR2
In the absence of recombinase or in recombination assays with Bxb1, the resulting colonies are white. Therefore, non-specific recombinases cannot switch the XOR2 gate. When XOR2 was put in the presence of FimE, 5% of the colonies were red. And the switch of the red colonies were not validate by restriction and by sequencing.  Several explanations can be made: i) low expression of FimE, ii) low activity of FimE in the tested buffer; iii) none efficient FimE sites. The red colonies observed can be due to contamination by an RFP plasmid. At the end of the summer, the Michigan team which are working on FimE too, published result about FimE sites. They validate our assumption that the FimE sites, that we used, are not efficient. They advise to use the BBa_K1077001 and BBa_K1077000 sites.
AND1
In the absence of recombinase, the colonies are white. As a result, AND1 gate does not have transcriptional leakage and non-specific recombinases cannot switch the door.
We tested the AND1 gate with Bxb1. After incubation with Bxb1, the colonies are still white (this is normal!), therefore visual inspection of the switch was not possible. The only possibility was to sequence independent clones (see genotype section). We analysed five independent colonies by sequencing, all of them were switched.
AND2
In the absence of recombinase, the colonies are white. As a result, non-specific recombinases cannot switch the AND2 gate.
We tested the AND2 gate with FimE. After incubation with FimE, the colonies are still white (this is normal), therefore visual inspection of the switch was not possible. We analysed five independent colonies by sequencing, but none was switched. As said before, FimE sites that we used, do not work well, BBa_K137008 have to be replace by BBa_K107001 and BBa_K137010 by BBa_K1077000.
In vivo switch using cotransformation
The principle of this characterization is to cotransform the gate and the recombinase in the same strain. The gate construct ( BBa_K1132032 ) is on chloramphenicol and the Bxb1 construct ( BBa_K1132027 )"
SUSTC-Shenzhen,2014,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," cell-specific binding domain recognizes the EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptors on the cell surface. The translocation domain enhances nucleic acid escape from the cellular vesicle system and thus to augment nucleic acid transfer. The nucleic acid binding domain, which derives from the yeast GAL4 transcription factor, can carry plasmids with UAS (Upstream Activation Sequence) sequences into cells in vivo. Several research groups (Gaur, Gupta, Goyal, Wels, & Singh, 2002) (Chen et al., 2000) (Fominaya, Uherek, & Wels, 1998) have achieved this goal. Prof. Wels was kindly enough to provide his TEG vehicle for us to deliver DNA into Hela for this project. Figure 7 shows the schematic representation of the TEG fusion gene in the E.coli expression plasmid pWF47-TEG (Wels, Winfried 63110 Rodgau (DE)). A-B toxin delivery system for various human immune cells will need to be developed in the future.

gRNA design
gRNA is a 23nt short RNA fragment (not include tracrRNA) which binds to its complementary target and 'guide' Cas9 to cut the target DNA. Since we would like to destroy the HIV virus inside human body, a gRNA sequence that matched part of HIV conserved region but have few off-target matches in the human genome is desired. However, designing a gRNA for a human-infective virus is difficult due to the very large difference in the genome size. For virus like HIV, it is even more difficult because HIV can mutate in a very high rate. So we change our goal to finding a group of specific quasi-conservative sequences (gRNA) which are able to target one or more species of HIV.
Our search for the sequence roughly followed the process described in George M. Church's paper (Mali, Yang, et al., 2013). We modified it slightly to fit our own purpose. We first used bioinformatics method to find the quasi-conservative regions in the HIV-1 whole genome reference library by NIH. From the candidates, we selected the region around 720bp from beginning of the genome (aligned), in the less-selected region slightly off the LTR. We then used the online tools of Feng Zhang's Lab at MIT to find our desired g"

What is BioHub 3.0
BioHub 3.0 is a synthetic biology community, integrated Intelligent Search Engine and the online report editor. It brings you a new way to edit your reports and search whatever you need only in one step.
The Editor
We established a standardized description of experimental steps. The editor can help you complete high-quality lab reports quickly just by choosing steps and filling in the blanks. Custom steps and protocols are also supported. And in our report editor, biologists could use a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation and writing articles, which improve the efficiency of completing the experiment report.
Intelligent Search Engine
We developed our search engine on the base of 2017's project. Our engine has a better command of language recognition. It supports semantic recognition, like ""reports today"", ""reports by ana"", ""reports this year"" and edc.. Meanwhile, we listened to the opinions of the judges. This year we added advanced search and we can now sort the results by time, labels, etc.. It is easier for synthetic biologists to find what they need without many input's instructions. Additionally, we have added many useful databases and academic websites to our search engine, so biologists could search information more quickly.
The community
In this community, bio workers can record their experimental process and release those reports. Meanwhile, they could also read and comment on other scholar's reports. In this way, we make the academic discussion more convinent. We provide both site search and off-site search to provide better user experience.
Motivation
After consulting with several synthetic biology workers, we found that they would inevitably suffer from the need to spend a lot of time to complete the experimental report during the experiment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a editor that provides a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation, writing articles by dragging steps or protocols to improve the efficiency. So it can replace the original Pages or Microsoft Office for its convenience.  As we all know, too programmer-style search engine is very unfriendly to synthetic biologists, so we reidesigned functions of search engines. Researchers can easily find reports written by others after inputting some key words. They could also search information in some databases and websites directly though this engine.  For most synthetic biology workers"

We plan to use modelling to help test and characterise our Bio-Devices. This includes modelling our expected fluorescence based upon Fluorescent Protein production, statistical modelling and testing for physical binding versus false positives and various other parts of the project.
After attending YSB 1.0, we signed on with Manchester to help develop a modelling standard - this also interlinks with our work with Purdue . We hope that by being more tightly involved in these processes, we will better understand how to approach our project in terms of Characterisation and Modelling. Additional thanks to Newcastle for showing us BioNetGen.
Modelling The Cpx Pathway
The key to making MicroBeagle successful hinges on proper integration with the Cpx pathway. As such, it is essential we develop a god working model, not only to predict how much fluorescence we can expect in different environments, but also to prototype and test potential methods for controlling this; in turn reducing our false positive rate.
We are currently using BioNetGenLanguage to write the model code, as this provides a rule-based coding language that is easier to use than SBML. Rule-based modelling allows mechanistic simulation of the pertinent reactants, reducing the need to know the exact kinetics of reactions, as sub-processes can be absorbed into rate constants. Additionally, adaptation of the model should be easier after a basic framework has been produced, as new processes simply require insertion of new rules into the code. Finally, BNGL offers"

Collaborations
This year, FAFU-CHINA team had many collaborations with many Chinese teams and exchanges parts with them. We helped different teams to design protocol, construct the parts and verify their results independently. Meanwhile, other teams helped us to build model, test the accurate data and purify the expressed protein. Parts exchange also played an important role in collaborations.
Collaborations with SZU-China team
On 17thJune, Junhao visited the Shenzhen University and their team (SZU-China) after Synthesis Biology Meeting. SZU-China focused how to utilize Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii to produce more hydrogen. We also tried to express toxin proteins in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii. Based on the various background, they transform plasmids into Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii by glass-bead method while we used electroporation. The genetic transformation in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii is still big problem, with their help, the transformation of Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt1 was successful by glass-bead method.
Meanwhile, due to various and unknown reasons, SZU-China encountered a common problem that they failed to get any clone or amplified the PSB1C3 plasmid could not get any clone in the lab. We reproduced their experiment in our lab. Luckily, we got the positive result and figured out that their Chloramphenicol was inactivated. If you are interested in the details, you can visit this link.
Collaborations with JNFLS-China team
We noticed that the fluorescence value in treatment group was higher than the positive control group in JNFLS-China high school team's project. To explore the potential cause, we advised them to use Flow Cytometer (FCM) to gather data. And we helped them design the protocol of experiment in details.

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#coli_-_-_TEXT.html," <partinfo>BBa_K863005</partinfo> was made up to a final working volume of 6 L in a Bioengineering NFL 22 fermenter. Agitation speed, pO2 and OD600 were determined and illustrated in Figure 4. There was no noticeable lag phase and the cells immediately began to grow. The cells were in an exponential phase between 2 and 4 hours of cultivation, which results in a decrease of pO2 value and therefore in an increase of agitation speed. After 4 hours of cultivation the maximal OD600 of 2.76 was reached, which is comparable to the 3 L fermentation of E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863005</partinfo>. Due to induction of protein expression there is a break in cell growth. The death phase started, which is indicated by an increasing pO2 and a decreasing OD600. This demonstrates the cytotoxicity of the laccase for E. coli, which was reported by the DBU . In comparison to the fermentation of E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> under the same conditions (OD600,max= 3.53), the OD600,max was lower. Cells were harvested after 12 hours.
Purification of ECOL
The harvested cells were resuspended in Ni-NTA-equilibration buffer , mechanically disrupted by homogenization and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant of the cell lysate was loaded on the Ni-NTA column (15 mL Ni-NTA resin) with a flow rate of 1 mL min-1 cm-2.

The bound proteins were eluted by an increasing Ni-NTA- elution buffer gradient from 0 % to 100 % with a length of 200 mL and the elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In Figure 5 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak.

As mentioned last Monday, my laptop met an untimely demise (all right, it wasn't a complete demise, but it was close enough!), and it was necessary to mail the notebook in for repairs. This I accomplished as quickly as I could, and I can now say with confidence that it is on its way to Texas for a full recovery!
Week 7: July 8 - July 12
Our website thus far.
Monday, 7/8: I must admit, waking up and coming into work after a four-day-long weekend was quite the challenge. Nevertheless, it was done, and as soon as everyone was back in the lab we were pumped and ready to go. Today, I decided that it was finally time to tackle the Twitter/GAE/HTML communication challenge. I had been putting it off all of last week but if it has to be done, it has to be done. And so I settled down to code this up. And while it wasn't as fruitful a day as I had hoped, I definitely learned a lot about Google App Engine, which I will definitely put into use later on.
Tuesday, 7/9: Today, I continued my work on establishing the communication between Twitter, GAE, and our HTML page. After a full morning of research, I realized that I was in no better place than I was at yesterday, and that it was finally time to admit defeat - this was not something I could do on my own. As a result, I decided to contact one of my old professors from last semester who has a lot more experience with web programming, twitter, and google. After emailing her, I realized that to use the Twython api, I had to download several other packages as well, which I thought to be quite dumb - why didn't they just specify this on their api page? In any case, after that, I was finally able to get Twitter communicating with GAE!
Wednesday, 7/10: Now that Twitter is communicating with GAE, it was time to get GAE communicating with our HTML page. This was no easier than my previous challenge, and I was quite the frustrated coder after two days of trying to get this to work. Like yesterday, I knew this wasn't something I could do by myself in a timely fashion, and thus I decided to visit Eni, my web mashups professor from last semester. Together, we were able to get the communication working, and I was absolutely ecstatic. From there on, it was just a matter of getting the message to show up in the correct place,"

Extra Pillar
Last but not least, the final pillar is all our sponsors:
Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) gave us the opportunity to achieve our project by supporting us from the beginning. Their help came from different entities: from the ISV (Institut des Sciences de la Vie), to the SST (Secteur des Sciences et Technologies), École de Biologie, and finally, Jean Christophe Renauld, research Pro Rector of the UCLouvain.

We also tested if vegetative B. subtilis cells survive the long-term storage conditions (-20°C) for spores and if they can be transformed. They grew on plain agar plates but not spectinomycin plates, which was expected since the cells were not induced with xylose and thus incompetent. In addition, we tested if incompetent B. subtilis spores could be transformed and no colonies grew on the spectinomycin plates. This was expected since the cells were not induced with xylose.

General Support
Professor Dr. Uwe Sonnewald turned out to be the first person to support our iGEM vision. Giving us our lab spaces and getting the Department of Biology behind our project was an enormous help to us. Regularly, he checks up on us to ask if everything is going all right. In addition, he helped us with lab materials and financially.
Lab support
Marlene Pröschel, a PhD student in the Division of Biochemistry, introduced us to the different labs and surroundings. She was our go to person when it came to any questions, be it either theoretical or practical. Moreover, she lent us a hand in the lab on some occasions (e.g. rpd3 overlap PCR).
Thanks to the Division of Molecular Plant Physiology (MPP) for letting us use their confocal laser scanning microscope to analyse our YFP expressing yeast.
Project advisor support
Professor Dr. Christian Koch was our specialist when it came to yeast knowledge. While always staying interested as well as enthusiastic, he also provided us with more lab space and materials. Prof. Koch's never ending expertise gave us great insight into homologous recombination, promotors, plasmids and literature.
Wiki page layout support
This Wiki Page layout was in large parts copied from the 2014 Team from SDU Denmark , which itself is also based on the 2013 Team from Denmark under the CC license . There have been several styling adjustments to make it optically distinguishable from their wiki, but the core concept remains the same. Initially, we planned to make our own layout, but as no one of our team has ever done any webpage development, we had to adapt and only make small changes to an already existing layout.

Public Engagement
Introduction
Our team recognized the need to extend our project beyond the lab and involve the members of our community. Through a number of diverse activities ranging from presentations at city hall, to a fun filled information night for parents and teachers, we spread information about synthetic biology, and the issues found in ink production. Overall, the engagement activities helped inform the public of iGEM and our project.
City Council
Members of our team decided to present our synthetic ink project to city council members to inform them of all the benefits that iGEM has to offer. During the presentation, members of city council expressed their interest in mostly the marketability of our project, and where it would lead us in the future. They gave us great recommendations for how to move forward with the project and expressed interest in helping us out. For instance, contact information for other large ink companies were shared with the team in order for us to gain more knowledge on the ink industry. Councillors also expressed confidence in our project by showing their support.
City Hall Public Forum
Following the presentation at city hall, a public forum was also conducted where members of city hall, and citizens could ask questions about our project. It also allowed us to inform them about iGEM and synthetic biology. Through this, we gained the attention of the local media. Global News Lethbridge interviewed a member of our team. This was a great opportunity to spread the word on our project and iGEM. The visit to city hall was quite rewarding, and very beneficial to the development of our project, as we learned citizens’ opinions on our project.
Shine on Festival
As part of the University of Lethbridge's ""Shine on Festival"" Homecoming Event, our team secured a tent to spread more information about our project and iGEM to the community. Members spoke with a variety of people including professors, university students, and children. We were even able to persuade a few high school students to join the team next year! As well, through advertising our Gofundme page, the event posed a way for our team to gain funds for our project. Promoting the synthetic biology community and the involvement of"

I had a ton of fun (and stress) building and documenting DNA parts, adding compounds into cataracts model, and purifying proteins that didn’t get eluted!
Avery W.
I was in charge of modeling and wiki. People who visited our poster should recognize me by the sign I held: “Ask me about my modeling! ☺ For modeling, I researched, coded, analyzed, and typed all five mathematical models on prototype design, and built the nanoparticle calculator (software). For wiki, I coded the wiki HTML/CSS/JS pages, including the cataracts animation in the background that sadly no one noticed. I was also in charge of setting and enforcing deadlines for wiki pages, which as expected did not work out.
When my eyes started to hurt after staring at a laptop screen, I played a crucial role in experiments serving as a secondary eppendorf holder, during which I patiently listened to Changsun or Huiru’s complaints about their experiments (and usually making them even more frustrated). I also documented the entire Boston trip through my selfies ( see example ).
Dennis J.
I am the safety head. I contributed other members in their experiments, research, and modeling. You have to remember, looks are deceiving, so do not forget to check your lab benches twice!
Austin L.
I free-rided on all the hard work of the seniors and used this purely as a way to build my resume.   The resume-building part didn’t really work.
I contributed mainly to literature research, and helped with the initial spring-boarding of the counteracts idea. In addition to literature research, I helped with policies and practice by bringing a few individuals for interviews. I also worked part-time on experiments, as I am otherwise known as the ""miniprep-machine""
Alvin W.
I came into the lab everyday to warm up for a tennis game with exp_mas. Occasionally I read my summer reading. Otherwise, I blended ice cream with apple juice, froze Huiru’s hair with liquid nitrogen, gauged fish eyes without cleaning up, and ordered Pizzahut. In total, I had spent 10 hours of work to make a 2-minute video on how to make nanoparticles.

The sense device, BBa_2368007 and BBa_2368008, was expressed successfully in the host yeast. Once the receptor can respond the presence of sweeteners, the mRFP will be expressed as output. (Fig. 13)
Fig. 14  A simplified model of the αpheromone pathway with T1R2/T1R3
Following the above, we separately added a list of sweeteners like fructose, sucrose, glucose into the culture to detect the red fluorescence intensity based on whether its regulatory interaction with sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3.
So we selected two sweeteners, fructose and sucrose, for the first testing.
Firstly, we selected a single cell clone of CEN.PK2-1C with the circuits mentioned previously and cultured this clone in SD medium with 2% glucose and corresponding concentration of antibiotic G418 at 30℃ overnight.
After harvesting cells, we centrifuged the cells and added new SD medium with 2% galactose and antibiotic G418 for inducing the expression of T1R2 and T1R3. Incubated at 30℃ for 12 hours.
Then added sweeteners into culture according to Table 1
Table 1.  The sweeteners added for detecting function of the system

After adding sweeteners, we used plate reader to measure the fluorescence intensity and OD600, calculated the value of fluorescence intensity/ OD600 as the  mean fluorescence intensity at the single cell level. The mean fluorescence intensity is showed in Fig.15.
Fig. 15 The mean fluorescence intensity of experimental group and control group after 12, 16 hours
As the picture shows, the fructose group and sucrose group established obvious increase compared to control group from 12h to 16h.
The red fluorescence intensity at the single cell level all increased, but the sucrose group and fructose group increased faster than control group, which meant adding sweeteners indeed accelerated the fluorescence protein production in yeast cells in our system.
In other words, our system can be sensitive to sweeteners."

As a webpage it’s much more accessible - anyone (even on a phone) could use it without having to install any custom programs which would take both time to install and might require a license.
As far as we’re aware, we’re the first iGEM team to ever put up something like this. The closest was Pretoria UP 2016, but our graphs also contained our entire mass action kinetics model, instead of just a visualization.
It was built in JavaScript and therefore not limited by proprietary license agreements, and doesn’t require Java applets to be enabled (which modern browsers no longer support due to stability and security issues). [2]
JavaScript follows ECMA’s open standard so it can run on purely open-source tools. This helps acheive “iGEM’s goal of making everything in the competition open source”. [3] There are also a lot more open source libraries available for JavaScript which means other teams can build upon our work easier. These include Chart.js, the library we are using to draw the graphs.
Finally, our JavaScript code ran faster than our MATLAB code, which we attribute to both our greater experience in JavaScript and the aggressive optimisation that’s been done by vendors trying to compete for the fastest browsers. [4]
Initial mass action kinetics model
We created our first model following a meeting with Thomas Ouldridge at Imperial, who recently coauthored a paper about mathematically modeling toehold-mediated strand displacement. In the meeting we agreed that we’d need to model the different states of the toehold switch. We also discussed modeling the miRNA binding and unbinding to and from the toehold base-by-base. We later decided against this, as whilst it may have been useful for learning about the kinetics of toehold switches it would not have given us useful information to put into our design process and would have overcomplicated our model.
We first modelled a simple system of 4 substances with reversible reactions as follows:
Where CTS, PBTS and OTS represent the toehold switch in closed, partially bound and open states respectively. At this point we didn’t know the value of the rate constants so we used placeholders.
This was useful as it gave us experience programming in MATLAB, which we hadn’t done before, as well as forced us to learn the foundations for the maths we’d need later; mainly ODEs. Khan Academy was very helpful with this.
With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to"

According to our circuit, we choose the LuxI/LuxR system as our sensor part. The toggle switch contains lacI gene and cI gene. And the responder is M13 engineered phage packaging the sRNA cassettes. Then, a gene circuit which can sense the signaling molecules AHL and silence the antibiotic resistance gene of Enterohemorrhagic Esceriachia coli is constructed.
Here comes the concrete gene circuit.
Figure 3. The entire and concrete gene network of programmable cell contain four parts: sensor, responder, toggle switch and lysis.
Sensor
As mentioned above, our engineered bacteria are designed to detect the signaling molecules and start the responder gene.
Quorum sensing plays an important role in the bacteria communication. Quorum-sensing bacteria can express and release small chemical signal molecules called autoinducers. The concentration of the autoinducers increases when population rises. Bacteria can detect a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of autoinducers, then lead a relevant gene expression.
One quorum sensing system in Gram-negative bacteria is LuxI-LuxR type. LuxI is the autoinducer synthase to produce the acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducer, and LuxR is a protein which can bind AHL autoinducer and then activates transcription. In our sensor, the right hand Lux promoter (Lux pR) can be activated by LuxR-AHL component[1].
The sensor consists a promoter ( BBa_J23100 ) and LuxR gene and Lux pR ( BBa_A340620 ). BBa_J23100 is a strong promoter that can be on in strains without any inducer, so LuxR gene can express constantly. The autoinducer AHL will bind LuxR when the concentration of the AHL up to the threshold. Then the promoter Lux pR will be activated, and the responder start to express.
Figure 4. The diagram of the mechanism that the AHL is sensed by the lux system sensor part.
Responder
Recently the recombinant phage containing genetically engineered DNA has been a new weapon for clinical treatment. This combination enables the extension of phage's innate phenotypes, provide a delivery way for sRNA cassettes. The M13 phagemid/helper system has been widely used in phage display, and been commercialized already. We choose the M13 phagemid/helper system packaging the CAT-targeted sRNA cassettes as our responder.

COMPOSITE PARTS
All the composite parts are composed of the same skeleton: A promoter, an R.B.S., a keratinase gene, and a double terminator.  There is a composite part that uses the KerA gene, and one that uses the KerUS gene.
Part name: Keratinase A Expression Cassette (BBa_K1717000)
Creator: Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy 2016
Short description: Keratinase A (KerA) under control of a Lacl promoter
Long description: Keratinases are proteolytic enzymes that are capable of breaking the disulfide bonds in many different keratin substrates, such as hair and feathers. KerA is a basic part comprised of a synthesized KerA protein coding sequence, optimized for expression in E. coli and is intended for the breakdown of the beta-keratin, more commonly present in feathers.
KerA, when successfully expressed in cells, can be tested for enzymatic effectivity by looking for zones of clearing when plated on skim milk agar plates, as well observing the degradation of keratin substrates when grown with cells.
Design considerations: Keratinases are isolated from a number of bacteria and fungi species, most notably those in the Bacillus genera. The bacterial chassis we use is a strain of E. coli called K-12. Like all E. coli, this strain is gram-negative. Building off of the work of previous teams, such as Chicago, Sheffield, we deduced that the signal peptides that originated from gram-positive organisms could be causing the poor enzyme secretion in these teams projects. These teams either left these gram positive signals in their sequence, or removed it entirely. However, our team decided to replace the native signal peptide sequence and replaced it with one specifically optimized for secretion in gram-negative E. coli (pelB, with the sequence taken from part Part BBa_J32015). This part would hopefully secrete our enzyme into the periplasm, where it could escape into the media extracellularly once the promoter was induced.  DNA sequences were compared using Clustal to ensure protein coding sequences were not altered, as well as to ensure that start and stop codons were correct. NEBCutter V2.0 was used to check for illegal cut sites."

PCR analysis
To analyze whether or not the PCR had succeeded in amplifying our constructs of DNA, the samples were run on an agarose gel. After analyzing the samples using an UV reader, it could be concluded that CL2 and CL4 had a clear and sharp band at the correct length and were thus successfully amplified. CL3 however, was vague and had no clear band at the desired length and thus not amplified correctly. Another PCR of CL3 will be performed tomorrow.

Miniprep of negative control library colonies
Today I miniprepped the 24 colonies that were picked and grown to saturation last night.  These 24 colonies should contain a good number of the 18 practice plate plasmids within them.  The minipreps were very successful for these strains, yielding concentrations from ~30-60 ng/ul.  Nida ran a junction PCR on the 24 miniprepped products, and we sent them out for sequencing in order to determine which of the 18 practice plate oligos are contained within these 24 colonies.  The yields of the minipreps can be seen below:
Miniprep concentrations and purities
Selection plasmid concentrations
In order to proceed with the experiment #2 outlined yesterday, Nida and I combined the miniprepped products (everything except for sample 6, which had very low miniprep yields for some reason) in equal molar ratios according to their concentrations.  This constitutes our negative control library, containing complete zinc fingers targeted towards the CB bottom target, but not towards the Zif268 binding site.
I then took the negative control library and spiked it with varying amounts of Zif268 whole plasmid, yielding mixes that contained in total 500 ng of plasmid.  Thus, for the positive and negative plasmid controls, they each contained 500 ng of Zif268 and 500 ng of negative control library, respectively.  For the 1:10 dilution, there were 50 ng of Zif268 and 450 ng of negative control, and so on.  The Zif268 plasmid that was used originated from the midiprep that Nida performed last Friday.
The 8 mixtures outlined yesterday were then transformed into the EcNR2 selection strain, and plated on spec plates.  This will simply select for bacteria that contain plasmid, but not specifically for those that contain Zif268 plasmid.

The two 2-part and two 3-part CBA's were amplified using PCR Rescue and gel purified. The original 4-part CBA was transformed into E. coli electrocompetent cells using electroporation and plated on kanamycin antibiotic agar plates. The 4-part CBA was repeated to ensure accuracy. Because the CBA parts contained no plasmid DNA, the 4-part CBA could be digested by restriction enzyme Dpn1. Dpn1 binds and cuts methylated DNA sites, thus destroying any plasmid DNA remaining as a contaminant.
More issues with RBS library design, as it seems very difficult to find sequences with sufficiently high TIR. Decided to use an initial condition for the calculator, which should speed it up and also ensure higher TIR is reached. More calculations ran.
Tuesday, June 10, 2014
The original 4-part CBA worked! Many colonies appeared on the plate after incubation at 37 degrees C for 18 hours, and 12 colonies were selected for plasmid preparation. These were digested with AatII and XbaI, two restriction sites that are only both contained in the final assembled 4-part plasmid. 6/12 colonies showed the correct bands on the gel. We also prepared more 1 kb ladder from concentrate.

In order to insert the dCas9 system into plasmid 1, dCas9 was digested with XhoI and ClaI. 4 successful colonies were digested with ClaI for 3 hours, heat inactivated at 65 degrees C, and then digested with SalI-HF restriction enzyme. SalI and XhoI are compatible sites. These digestions were gel purified, resulting in low concentrations of plasmid DNA. Only two colonies were used to continue further.

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," that would have monopoly on the product. This fitted well with the idea of strains that can be grown at home by everyone. By focusing on yeast and bacteria that are kept in pots and that can be added in a dish at the user’s convenience, we are not targeting the farmers specifically, and we are not affecting the crops at all; and we are giving people an independence and way to chose at any time whether or not they want to eat the GMO.
Most of the indian people we interviewed also told us that they would try our idea of adding a vitamin-producing bacteria, as long as it is proven efficient and harmless for human health. They said that a slight change in the recipe of a dish (aka adding the yeast a bacteria so that they would ferment and produce the vitamins in the dish) would not bother them as long as the taste is not changed.
In order to not affect the taste, we chose to modify micro-organisms already present in the dish instead of adding new ones, in order to not disrupt the microbiome of the fermented dish. To check if high amounts of vitamins could change the taste, we also tasted idlis (fermented rice cakes) in which vitamin A, B2 and B12 bought in a supermarket had been added in quantities equivalent to the required daily amount, and did a blind test: people found no difference in taste at all with and without vitamins.
Why idli?
Idli (or idly) is a small steamed cake made                         with fermented rice and black lentils (called urad dal or dal). It is a very                         popular breakfast food across India, mostly in the south, and is often eaten with chutney.
We wanted our product to truly fit the traditions and tastes of the people we were                         targeting, and idli appeared to be the ideal dish. It is a very popular staple of the                         Indian diet, along with the crepe-like dosa, which is made of a similar but less coarse                         batter. Its two ingredients (rice and dal) are very cheap and widely available resources,                         and idli is commonly eaten by people who lack other types of food and who suffer from                         vitamin deficiencies. There is even a program that distributes free rice to the poorest                         populations in the country, the Public Distribution System (PDS); and in the city of Chennai and                         its suburbs, canteens called Amma Unavagam sell idli and other foods for very low                         prices (Rs1 for 1 idli).
Besides its popularity and easy accessibility, the most interesting property of idli is                         that it is fermented. To cook"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,", no GFP signal could be observed in cells transfected with GFP reporter driven by EF-1alpha promoter. Originally, we thought that the sequence of EF-1alpha promoter cloned from iDUET101a contained the full functional promoter region annotated in pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen). We believed that EF-1alpha did trigger transcription but failed to translate the GFP coding sequence due to insufficient 5’ untranslated region (UTR). After the regional jamboree, the promoter was re-cloned with additional 3' sequences after the identified TATA box to allow a longer 5’ untranslated region before the GFP coding DNA sequence. From the the results above, we believed that translation of GFP is successful this time.
Conclusion
EF-1alpha promoter was observed to drive expression of GFP in HEK293FT cells and green fluorescence was observed under fluorescence microscope.

5) We labeled the purified stock as 7.19.
6. Titer to determine phage concentration 2 (7.19)
1) For each concentration of phage, specifically 5uL and 10uL, 1:100 dilution series were performed to generate 0, -2, -4, -6. 1:10 dilution series were then performed to generate -7, -8, and -9.
2) For each dilution, a test tube was assigned to it. To each test tube, 0.75mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight was added and then transfected with 30uL of phage dilution. After 20 minutes of incubation, 7mL of x1 agar was added to each test tube and the content was then plated.
3) Plates were incubated upside down for 24 hours.
V) Results
3. Titer to determine phage concentration 1
10ug has many plaques on the -4 plate and 6 plaques on the -6 plate.
100ug has many plaques on the -4 plate, none on the -6 plate, and 1 on the -7 plate.
1mL has many plaques on the -4 plate, 4 on the -6 plate, and 2 on the -7 plate
We realized afterwards that using x8 top agar will not give us an accurate measure of phage concentration. From our results in 4.26 T7 Phage Selection Test , we know that the more concentrated the top agar is, the fewer the number of plaques will form on each plate. Thus for our next titer, we will use x1 agar.
4. Set up phage liquid culture - second round of propagation
The 10ug test tube was pretty clear, while the 5ug test tube was a little cloudy. The 0ug test tube was still very cloudy.
6. Titer to determine phage concentration 2
Both 5ug and 10ug went down to -7. They appear to be at about the same concentration.
VI) Conclusion/Next Step
After these two round of propagation, we are able to increase the titer of our phage stock to 10^(-9) PFU/mL. We will use this as the new stock for our future round of mutagenesis. Also, this experiment made us realize that phage titer will drop if it is stored inside the fridge for too long. This requires us"

This is the simplest job, since the VEGF & VEGF antibody complex structure have been texted by X-ray diffraction. That means the interface of those two proteins has been determined. What we have to do is just remolding the amino acid sequence to have a stronger binding affinity. However, this is the best chance to test RosettaDock, since we have got the correct response. After 5000 times of global docking, we finally chose a best structure, in consideration of total energy, binding energy and interface (Antibodies have stationary interface, CDRs). Then, another 1000 times of local docking was operated. (see more from principles )

Finally, we have got a not-so-bad docked structure. As Figure 2 shows, the docked structure has only minor difference compared to the crystal structure.
Next step is sequence design of the VEGF-scFv. With 200 rounds of sequence design of the CDR loop by RosettaAntibodyDesign, we finally mutated 4 residues on the heavy chain: (using AHo Scheme numbering)
Thr-59 → Val
Tyr-69 → Glu

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," new production method for example, one must first closely study the available techniques that do not employ synthetic biology. If something can be produced chemically, then a comparison has to be established between this process and the potential new synthetic biology based process. Once this comparison is made, and if synthetic biology can offer an advantage (less costly, quicker, more environmentally friendly, etc), then it is sound to develop a new method based on synthetic biology.
The process of bringing a new product from the lab to the market will often result in the oversimplification of technical knowledge and the associated ethical considerations. People who are involved in this process, be it a businessman or a policymaker, should, in our opinion, be aware of issues that emcompasses the use of synthetic biology in their products. One area that is especially important to talk about is bioethics. A discussion about bioethics can help society define both possibilities that are welcomed and boundaries in which society should remain.
The advantages brought by modifying living organisms are far from minor[2]. Here, we will take the example of two industries central to this field: the pharmaceutical industry works in the medical sector and aims to improve the daily lives of suffering patients, while the agri-food industry seeks to feed the world, and the optimisation of its yields may seem secondary in comparison to pharmaceutics. However, the human population is ever growing, and feeding billions more mouths may become a more pressing problem than what we may first think.
In these two major areas, the synthetic biology industry is making great leaps forward and enabling innovations that directly affect society. The first is the creation of new medicines and skincare techniques that could improve the quality of life for everyone. The second is to increase the profitability of certain foodstuffs, which could help reduce hunger in the world.
Take the example of Taxol: it is a cancer chemotherapy agent, acting on spindle stabilisation. Its effects are proven on cancer but remain very inaccessible to many because of its price (about 6000 USD for a full cycle[3]). The reason behind the high cost is the inefficient extraction process from the Pacific yew tree that produces not only low yields of Taxol, but also impure mixtures of compounds. By going through a synthetic biology process, we can simplify the production and purification process. The cost of this drug could then drop dramatically[4] and therefore be much more readily available to those who need it.
Similarly, allowing the creation of plants for continuous food production regardless of the season would result in a significant cost reduction of food which could reduce hunger in the world. This raises the issue of the"
