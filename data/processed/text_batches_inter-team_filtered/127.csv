2. Weaknesses
Not as experienced in business development and management as competitors might be.
The research and development pipeline depends on cutting edge high-technology, which increases the difficulty of research and engineering.
The growing pace may be slow at first, as large amounts of initial sequence to function data is required to be collected to reach a certain breaking point in enzyme engineering.
3. Opportunities
Accelerating demand in the synthetic enzyme market.
Collaboration with already established large enzyme engineering or pharmaceutical companies.
4. Threats
Harsh competition in the catalytic biomolecule engineering and similar industries.
Extremely long incubation times for life science startups and spin-offs.
Conclusions
Our research and development pipeline consisting of CAT-Seq for data acquisition and ReactionGAN for novel enzyme generation has a tremendous potential to disrupt the synthetic biology and enzyme engineering markets. We have taken the first steps by analyzing our business case. Moreover, we have submitted a patent application just before the iGEM competition in order to protect our intellectual property.
There’s is a great amount of toxic chemical catalysts used every day all over the planet, and there is only one reason for that - the lack of catalytic biomolecules for various reactions. For that reason, we believe that it is important for us to continue developing CAT-Seq and accelerate the production Novel, Synthetic and Environmentally friendly Enzymes."

Synthetic biology is more than ever at the centre of economical and industrial stakes in agro, pharma, energy, biosensors and synthetic chemistry fields. This project is perfectly integrated in my course as future genetic scientist. It allowed me to go deeper into details, to improve my skills in molecular biology (cloning strategies and processes, normalization) and to get a multidisciplinary approach in problems. The iGEM in an unique adventure which gathers rigorousness, autonomy and team work integrated in a project that allows interesting meetings with people sharing the same passion.
Jean-Rémy Brossier (3rd year of Bachelor’s degree in Biology)
In the last 40 years, technological advancement in health has been dazzling. Thanks to this, several new scientific fields emerged like synthetic biology, nanotechnology, biotechnology… Synthetic biology is one of the principal stakes of the next years. The iGEM competition has the goal of making synthetic biology known thanks to the involvement of students. I have been in the iGEM team of Bordeaux last year and I wanted to start over this year. The values taught by this competition (helping each other, cooperation, team spirit) correspond to my own vision of what is biology. It is also an opportunity to acquire knowledge in specific domains that are less known (thanks to the multidisciplinary team). iGEM is an ideal occasion to begin with my wish to become a genetic researcher and to expand my network in this field, while meeting people sharing the same passion.
Mounir Benkoulouche (2Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
I am a third-year student in MS of biotechnology in a French engineering school. I've been involved in the iGEM since two years. After the first year of participation, I was utterly motivated to renew this incredible adventure. This time, my job was to recruit a team and then to supervise the theoretical work during the meetings, giving a hand on all the aspects thanks to the experience from my first participation. Even if I couldn't take part in the labwork due to my synthetic biology internship at Evolva SA, I am one hundred percent with my teammates to win a gold medal in Boston!

Members of product development and P&P also spoke with more hydroponic growers, and they learned that disease can kill hydroponic crops extremely quickly. Many of the non-traditional growers, such as J.J. Reidy at Urban Pastoral, who uses an old shipping container for his setup, had similar complaints about energy usage and monitoring as the traditional hydroponic growers did. Another hydroponic farm, Urban Crop Solutions, told the team about its own use of oxidants such as ozone to sterilize the hydroponic solution.

SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," number of bacteria can influence the ability of urate consuming, we measured the OD600 of the                     bacteria when the sample was ready for HPLC test.
The values in different independent repeated experiments are not always the same. But the tendency is the same in every group:                     For urate utilization ability, M9(Anaerobic)＞M9(Aerobic) ＞LB(Anaerobic)＞LB(Aerobic). It means that bad                     nutrition environment and anaerobic environment can better reduce the urate level. The urate concentration                     in gut is about 100uM-400uM. According to our experiment results, our gene constructions (pucL, YgfU                     + pucL, LM4 Full, LM4 Optimum) all have the ability to reduce the urate concentration to the ideal value.                     However, we cannot determine which one is the best choice. LM4 Full and LM4 Optimum showed no significant                     difference in this urate consuming experiment. Moreover, the LM4 optimum grew better than LM4 Full, which                     means that our modeling works well (Table 6).
Furthermore, some LB medium samples, even cultivated in an aerobic condition, showed an decrease in urate concentration.                     However, we never found urate concentration reducing in LB medium before, which may be related to the                     expression host we chose (BL21 and Nissle 1917).
Meanwhile, We measured the OD600 after cultivation for another 24h, and we found that if the absolute value of the difference                     between OD600 at 24h & 48h is below 0.05 (which means that bacteria growth is in the platform phase at                     24h), the possibility that the urate concentration decrease is more than 100uM(about 1000 if shown in                     HPLC peak area) is 85% on average. We doubted that the decrease of urate was due to the outflow of the                     uricase after cell death and lysis. The hypothesis can also interpret why anaerobic & worse nutrition                     environment, which is with lower environment capacity, is better for urate reduction.

Government Officials
Robin Rosenbaum, Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA) Plant Industry Section Manager
GMOs are subject to many rules and regulations through the state and federal government. After unsuccessful attempts to speak with someone at the FDA and USDA, Jordan and Jessica met with Robin Rosenbaum, the Plant Industry Section Manager at the MDA. She was a great resource for learning more about the government standards that apply to GMOs, as well as the history of government regulations for GMOs at the state level.
What are the regulations regarding GMOs in Michigan?
There are no regulations for conventional crops. GMOs are mostly regulated by the federal government. State governments can either concur or not concur with the federal ruling about a GMO. The federal government also oversees interstate movement of GMOs, while state governments oversee intrastate movement of GMOs. Exporting plants requires that the USDA look into the host country’s regulations to decide if the plant is allowed to enter that country. Some plants may be prohibited.
How have GMO regulations changed in your 30 years with the MDA?
GMO regulations have stabilized and I do not see them changing drastically anytime soon, even as more GMOs enter the market. I think the plant pest laws have been in place since the 1930s and are still used today. However, science is constantly changing so the future of GMO regulation can be difficult to predict.
What is the process of getting a GMO approved by the MDA?
The time frame depends on how simple and well understood the genetics are; that said, the Biotechnology Regulating Service (BRS) wants early communication about an upcoming GM product. Well known GMOs may be labeled as ‘unregulated’ or ‘deregulated’ by the BRS. In this case, the GMOs can be used with just a notification to the BRS. Lesser known GMOs have a longer approval process. The public also has a chance to comment on the federal and MDA regulations of GMOs.
How does marketing and selling GMOs work?
Farmers may have more difficulty marketing GMOs to the general public. For the most part, farmers try to keep the fact that a product is a GMO underwraps. Most people don’t know and understand enough about GMOs, so they often steer clear of the products. There should not be any legal problems associated"

ZJU-China iGEM team this year successfully built a universal protein detection platform based on the idea of aptamer-induced inner-membrane scaffold dimerization. In our project, we altogether used two sets of inner-membrane scaffolds as protein sensors. One is based on split GFP and the other is based on split β-lactamase.
Split TEM-1 β-lactamase
Protein fragment complementation assay is a widely used method for protein interaction detection. The two fragments of the protein is rational designed and based on protein interaction assisted folding. TEM-1 β-lactamase is relatively small and monomeric, is well characterized structurally and functionally, can be easily expressed, and is not toxic to prokaryotic cells. Furthermore, no orthologs of β-lactamase exist in many prokaryotes, and thus a protein fragment complementation assay based on β-lactamase could be used universally in prokaryotes without any intrinsic background activity. We split TEM-1 β-lactamase according to [4] into N-terminal consisting of a.a. 26-196 and C-terminal consisting of a.a. 198-290.
Diagram illustrating the split of TEM-1 β-lactamase.
(André Galarneau et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2002, 20, 619-22)
The activity of TEM-1 β-lactamase can be detected with a wide range of methods, such as simple colorimetric in vitro assays using the cephalosporin nitrocefin and assays in intact cells using the fluorescent substrate. There are also many commercial immune colloidal gold strips in China initially designed to detect β-lactamase in food and beverage. These strips are cheap, sensitive and robust, making them the ideal candidate for large scale applications.
Design
We try to detect thrombin as our proof-of-concept experiment. There have been two well characterized aptamers, one is 15-mer and the other is 29-mer, all show very high and specific affinity to thrombin. We then connected the two aptamers with different length of poly-T linkers, namely short and long linkers, to their 5’ end. At last, all aptamers were modified with 5’ biotin in order that they can bind to streptavidin.

It proves that using both glucose and 3HB can double the yield of P(3HB). The production rate 70g/L/Day is also relatively high for industrial scale of bioplastic production.
Assumption in the production
Conditions and considerations accompanying this value are:
volume of the system is 1 litre
growth medium: LB broth
Cultivation temperature: 37°C
wild-type E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 (NB: though not exactly our engineered one, it is the correct strain)
Assume stationary growth phase.
Assume that the amount of P(3HB) accumulated during the time course of simulation doesn't exceed the cell's capacity or ability to contain it.
Assume that all initial concentrations of the species in metabolic pathways and the synthetic pathways are in a large population level. The concentrations are maintained by approximately 1.5x1012cells in a 1L broth, calculated from value obtained from BioNumbers.  A range was given: 1-2x109 cells/ml, so 1.5x109 was taken. [29]

3.0 PLA Degradation Model▼
Introduction
The efficiency of degrading Polylactic acid (PLA) is important for the performance of MAPLE. Therefore, we chose a strong enzyme Proteinase K which is suggested by many literature as an efficient PLA degrading enzyme. We performed several assays in order to determine the kinetic properties of Proteinase K. The PLA degradation model was then built based on the experimental results.
Objective and Design
1. With the defined kinetic properties of Proteinase K. The model can predict the time needed to degrade a certain amount of PLA. It will produce useful information when degrading large amount of plastic.
2. The model also involves the gene expression model of the Proteinase K with an inducible promoter. Gene expression can be regulated by adjusting the inducer concentration.
3. A secretion module is contained in the model which assumes the efficiency of enzyme secretion to the culture.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". Before the protocol could be followed, the cells were thawed for 20 minutes on ice. After the thawing, 8 µl of the ligation mixture was added to cells and incubated for 30 minutes. Running out of ‘sticks’, some of the results of the transformations were plated the next day.
30/07/2015
The restricted RFP was isolated from the gel, which resulted in concentrations of 17, 14 and 12 ng/µl in volumes of 50µl each. After that, ligation of I13521 (RFP) with CsgA & CsgA_His/HA/SpyTag. The ligation scheme is calculated in such a way that a vector DNA concentration of 50 ng is achieved.
Another part of today was checking the plates made previously (24/07). No colonies were shown there. Consequently, the plates one tested with top 10 cells without plasmid in order to check the KAN antibiotic. So for the plating we used top 10 cells on LB + KAN plates.
Moreover, we made overnight cultures in 5 mL LB + antibiotics (although mentioned otherwise).
31/07/2015
Today we started with plasmid isolation of the overnight cultures 1-20 inoculated at 30/07/2015. For the plasmid isolations, 4.5 mL (3 x 1.5 mL) was used from each overnight cultures, except for 7.1 & 7.3 (3 mL → 2x 1,5 mL) due to pipetting mistake. In the table below, the concentrations we found after the plasmid isolations are shown.
From the obtained plasmids, number 1 to 12 and the Interlab construct J23117_GFP were sent for sequencing. All in a total volume of 10 µl, a total amount of plasmid of 500 ng and a total amount of primer of 25 pmol. The primer working concentration would be 10 pmol/µl.
After plasmid isolation, we performed a restriction reaction. For this, the constructs Mfp5_csgA, CsgA_Mfp3, CsgA_his, CsgA_HA, CsgA and CsgA_Spy (1 to 6) were cutted with the restriction enzymes EcoRI-HF and XbaI-HF. pSB4K5 (14) and pSB1C3 were cut with EcoRI-HF and PstI-H"

It is precisely this type of constraint that has restricted the utilization of the nascent review tool and is the culprit for the vast number of antiquated biobricks, which are consequently useless to any user interested in acquiring the part.
It is important to note, however, that the mere existence of the “sample” review image and  “Experience” page verifies our belief that there is indeed a communal need for this type of tool and at least an attempt is being made by the developers to address this need.  Accordingly, our proposed design will build off of this current framework so as to transform a currently ineffective tool into an invaluable resource for all Registry users.
Proposed Design Changes
We propose a means of quickly and easily reviewing parts on both a quantitative and qualitative scale using a standardized formatting system and a means of essentially reviewing the review based on user feedback.  Additionally, we propose a set of easily accessible buttons that will allow the user to flag parts so as to solicit further inquiry into the part by other users.
Keeping the system as simple as possible is critical to gaining user participation, as any sort of difficulty or confusion the user confronts in the process is likely to divert them from fulfilling their review.
Accordingly, we believe there should be a clear button next to the part name that allows the user to immediately enter both the list of reviews for that part as well as one-click access to the “submit a review” page.  Furthermore, a star based “average review” next to the part name will provide additional exposure of the system to the user and entice the user to participate in the review process.
Once the user enters the “submit a review” page, the first step will be to rank the part on various attributes by simply clicking the star-ranking the user wishes to give for each of the following attributes:
Part matches expected DNA Sequence
Part functions as expected
Description of part was helpful
Characterization of part was helpful
Experience with part was beneficial
Once the user has ranked the part based on each of the aforementioned attributes, they will then be required to enter a qualitative, text-based, review of that part.  This can include general experience with the part, overall opinion of the efficacy of the part, or tips and tricks to help other scientists when working with the part.  At this stage, the user will also have the opportunity to click a radio button to flag the part to incite inquiry and further review by other users (*flagging the part requires a text entry"

Talking to yeast
How long have you been fermenting?
In this part of the project we have achieved great results. However we are still working with our yeasts in order to improve their response and to perform a better characterisation of the constructions. To sum up, we have successfully transformed a delta-yap1 strain with the two constructions pADH2-Yap1 and pTRR2-GFP and pTRR.GFP (links), and what is more, we have observed a very neat and marked fluorescence in the transformed yeast.
Read below to follow us through fantastic results of our experimental work!
Transformation
We have successfully transformed  yeast with two constructions, pADH2-Yap1 and pTRR2-GFP . We used a methionine, hisditine, uracil and leucine auxotrophic strain, to grow it up we needed a SD medium supplemented with this essential compounds. After the previously described transformations, our yeast became capable of growing up in methionine and histidine supplemented SD medium, due to we have used the two yeast plasmids Yeplac181 and Yep352 with leucine and uracil  complementation, respectively.
In this figures we can see the leucine and uracil complementation wich confirms the presence of our two constructions.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#human#interviews#expert6_-_-_TEXT.html," of an atom, you are not going to write a Hamiltonian on all quarks inside, gluons, etc. There are some effective theories which, at your level, will enable you to understand phenomena without needing underlying theories. At the level of the nuclear physicist, there is an effective theory, and between his level and the level of the particle physicist, there is a kind of emergence. The reductionist approach assumes that there is a fundamental theory below, and that we are able to extend it. This is what we call the synthetic ascent. Yet we are still not able to do it. For example: we don't know how to derive Ohm's law from axioms of the quantic theory. Ohm's law is something we only observe. We are not able to make it emerge from Dirac's equations. However we assume it is possible. Maybe it is completely wrong.
The question of what type of emergence we are dealing with raises another more metaphysical question: Does Nature have a core level, which we could qualify as fundamental, or do we have to deal with only effective theories?
And in the case of biology, this question about emergence raises also new questions:
What is the status of life, the status of conscience, compared to matter? Is conscience a property that matter has when it is organized in a complex way? Or is conscience coming from an extraterritoriality in relation to life? Are biological laws derivable from physical laws, or do they simply add up to physical laws? In short: if there are biological laws, do they have or not a link to physical laws?
HOW DOES ONE DEAL WITH COMPLEXITY IN PHYSICS?
Physics' commitment is to avoid complexity. Modern physics starts from the principle that fully describing a phenomenon is impossible. So we limit our ambitions, and this is how we can become efficient. For example if one tries to understand celestial mechanics, one has to understand first that the dynamics of a body orbiting the sun is independent from its shape, its density, its colour and its mass. What you can write mathematically is the dynamics of this body in motion. If one would like to describe entirely this body, one would have to deal with complex systems. This simplification approach is called reductionism.
This approach has become impressively efficient, to the extent that people wondered whether physics really had to limit its ambitions, and whether it could colonize other domains such as Biology. We thought at the age of Enlightenment that physics could serve as a theoretical basis for theorising all phenomena.  Today we came back of this enthusiasm because of complexity and because of"

TERRA allows scientists to easily incorporate microfluidics to their experiments and easily access and utilize the outputs of microfluidic devices. By using TERRA, scientists can automate synthetic biology protocols, such as those for molecular cloning, that can be applied in creating BioBricks or similar experimental products.
TERRA Works!
Our system TERRA has demonstrated the ability to automate and selectively dispense the output of an experiment on a microfluidic chip. Automation is implemented by the actuation syringe pumps and controlled from the UI. TERRA is also able to selectively dispense to specific wells on microtiter plates by choosing locations on the interface. By implementing these features in our design of TERRA we looked to achieve of making microfluidics more approachable and easier to use for biologists

Community Lab
In order to spread the idea of “synthetic biology” to public, we did a lot of brainstorms and came up with plenty of ideas, one of which was to cooperate with Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum (ZJSTM) and exhibit a series of activities to a wide range of people.
After a long and profound discussion with the principal of the museum, we noticed that building up a community lab must be an excellent way to introduce “synthetic biology” to the public and ZJSTM would provide us with a certain place for this lab.
Months later, the building of a small lab especially for presentation of life science was completed. The walls of the community lab were especially designed to be made of glass. They are transparent so all visitors of the museum, even children at low age, can watch the whole procedure of some biology experiments with out any risk.
To make full use of the lab and other resources provided by ZJSTM, lots of thoughts were put on how to make the activities presented entertaining while educational.

What are your interesting features of sweetness?
Through these two questions our questionary got the information about the market demand. We knew that people might be more acceptable to natural sweeteners, and comparing with aftertaste, coolness and mellowness, sweetness is more important.
Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd
As soon as we completed the initial plan, we visited the Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd, the most outstanding company in the area of producing concentrated fruit juice in China. We regarded the chance of discussing with the the chief engineer Mr. Wang as an honor and he was so friendly and warm-hearted to answer all questions asked by us and introduced the plight and prospect of sweeteners. For instance, saccharin is extremely sweet and low calories, but it has some certain potential risks to human beings, while the international standard of food health was never ignored by anyone. Thus our project has a really great future of the application through the two aspects including market prospect and policies.
COFCO
When several constructions of genes had been finished and tests had been carried out, the COFCO which is the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food supplier in China became our next interviewee. Some of the managers showed up to welcome us and  they are the principal of innovating new product—Mrs. Zhao, the one of vice chairmen of the company—Mr. Huang and the doctor who is responsible for the manipulating of electronic tongue technique—Mr. Liu. We had a long but meaningful chat about the current device used by most of the food producing companies, which made us realize that the generally used machine’s range is so limited that it is hard to measure the sweetness conveniently as well as some devices like electronic tongue technique would only be efficient after the association with the assessment given by workers, which results in the humongous uncertainty. Therefore, an innovative bio-system which relies on Synthetic Biology to observe and select new types of sweeteners will have a non-negligible contribution to the society. Finally, we accepted the advice which came from COFCO and what they suggest is to let us start with some classical and conventional sweeteners like stevia rebaudiana，liquorice and Momordica grosvenori.
COFCO AGAIN
When we had run the experiments for several months and attained a certain achievements, we decided to visit COFCO again to show what we had done and what we expected to do in the future, which thoroughly pleased almost all of managers shown up and made them create the idea to cooperate"

Project Overview
Tri-stable switch is a biological device that could perform three discrete, but alternating, steady states driven by three different repressible promoters. The presence of a transient pulse of inducer allows effective state shifting, while signal interference is prevented. In order to enhance the specificities towards inducers, improvements were made based on the Brown’s tri-stable switch model in 2006"

A New Measurement System
After running our project for quite some time we had started using current production instead of GFP fluorescence for protein expression.  We realized that current measurements were many times faster with reproducible increase in current 18 minutes after induction with IPTG.  This brought us to the realization that we could use current instead of GFP as a reporter for protein expression.  We also realized that anyone could use this, that it would be faster than GFP, and it would be just as accurate.  This method has many benefits over GFP fluorescence.  The expression can be taken in anaerobic conditions, where the superfolder proteins in GFP need oxygen to fold properly.  Current is a much faster method with induction visible after 18 minutes as opposed to multiple hours for GFP.  Current requires less expensive equipment than GFP and current measurement has a continuous display while GFP only has intermittent results.  All of these claims are visible in either the results tab of or the model tab.  Due to all of these benefits to using current as a measurement tool we posit that current is a more effective measurement tool of protein expression than GFP fluorescence.

As we will see later, they are a function of a number of factors.  Among them is the level of the substrate in the solution and the probability of binding a substrate molecule to the enzyme.
Since there are usually a very large number of molecules in the solution, we can use the law of large numbers:
\[\begin{array}{l}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\frac{{dP}}{{dt}} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {{K_{enzym{e_i}}}}  \approx N \cdot E\left[ {{K_{enzym{e_i}}}} \right] = N \cdot \left( {{K_{ca{t_{forward}}}} \cdot {P_{reactio{n_{forward}}}} - {K_{ca{t_{backward}}}} \cdot {P_{reactio{n_{backward}}}}} \right)\\ \Rightarrow \frac{{d\left[ P \right]}}{{dt}} = \left[ {enzyme} \right] \cdot \left( {{K_{ca{t_{forward}}}} \cdot {P_{reactio{n_{forward}}}} - {K_{ca{t_{backward}}}} \cdot {P_{reactio{n_{backward}}}}} \right) = {V_{{m_f}}} \cdot {P_{reactio{n_{forward}}}} - {V_{{m_r}}} \cdot {P_{reactio{n_{backward}}}}\end{array}\]
Next, we will find \({P_{reactio{n_{forward}}}}\) and \({P_{reactio{n_{backwards}}}}\) for our enzyme.
Developing the model
The drivation of this model is based on a similar model for binding of ligands to receptors found in the book[8].
The AKR1C9 has one site for binding a cofactor. Once the cofactor is bound, the enzyme has a site which the appropriate hormone binds to. Let us look at a system with one receptor that has two binding sites and four ligands:
We'll assume we have \({L_A}\) ligands from type A, \({L_B}\) ligands from type B and so on for C and D. The solution has \(\Omega \) ""volume cells"" which can contain only one ligand"

The Signalling Cascade
sdSQR  is a NAD(P)/FAD-dependent oxidoreductase, which oxidizes S2- to  zero-valent S0. SqrR, encoded by sqrR,  is a constitutively expressed suppressor protein of sqr promotor. When there is no H2S in the environment,  SqrR combines with the sqr promotor  and keeps the expression of the enzyme at a low level; while in the case where H2S  exists, it will be oxidized by the small amount of expressed enzyme, and the  product will interact with SqrR, forming a tri- or tetrasulfide cross-links  linking C41 and C107 on the same subunit of SqrR. The change in the structure  of SqrR makes it fall off from the sqr promotor and thus the expression of sqr turns on. Overall, SQR promotes the expression of itself by producing  substances that help with disinhibition[1,2].
Signalling Kinetics
In cell signaling, the enzyme sqr, catalyzes the oxidation of S2- to zero-valent S0, We model this rate using the Law of Michaelis–Menten kinetics, this model involves  an enzyme, E, binding to a substrate, S, to form a complex, ES, which in turn  releases a product, P, regenerating the original enzyme. This may be  represented schematically as
where (forward rate), (reverse  rate), and (catalytic  rate) denote the rate constants, the double arrows between S (substrate) and ES  (enzyme-substrate complex) represent the fact that enzyme-substrate binding is  a reversible process, and the single forward arrow represents the formation of  P (product).
Under certain  assumption– such as the enzyme concentration being much less than the substrate  concentration – the rate of product formation is given by[3]
Applying  these principles to the reaction:

5) Open Lab
UFMG_Brazil iGEM team is supporting the creation of a community lab in the UFMG. The project submitted to funding in 2014 has been recently approved and is beginning to be built. One of the main purposes of a community lab is to create a space to attend demands of the society and put them in practice.
To do so, it is necessary to understand how the general public feels, what are their thoughts on science and also what their possible contributions could be. Considering this, we promoted additional actions, such as the online platform Embryo.
6)Embryo Platform (1 k people reached)
The team is building, through a Facebook page, an Ideator pilot project - Embryo -, a place where we can easily reach more people and share more information about how good Synthetic Biology could be for the society. Check our pilot here .
Also, we have a Facebook page , where we dialogue with the public, we put news on the team, announced the project and events and disclose research questionnaires.
At last, the team wishes, in future, to build the ideator platform at first as a SynBio advertising tool to support the events, courses and lectures. In the future the team hopes the platform will also function as a data bank for innovation in SynBio, ideas and problems that the population is concerned with as well as suggestions. The platform would be open to everyone as a way of communication between the general public and scientists focusing on the general public’s needs.

Method
An overnight culture of E. coli transformed with BBa_K1486056 (named CpxR-IFP) or BBa_K1486013 (named IFP-neg) was prepared in 5 ml LB supplemented with chloramphenicol and inoculated with cells from fresh agar plates. The culture was incubated at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm. The following day the overnight culture was diluted 1:100 in 5ml fresh LB + chloramphenicol and grown for 4 hours at 37° C on a rotary shaker to reach an OD of ~0.6.
1.8 ml of the culture was then diluted in 1.2 ml arabinose 20% (final concentration of 8%) and grown for 2 more hours. 1 μl of biliverdin hydrochloride 25 mM in DMSO was added and thoroughly mixed until homogenization. The culture was grown for 4 more hours, then centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in either 320μL PBS or 320μL PBS + 80 mM KCl and aliquoted into a white 96-well plate in triplicates.
Once the difference in intensity between stressed and non-stressed cells on the plate reader was high enough, cells of each batch were taken from one well and transferred on the microfluidic chip as shown below.
Cells were scanned after 20 min using a Cy5 filter.

The ratio of fluorescent cells was calculated on 5 chambers for each batch using ImageJ (the total number of cells was measured on brightfield images). The mean and standard deviation of these ratios were then calculated for each batch and represented as shown below:
Interpretation
This experiment shows that it is possible to detect IFP complementation following KCl stress on-chip, which is the prerequisite for further on"

Styczynski Lab at Georgia Tech
Our iGEM team was inspired for our project by the work in the Styczynski Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Professor Styczynski and his graduate students, Monica McNerney and Daniel Watstein are currently working on engineering a zinc biosensor.  (Watstein, McNerney and Styczynski 2015) Their use of the violacein and carotenoid pathway as a biosensor for zinc micronutrient deficiencies led us to investigate other visual detection sensors.  Chromoproteins from the Uppsala 2013 collection seemed to be a natural place to start.  The Endy Lab and Edinburgh's 2014 projects into ""degrons"" or degradation tags were also inspirations for our project.
In addition, Dr. Styczynski and Monica McNerney have been mentors and advisors to us. They have met with us multiple times to revise our project and troubleshoot issues both in person and by Skype calls. Dr. Styczynski has also generously provided materials that a high school lab does not have access to, and has periodically allowed us use of his lab for training and use of specialized equipment. We could not have completed our project without this collaboration!
Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
In order to further understand the impact of our project, we discussed micronutrient deficiencies with Dr. Ralph Whitehead, a researcher from the CDC. During the interview we asked questions about micronutrient  deficiencies in multiple regions around the globe. The insightful answers gave us a better understanding of the micronutrient problems that affect different areas. Micronutrient deficiencies are often unspecified through different regions because micronutrient amounts available in the soil can vary between agricultural fields within the same village. He shared the specific process of blood analysis for micronutrient amounts. He also named other organizations that are working on the development of a household indicator for blood analysis. The process from blood sampling to results and actions to resolve the deficiencies can take weeks and has enormous resource costs. The blood samples must stay refrigerated and travel long distances to clinics or labs. The results of the tests then needs to be delivered back to the patient and caretakers. Dr. Whitehead also touched on the CDC’s specific process"

Cell Division Rate
We have assume the period of cell division is 30 mins, which means the ""degradation rate"" in our model is actually the sum of degradation rate of the substance(1/half life) and cell division rate(1/30 mins).
Degradation of mRNA
From Ref1(Belasco 1993) and Ref2(Genome Biology 2006, 7:R99), we have decided that all the mRNA in our system have a half life of 4.4 mins.
Modeling - T3 RNA polymerase
We have construct two models, the difference of which is in the AND Gate 2 module. In this section, we'll demonstrate the parameters of our first model, in which T3 RNA polymerase mRNA with amber mutation and Aa-tRNA cooperate to produce T3 RNA polymerase protein.

Schoolfellows took care of the situation of scientific research and were willing to learn the creative works from students. We set an introduction station to demonstrate what we did this summer. We also took Bio101 in this display to let visitors have a try. Most visitors were professional, so our topic of communication was well over our project. We discussed the synthetic biology development trend, we compared electronic computer with biological computer. Schoolfellows said that not only our project but also DNA information storage system could represent a brand new field, which had huge potential and wide prospect.
Fig.15.A visitor is trying our software.
In the 60-year-old celebration, we showed iGEM, our achievement and the burgeoning subject of nowadays technology. Facing the smile and affirmation of school fellows, we felt what we did was so meaningful. At the same time, we hope our partners in UESTC can be on the way for the palace of scientific research all along.

The cost of a false positive was taken as the cost of a contrast enhanced chest CT scan (£359 [19] ), plus the cost of the test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110) as it would be done for 6 years - as that would be the follow up of a positive result of our test. We assumed that all patients with a false positive would subsequently have their cancer ruled out by a CT. Previous screening trials have showed that other procedures are needed, sometimes bronchoscopy, or a false positive proceeding all the way to surgery and treatment. However, we believe a CT in combination with our test would rule out nearly all false positives (especially if several miRNAs were used in tandem to look at the properties of the ‘tumor’ in a subsequent test) - and the probability of a patient having further measures taken would likely be negligible. There is also no data available to quantify this additional cost.
The cost of treatment in stage 1 is £8000 and in stage 4 is £10,050. [19] We used the cost at stage 4 as the upper bound of the cost for stages 2-4. Similar to before, this is likely to decrease were a large scale screening trial to take place and figures for individual stages used - as cost of treatment in stage 2 is far lower than stage 4. [19] We assumed the cost of unsuccessful treatment in stage 1 was the same as the cost of successful treatment in stage one plus average cost of treatment in the other stages - as if treatment is unsuccessful in stage one, a patient is likely to have their tumor progress to later stages. The cost of treatment in stage 4 is not dependent on success as the treatment is just palliative care.
We ignored the cost of recurrence of a cancer - recurrences in cancer are complex and cannot be easily modelled. Furthermore, the earlier the cancer is detected, the lower the chace of recurrence. This means our sensor that can detect NSCLC at stage 1 would drastically reduce this cost.
As Tammemägi gave the probability of cancer in the next 6 years we calculated the cost effectiveness of screening each year for the next 6 years. Hence the cost of 6 true negatives is the cost of our test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110).
Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in"

Development of New Methods
Short summary
For our experiments, we developed two new methods which are potentially applicable for the analysis of experiments with most unnatural bases: The restriction enzyme based Mutational Analysis Xpolorer (M.A.X) and Oxford Nanopore sequencing of unnatural bases with the help of our software iCG. Both are comparably cost efficient methods that have the major advantage of enabling the direct analysis of mutational events in addition to the mere detection of unnatural bases. In our experiments, we showed that both methods are applicable for the analysis of experiments with the unnatural base pait between isoG and isoCm. Additionally, we analyzed the replication efficiency of this unnatural base pair with the help of both methods, showing that they produce similar results by orthogonal approaches.
Background: Detection of Unnatural Bases in DNA
When working with unnatural bases, one of the major challenges is the detection of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) in the DNA. For the analysis of UBP retention in vivo, in vitro replication and PCR experiments, it is mandatory to have a reliable method for UBP detection."

Further experiments, see below, were performed with some promising results. Besides, the presence of both plasmids in one cell was not confirmed.
Figure C. Preliminary synthetic transcriptional cascade test. The pictures were taken at 1) t=0 (IPTG induction, left tube in all images), 2) t=1h, 3)t=2h, 4)t=3h, 5) t=5h, 6) t=7h, 7) t=9h
Then based on the paper [ 10 ], which created a similar transcriptional cascade, we performed the fluorescence experiment in a 96 well plate reader with GFP specific filter. The results and discussion of that experiment are shown and explained in next section.
Fluorescence Experiments
The control organism developed for this experiment has two plasmids. One is plasmid 1 of negative cascade and other is a pLacI controlled GFP generator. Hence it resembles the negative cascade organism in all ways other than the cascade initiating gene (TetR). Even though our modeling showed that the delay time caused by the cascade is around 6 Hr 15 mins without leakage, at first we guessed that our delay device would cause only delay in less than 2 hours since we saw leaky GFP expression already in control colonies. Hence the fluorescent reading after IPTG induction (0.1mM and 0.2mM)(see for protocol here ) in the 96 well plates was taken only for 2 and half hours and the readings did not give promising results. With the help our supervisors to find which part of the growth curve are we in, we ran an overnight experiment and continued the same experiment for another 14 hours, giving a total of 16 and half hours.
The results for the positive control and negative cascade (experiment) are given in this xls attached here . The results were consolidated and shown in graphs below.

The selective filter is the central structure of the ion channel,which is also the narrowest part of the channel. Its amino acid sequence is TVGYG from77-79[1], which is the same in all potassium channels. The carbonyl oxygen atoms on the amino acid sequence point inward toward the ion channel and form four ion-binding sites on the potential energy.
After simulation,reading dissertation[2][3] and with the help of AEMD(Automation Enzyme Muatation Design) 链接From NPU , we decide to mutate Gly77 to D-Ala77.
The free enegy landscape of simulation progress about Na+ get through the selective filter shows that there is a energy barry when Na+ get through the site of Gly77.So the best way for us is to mutate the Gly77.
We don't make a great change on the filter or the narrow may fatally expand that loses the ability of specific selective. The side chain of Gly is -H(or it doesn't have side chain) ,the most similar group is -CH3 ,So we try mutating to Ala77 first. But the simulation told us that the methyl of Ala77 in each subunit would point to the centre of the narrow, which totally blocks the channel.
And alternative try is mutating to D-Ala,which is the same as Ala but chirality.The simulation is very successful and shows that the addition 4 methyls affect the structure of selective filter to have a 0.16A average displacement on the filter atoms.A profound change it brought is that the channel will keep open.
The other novel characteristic is that the new"

(D)Fluorescence microscope observation of the Jurkat T cells in image (B) co-cultured with 293T cells expressing cell surface-expressed GFP for 4 h.
Through fluorescence microscopy, we could observe that the suspended T cells emit green fluorescence, which is clearly distinguished from the weaker green fluorescence of 293T cells expressing surface-expressed GFP deposited at the bottom of the culture medium. The results show that TEV can relieve the inhibition of tetR on the promoter in 293T cells. It means that we have successfully verified the function of TEV - activated transcription system based on the modified tetR in eukaryotic cells and the results also confirm preliminarily that our upstream circuit can work normally. However, we have to admit that due to we chosed GFP as"

Sunday 12th June 10AM - Team brainstorm meeting
Most team members were present to brainstorm some more ideas we had come up with, to the rest of the team with some pizza added! We also had a final discussion about project ideas before we meet for PROJECT HACK day the following morning. Once we shared some of our ideas, we then discussed in greater depth our ideas we have come up with.
Monday 13th June-Project HACK day 1
All team members and post doctoral supervisors were then present to narrow down to one project idea from all the wonderful ideas we had come up with in the previous brainstorming sessions. It was here, where we decided that ageing was the theme of our project as all team members agreed that it's a promising and exciting area of research that hasn’t been explored by synthetic biology yet! We also collectively came up with a plan of what needed to be done by Thursday. This was to research in depth of some assays, specific enzymes in ageing pathways that we can use synthetic biology to tackle/solve.
Wednesday 15th June - Team research session
Most team members decided to meet to do some further research as a team on possible areas of ageing that we can focus on. Most team members shared  some exciting research, ideas and knowledge that they had researched the night before.
Thursday 16th June -  Project HACK day 2
After meeting with the team the day before, this was the day that the team members and the post doctoral supervisors met up to map out some experimental plans that would develop from the research we had done before. The team members also started to think about DNA and what parts/biobricks would need to be ordered.

Abbie, Kuba, Dale and Amandeep then met up after the training, to make a plan of what was needed to be done over the weekend by all team members and what we wanted to do next week (meet some internal deadlines). Part of this plan was to look into DNA sequences for assigned parts, start thinking about sponsorship and funding, those members that are not strong with HTML, would start to learn HTML basics and for members to start to think about populating the wiki page.

High Fidelity PCR
This PCR reaction was done to amplify sgRNA template for EPO. There are two different sgRNA that will target slightly different position of EPO cDNA. The two templates will be addressed as sgRNA for EPO1 and sgRNA for EPO2. To amplify  sgRNA for EPO1 and EPO2 (125bp), high fidelity PCR was done using sgRNA for EPO gBlocks as template DNA and either 033 and 034 or 035 and 034 as forward and reverse primers respectively. 2 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared for each amplification of sgRNA for EPO, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol. 1 50µl of PCR mixtures with no template and primer 035 and 034 were prepared in parallel for negative control.

The 2018 Southeastern iGEM Conference
Our team successfully hosted a web conference with 3 other iGEM teams from the Southeastern region discussing our projects, the iGEM experience, and the social challenges faced regarding genetic engineering in the South. The participants included The University of Virginia Team, The Washington University Team, The Liberal Arts & Science Academy (LASA) Team in Austin, TX, and The University of Tennessee, Knoxville Team. Each team practiced presenting their project and answered questions from each team. We discussed the challenges of genetic engineering and the methods used in our research. We discussed our community outreach efforts and events we participated in such as the Ask A Scientist event where we performed demos and discussed involvement in the science community. Each team provided their own useful insight on different aspects of their iGEM experience. The University of Virginia team provided us with insight on making a successful wiki. The LASA team felt that an effective way to find funding was seeking out businesses you had a personal connection to. The Washington University team discussed the importance of outreach and explained what a member had learned traveling with Engineers Without Borders. We also held a guided Q&A session.
Questions asked to each team:
As a research team, what roadblocks have you faced so far in the research process?
What funding challenges, if any, have you all faced as a team, and what strategies have you taken to fund your team so far?
In what ways do you think synthetic biology and the STEM field in general can be improved in the southeast region? In what ways do you all think outreach can play a role in helping this region be more accepting of synthetic biology?
How has the iGEM experience helped you current or past members in their career development?

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html,"PPTase and T-domain Interaction Strongly Influence the Yield of Indigoidine Production
As the previous experiments of shuffled T-domains and different combinations of PPTAses showed, there are substantial differences in cell growth and indigoidine production when observed on plates. However, this observations were always of qualitative nature and did not give any insight into quantitative differences. We approached the quantification of indigoidine production in a time-resolved and highly-combinatorial manner: plasmids coding for indC containing all synthetic (4) and native T-domains (3) proven functional by the previous assays were co-transformed with the four functional PPTases. The indigoidine production over time (30 hours) was measured at its absorption maximum of 590 nm and corrected for the contribution of the cellular components in the medium as described in the methods. As Figure 10 shows, synthetic T-domains in combination with different PPTases lead to distinct differneces in indogoidin production. As a comparisons between the left and right panel of Figure 10 shows, PPTases working best with one T-domain might not lead to any indigoidine production when used with a indigoidine synthetase containing a different T-domain (Figure 10, pink line, delC). In addition, as distinctly visible in Figure 11, indigoidine production over time is not a strictly monoton function (blue line). After an indigoidin production peak at 16 hours, indigoidine production caused by indC containing the synthetic domain 4 decreases again. The indigoidin production in cells transformed with indC/synthetic T-domain 3 is still increasing.
Figure 6: Comparison between different E. coli strains and PPTases:      a) Comparison of different E. coli strains examining growth and indigoidine production The figure shows five different strains of E. coli that have been co-transformed with an indC expression plasmid and a sfp expression plasmid. The negative control is E. coli TOP10 without a plasmid. All transformants have been grown on LB agar for 48 hours at room temperature, cells were not induced. One can see that even without induction all strains express the indigoidine synthetase and produce the blue pigment indigoidine. However, the strains BAP1 and NEB Turbo grow faster in the first day, exhibiting a white phenotype (data not shown). Colonies on the plate of E. coli TOP10  are very small and dark blue/"

Background
In order to fulfill the requirements of testing diseases at home for patients instead of going to                         hospital tested by high-tech testing equipment. We designed our products which can upload                         grayscale data to the cloud and analyze it through mobile devices obviously. What we required is                         just a liquid crystal detection scheme, which is sufficient to reflect the change in                         β2-MG                         concentration.
The main purpose of our experiment is to prove whether the change in β2-MG                         concentration in the                         home test box (Dr. Familict) can be reflected in the liquid crystal through a noticeable gray                         scale change. Therefore, we have constructed a molecule that is more suitable for the liquid                         crystal detection system based on the nano-antibody, a competitive combination which can disturb                         the liquid crystal to change the gray level of the image.
We designed a competitive binding method : First, immobilizing a certain amount of β2-MG                         in a                         liquid crystal, and then combining the test solution with an excess of Nanobody. The mixture is                         then added to the liquid crystal, and due to the excess of the Nanobody, the excess is bound to                         the immobilized β2-MG, causing perturbation of the liquid crystal. Since the fixed                         β2-MG is a                         certain amount, the amount of β2-MG in the liquid to be tested can be calculated by                         the                         difference method. However, during the experiment, we found that the nano-antibody itself has                         little disturbance to the liquid crystal, so we hope to construct a more interfering molecule                         based on the nano-antibody. At the same time, we tested the effects of different β2-MG                         and                         nanobody concentrations on liquid crystal perturbations, and hope to find a set of solutions                         with the most obvious gray scale changes.
Experiment
Our experiments are mainly divided into two parts: molecular biology experiments and liquid                         crystal experiments.
We obtained nano-antibodies with aldehyde groups by adding aldehyde-based labels to                         nano-antibodies and by FGE treatment. After that, we added C18 to the Nanobody to enhance its                         interference. Finally, we verified that the interference of the antigen concentration on the                         liquid crystal can be detected.
In the molecular biology sector, we planned to connect a long-chain molecule (C18) on the                         nanobody in order to increase the interference of nano-antibodies on liquid crystals.
Firstly, We constructed two plasmids, p"

September 1st
show technical details
We ran a PCR for amplification of pC13Y, pC13BQ, pC13BR, and pC13CD to put between the lox sites. The PCR products were then cleaned and quantified. We redid the ligation of pC13D with pC13CJ to form pC13CK. We electroporated the ligation into DH5a. We miniprepped the pC13BN 2 cultures. We then ran a Vent colony PCR of pC13CB colonies 1-5. We also grew up 5ml cultures of pC13CB colonies 1-5 and left them in the incubator overnight. We finished our attempt at protoplasting G. lucidum with the help of members of the Turgeon lab, with hygromycin as our selection marker, and we left the plates in the Turgeon lab incubator.  We then combined our three blended cultures and blended again to make a new culture for tomorrow. We planned out a protoplasting schedule for this week to try running the protocol under different conditions since it takes a long time to get results. We believe there might be bacteria growing in the fungal cultures we are using for protoplasting since phosphinothricin does nothing to bacteria and we could not blend the fungi under sterile conditions. We will put ampicillin in later cultures to kill bacteria, which shouldn’t affect G. lucidum because only bacteria will have peptidoglycan cell walls. We did a PCR clean up for pC13A. We ran a digest screen for pC13I, pC13AF and pC13CV, but only pC13AF (colony #2) appeared to work. We then ran a PCR with Vent for pC13I, pC13AF, pC13CV and pC13L, but they all failed…
We are putting PgpdA with geneticin resistance, PtrpC with geneticin resistance, and PtrpC with hygromycin resistance between the lox sites. We miniprepped pC13BN. A Vent colony PCR of pC13CB colonies 1-5 was run to confirm successful cloning. We finished our attempt at protoplasting, once again unsuccessful, likely due to contamination on the fungal cultures. We ran a digest screen for pC13I, pC13AF and pC13CV"

I’m a junior pre-medical and Biomedical Engineering student, so I’m both bossy and boring, which I’ve found tends to work out really well in social settings. I’ve been interested in playing with biology ever since I learned as a child that jellyfish could use their bodies to produce light and poison people, neither of which I could do at 5.
At 19 I still can’t produce light or poison people, but my interests are a bit more benign now, so it isn’t such a disappointment. I am particularly interested in gerontology, end of life care, and psychopathology, and on the lighter spectrum of things I enjoy rainy days, soft cookies, and ballet.

I have been interested in genetic engineering since I was 8, when I read a relevant article in a copy of TIME for Kids in the back of my grandma’s car on the way to go see a movie.
Since I never shut up about space and AI technology, my friends often wonder why I’m not pursuing one of those fields instead. If I were pursuing one of those fields, I’d probably never shut up about genetic engineering.

Using the cells containing Bba_J45700, some of our team members did a smell test, to see whether the production of methylsalicylate was significant, since methylsalicylate has a wintergreen scent. Plate C was the one containing these cells. These are the results, “-“ meaning no difference in scent compared to the control, “+” meaning a difference in scent compared to the control. As can be seen, plate C is chosen only a few times. The brick might need some improvement, for example by using stronger promoters and ribosome binding sites. So we will reconstruct Bba_J45700 by taking out the useful pieces and putting them back together with other parts.

In order to get pchBA and bsmt1 out of the original brick, a PCR on pchBA and bsmt1 is done. The fragments are cut with EcoRI and PstI, ligated in pSB1C3 and transformed.
22/07 – 26/07
Week 4: aroG, bsmt1 and pchBA, the holy trinity.
Last week’s transformation failed, so we did PCR purification to make sure that all the small fragments were gone. The transformation was repeated.
To improve the production of methylsalicylate, we wanted to improve the production of chorismate, a precursor of methylsalicylate. The product of aroG is an important enzyme in the production of chorismate. We first wanted to isolate this aroG, and then mutate it to make it insensitive to negative feedback from phenylalanine.
We did a colony PCR on 4 random DH5α, to amplify aroG.
Fragments were all around 1000 bp, as expected.
Restriction with EcoRI and PstI, ligation and transformation.
Our transformations for aroG, bsmt1 and pchBA were all succesful. To check whether the genes were actually inserted into the plasmids, we did a colony PCR on all"

For our lysis buffer it should be high salt (100-150mM), pH balanced (around 7-8), can add some glycerol or other stuff too
we can add some EDTA too but then we need to buffer exchange it before we load it onto the Ni column
We can use the french press or sonication (just ask him for help or training). They also have like a fancy french press we can use which he recommended if we use a machine for lysis
you still need the lysis buffer for this tough
Purification
we can use our gravity column with an IMAC resin and that's fine
we need to store our protein in a buffer that's not super high salt
so we can elute, dialyze or buffer exchange
the lysis buffer can be the same as the initial buffer for the column though the lysis shouldn't have any imidizole
if that column doesn’t work well we can ask to use his HPLC machine
they will run it for us
we need to provide the sample (1-10mL for SEC)

Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.

Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

In March one of our iGEM team members was taking over our university’s official Instagram page @unitartu stories in order to show what it means to be a synthetic biology student. During the take-over project we introduced the Institute of Technology, science student life, synthetic biology and iGEM, including our iGEM labs and team.
In the beginning of April our team leader and primary PI visited Engineering - Linguistic Gymnasium in Pskov, Russia, in order to host a lecture about the innovative science fields. Students were really motivated and actively participated in discussion.
In the end of April our team was happy to educate Finnish career advisors on iGEM, synthetic biology and UT’s Science & Technology programme. The workshop we organized consisted of pipetting, PCR and analyzing DNA products on the gel!
Video for Estonian TV
In May we had an honour of being on a show of the local TV channel and represent our iGEM team, spill a sneak peek of our project’s idea, discuss science, its importance, development and our student life challenges.
Watch the show in Russian
In the beginning of May high school students from Tallinn visited our Instutute of Technology. We talked about study opportunities in English, how future scientists will look like, what skills they will possess! During meeting we introduced iGEM in general and discussed the idea of our team. After fruitful discussion pupils had a guided tour in the Institute building and got familiar with modern lab equipment!
In the middle of May our team gave a synthetic biology workshop to finnish journalists and young bloggers. We showed how to pipette, do the PCR mix, and analyse the results. We talked about modern world problems which synthetic biology is able to solve, introduced innovative Science & Technology programme and talked about how Tartu_TUIT team is trying to make the Earth a better place! It was very fun and encouraging!
The Wisdom Week
On the first day of September we organized an open-air workshop during which we introduced synthetic biology in play form! Participants got familiar with synthetic biology principles, methods of working with DNA and our iGEM team’s this year project: Production of eco-friendly sunscreen components; toxicity of modern sunscreens - marine life damage. We offered various activities for kids, teenagers as well as adults!

We also looked deeper into the real environmental sustainability of our proposed methods of materials production.   We met with representatives from Mango Materials, Stanford’s Civil and Environmental Engineering department, the Joint BioEnergy Institute, World View, and Genentech, among other groups, to help us develop a clearer understanding of whether and how our biomaterials might provide “cleaner” alternatives to traditional manufacturing materials.  Hopefully our published findings will help inform other student teams’ critical perspectives on synthetic biology’s contribution to environmental sustainability.
•Education and Public Engagement - Required link: https://2016.igem.org/Team:Stanford-Brown/Engagement
We hosted teaching events at Bay Area and New York Maker Faires, where we held interactive activities that demonstrated the importance of utilizing synthetic biology in society. These activities were aimed for wide ranges of both age and experience levels with synthetic biology; children, parents, and other biology teachers all gave positive feedback on our educational activities. Through explaining physical models of DNA helices, teaching parents how to do fruit DNA extractions with their children, and explaining our summer work in an easily digestible manner, we were able to make synthetic biology concepts tangible and enjoyable to the several hundred thousand attendees at the faires. To further expand upon our synthetic biology teachings, we also created an interactive crowdsourcing board regarding the field’s applications, where we asked participants how a biologically synthesized balloon would best be used.
•Model - Required link: https://2016.igem.org/Team:Stanford-Brown/SB16_Modeling
In order to augment our capabilities within the lab, we used mathematical modelling to get our bioballoon off the ground. Our model simulates balloon payload and flight capabilities in various atmospheric conditions with the ability to modulate membrane material, mass, gas production, and other balloon features. Earth allows us only a small range of the atmospheric properties necessary to fly an exploration balloon in a habitat like Mars; simulation is necessary to predict the behavior under the extremes. Modelling also played a smaller role in the metabolic engineering of the Shikimate pathway in Escherichia coli for para-aminobenzoic acid and melanin production for UV protection and kevlar polymerization. Using elementary flux analysis, we were able to get a better understanding of E. coli production methods and examine the effects of knocking out certain genes to increase pABA production.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," into account the raw data, we can estimate for the majority of our biosensors that if D-Psicose concentration is above 10 mM, a 6 hours incubation after induction would give relevant results.
Basal Expression
All the biosensors show a basal expression between 200 and 1800 arbitrary units of fluorescence at 9 hours post-induction. This basal activity even without psicose in the media is due to the imbalance between the amount of PsiR transcription factor available and the pPsi promoter strength. Even when PsiR is produced, the transcription factor can’t totally prevent the transcription from happening. Biosensors with low basal activity are also the ones with the worst sensing abilities. Since we care more about fold change than absolute value of fluorescence, basal activity won’t be a criterion of choice in selecting the best biosensor.
Dynamic Range
Determining the dynamic range of our biosensors will give us an estimation of their sensitivity, their maximum and their potential use. What we can observe in figure 3 is a rising curve from 1 mM to 300 mM. This gives us two important pieces of information:
First, the results show that all PsiR seems to interact with psicose behaving as predicted for all species. Similarly for the pPsi promoters, even for pPsiTacI, that seems tightly regulated by PsiR under psicose induction, all behaving as predicted.
Second, the dynamic range of the biosensors is very similar for every one of them, and appear to go from 1 mM to 300 mM psicose. Given that, we could use any of them in real applications for our bioscreening protocol to assess the production of psicose ranging from 1 mM to maximum 300 mM.

The graph shows all engineered biosensors in one plot with the mCherry measured florescence over psicose concentration in the media. Each data point is the mean of two of technical duplicates and of three biological triplicates.
Each biosensor show a particular fold change and linearity profile :

Recent research has demonstrated that certain enteric microorganisms have important influence on female hormone metabolism. The project will utilize macro genome sequencing and designing animal experiments to confirm the strain regulating estrogen levels significantly, and then we screen them in intestinal tract and enlarge cultivation, using the microfluidic technology made into candy (confection). By taking the candy, menopausal female can improve intestinal microbial environment to adjust estrogen levels, thereby mitigating a series of symptoms caused by sharply drop of estrogen after menopause.
Design and Application of Mask for Acne Treatment
This research is aimed at solving the acne problem, which usually appears in adolescents. When sebaceous glands secret too much grease and can’t eliminate it in time. Then the grease will block pores and the bacteria which parasite in the pore cells will propagate quickly. Especially one kind of them named Propioni-bacterium acnes, their mass propagation will induce immunoreaction, and excessive immunoreaction will lead to inflammatory. We add the gene of cecropin P5 into the yeasts’ genome, to restrain the growth of the Propionibacterium acnes and reduce the secret of inflammation factor. In order to solve the problem that the Cecropin is too big and can’t permeate through cuticle, we link Cecropin with peptide chaperon TD1 to form a fusion protein which is more capable to permeate. The existence of too much oleic acid will induce the assembly of inflammatory factor, while the supplement of linoleic acid can reduce inflame-mation.
We want to design a kind of mask which consists of culture medium and reconstructive Pichia Pastoris. The reconstructive Pichia Pastoris has gene of △12 fatty acid desaturases with strong promoter, and itsω-3 fatty acid desaturases gene will be knockout by Crispr/Cas9. Thus, this kind of P.Pastoris can convert oleic acid into linoleic acid, and secret the product.

Analysis
In the early stages of our project, before we decided to proceed with our final “ kill Switch ” design, we had considered using Cre recombinases in order to disable our genetic circuit. We designed our plasmid and flanked it with two Lox-P sites, so that once Cre recombinases were introduced into the cell, it would excise the gene that was flanked between these two Lox-P sites ( figure 1).
Figure 1: Cre Lox system
In order to examine whether using recombinases was a viable option for our system we understood that modelling the mechanism was crucial. Unfortunately, such a model is extremely complex, and for lack of time and experience, was not feasible for us to create. Luckily, we discovered that Team Edinburgh UG , whose whole project was concerned with recombinases, had already created such a model. Team Edinburgh UG generously offered to help us model our system, and through intense collaboration and specific modifications to their original model, we managed to attain informative results that shaped our decision regarding which “kill switch” mechanism to use.
We modelled two different processes:
Cells transiently transfected with our ToleGen plasmid, assuming a copy number of 20.
Cells with stable integration of our ToleGen construct, this means a copy number of 1.
This allowed us to analyze how the Cre system would function in our lab as well as in future in-vivo applications.
Lastly, we analyzed two Cre delivery systems:
Where Cre enzyme is taken into the cell directly through endocytosis
Where a Cre-enzyme producing plasmid is taken into the cell
Assumptions
Homogeneous mixture assumed throughout (e.g. if Cre molecule number is set to 100 at time = 0, it is assumed that the 100 Cre molecules are dispersed evenly inside the compartment regardless of its delivery method).

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," precision upon deposition of the material. At this point the material needs to form a  stable, solid structure,by cooling  it, or using UV light that chemically solidifies the compound.
Based on 3D printer general principles, we identified the following design requirements for the Biolinker:
- Liquid bioink
- Curing reaction to form a supporting scaffold
- Removable scaffold to obtain the final bacterial structure
- Cells need to survive every step of the entire process
- Sterile environment needs to be maintained at all time
From these points, we came up with a six step process to make a 3D biofilm!
How we print bacteria in 3D
Step 1: The first step already determines the outcome printing quality. The bioink needs to be deposited at the exact right spot to print a structure with high precision. Firstly, this depends on the precision of the motors moving the printhead across the stage. Secondly, it depends on the bioink itself. Its viscosity, flow rate and surface tension. Finally, the adhesive properties of the surface (in the following referred to as biopaper) upon which the material is deposited determine the outcome.
Step 2: By pretreating the biopaper with calcium chloride, the bioink is immediately exposed to free calcium ions upon deposition. This triggers the crosslinking of the alginate polymer to afford a stable gel. You can imagine this like spaghetti before and after boiling them. This step needs to take place as fast as possible to avoid liquid movements leading to unwanted losses in precision. Here it is important to ensure that both the liquid and gel form of alginate do not pose any harm to bacterial cells and that they are sustained with water and nutrients.
Step 3: Our cells are now trapped in a tangle of spaghetti. It’s time to start what they were made for: connect! Rhamnose induces the production of protein units CsgA which are exported out of the cell and self-assemble to form nanowires which connect the bacteria.
Step 4: Protein production and diffusion at the right place takes time. To create a strong interaction between cells, this step takes up to 24 hours. However, placing the biofilm into a 37 degrees incubator leads to the alginate gel drying out and eventually cell death. To prevent this, storage at room temperature was found as compromise.
Step 5: Now that a stable connection between cells has been established it is time to liberate the final product. To do so, the spaghetti tangle around the biofilm needs to go. Sodium citrate is used"

Light-Dependent Dormancy System
Dormancy Optimises the Efficiency of the Bacterial Solar Battery
Photosynthetic bacteria draw energy from sunlight to drive the fixation of carbon, implying that the bacteria are not able to carry out carbon fixation in absence of light. However, the bacteria constantly metabolise and the carbon fixed during time of exposure to light, will be used as an energy source for the cells. To circumvent this, a photocontrol system created by the UT Austin iGEM 2004 team was used in combination with the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system native to E. coli. In this way, a light-dependent dormancy system was implemented in E. coli.
The Photocontrol Device Mediates Light-Dependent Gene Expression
Plants and several photosynthetic microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria, contain signal transduction systems, which makes them capable of reacting to light Bussell AN, Kehoe DM. Control of a four-color sensing photoreceptor by a two-color sensing photoreceptor reveals complex light regulation in cyanobacteria. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2013;110(31):12834-9. . This ability gives the organisms the opportunity to adapt and optimise the regulation of their metabolic rate in response to sunlight. This property is achieved by photoreceptors incorporated in their plasma membrane, of which phytochromes are the most abundant and well described Vierstra RD, Davis SJ.

Several two-component signal transduction systems evolved in E. coli enables it to respond to various external conditions, such as osmotic stress, lack of metabolites and other external stress factors.

Table 2: The above table simply depicts information about possessors     of parts and their contact information and the popularity of the parts     for groups. Parameters heading, refers distinctive experimental details     unique to the usage of parts which should be decided by groups.
Second step for building the standardized template was to get the     phylogenic information about the parts development process which includes     the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.
Additionally, the “group favorite” and “starRating” fields are also     important for individual evaluation of the parts, which doesn’t get     the deserved attention from the iGEM groups. “Group Favorite” defines     the confidence on the part by the designer group. “StarRating” defines     the related part in terms of popularity and usage efficiency among the     groups. According to our observations, most groups are not aware of     either of the fields or they are used incorrectly or ineffectively.     For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and expected results the StarRating should be at least     2 stars, but for most of the parts in 2010 distribution, it is very     difficult to observe a part whose “StarRating” is above one. For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”
Second step for building the standardized template was to get the     phylogenic information about the parts development process which includes     the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted.

Education and Public Engagement
Introduction
Designing educational activities around synthetic biology is difficult because the field is new and interdisciplinary (Kuldell, 2007). Consequently there are a lack of standard principles and definitions, creating an enlarging division of knowledge between the general public and synthetic biology community which fosters generalisation and misconceptions. Bidirectional public engagement is necessary to help bridge this gap, and was therefore a key focus of our public engagement.
Summer School Engagement
A major reason for the gap is a lack of synthetic biology training of the young. To accurately tackle this problem we base our activities on learning objectives for MIT undergraduates training in synthetic biology (Kuldell, 2007) (Figure 1). Our approach means our educational activities are not generalised, true to core synthetic biology concepts, and encourage scientific thinking.
Not generalised
True to core synthetic biology
Encouraging scientific thinking
Although there are some excellent secondary education tools available (e.g. Biobuilder), we found that many of these require extensive access to lab equipment and expensive resources, creating a barrier to use in teaching. Therefore, our designed activities are low cost, require minimal materials and do not assume lab access.
Figure 1: Main outcomes of synthetic biology education and activities we designed to fulfil these
Our Activities
We carried out workshops at 3 different summer schools in Oxford: Northwest Science (students aged 17-18 yrs interested a broad range of sciences), Oriel College summer school (students aged 13-14 yrs interested in medicine) and UNIQ (academically selected state school students aged 17-18 yrs from state schools interested in biochemistry).
To meet these outcomes we designed a variety of activities including: a genetic memory computer lab, a bacterial photography system worksheet, an ethical washing line activity, and a 'Design your own biosensor' activity. These activities have been"

In conclusion of our project design, we test different binding domains of VEGF and D-Dimer by both BiFC and overall experiment. Also, we attempt to carry out in silico protein design to increase the binding affinity and prove its results in wet lab. Through all these experiments we are able to construct, test and optimise the STEP system, and make it ready for application in cancer cell therapy.
