Project Development
For our project this year we wanted to capitalize on our resources at Purdue. In addition to our strong engineering programs we have top agriculture programs and extension efforts. The biggest problem facing the agriculture today is Food Security; how will we feed 9 billion people by 2050?
We tackled this issue by talking with professors in our College of Agriculture. In one conversation with Dr. Camberato, of the Ag Extension office, we discussed soil management strategies and how a university like Purdue tries to educate local farmers about innovations that they have systematically tested. Farmers nowadays are in great need and are willing to try anything for consistent and high yield crops, so much so that Dr. Camberato estimated each farmer probably spends up to 10,000 per acre on unproven strategies simply as result of rigorous sale strategies on the part of companies.
One day while discussing the history of Ag extension, Dr. Camberato showed Peter Mercado a black and white picture of a child playing in soil that was taken from China in Lake Michigan. Dr Camberato then stated that this family was able to increase the size and percent yield of their crop by supplementing their natural soil with the  foreign soil taken from a ship. Curious as to what properties of the soil were able to accomplish this; we did more research and found that the likely culprit was probably microbes.
We decided to talk to Dr. Nakatsu, a microbial soil ecology expert, and realized the great diversity and ability of microbes to aid plant health. However given the enormous diversity and competition in naturally occurring soil, how would we go about managing the complexity? Could we benefit plants with just one microbe or a cocktail?
We dived into the literature on the rhizosphere and the use of"
ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," a startup biotech company and discussed with him if MicroBeacon would be a promising business idea .
We talked to a patent expert and learnt about patents in general and discussed about what parts of our system would be interesting to patent.
We collaborated with the team from Stockholm by testing their constructs .
We contributed to the Newsletters from Amoys team , met with the Darmstadt team , conducted a survey together with the EPFL and provided Colombias team with protocols and troubleshooting advice for their transformations.
Medal Criteria
We registered for iGEM, had a great summer so far, and now we are looking forward to attending the Giant Jamboree!
Going for it!
We completed and submitted the Judging Form.
We created a description of our project in time.
We documented all the parts taken from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts , of which two ( BBa_C0160 and BBa_K822000 ) were redesigned and newly characterized.
We are going to present a poster and give a talk at the Giant Jamboree.
Going for it!
We created this website for you to learn about every aspect of our iGEM project.
We documented and submitted two new basic parts to the iGEM parts registry and created a part collection with 13 parts.
These 13 new parts for our parts collection we also submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We characterized two newly designed hybrid promoters and were able to show that one of our combined promoters, Plac-lldR ( K1847010 ), reacts in a clear AND gate fashion to a combination of lactate and IPTG. To our knowledge, combining these two elements has never been attempted before.
Our Human Practices Efforts:
We visited two different elementary schools, thaught the children about what DNA is, performed experiments with them and published an article about it in the local newspaper .
We informed the ETH-student magazine polykum about iGEM and gave an interview .
We contributed to the Newsletters from Amoys team , met with the Darmstadt team , conducted a survey together with the EPFL and provided Colombias team with protocols and troubleshooting advice for their transformations.
More Human Practices Efforts:
We interviewed many different experts from various fields: medical doctors , an expert from the ethics commission of the ETH Zurich , the founder of a startup biotech company as well as an expert in patent law and integrated their advice and ideas into our project design .
We collaborated with the team from Stockholm by testing their constructs .

We received an email from the ambassador of IGEM to North America; Minaal Zahadi, who introduced us to the IGEM team Bio Without Borders. We have had a great experience with them, exchanging knowledge and information including Questionaires about their project. We had several skype chats through which we communicated and got assistance in beating some deadlines especially those where we were naive.Thanks to this great team and we hope to meet them in Boston.
2. UMarryland IGEM 2018
After finding out that we were doing a similar project , UMarryland reached out to us to get to know how we could be of help to eachother. Through the collaboration, we have managed to do a lot especially  in our labwork. They promised to test our results using their Biosensor and an Electron microscope which we are looking forward to.
3. Queens IGEM Canada
This great team participated in the competition for the Opentrons OT-2 robot and were also among the lucky 10 teams to win it.After getting to know about this, we got in touch to get to figure out how we could run the protocol. In addition to this, they helped us out in the interlab study and also getting round some of the road blocks on the wiki.
4. IGEM Tec-Monterey, Mexico
This was one of our first Team collaborations we had. We engaged in a number of skype calls and emails exchanging knowledge on how to go about with our project. Since this is our time, we wanted to utilize this opportunity to gain more information about IGEM particularly about the IGEM Jamboree. Through this collaboration we have learned a lot.

TAS_Taipei,2018,Team:TAS Taipei#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," also said that current statistics show that drunk driving is the largest alcohol-induced problem, and not the deficiency. He went on to say that the deficiency might even be a form of protection as people are likely to drink less because of their flushed symptoms.
We asked about the possibility of ALDH2 tests being covered by health insurance, but Dr. Lee believes that since the flushing symptoms are so apparent, there is no need to advocate for the test. He says that since the deficiency is not a “sickness,”, confirmatory diagnostics are not required.
When presented with results from our survey, Dr. Lee does realize that current health education programs are in need for reforms, and that maybe “greater implications” exist regarding alcohol ingestion. We also wanted to see if our product has the potential to be covered by insurance, unfortunately, he said only prescription drugs can be covered.
ALCOHOL WARNING LABELS
Current Practices and Policy Brief
Concerned about the large ALDH2 deficient population in Taiwan, we tried to look for policies aimed to educate the public about alcohol consumption and their ramifications on health. We found that little attention has been paid to this matter in terms of policy and regulation. For example, unlike cigarette health warning labels, alcohol products lack similar rigid health-oriented labels, despite having similar detrimental impacts on health. We also surveyed several alcohol manufacturers on their labeling practices and looked at alcohol warning labels at supermarkets and convenience stores. Only about half of the labels directly linked excessive drinking to negative health effects.
We looked at alcohol warning labels (boxed in yellow) in a convenience store, and found that less than half of the products (in this picture, only 2 out of 9 labels) mentioned health risks associated with alcohol consumption. Furthermore, these labels blend in with the product labels and are very small in size--current regulations only require warning text to be larger than 2.65mm in size.)
Using tobacco regulations as a model, we composed a policy brief with suggestions for modifying current alcohol labeling practices. We seek to inform more people about the health effects of excessive alcohol consumption. (Policy Brief by Iris H.)

Canadian iGEM Newsletter
This year, the iGEM Calgary 2017 Team set a goal to increase collaborations amongst teams across our country and did not limit ourselves to teams from iGEM. During our journey, we reached out to many organizations as a part of our public outreach. For more details, please visit our Engagement page. To help promote communication between teams, we pioneered the first Canadian iGEM Newsletter. The purpose of this initiative was to foster an avenue through which teams can share their project updates and seek collaborative assistance. Because this newsletter was distributed by all participating teams, universities and public communities across Canada can be engaged. Additionally, we increased public awareness of iGEM and synthetic biology.
Canadian iGEM Newsletter Volume 1 Issue 1
Wet Lab Collaboration
Through the connections we made in the process of publishing the Canadian iGEM Newsletter, we were able to connect with the iGEM McMasterU team. One of their team members, Dhanyasri Maddiboina, had an internship in Calgary this summer. Our team was able to meet with her, and together we brought a between these two collegiate teams to fruition. This year, the iGEM McMasterU team is working on a project called Glowzyme, a fluorogenic DNAzyme that cleaves RNA and detects pathogens. As a proof of concept, they synthesized a DNAzyme that fluoresces when E. coli is present. Because our bioplastic synthesis system utilizes E. coli on Mars, the DNAzyme may be integrated into our containment system as a method for containment. By assessing the possibility of incorporating the DNAzyme into our system, we can evaluate the properties of the DNAzyme and provide possible areas of improvement to iGEM McMasterU . Check out their Collaboration page here .

More than filling the requirements and essential preparations, we could deeply communicate about difficulties in running such a big project by our own as a student. Especially in the sense of handling a whole project, we discussed about how Korea_U_Seoul is dealing with our own team management and organization. Dividing team into smaller groups and having weekly communication session where each group exchange their group’s progress could harden the teamwork and help Korea_U_Seoul to be a long-lasting team, which was the most important thing in overall.
2. Experimental exchanges
The members of KoreaSonyeodul came to our lab to look around and have a meeting with our PI. They consulted us about their project, and we helped them to schedule their experiments. Since they did not have their own lab, they shared the lab with us. They never had any experience with lab work such as cloning, so we taught them how things are done. We taught and helped with their part cloning(Restriction enzyme cloning) and LIC cloning. We also helped the with their part registration and submission.

Duesseldorf,2016,Team:Duesseldorf#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," group of about 20 healthy patients who have to be volunteers. To enlighten them and keep them informed is one major task. It is very important that they know that they are able and allowed to quit the study anytime.
Some medicaments skip this phase as it would be inconsiderate to treat healthy human beings with chemotherapy or other active substances which are toxic. Imagining that our project would successfully make it out of the preclinical phase we would not apply our therapy on healthy patients as there is no malignant tissue which would be irradiated.
The second step of the clinical phase would be within a group of about 200 sick patients. This is the so called therapeutic- exploratory stage which aims at detecting possible side effects and testing the actual efficacy. Additionally it has to be shown that this medicament actually is an improvement regarding other already existing medicaments. This part can be a controlled study meaning that there is a control group which is given a placebo and compared to the other group.
If this stage is completed successfully the third clinical phase is ready to start. Its goals are basically the same as the ones in the second clinical phase but with a higher amount of patients which is about 1000. If all criteria, quality, efficacy and safety, are fulfilled, the medicament gets approved and it can be used as a regular therapy.
After it is available on the market, the fourth stage is the pharmacovigilance which means that side effects still have to be reported because some side effects are statistically so rare that they cannot be detected in studies with 10000 patients.
Throughout all the different steps, “good clinical praxis” which is very essential, is watched by different institutions. This means that everything has to be documented properly and fulfill the required criteria.
The Paul- Ehrlich- Institute is a federal institution which promotes quality, efficacy and safety of biomedical drugs through research as well as examination and is responsible for so called advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP). These ATMPs are defined as biomedical drugs which heal or prevent diseases by correcting, influencing or restoring physiological functions mainly through a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic effect.

ATMPs are divided into somatic cell therapeutics, biotechnological processed tissue products and, relevant to us, gene therapeutics and are subjected to special regulation. Therefore the process of getting a legal authorization is different regarding certain aspects. For example the toxicity tests are not"

Collaborations
Whoever has experience in lab works acknowledges that experiment is a process accompanying with hardships and depending on collaborations. Our team persists in building a good relationship and partnership with other teams and strengthening regional cooperation constantly. We have tight connections with both the HZAU-China and the HUST-China team based on the advantage of convenient geographical location. Besides, our team also collaborates with team Jilin-China on brick-building and we have established reciprocal relationship as well as the trust.
iGEM Team HZAU-China
We provided team HZAU-China two plasmids BBa_K1647006 & BBa_K769001 we work with to help them build the part, especially our photosensitive promoter successfully function in their program. https://2015.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Team/Attributions https://2015.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/OutReach/Collaboration
iGEM Team Jilin_China
We helped the team Jilin-China construct a part, which is used in their program, helping them deliver the plasmid timely. We gave them our last year's favorite part BBa_K1334002 , which is a regulator designed by Haoyuan Sun. In order to promote its utility, they repeated the experiments that we did last year and improved it. The promoter we offered them really helped a lot, they said. Meanwhile, we had a small gathering discussing some practical issues and exchanging ideas about team works. https://2015.igem.org/Team:Jilin_China/Collaborations

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Parts#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,",Sequence alignment of MerR and PbrR has been carried out. Previous work showed that MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at their metal binding domains (Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007), which implies that our strategies of bioabsorbent engineering might be applicable to other cases of heavy metals. We again design a single polypeptide consisting of two dimerization helixes and metal binding loops of PbrR, to form an antiparallel coiled coil MBP mimicking the dimerized metal binding domains of the wild-type as Figure(B) shows.Figure (C) shows that the MBP was constructed by fusing two copies of metal binding domain of PbrR in tandem via the same method with mercury MBP.

Symbols, descriptions and units in equation set (9).
Further analysis is unpractical when all these parameters are time-verifying, so we obtain the solution of equation set(9) at first, and reach the strict solution thereafter.
Lee and Bailey established a detailed model of plasmid replication [15] . The form of the model is too complex, but the result shows that the replication period is converged to be synchronized with cell cycle. Accordingly, we can assume that the growth rate of total number of plasmids is equal to that of cells:
\frac{{dn}}{{dt}} = \mu  \cdot n\quad(10)
Firstly, we discuss the solution of equation set (9) when μ is constant. The equations can thus be rewritten in a matrix form:
\frac{d}{{dt}}\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}                         n\\                         M\\                         I\\                         P                         \end{array}} \right) = \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}                         \mu &0&0&0\\                         {PoPS}&{ - {\gamma _M}}&0&0\\                         0&{RiPS}&{"
ZJU-China,2013,Team:ZJU-China#Project#TheGhostKit#GhostSensor_-_-_TEXT.html," team this year successfully built a universal protein detection platform based on the idea of aptamer-induced inner-membrane scaffold dimerization. In our project, we altogether used two sets of inner-membrane scaffolds as protein sensors. One is based on split GFP and the other is based on split β-lactamase.
Split TEM-1 β-lactamase
Protein fragment complementation assay is a widely used method for protein interaction detection. The two fragments of the protein is rational designed and based on protein interaction assisted folding. TEM-1 β-lactamase is relatively small and monomeric, is well characterized structurally and functionally, can be easily expressed, and is not toxic to prokaryotic cells. Furthermore, no orthologs of β-lactamase exist in many prokaryotes, and thus a protein fragment complementation assay based on β-lactamase could be used universally in prokaryotes without any intrinsic background activity. We split TEM-1 β-lactamase according to [4] into N-terminal consisting of a.a. 26-196 and C-terminal consisting of a.a. 198-290.
Diagram illustrating the split of TEM-1 β-lactamase.
(André Galarneau et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2002, 20, 619-22)
The activity of TEM-1 β-lactamase can be detected with a wide range of methods, such as simple colorimetric in vitro assays using the cephalosporin nitrocefin and assays in intact cells using the fluorescent substrate. There are also many commercial immune colloidal gold strips in China initially designed to detect β-lactamase in food and beverage. These strips are cheap, sensitive and robust, making them the ideal candidate for large scale applications.
Design
We try to detect thrombin as our proof-of-concept experiment. There have been two well characterized aptamers, one is 15-mer and the other is 29-mer, all show very high and specific affinity to thrombin. We then connected the two aptamers with different length of poly-T linkers, namely short and long linkers, to their 5’ end. At last, all aptamers were modified with 5’ biotin in order that they can bind to streptavidin.
We altogether used two sets of inner-membrane scaffolds, one was based on split GFP and the other split β-lactamase. Our inner-membrane scaffolds consisted of three fusion parts. The split"

As for the lecture on the third day, we told them more about what exactly Molecular biology is, and we invited a senior who had engaged in iGEM last year shared his experience and what he learned in iGEM. 
This activity gives middle school students a basic idea of Molecular biology. Moreover, it helps increase iGEM’s popularity as well. It is really killing two birds with one stone.

Elementary School Promotion
After S&T Month, we decided to extend our educate range to elementary school students. To let more people know the spirit of iGEM, we went to an elementary school, Chiao-Jen, to teach students there some basic concept of synthetic biology and introduce iGEM to them.
   We prepared a game for them and a bag of candy as reward, making it easier to understand what we want to express. Every team had one million dollars to invest in the genetically modified product. In the meanwhile, we mixed some fundamental idea of the synthetic biology into the game. Then, we explained the relationship between DNA and gene briefly. To our surprise, there was even a little boy asking us our opinion on GM foods! 
In this activity, we find It is the passionate interaction students react to you that what the most enjoyable moment of teaching is.  It was their passionate participation that made this activity succeed.

In order to know whether sweet foods are more favored by the public, we held an event in school, called “Drink sampling”. 
We made the statistic this way: We offered both sugar-free and sugary beverages. There were buckets placed beside each beverage pail. First, the participants were given two cups of drinks from each pail. They were asked to decide which one they like, and toss both of their cups into the correspondent bucket. At last, we sum up the cups in each bucket to find out the result.

SUSTC-Shenzhen-A,2013,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," are still in the spirit of helping the defectors, the dwindling population results in effective defects and cause the fast growth defector to lost Zeo-R protein and succumb to Zeocin, which leads to lost of both populations. This scenario is likely more realistic and happened in real life such as ecology and politics.
Scenario 3: no bad deed goes unpunished
If the both guy wants to take the advantage of the other guy’s sacrifice without giving back, they will end up receive harsh penalty and die off, although it is slower than the poor guy in scenario 2.
Oscillation and crush
The above scenarios assume both the prisoners have an identical physiological and psychological characters, meaning all the functions and parameters except for the defects/cooperates decision. According to this assumption, every cell can act the same behavior when meet the same change in the environment.  However in reality, two pieces of leaves will never coincide in the world, and two prisoners could have different personalities. In our system two type of cells use different quorum sensing system should have different parameters. What will happen if we put two people with different sensibility of other’s goodwill into this dilemma? To achieve this we simply adjust the Hill coefficient of the differential equation of Zeo-R. What we found is in the figure below.
There is appears a clear tug-of-war game between our prisoners. The oscillation gradually damped. Usually a damped oscillation leads to a stable equilibrium. To our surprise this oscillation results in crush at certain unpredictable time. Perhaps it could be used to explain realistic game theory scenario in action.

All of the constructs were expressed in high copy plasmid PSB1X3.
The transformed cells were cultured in 37℃, 200rpm.
 
We used fluorescence microscope to observe the fluorescence at 16h, and we also used Thermo Varioskan Flash to quantitatively measure the fluorescence intensity at 16h, 18h, and 19h, respectively. 150ul culture fluid was added into each well of the 96-well black plate to measure the fluorescence intensity, and OD600 were measured using spectrophotometer at the same time one by one to quantify the concentration of bacteria.
Each sample had three duplicates when cultured. And the fluorescence value was handled through mathematical method. The fluorescence intensity of above transformants was divided by the OD600 value and minus that of negative control.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2017,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"ciences, our team played a part in the establishment of an educational project the ""UNO Academy"" aiming to raise the young-generation's interest in science.
We arranged the initial meeting with the UNO Parks and later were invited to contribute to the creation of the ""UNO Academy"" - an interactive educational program for children aged 7 to 12 years. The program aimed to encourage toddlers to explore science through fun and interactive learning modules. ""UNO Academy"" included the STEAM fields - Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics. Its goal was to teach students to think critically and have not only an engineering but also imaginative and creative approach towards real-world problems while building on their current mathematics and science base.
We believe that synthetic biology requires boundless imagination. As it becomes limited with age and received knowledge, it is crucial to introduce the possibilities of synthetic biology to youngest-children-possible. Teaching how synbio allows the modifying of living organisms and creating new forms of life might result in their childish ideas becoming the most mind-blowing synbio discoveries in the future.
The Science part of the ""UNO Academy"" was introduced as an exhibition of arthropods. Having the main idea - to adopt nature to serve for human needs - of synthetic biology in mind, we created an exhibition of paintings of arthropods, that were depicted performing unusual, yet profitable functions. Children were invited to explore the unity and diversity of the arthropods as well as colour the paintings and draw their own creatures. The exhibition of paintings and other engaging activities gave the opportunity to teach young children about synthetic biology without stressing the complexity, however emphasizing its possibilities.
High Schools
We held lessons at more than 10 schools with an aim to spread the message about synthetic biology and iGEM all around Lithuania. Over 450 students attended our interactive presentations, where they could learn about the basic concepts of synbio, the competition and the future of science itself.
Former Vilnius-Lithuania teams had discovered that school children are often poorly informed and have a negative attitude towards science, so this year we realised the necessity not only to continue visiting Lithuanian schools, but also do it in a modern and engaging fashion. It is crucial to continuously excite students about life sciences and what possibilities they hold for them and the whole mankind in the future.
During the numerous lessons that the team members held, our main aim was to provide the students with basic knowledge about synthetic biology, genetic engineering and spark an interest in science. Thus, presentations about the principles, current applications and perspectives of these fields were given. In order to paint the whole"

It being the end of the work week and the lab closing on weekends, the students were not able to do overnights or anything requiring an extra day. Thus, the students started and finished the day checking to see if their “iGEM-Rhl” plasmid with the iGEM backbone grew up. There’s growth!” the students exclaimed as they opened their incubators and examined their plates.  As it turns out, there was growth on the “iGEM-RhlR” plates with chloramphenicol. The students knew for sure that their plasmid had been transformed correctly into the DH5a cells. Afterwards, the student had a quick meeting and final tune-up presentation before the Michigan State Meet-up.

The iGEM RX lab team began their day at UES where they continued to edit the presentation for the Michigan State meet up.  They also continuously practiced their presentation and their speaking abilities while the others gave helpful tips and suggestions.
Week 5
Monday (07/02/18)
Lab 1
It was another short day in the lab as the LabPat’s main focus today was just to grow up cultures of the “iGEM-RhlR” plasmid in DH5a cells. Their goal was to grow it up overnight, then perform a mini-prep to extract the plasmid in order to send it off for sequencing. After the labwork, the students contacted teams at University of Texas for collaboration, Wilbert from National University of Singapore for modelling, and the London School of Boys for Wiki Tips and Tricks.
Lab 2
To begin the week, the RX lab students began their day at UES.  At UES, they reviewed with Dr. Carter the presentation from the previous Saturday at the Michigan State Meetup.  At UES, they worked on improving the presentation and made a list of companies to start contacting as a means of aiding in the human practices category.  They then began to contact companies through phone calls, voicemails, and emails.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 Float Gas_-_-_TEXT.html,".
After waiting several days for the balloon to expand and re-reviewing existing literature, we realized that the latex balloon used, despite having a very thin membrane, would likely cause our hydrogen gas to preferentially compress within the flask over filling the balloon. As a follow-up test, we allowed our stock of C. reinhardtii to re-fill a flask with gas, and then conducted a simple chemistry test to see if we had been producing oxygen or hydrogen. [8] Our expectations were as follows: when introducing a lighted splint to our flask, contact with hydrogen gas would result in a loud and mildly violent ""pop"" noise, alongside the extinguishment of our flame. Contact with oxygen gas should produce the opposite effect of re-lighting our flint or strengthening the flame, as oxygen gas supports combustion.
Luckily, upon testing our splint with our flask of algae, a healthy ""pop"" noise was heard and our flame was extinguished. C. reinhardtii's ability to produce both oxygen and hydrogen gas is beneficial to a potential bioballoon because these two gasses can work as flight mechanisms in a variety of planetary atmospheres. For instance, Titan and Venus have denser atmospheres than Earth, making oxygen a viable gas candidate for flotation. Additionally, any method of producing oxygen gas biologically can be useful for astronauts and International Space Station workers as a life-sustaining substance. We'd call this subproject a success!

After dividing the class over several groups of interest, e.g. the Ministry of Health and Sports, Sport doctors, Athletes and Fans, they could discuss their opinions in the light of their interest group.
Subsequently, they had to come to a united conclusion with the aid of some text fragments selected by us to provide a broader focus. Below in figure 7, the template is displayed that the students used for recording their opinions.
Figure 7. The template on which students could add their arguments pro or con the statement “The goal of sports is to get the best out of people. Is science allowed to contribute to this in any way?”.
In setting up the lessons, we closely collaborated with Hannah Stammes from the education department of Delft University of Technology to have the most effective outcome of the debates. We followed the so-called 5E model. The five E's stand for Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate respectively. In the Engage phase of our visits we anticipated what we were going to do and made connections between the background knowledge of the students and the principles of gene doping and our detection device. Also, we evaluated the sports affinity of the class and made a link to sports events as the Tour de France that was upcoming.
After the Engage phase, the students could explore in their group discussion and source evaluation (Sources used by the students: fragments from “Topsport en gendoping: grenzen aan sport, opsporing en geloofwaardigheid” by Ivo van Hilvoorde and from “How Sports Would Be Better With Doping” from WIRED ). We walked around to train them to explain their arguments.
Subsequently, during the explain phase there would be a discussion between all groups representing the different stakeholders. Often, this plenary debate would be vigorous, with students passionately defending their opinions against their classmates.
Then, we would answer their technical questions and we would evaluate the students knowledge in turn. Interestingly, some students independently came up with challenges we faced. An example is the insertion of small introns that could make exogenous EPO e.g. harder to detect. This gave a good idea of their high conceptual understanding as well.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Freiburg,2013,Team:Freiburg#Safety#engineering life_-_-_TEXT.html," to the result that many of the movies showed the chances but also the risks of synthetic biology. Some aspects of mythology reappeared in the movies e.g. breathe life into a golem or opening Pandora's box .
In general, the risks always seemed to have a stronger effect on the audience than the benefits had. Furthermore, synthetic biology seemed to be connected with some kind of industrialization and a symbiosis of nature and technology. Regarding biosafety and biosecurity issues any genetic exchange between synthetic organisms and natural organisms should be prevented. Scientists support a clear separation of those, so that several approaches have been made. Here, xenobiological ideas e.g.  alternative sugar-backbones [1] or chlorouracil [2] in the structure of D(X)NA are worthwhile to mention.
The next day, on 27/9/13, genetically engineered machines were in the focus of the curriculum. During the discussion catchwords such as ""living machines"" or ""creating life"" arose which led to the question if mankind was simply imitating God or if creation was no divine prerogative anymore.
With these questions in mind the discussion went into a direction, where the role and the character of human beings were exposed in the light of synthetic biology. It was realized that within synthetic biology homo faber, a human that changes and modifies his environment, evolved to homo creator, a human that recreates his environment anew. With well-known literature at the back of their minds [3] the participants came to the result that synthetic biologists were still normal members of our society and their engineered machines not comparable to God's creation.
Despite, this led automatically to the question if we would be in need of new laws and limits in order to safe the original environment and to beware the society of a next generation of bioweapons. This was also the main topic of the last day of the seminar on 28/9/13.
Here, the panel discussion showed that differences in e.g. european and US-law make it difficult to assure the safety of the environment. Therefore, it was suggested that a global gremium should adjust international laws concerning biotechnology and synthetic biology. This reminded us of the dual-use debates following a moratorium of several scientists who were working with so called superviruses in 2012. During this debate Global Health Security Policy Board additionaly to the NSABB was recommended by several scientists and scholars.
Hence, a debate about Do-it-yourself biology and so called biohackers was initiated. Thus, the defintions of biosafety and biosecurity were elaborated referring to Kelle:

To better understand the ins and outs of our project and improve it we contacted many experts specialized in algae research field, legislations and ethics.  Indeed, as students we needed to learn more about the possible limits of our project, think of ways to overpass them and imagine how to make it be conformed with society, law and scientific community's expectations and requirements.

Interview
Hubert Bonnefond
Hubert Bonnefond: holds a Phd in oceanography and is the co-founder of a start-up called “Inalve”. The goal of his work is to naturally select ultra-productive microalgae strain to sell flour for animal feeding.
Interview:
Mr. Bonnefond believes that, in addition to the fact that GMOs are forbidden or partially forbidden in France, French people also have a negative vision towards them. For these reasons, he insisted on the importance of the safety of our microalgae cultures, as serious environmental concern could arise if our microalgae was to be released in the sea.
What we learnt and how we used it
Thanks to this interview, we conceived a safety system to prevent the release of our strain into the environment. In fact, we improved our photobioreactor design to ensure its closure and its sealing. We therefore moved forward from our initial photobioreactor 3D prototype  Newcastle helped us to design (see collaboration).
Theodolinda Fabrizi
Theodolinda Fabrizi: PhD student in water and environment law. She’s currently enrolled at the Doctoral School of International Law, European Law, International Relations and Comparative Law of the Panthéon-Assas University in Paris.
Interview:
During our interview with her, we talked about our project general feasibility, with for example the possibility to cultivate algae in sea water. She confirmed us that in legal term, it was impossible to free our modified microalg"

Figure 2: Plots of log [absorbance] (optical density) for cells with no colanic acid. Samples C1, C6 and C11 contain cells induced with colanic acid. The linear description stands for linear regression, which was used to estimate the growth rate for different pH values.
C1 growth rate:0.0034
C6 growth rate:0.0038
C11 growth rate:0.0028
Conclusion
On average, cell growth is slighly faster in the presence of colanic acid. However, this experiment will be repeated before the jamboree, to ensure that large variations in some cases are not due to faults in our plate reader.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-lys_-_-_TEXT.html," including that from the supernatant and pellet. Whereas the untransformed samples do not display protein bands of this size (lane 2 and 6). However, we also see that the uninduced samples (lane 3 and 7) show protein bands at 30 kDa. We think that the emergence of these protein bands could possibly be due to a leaky promoter of the T7 DNA polymerase in the E. coli BL21(DE3) system. It would be unwise to conclude that lysostaphin is more insoluble based on this result alone, as we acknowledge that in the pellet several more proteins are present many of which could have the size of 30 kDa. Additionally, the amount of protein loaded was determined only very roughly and was evidently higher for pellet samples.

Demonstrating bactericidal activity of Lys
To demonstrate that Lys had been successfully expressed in E. coli, we performed a modified Kirby-Bauer test of the cell lysate on E. coli TOB1, a biofilm producing strain. Any bacteriolytic activity from the cells lysate would imply that Lys has been expressed and it possesses its enzymatic activity.
Kirby-Bauer Test [✔️]
The figure below shows the Kirby-Bauer test that was done on MacConkey agar. Regarding the zone of inhibition observed, kanamycin, which served as a positive control, displayed the largest and most clear zone compared to the cell lysates. Induced cells from both the pellet and supernatant sample with 0.5 mM IPTG and 1.0 mM IPTG also showed zones of inhibition. The zones from induced samples were larger than that of uninduced samples.

1. LightOn switch with mcherry
    ECUST helped us test the feasibility of suicide system induced by visible light. Cells with light illumination all the time, with light illumination at logarithmic phase, with light illumination at late period and cells in dark are measured fluorescence intensity. Wavelength of exciting light is 587nm, and wavelength of emitted light is 610nm.

    The period starting light illumination doesn’t effect on the expression of mCherry, so no matter which growth phase bacteria is, the system can response.
    2. Verify the efficiency of toxin protein, mazF.
Figure 16.The lethal efficiency of mazF under different time and arabinose concentration
    According to the experimental results, we can know that mazF has a strong lethal effect. The death rate of E.coli connected with the concentration of arabinose. In the range of commonly used arabinose concentrations (5% to 50%), the higher the concentration, the more mazF expressed, resulting in more death of E. coli. Two hours after adding arabinose, E. coli had been efficiently inhibited.
Bromidrosis
    Overview: Aim at another stink caused by bacteria, the bromidrosis is also an unpleasant smell which bothers people around. Generally speaking, we try to realize that once people sweat, PLA will express to inhibit the bacteria under axilla. Reducing the stink and give off fragrance at the same time.
Salt and temperature
    Goal: In the bromidrosis part, several literatures mentioned that the salt concentration in people’s sweat is about 0.05 mM, and the temperature under the axilla is around 37 degree. We try to detect different GFP expression level by changing the salt concentration in medium and culturing temperature.     Reaults: 1. Verify the salt and temperature logical gate is working. 2. Quantitatively detect the fluorescence level of circuit.

Overview
This is a brief profile on the topic of synthetic biology in China. Information from reliable English and Chinese media was gathered from on-line sources. With the help of our Chinese teammates, information from Mandarin media was translated to English. The profile is divided into seven parts: SynBio map entries; iGEM competition; biotechnology market; biotechnology funding; regulations of synthetic biology; the perception of synthetic biology; and general information on leading institutes and organizations. We present information so that readers will be able to get an overall picture of the current situation and China’s efforts in promoting synthetic biology.
Synthetic biology in China is still in its infancy compared with other countries, e.g.: the United States (“Synthetic biology”, n.d.). Researchers and the government, however, have realized the importance of developing synthetic biology and are facilitating through various activities such as funding researches, and incorporating into government plans.
China’s impact on synthetic biology is small at present. In the future, however, the country plans to utilize its current technologies, such as genetic sequencing and recombinant DNA, to facilitate the field of synthetic biology (香山科学会议第322次学术讨论会综述, 2008). With technological advancement, independent innovation and thorough regulations are expected to support the development of synthetic biology in China.
Synbio Map
In 2009, the Synthetic Biology Project began mapping the research in the field of synthetic biology. As the field develops, this map expands in region and identifies companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in this emerging field.  This map is based on publicly available data from official websites, scientific literature, government reports and records, and newspaper and journal articles"

SCU_China,2013,Team:SCU China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," contained genes from both male and female gametes.
 
Simply, our project included differentiation from mature E. coli to gametes, conjugation between male and female gametes, which resulted in de-differentiation, and sex differentiation through plasmid incompatiblity.
 
Five systems in our design
 
Quorum Sensing system in high copy plasmid;
Controlled DNA Invertase device inserted into genome;
Real-time fluorescence reporters;
Three regulators and its responding promoters;
F  factor and its incompatible plasmid.
Quorum Sensing system
Functionality
This part was designed to sense the density of E. coli and to start gametogenesis at an appropriate time. So , it could imitate the growth and maturity of the animal.
 
Design
This part was constructed by assembling standard biobricks: BBa_F2622, BBa_C0261, and terminator  BBa_B0015.
In this part, luxr was controlled by inducible promoter R0010.
IPTG was added to the culture of G+/G- so that this part could work. And IPTG could be washed away to stop quorum sensing before mixing male and female gametes(quorum sensing would disturb conjugation between gametes).
 
Test
 
To test this system, we also insert a GFP after LuxI to detect the strength of luxpR and to report the time when cell density reaches the threshold.This was achieved by assembling BBa_F2622,    BBa_C0261, and BBa_I13504.
 
Achievements
We have constructed above two devices, however, sequence results suggested the whole devices except the first biobrick BBa_F2622 we used was right. Maybe some unknown problems came up when we transformed BBa_F2622 from the distribution kit.
 
 
Controlled DNA Invertase device insertted in genome
Functionality
This part was a crutial sysytem for our project since it was designed to control the differentiation from mature E.coli to gametes. This device used cre and flpe invertases, and could “invert only once at one time”. Moreover, it is reversible and could invert again after conjugation. Therefore, this part is very suitable for the control of differention and de-differentiation in our project.
 
Design
This part was derived from DNA Invertase Cascade (DIC) Counter (reference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690711/ ), and have been redesigned to be used in our system.
In this part, there were a reverse"

Reactivity Assay in vivo
Our fusion protein is constructed using GGGGS linker and EAAAK linker on a T7 vector. It is then expressed in $E. coli$ (BL21) under the IPTG inducer. We tested the results using the same method for NiR, which is using a chromogenic agent to show the change in concentration of nitrite. We incubated at a temperature gradient of 16, 25 and 30 degree Celsius, 220rpm.
Protocol
Add IPTG into prepared cultures of $E.coli$ (IPTG concentration: 0.1mg/L)
Induce at 16 Celsius degree, 150 rpm overnight
Add sodium nitrite solution and pickle extract collected from Qiumei Food (Target nitrite concentration: ~65mg/L), place three bottles of culture in different temperature
Take samples (500uL) of the cultures at various time points
Measure optical density(600nm) of the samples
Centrifugate at 6,000 rpm for 60s
Take 100uL samples from supernatant and dilute with 900uL ddH2O
Take 100uL samples from the diluted solution and dilute again with 900 uL ddH2O
Add 20uL of chromogenic agent to the solution
Stand the solution for 20 mins and wait for the color to develop.
Measure the absorbance(540nm) of the solutions
Record data in Excel forms
*Prepare the chromogenic agent as follows:
1
In 500mL beaker
50mL Phosphoric Acid (d=1.70g/m)
20.0g p-aminobenzenesulfonamide (C6H8N2O2S)
1g n-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride
250mL ddH2O
2
Transfer the solution to a  500mL volumetric flask and dilute with ddH2O to standard volume.
We selected these temperature gradient because they represented the normal temperature in Qiumei Food's storage.
Results
*Because the controls in different temperature showed similar results, we took their mean for better presentation.
Conclusion
The difference in Nitrite concentration may be caused by the different pickle extract: Qiumei Food provided us with only small quantity"

Lyon Presentation
Started working on the presentation layout for Lyon using Prezi . The team feels this will enable us to create a much more visually appealing presentation, giving us not only the best chance of captivating our audience and conveying our findings, but also winning at the Jamboree.
Initial design ideas have begun along the line of a microfluidics chip being used as a back-drop, with chambers used to contain relevant information (acting as ""slides"" as such). Along with the design ideas we have also started to compile a list of what information we want to have in the presentation, and how best to present this.
Planting Chinese Cabbage Seeds
Aim:
To plant seeds in order to wash them with L-forms and visualize them by confocal microscopy.
Methods:
We washed and planted chinese cabbage seeds in preparation for the introduction of L-forms into seedlings following the Production of L-form containing Plants protocol up to and including step four. The seeds were planted in Murishage and Skoog containing petri dishes and placed in a dark cupboard to germinate.
Results:
Please refer to August 23th .

Lyon Presentation
The presentation team has started getting to grips with Prezi and trying to find out exactly what it is capable of. We have discovered that the easiest way of creating animations is to create .swf files using Adobe Flash which, luckily, one of our members has a decent amount of experience with. Unfortunately it has also come to light that Prezi does not handle interactive animations well, meaning that animations will work much better if they loop endlessly. Whilst it is possibly to build simply interactivity into the animation, it requires and ActionScript 3.0 ""hack"" that could result in some unpredictable behavior. In the interest of reliability and owing to not wanting any unexpected events whilst giving the presentation, the interactive elements have been dropped out of the design.
Due to this the microfluidics theme has come under question, as the complexity of it may outweigh the overall result. One team member has, as such, come up with a preliminary design along a different theme. This can be seen in the image below and also by clicking this link .

Figure 1 This picture shows the fluorescence intensity after induction for 5h.
Inevitably, the light control switch had a leaky expression, but the leakage was low in a certain period of time.
Then, we cultivated the induced E.coli under green light, red light and darkness for 2h, and examined GFP expression.
Figure 2 This picture shows the result after triggering by different light (the result is evaluated by fluorescence intensity).
The bacteria transformed with light control system and GFP had obvious increasing in fluorescence intensity after activated by green light and the negative control (only have the light control system) had the similar fluorescence intensity under different lights.
After that, we transformed the green light into red light, vice versa. We kept the bacteria in darkness dim and cultivated them for 1h to examine the GFP expression.
Figure 3 This picture shows the result after transforming light (the result is evaluated by fluorescence intensity).
After transforming the light, we can see the fluorescence intensity were changed dependent on the different lights. Positive control and Negative control had similar data in all kinds of light. But light control system play significant role in the expression of GFP under different light conditions. In conclusion, red light can cease the PcpcG, and green light can re-start the pathway ceased by red light. That suggests our promoter can work cyclically.
2.Light-controlled promoter + Not Gate pathway
We did this pathway experiments together with the light controlled promoter, and now we can focus on the blue one:

The bacteria transformed with light control system , not gate and GFP had a few increasing in fluorescence intensity in the red light and darkness. What’s more, The fluorescence intensity in green light had a relative lower fluorescence intensity compared with the samples that got  before activated by light.
Figure 6 This picture shows the result after transforming light (the result is evaluated by fluorescence intensity).
In the transforming light experiment, the not gate play significant role in the expression of GFP to reverse the trend.
Conclusion: The verification of the entire pathway illustrates the coupling of the light-controlled promoter and the Not Gate, and preliminarily demonstrates that our system can work cyclically"

The results indicate good induction of the pBad-pTet device. The concentrations of aTc used for induction of the pTet promoter may have been incorrect, leading to uninterpretable results.

The discussion was moderated by members of our team while the audience was allowed to ask questions and become thereby an important part of the debate. The investigated questions lead to interesting results that gave our team new views on the prior executed researches as well as on possible future planned projects.

Results discussion 1
Forecast
Within the next five to ten years synthetic biology will not change our life or our society completely. This scenario is mostly envisioned by some American scientists whose companies need big investments. Thus they have a crucial interest in the upkeep of “radical visions”. It will take much more time and development till synthetic biology could have such a big impact on society like computers, the internet etc.
Acceptance
Until now the socio-cultural advantage of synthetic biology is the possibility of lower production costs for already existing products. If somebody had to choose between two similar products he would not select the one manufactured with synthetic biology, except the price difference is significant. The only chance to increase the acceptance is to provide additional products which cannot be made without synthetic biology. The consumer can see directly the benefit for his life and thus the benefit of synthetic biology.
 
Results discussion 2
Legal aspects
Against the general position in Germany there are detailed laws concerning the fundation of a lab at home. These laws are very strict and make the establishment of  a biohackerspace rather difficult.
Risk
Community labs include the threat of bioterrorism. But this seems to be an emotional fear rather than a rational one. The creation of bioweapons has several big limitations. To get them weapon-grade deep expertise and very expensive equipment is needed. For common people both things nearly can’t be achieved. Community labs won’t change this situation.
Advantages
A great benefit of “open science” is the checkability of companies and scientific work. Broadly spread community labs would give the people the chance to make chemical and biological tests of water quality, food, medicine etc. It can largely increase the"
UChile-OpenBio,2015,Team:UChile-OpenBio#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,": Safety System
Develop a system that can guarantee human and environmental safety by destroying cells which escape from the controlled culture media.
What parts did we use? And why?
PBAD (K206000): pBAD is an E.coli promoter that is induced by L-arabinose. Based on the Registry, in the absence of arabinose, the repressor protein AraC (BBa_I13458) binds to the AraI1 operator site of pBAD and the upstream operator site AraO2, blocking transcription [1]. In the presence of arabinose, AraC binds to it and changes its conformation such that it interacts with the AraI1 and AraI2 operator sites, permitting transcription.
PTetR: How it was explained before, we did use the BBa_R0040 part.
To all of our constructions we use the Ribosome Binding Site based on Elowitz repressilator BBa_B0034. It is considers with efficiency 1.0, it means has the best translation velocity (what’s translation?), so is used to define efficiency of other RBS
TetR: How it was explained before, we did use the BBa_C0040 part.
Lysis gene (BBa_K117000): This lysis gene encodes for the lysis protein in colicin-producing strains of bacteria. Once activated, it causes the host cell to lyze.
To all of our constructions we use the Double Terminator BBa_B0015: This part controls the end of transcription. This is the most commonly used terminator and It seems to be reliable. Consist in a double terminator containing BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 terminators.
What modules will we assembly?
Module 1
Module 2
How does our safety system work?
Essentially, we create a kind of auxotrophic cells which are arabinose-dependent; that means cells need arabinose in the culture medium to survive and grow up. The specific gene circuit is shown in Figure 4. In presence of arabinose pBAD promoter are induced so TetR protein is synthetize to repress pTetR promoter of the PTetR-Lysis gene module.
This allows us to control genetically modified bacteria in the lab, because if bacteria escape from their medium; means there is no presence of arabinose anymore (Figure 5), pTetR promoter will no longer be repressed so cells will produce a lysis toxin which will kill them by destroying its cell membrane.

J6 Plac-RFP + pSB TetR-LacI, IPTG: you can clearly see an increase of RFP when IPTG is added. This means that even with a constitutive promoter in front of TetR, LacI is still expressed. In fact, Pconst is weaker than Ptet. The ""2.5"" data seems strange, I perhaps missed to put IPTG in this well.
J6 Plac-RFP + pSB TetR-LacI, ATC: Without ATC, we have a similar expression curve as in the IPTG experiment. When ATC is added, we see a diminution of RFP expression because LacI is not repressed anymore.

Nadine made colony PCRs for the T7 promoter variants that Henrike cloned into the biobrick vector. The right insert should be ~450 bp long, but all the colonies show a fragment at 300 bp. Nevertheless, we have 5 colonies with the 450 insert.

Achievements:
Western immunoblotting with anti His6 sequence was performed to validate three biobricks: BBa_K1773022, BBa_K1773023 and BBa_K1773024. Proteins were generated and detected. Experiment was successful and we have obtained expression of Cascade construct. We also conducted in vivo experiments with BBa_K1773022, where we showed that this biobrick works just as expected – it attacks cell host genomic DNA, when other needed parts are present, and causes cell death. For more information check out our results .
We registered 4 biobricks for this criteria. They are: BBa_K1773022 , BBa_K1773023 and BBa_K1773003 .
When we were brainstorming our ideas, we noticed one big fear of lithuanian people. GMO usage affects us every day and the biggest fear is that GMO may be uncontrolled. There is a possibility that GMOs will spread or mutate after some time in the environment. We created a system that controlls GMOs. With this system GMOs can be used safely. It can take away a fear and let us"

Secondly, H2O2 sensor Yap1, will transfer into cell nuclear to start antioxidant-relative genes transcription once sense the over accumulation of ROS. If the Yap1                         starts working, which indicates ROS level is so high that it is dangerous for our yeast cells.                         So the Yap1-dependent promoters selected from yeast genome will induce the dCas9 system to                         repress the translation process of ndi1 and yno1, maintaining a safe level of ROS                         amount in vivo.
Thirdly, through transforming the roGFP-Orp1 expression vector into host, we can easily know                         how everything going inside the yeast.
Eventually, final test part comes!
The testing antioxidant is added into culture, and the artificial accumulation of ROS will                         decrease through integrated cell reaction. Some dues to direct antioxidant reaction, other may                         be removed by cells natural anti-oxidant system which is activated by testing antioxidant. No                         matter which kind of working way the testing antioxidant is, its antioxidant capacity will be                         reflected by the remaining ROS level, reported through roGFP-Orp1. In a word, higher ROS                         remaining represent lower antioxidant capacity.

RiboSense
Fluoride Riboswitch
Having obtained our DNA, the first test was a rather crude β-Galactosidase assay using cells cultured from the plates Yale sent us, the results of which are shown below, the protocol for which is found here .
A β-galactosidase assay of the fluoride riboswitch, the numbers represent fluoride concentration in mM
These results were very positive as it hinted at a good correlation between fluoride concentration and reporter output.
The next step was a more quantitave assay using a 96 well plate reader. This was in line with the assays done in the original paper by Breaker et al. In the paper they carried out a Miller assay, and whilst we have included the full and correct protocol on our protocols page , including the appropriate calculations, we lacked the filters and so were only able to record the A450nm. We feel that this was close enough in wavelength to be a suitable proxy for the A420nm reading required to assay the o-nitrophenol produced. We ran an initial assay and indicative results are below. All the A450 bar charts are based on two repeats, error bars are not included as they would not be statistically significant.
The timecourse of the first run of the β-galactosidase assay using crcB knockout B. subtilis transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 420 minutes with crcB knockout B. subtilis transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 420 minutes with B. subtilis strain 168 transformed with the fluoride riboswitch
A450nm readings after 420 minutes with E. coli carrying a plasmid containing the fluoride"

For our perspectives, there are some significant issues and stuffs we can never neglect for the modeling of synthetic biology.
A.Whether the relative reactions will be influenced by the metabolism of the adopted cells(i.e. E.coli, yeast)?
B.Whether the established modeling can characterize related features of corresponding projects. For instance, for the project “sensor”, whether the model can accurately deal with every biochemistry step and then precisely output two essential scales of the “sensor”, namely sensitivity range and response time?
C.Is the model valid, whose equations stand in the special reaction environment(minimal space for reactions, the quantized number of molecules)?
D.Is it necessary to consider the effect of noise? If so, then does the divece possess noise immunity and robustness?
E.Can the established model be simulated by current computing devices?
Considering all the elements above, the models are given in two sections. For different issues, related models are discussed step by step. The integration of three models is expected so as to reflect the reality of the reaction given by relative devices, and instruct our design and experiments.
SectionⅠ: Software Simulation for Core Circuit
Modular, mass-action-kinetics-based model of the dioxin sensor circuits
Differently from the work by Ajo-Franklin et al. [1], we did not use a simplified model based on Hill functions but we tried to give a more detailed description of the interactions that take place in our circuits by using mass-action as kinetics. As a novelty, with respect to the model in [1], our model consider
1. cell compartments (nucleus and cytoplasm);
2. mRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase;
3. mRNA splicing, maturation, and transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm;
4. mRNA translation via ribosomes;
5. activator protein transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus;
6. the interaction of d"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"E and RelB expression, the properties of the OmpR-regulated promoter were studied thoroughly. To assess the functionality of the OmpR-regulated promoter in practice, a reporter system containing the OmpR-regulated promoter controlling RFP was cloned into the E. coli strain MG1655 ΔOmpR. The phenotype of the resulting cultures revealed a dysregulation of the OmpR-regulated promoter. Thorough research lead to the finding that the OmpR-dependent promoter is not controllable when cloned on a high copy vector. As the modelling revealed, and which is evident from Figure 2-Main-Page
, a relatively low expression of RelE is required to induce dormancy, whereas high expression levels quickly result in overshooting. Since the OmpR-regulated promoter is an integrated part of the light sensing system, replacement is not an option. Therefore, the variability of the relE gene copy number was studied, and it was found that the OmpR-regulated promoter should be cloned into the bacterial chromosome or a low copy vector to obtain proper regulation Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson ZB, Lavery LA, Levy M, et al. Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see light. Nature. 2005;438(7067):441-2. . This intriguing finding let to the aspiration to investigate the controllability of the OmpR-dependent promoter on vectors with different copy numbers compared to the chromosome, thereby improving the characterisation of the promoter for the benefit to future iGEM teams.
To incorporate DNA onto the bacterial chromosome, homologous recombination with the red λ recombinase is a suitable approach Thompson JF, de Vargas LM, Skinner SE, Landy A. Protein-protein interactions in a higher-order structure direct lambda site-specific recombination. Journal of molecular biology. 1987;195(3):481-93. . Using this technique, a short fragment of chromosomal DNA at the bacterial attachment site attB Groth AC, Calos MP. Phage integrases: biology and applications. Journal of molecular biology. 2004;335(3):667-78. can be replaced with a linear DNA fragment encoding the OmpR-dependent promoter, RelE, and an chloramphenicol resistance cassette. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the linear DNA sequence was flanked by sequences, which are homologous to part of the chromosome.

Badge Design

Overview
Badge
The design of the badge has been a significant part of our work. It must be small, practical and bio-secure, preventing our bacteria from escaping into the environment. As our badge is specifically made to be used outside the lab, the biosecurity aspect needed careful attention. To respect these specifications, we decided to set it up as an assembly of three separate pieces, all of which can be 3D printed. Some parts are also safely reusable, so you don’t have to replace the entire badge when it is used.
The first one is the support, that can be attached to a bracelet by simply pulling it through the gaps on both edges. This part will never get in contact with the bacteria and is thus reusable. The middle part of the support contains a hole, allowing the second part of the badge to come in and to be secured, thanks to the groove on the side and on the bottom.
The second part is the heart of our system, we call it the capsule. It’s the piece that holds the medium containing our UV sensitives bacteria. Therefore, it is completely sealed, except for a small hole left on the side which allows us to fill it with medium and bacteria. This hole will also be used to ensure the biosafety of our badge, in cooperation with the last part. Regarding the top of the capsule, it is covered with a transparent polymer, that lets both visible and UV light pass through. There are also two smalls teeth on the bottom which fit into the support grooves to secure the capsule in place. You can finally find a small bump on top of the hole which will be used to secure this piece into the support using the final part.
Last but not least, the next part is called the safety ring. It will act as one of our biosecurity features.

Cambridge-JIC,2014,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," more reasoned fear of electrocution, were slow to take up what became one of the most useful technologies ever to be invented. Originally electricity was a phenomenon worked on in labs, but after the first practical outputs came along, it was taken up on a personal level by people like Henry Villard (a friend of Thomas Edison, and later founder of the predecessor to General Electric) who understood that the dangers can be well-managed, and lit one of his boats electrically. Once the technology is being used by normal people, publically and safely, the path to general acceptance is a short one.
The same gradual normalisation has been seen with public reaction to tomatoes and potatoes, both of which were feared poisonous when they were introduced to Europe (to the extent that during a famine in 1774 potatoes sent to peasants for free by Frederick the Great were left uneaten), and were not accepted into the staple fare of Northern Europe for many years (13). This was the case even when tomatoes were known to be eaten with no ill effect in Spain and Italy, such is the neophobia surrounding food. Eventually of course these foods were accepted as it became clear that their ease of growing and nutritional content made this fear gradually less important until it disappeared. Even to this day some of this writer’s friends’ grandparents distrust tomatoes...
What is interesting is that this process of normalisation can occur for something as useful as electricity even when there are obvious dangers associated with the technology like electrocution and accidental fires. The key to this acceptance was an accumulating history of safe use, and a usefulness that makes the technology worth the risk. Both of these factors are becoming true for synthetic biology, and from now it may only take practical outputs (mirroring lightbulbs and washing machines for electricity) which will make normal peoples’ lives easier and more convenient, for example more nutritious food where the reduced cost of farming GM compared to a wild type crop is passed not onto the farmer (as is the case with glyphosate tolerant crops) or the biotech company that created the line, but to the consumer. So by offering a plant that could easily be grown at home, but without pushing the question of it being eaten, mösbi is helping normalise synthetic biology for the really important matter of food security.
Mösbi is also helping in addressing the lack of understanding that can lead to fear. With its clear, open, workings and the try-it-yourself nature of creating a new combination of modules, it is both a useful tool and an educational exercise. If people are happy to use a plant to assess water contamination, soil nutrients, toxins or"

My name is Kasia and I am a workaholic. I also happen to be 2nd year MSc student of Systems Biology at DTU. I am a fan of bioinformatics, computational biology-based research and getting tan under a laminar flow cabinet (true story). And now that I still do not expect to be paid for my work I have decided to join the iGEM team to work on the damn cool project and put my skills to good use.
Helen Cook
I've just finished the first year of my Systems Biology MSc at DTU.  In a nutshell, this means I write code to study biologically relevant patterns in genomic information, and I make predictions that can be tested experimentally.   I joined the iGEM team because my concept of 'fun' includes dedicating my summer to work on a big project with"

Very slowly and steadily, push the sample out and watch as the sample fills the well. After all of the sample is unloaded, push the pipettor to the second stop and carefully raise the pipette straight out of the buffer.
Run the gel at 80-150 V until the dye line is approximately 75-80% of the way down the gel. Note: Black is negative, red is positive. (The DNA is negatively charged and will run towards the positive electrode.) Always Run to Red.
Turn OFF power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then carefully remove the gel from the gel box.
Use any device that has UV light to visualize the DNA fragments on the gel. Note: If you will be purifying the DNA for later use, use long-wavelength UV and expose for as little time as possible to minimize damage to the DNA. Note: The fragments of DNA are usually referred to as 'bands’ due to their appearance on the gel.

The short answer? Everything.
Wet Work
Undergraduates from the team performed all wet lab work, from plasmid mini-preps to PCRs to gel extractions.
We filled our own pipette tip boxes, prepared our own TAE buffer and poured our own agarose gels. We even rode our bikes to the laboratory supply center to buy our own 96-well plates for liquid culture analysis.
We based our protocols on existing Facciotti lab procedures and information on OpenWetWare.org .
We revised and improved the mutagenic PCR protocol from this paper to function well with standard BioBrick primers and to produce mutations at a suitable rate for our project.
Data Analysis and Imaging
The information and graphics on our data and project pages comes from analysis performed by undergraduate team members.
Keegan wrote scripts in Octave which were used to parse raw data from our plate reader for mutant screening, promoter activity assays and fluorescence emission scans. Similar scripts were also used to output our 2D and 3D graphs.
He also employed the Flot.js and Three.js libraries to create the 2D and 3D characterization plots seen on the data pages. To do this, he had to code a 3D plotting routine, an interpolation scheme for smooth coloring of 3D surface graphs, and the display widget that is used to present our data.
The mathematical model used to obtain parameters to fit to our data was developed by graduate advisor Linh Huynh . Thanks, Linh!
The Cell Designer graphics on our project selection page were created by Marc Facciotti . Thanks, Marc!
Wiki and Graphic Design
We designed and built this website from the ground up.
The layout was a group effort, with templates designed by Tim. Much of the wiki formatting was removed using CSS code from the 2009 TU Delft iGEM team .
Tim was the primary designing powerhouse behind the wiki and contributed largely to the Notebook section, particularly the gallery. He also implemented the Lightbox 2 code from this site to allow photo viewing from our Flickr account.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#The Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"Sabrina is one of our best advisors. She has taught us so many things in the lab and also in theory. She taught and explained everything to us patiently when we first came to the lab. In the meetings, she always tries to give good advice so we have better results in our project. When we failed, she helped us solve the problem by giving suggestions about what should we do next. We are very pleased to have her as our mentor.

Samiha TASNIM Khandaker
Samiha is one of the sweetest and most approachable advisors. Whenever she bumps into any of us, she’ll always ask us how we’re coping with the project and give much-needed encouragements. She likes the computer barn a lot along with other quiet places in the school. Sometimes, you’ll even see her loitering around the corridors. She’s really good with styling hair and that’s why every day is a good hair day for her.

Stephanie Yiu Pei Tung
The Lab Mum, in the sense of reliability. Stephanie was one of the leading members of last year's HKUST-Rice iGEM Team and this is her first year as an advisor coaching us rookie members from design of experiment to wet lab practice. Although she is doing her final year with her own Final Year Project lab work, she still spares practically all of her time to assisting in our project in whatever aspect that she is capable of helping. We all feel sorry for her sometimes in that she always helps in the shadow way beyond our imagination. With the greatest gratitude in heart, wish her every success in her years ahead.

Thomas LEE Ho Yin
Thomas is a smart person. His wit always gives way to intelligence and problem solving skills. He is a very hard-working and diligent person. Although he has jobs in other labs and is not always present in the iGEM lab, he is always willing to give useful advices to all other team members, be it lab work or auxiliary duties. He brings joy to the lab with his interesting jokes. I would really put some light on his soft skills, that is presenting himself in public. I wish him best of luck and I am sure, he would definitely find success in life.

""Taking an idea and bringing it to reality is challenging on a cadet schedule.""
- USMA West Point iGEM Team
The team established a sub group of three Cadets who established a team to develop a business plan based on the current research. One of the Cadets took an Entrepreneurial Management course where he wrote an executive summary, a business model, and marketing strategy to design a competitive advantage given analyzed financial factors. To assist with the development of their plan, the team met and presented their idea to a panel of consultants from Bain and Company in New York City, NY where they were critiqued on their style and knowledge. After working with the consultants to improve their business model, the team presented at the 2017 Mid-Hudson Regional Business Plan Competition where they took First place in the Advanced Technology section. They proceeded to the New York State Business Plan Competition where they did not place.

In our project, we attempted to use modified yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to mimic type I hypersensitive reaction in vitro. As former mentioned, two groups of cells play major role in allergy: the first group of cells (basophil granulocyte and mast cell) sense the existence of certain allergens, and release mediators; the second group of cells senses the concentration of mediators and carry on downstream physiological function, like endothelia cells of blood vessel. The activation of these two groups of cells could serve as indicators of allergen. For simplicity, we try to engineer yeast cells to emulate the behavior of the second group of cells.
There are two kinds G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway described in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Gpr1 pathway for sensing glucose, and Ste2/Ste3 pathway for sensing pheromone originates from yeast of opposite mating type (a/α). Yeast of α mating type secretes pheromone called α factor, and senses pheromone a factor from yeast of a mating type. Similarly, yeast of mating type a secretes a factor, and senses α factor. The mating pathway can be activated by pheromone from opposite mating type, inducing the transcription of mating related genes like Fus1 and Fig2. The pheromone sensing pathway of a-typed yeast is diagramed in fig 1.
fig 1. Pheromone sensing pathway of a-typed Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Former publications stated that some of human GPCRs can be successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and functional coupled with its endogenous pheromone sensing pathway, activating transcription of genes like Fus1 and Fig2. It has been showed that replacing the five amino acids at C terminal of Gpa1 with the five amino acids at the very C end of the Gα subunit that originally interact with GPCR to be expressed in human body could increase the coupling efficiency.

They came from Quanzhou, Fujian Province and they hoped they can enter Xiamen University after their graduation for further study. Although not all of them loved science, three still expressed their strong interest in biology. One of them even said that he will dedicate in synthetic biology field. At last, we left this joint picture. The woman stands at the second from left is their leading teacher.

On this closing day, almost all our team members appeared at the hall to leave pictures and celebrate the success of the exhibition. At this moment, a young couple entered and asked for a joint photo. We happily received their invitation and we formed a heart-shape circle surrounding them. Finally, they thanked us and left their best wished to our team – win the championship in 2012 iGEM.
Scene 5 on Aug. 27
Economy is a prosperous major in Xiamen University. On that day, a group of students from Department of Economy visited our exhibition. While we orally illustrating the contents in each panels, they showed great interests. Actually, their perspective differs from ours because they stress more importance on the market and commercial-related issues about synthetic biology. By asking numerous questions, they in fact also brought us a spirit that science and technology is expected to become real commodities to benefit the public rather than constrained in laboratory.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," they're equal because actually, I know society is not equal
and hence a female candidate may have a reason for having a gap in the CV. Overall, she argued that
unless we have a society that is not gendered
taking the names of CV’s isn’t the same as equality.
Professor Ryan gave us some incredibly valuable information on what needs to be done to make a difference in equality and diversity in science and in general, which supported many of the conclusions drawn by the other academics. Overwhelmingly, all academics highlighted the need for a massive societal change in attitudes to gender equality and the unconscious biases associated. Furthermore, many academics said that we could make an immediate effect by giving students and academics role models and mentors to help guide their perspectives on society.
Make sure they are obtainable so people can feel like they can be like them, that they are desirable or that they want to be like them and that they embody the same sorts of goals” (Prof. Ryan)
Importantly all academics have stressed the need for a change in attitudes to maternal, paternal and parental leave. All academics highlighted that first, societal attitudes need to change for there to be a significant difference, with Professor Ryan emphasising the importance of role models to encourage male and female partners that it is ok to take time off their career, and with Dr Dixon encouraging more support to both male and females in taking leave. Most academics stressed that the ‘Scandinavian model’ should be followed as an example of how to implement parental leave properly into culture.

Overall, we have examined the work of academics at this university who attempt to improve equality and diversity, at their different levels, in science. They have greatly informed us on the problems with gender inequality as well as how the university is, and plans on tackling the problem.
What can we do?
Panel Discussion
On 14th October 2016, we held a panel discussion to open up the debate about equality and diversity in science to a wider audience. We collaborated with the campus radio channel, Xpression FM, and the campus TV channel, XTV, in order to reach the widest audience possible. To conclude our work on equality and diversity, we needed to bring the work that we had highlighted from the academic interviews to the students that were represented in the first video (that highlighted students understanding to the issue).
One of our team members, Jack, hosted the panel alongside both student and academic representatives who were qualified to give an informative understanding of the issue of gender inequality and a lack of diversity in science. There were two student representatives:"
