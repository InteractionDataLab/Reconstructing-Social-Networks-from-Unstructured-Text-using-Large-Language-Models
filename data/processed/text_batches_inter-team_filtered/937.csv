Interview: With insights from Professor Rotimi's research into chronic wounds, we continued to model our focus on s.aureus biofilms. This provided us with a framework which was both safe and accessible for us to work with in the lab as well as being clinically relevant to the problem.  Our reflections on the interview with Professor Rotimi resulted in a mindset-shift towards the rapidly emerging problem of antibiotic resistance. Although we had originally concentrated on chronic wounds as a considerable economic healthcare burden that impacts the lives of vulnerable patients in terms of morbidity, this interview really opened up our outlook. We considered how the current therapeutic options for these wounds is actually a driving force to the problem of antibiotic resistance, and considered the issues of continued pressure to combine our new approach with drugs we already know are losing ground in the battle against bacteria.
From this interview we also learned to differentiate colonised from wounds which are secondarily infected. We considered how SMITe could easily have a role in the management of poorly healing wounds which were still vulnerable to infection, but with no systemic features. Since the early biofilm production (especially in diabetic wounds) originates from s. aureus, perhaps SMITe could have an even greater role in preventing secondary infections than treating them ""once the anaerobes have moved in.""
In response to this, we discussed the problem with our panel of supervisors and took advice about the incorporation of an antibacterial instead of an antibiotic into the SMITe. We were encouraged that this might be possible, but unfortunately did not have time to be able to develop and adapt the idea further (so far).
Furthermore, we considered the possible consequences of releasing previously stagnant bacteria from a biofilm into the local wound environment, but also to face the immune system and possibly systemic circulation of the individual being treated.
Again, we are currently far from the point of needing to worry about these issues, as the foundations of our idea are still emerging. However, we concluded that there are a number of possible outcomes:
1) Bacteremia- serious and better avoided but with the advantage that bacteria could now be targeted through intravenous antibiotics...rather than festering in a wound and dormantly developing resistance following attempts to clear wounds with systemic treatment
2) Successful immune clearance of the bacteria and rapid healing of the wound (ideal)
3) Unknown effects!

Project Description
Background Research
In the process of deciding what our project would be, we thought that we should choose something that would apply to our own community, as well as the international community. This idea led us to look into products that are used worldwide, and one of the things we found was ink. It is used in schools, homes, and nearly all workplaces. We then decided to go to the public and explore the idea of an innovation for ink as a viable product. After some research, we discovered that the ink is made up of three main parts; the resin, the solvent, and the colorant. Further research also led us to discover that the colorant is responsible for over 50% of the cost of ink. This led us to investigate the colorants themselves and we found that the production of colorants and pigments creates some horrible byproducts, such as large amounts of greenhouse gases, PCBs (polychlorinated byphenyls) and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). We took a tour of the Warwick Printing company in our hometown of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada and learned about how the ink is used in the industrial sector. We also learned from the owner Dave Warwick some of the important qualities of ink. For more information concerning the Warwick tour, click here .
Choosing our Project
After our initial research and our investigation into the industry and market we chose to do a project on ink. We then needed to decide what sort of problems existed within ink production and usage. The cost breakdown of ink led us to decide to focus on the colorant portion of ink as it accounts for the majority of the cost. This led us to research colorants and how they are made and used. We found that there are a few different colorants, pigments, organic molecules, and inorganic salts or compounds. We found that the most used and in highest demand colorant was carbon black, which is the byproduct of burning petroleum for energy (Figure 1). We had found our problem! Harmful byproducts of carbon black production are plentiful. We decided to combat this problem by producing a colorant of our own. We chose to produce four pigments"

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Project#Carotenoids#OAP_-_-_TEXT.html," verify our concept.
We transformed E. coli (TOP10) using K152005 from the 2009 Distribution Plate ( Week 2 ). After incubation for about 3 days, some light yellowish pigmention was visible. The long incubation time may be due to the fact that K152005 does not contain promoter. Although only small amount of yellow pigment was observed*** (instead of the expected orange colour), this gave us confidence that the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway was working in E. coli. ***Later experiments showed that the yellow pigment was probably not beta-carotene. Please refer to "" Characterisation of Biobricks and colour output "" for more details.
Mapping of Biobrick K152005 (update):
We will then put K152005 under a strong promoter (R0011, constitutive) to see if stronger colour production can be achieved.

Pathway from pyruvate and G3P to FPP. Figure from Yuan et al. 2006.
The first compound in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), derives ultimately from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (see figure on the right). The rate of carotenoid synthesis is limited by the rate of supply of FPP.
Certain strains of E. coli, e.g. MG1655, have been genetically engineered to up-regulate the enzymes involved in the pathway leading to FPP, thus increasing FPP supply and enhancing carotenoid synthesis. In Yuan et al., plasmid pPCB15 was used as reporter to assess the effect of such up-regulation. pPCB15 contains genes CrtEXYIB derived from Pantoea stewartii (homologous to the Biobricks available, which are derived from Pantoea ananatis) and produces orange beta-carotene as the main coloured product. The results showed that upregulation of enzymes upstream of FPP led more beta-carotene production.
Map of plasmid pPCB15.
In our project, we wish to compare carotenoid pigment production in E. coli strains TOP10, MG1655 and its derivative. Due to greater supply of FPP, we will expect higher level of carotenoid production in MG1655 and its derivative than in TOP10. Working on MG1655 and its derivative makes it easier to assess the effects of Biobricks on carotenoid synthesis, and allows us to develop and refine methods for"

Design
The main target in our project is to insert the sequences into the E.coli which serve the functions of both timer and bacteria counter. Once we turn on the device, the medium will become green. Afterwards, when the time is up or the concentration of bacteria invaded rises to a certain level, the medium will turn from green to red.
The whole reaction can be divided into three stages:
Standby: The E.coli only grow but other specific metabolism is excluded.
Lactose-accession: The lactose is added and the timer and the counter functions started.
Lactose-consumption: When the lactose consumes or that the amount of the bacteria invaded is large enough, the alarm                                         system starts and the E.coli suicide later.
(1) The Switch and The Input
The lacI operon serves as the switch of our project, and lactose works as the starting signal. At the beginning, the constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23106 ) unceasingly produces the LacI protein (BBa_C0012), which represses the LacI promoter ( BBa_R0010 ). When fixed amount of lactose is added, the lactose-lacI complex releases from the promoter and causes the transcription and the translation of downstream sequences begin.
(2) The Timer
Within the reaction, the lactose degrades by a constant rate. The promoter sequence will be repressed again while the concentration of the lactose is getting low enough. That is, to fulfill the timer function, we can control the reaction time by controlling the amount of lactose.
(3) Output
We use the green fluorescence protein (GFP) ( BBa_K145015 ) and the red fluorescence protein (RFP) ( BBa_K145150 )as the output signal. The green indicates “on”, whereas red indicates “off”.
We insert a part of sequence which encodes the GFP downstream the LacI-repressed promoter ( BBa_R0011 ). When switched on, the promoter starts translating and directly lead to the appearance of the green color. Moreover, the promoter would indirectly lead to the appearance of the"

We have collaborated with the Manchester Team on creating a document about GMOs legislation in different countries. In this document we covered things like the laws regarding the work with GMOs, commercialization, governmental institutions responsible for biosafety and the legal requirements use GMOs in your business. The teams Virginia (EUA) , Macquarie (Australia) , Botchan_Lab_Tokyo (Japan) , UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB (Chile) , ITB_Indonesia (Indonesia) , KUAS_Korea (South Korea) , IIT_Delhi (India) and UAlberta (Canada) were also partners in this collaboration.
In this collaboration, we aimed at creating a document that would illustrate that very depth and diversity of law. For this reason, the first issue we discussed is law-related politics, the second its bureaucracy, third law’s impact on business, fourth on science and finally on consumer behaviour.
This collaboration was very useful for us to understand the laws in our country as the research we undertook made us realize the complexity of Brazilian legislations regarding GMOs used for therapeutical reasons and the importance of the work we have been doing. Our project is to develop a new treatment for type 1 diabetes using a genetically engineered probiotic bacteria, which means that to this project became a real product someday, it would have to go under several safety assessments and approved to be used in humans.
Over this year, as we worked in our project, we were always worried about the legal requirements for a GMO like ours become a real product and how biosafety laws affect and guide the development of new GMOs. This document was very useful to us to research and understand the laws of our country, and also other countries, the steps that we would have to take"

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," GMOs this way, and through removing negative biases and public image, stir up conversation about steering legislation into a direction where it is informed by reason, not biased perception. To this end, we also want to bring attention to measures that can be taken in practice to design safe GMOs.
Ethics and related considerations in our project
We have given much consideration to the ethical implications of our work. This was evident from our brainstorming sessions, when the idea of targeting cyanobacterial toxins came about. The team’s acceptance of the idea was driven by how popular the problem was in Finland. We were addressing a serious, recurring environmental issue in the very country we were living in, though the problem is not exclusive to Finland. This would also let our project be more approachable and understandable to the the public as well as sponsors. Addressing a local problem creates an affinity between our project and the public, and also makes it easier for us to promote synthetic biology to them.
We wanted our products to have minimal side-effects on the environment and that meant limiting the reach of any genetically modified organism present in those products. Keeping this in mind and inspired by the Finnish nature and lifestyle, we decided to approach the problem of blue-green algae in the context of sauna water, thus limiting the scope of our products to a few drops of water and to maximum one bucket of water (~20 L) for the detection and degradation, respectively.
Our detection device would contain live yeast cells to produce the fluorescence signal, and is the main concern of our project when thinking about accidental release of GMOs. It is necessary to properly design the kit so that the yeast cells are contained within the device, in addition to placing biosafety measures for the possibility that the GMOs would escape the device, either caused by the device breaking or because of product misuse. This would have to be done in an especially fool-proof manner if the kit was to be commercialized. The best result would be achieved by introducing a combination of physical and biological containment strategies. An example of physical containment would be placing a filter (e.g. 0.22 µm) on the device sample wells in which the cells would be contained. Through this, water and small molecules such as toxins could pass but not yeast cells. This would allow detection of microcystin in the water while ensuring that the yeast stays inside the device. In addition, to adopt a biological containment strategy, we would engineer several essential proteins in our yeast cells to have a dependency on non-standard amino acids for their proper translation, folding and function, as described by Mandell et al. (2015).

We conducted a wide survey targeted at the general public, with respondents ranging from high school students to working citizens, in collaboration with the Kyoto Institute of Technology ( KIT-Kyoto ). The survey had two objectives. The first was to find how Japanese people feel or think about synthetic biology and its associated issues such as bioethics and safety. The second was to capture the public perception of radiation in Japan. We surveyed people who came not only from biological backgrounds but also from various other fields of study. We also obtained feedback from visitors to our universities' open campus events. In addition, we made an online version of our questionnaire to survey even more people from various walks of life.

Absorbance blank variation
Fluorescence blank variation
Variation in absorbance
Understanding of the fluorescence data requires normalization with cell growth data, in the form of optical density (absorbance).  Therefore, we proceed to analyse the OD600 data obtained first.
This includes recording the variation in absorbance of the blank well (containing only the M9 medium) and normalizing absorbance data against the latter to spot ay possible trends in growth rate variations at different temperatures.
We have made an analysis of the difference in growth rate of the cells at 28 and 42 degrees.
More information on our analysis of absorbance
Variation in fluorescence
At 28ºC
Figure 3: Fluorescence at 28 ºC
At 28 ºC, we can clearly see that the fluorescence is repressed, relative to the constitutive promoter (positive control).
The blue line is low, and fluorescence output is low. Therefore, the promoter is repressing downstream genes.

At 42ºC
Figure 4: Fluorescence results at 42 degrees
Figure 5: Fluorescence results at 42 degrees (corrected for effect of evaporation)
In figure 4, we can observe that fluorescence levels drift towards a steady state and are no longer low (as in the 28 ºC case).
This plot starts at a value of 4000 fluorescence units because the cultures were shifted from 28 ºC to 42 ºC overnight.
In figure 5 we have accounted for the effects of evaporation (as it happens due to an increase in temperature) so we can now see the positive control at a relatively constant level. This was not the case in figure 4, where evaporation was not taken into account. This, as mentioned earlier, could also be the reason of variation in the blank results.
There is a clear difference with the 28 ºC case, showing that indeed, at higher temperatures the downstream genes from the promoter are no longer repressed.
Click here for raw data
Conclusion
The characterization of the thermoinducible promoter is as follows:
At 28 ºC, there is no fluorescence (GFP) output because its expression is repressed
At 42 ºC, we can observe an increase in fluorescence (GFP) output,as its expression is no longer repressed

Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts. Please justify its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.
We took a new approach to the problem of phytoremediation by introducing a new chassis to iGEM. We hope that this will serve as reference for future teams who work on bioremediation or related environmental problems. See Phytoremediation for more details.
We wrote three tutorials in order to help previous iGEM teams to program better wiki pages, create animated gifs from PDB protein structures and to use Arduino microcontrollers in their iGEM project.
We submitted RFC[96 ] to the BioBrick Foundation which describes the usage of the AutoAnnotator to increase the quality of part descriptions for protein coding BioBricks. This software translates the nucleotide sequence into amino acids, calculates several parameters and performs alignments against various data bases and finally provides all collected data in a standardized table which can easily be pasted into a part description.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"Mechanosensitive channels: Piezo1 & TRPC5
Piezo1 protein is a functionally diverse mechanosensitive cation channel. It is expressed in lungs, bladder and skin, where mechanosensation plays an important biological role. It also plays significant role in multiple physiological processes, including sensing shear stress of blood flow for proper blood vessel development, regulating red blood cell function and controlling cell migration as well as differentiation.  Despite the functional importance and high sensitivity of Piezo1 proteins, their gating mechanisms and three-dimensional (3D) structures are yet to be defined. </ref>Ge, J., et al., Architecture of the mammalian mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel. [1] The density map revealed that Piezo1 formed a three-blade, propeller-shaped architecture, with distinct regions resembling the typical structural components of a propeller, including three blades and a central cap. (full length, 2,547 amino acids) (Fig. 2,3).

Figure 3. A proposed model of force-induced gating of Piezo channels. [2] Represent the closed and open state channels, respectively.Red dashed lines indicate the possible ionconduction pathways.Presumably, force-induced motion (red arrows) of the peripheral blade or PHs leads to conformational arrangement and gating of the channel.
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels belong to a diverse family of cation channels that respond to a variety of signals. [3] [4] TRPC5 is a calcium permeable cation channel predominantly express in the central nervous system (CNS). There is an impressive array of other activators of TRPC5 channel, such as nitric oxide, lysophospholipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, reduced thioredoxin, protons, lanthanides, and calcium, among them many can cause the change of TRPC5 configuration. Moreover, TRPC5 shows constitutive activity. It is shown to be associated with membrane stretch and cold feeling. Thus, TRPC5 channel has significant potential for synergistic activation and may serve as an important focal point in calcium signaling and electrogenesis. The biological functions of TRPC5 channel are also important, ranging from neurotransmission to control of axon guidance, vascular smooth muscle cell migration and contractility. [5]
TRPC5 shares several common features with other members of the TRP superfamily of ion channels, such as membrane topology and high select"

The team has developed a novel approach towards bioprinting based on a biomolecular two-component glue, which is composed of the protein avidin and the vitamin biotin that tightly bind to each other. This mild molecular interaction enables the printed cells to adhere to each other, opening up new perspectives for the bioprinting of live tissues and even organs.
After developing their interdisciplinary bioprinting project over the summer in the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra at TUM in Weihenstephan, the team was awarded the main prize of the ""Overgraduate"" section on November 1st, 2016. Furthermore, it won the first prize in the category ""Manufacturing"" and additionally received special awards for ""Best Hardware"" as well as ""Best Software"". Following up on the 4th place for LMU in 2012 and the 2nd place for TUM in 2013, this represents the greatest success for a Munich team in the iGEM competition thus far.
Congratulations to all members and thanks a lot to all sponsors of the team!
The iGEM competition is an annual, world wide, synthetic biology event aimed at undergraduate university students, as well as high school and graduate students. Multidisciplinary teams work all summer long to build genetically engineered systems using standard biological parts called Biobricks. iGEM teams work inside and outside the lab, creating sophisticated projects that strive to create a positive contribution to their communities and the world.
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Foundation is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to education and competition, the advancement of synthetic biology, and the development of an open community and collaboration.

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure"

On the other hand, in Georgia Tech part (hybB+OmpA+AOX), the alternative oxidase gene (AOX) was taken from a natural plant which does not represent any threat for environmental, public or research safety, but it would cause some adverse effects when this trait is expressed on wild bacterial colonies, due to the heat, energy production and their interesting but not studied improvement of growth under low temperature conditions. Although of this, its components don’t raise any biosafety issues.
In case of LMO (Living Modified Organisms) liberation on soil, thermogenesis is just temporary because these organisms need another conditions to survive, not only an appropriate temperature, and as the faster they grow, the faster they deplete some of their sources. Anyway, to avoid this situation, mixing these traits in a part and following the standard security we shouldn’t have high risks or “bio-issues"".
Finally we are planning experiments to meassure the impact of the CspA promoter, in replace of the hybB promoter in the AOX expressión machine, that could lead to a significative improvement of growth and expression capabilities under cold shock situation. This effect should be carefully analyzed due to the possible extension of bacteria survival and action range. This experience will be consultate about how to realize with professional of the National Biosafety Committe (or won't be made).
3- About Biosafety Groups
Our Institution
Our university has neither biosafety rules nor a biosafety committee, because we do not have Biological schools in our University. But with the emergence of Synthetic Biology, the next step should be to develop it in order to fix limitations in experimental projects and make students and professors aware of this. Nevertheless, we have the advise of The Institute for Scientific Research and High Technology Services; their Biosafety section will collaborate with us for lab rules and projects safety observations. We are establishing a conversation with the Nationals professionals in Molecular Biology and Genetics, at this moment to explain what's synthetic biology, then what we are doing.
Has not been easy to get contact with people involve in biosafety and bioseccurity in our country, due there is not a institution exclusively working in this, usually is a comitte or department inside other institutions.
Our country
In Panama,  Synthetic Biology does not have its own rules, but it follows the rules of government that dictate the basic instruments of reference to determine procedures, limitations and regulations established to manage LMO, GMO and bioethical issues.
However, in our country there is a commission that determines the"

FREDsense Technologies
We are building better biosensors.
FREDsense has developed a novel system for quantitative, real-time detection of various toxins in any sample. We use a biosensor with an electrochemical output to create a system that is portable, fast, and unlike anything else in the market
See how we're different. >
Toxic Chemicals Are Bad.
Detecting toxic compounds in our environment is an ongoing struggle that we face, whether the underlying issue is a public health or an environmental protection concern.  The biosensing market worldwide is already an $8.9 billion market and is expected to grow to $18.9 billion by 2018. Alberta, Canada is faced with a specific challenge; development of petroleum related industries, specifically the oil sands, has led to large volumes of contaminated water that must be remediated before release into the natural ecosystem.  However, current methods of testing are either too slow, labour intensive or do not accurately report the relative toxicity. Thus, the 2013 iGEM Calgary Entrepreneurial team is building a better biosensor based system to report on the general toxicity present.
Who Are We?
We are FREDsense, an early venture start-up company focused on designing and implementing novel biosensor systems for oil sands applications. Our goal is to commercialize a product that was initially started as an iGEM project in 2012.
What Do We Have?
Our toxin biosensor system is designed to be rapid, on-site, and require little to no sample prep, providing a distinct advantage against competing technologies presently available to oil sands service companies.
Are We Needed?
With growing regulatory bodies increasing the financial contribution to analytical based monitoring instrumentation, there is an emerging market surrounding specific toxin sensing for oil sands applications.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioSensor Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," we pursued two distinct approaches: IRES and FQ sensing . Both utilize aptamers, small nucleic acids with extremely high specificity and affinity towards their target small molecule ligand as sensory domains. Both methods served as functional nucleic acid-based customizable small molecule detection mechanisms. The approaches differed in how they reported aptamer binding. We had far more experimental success with the FQ system. To read more about our small molecule biosensing efforts, visits the IRES and FQ sensor sub-project pages.
BioClicks
In our early research on aptamers, we had a few realizations: 1. They are as functional as antibodies for small molecules and easier to manipulate, 2. There is no convenient database for aptamers online, 3. Aptamers are being under-utilized in bioengineering applications. We were motivated to address these three issues in synthetic biology and innovate new biosensing and biomanufacturing applications with impacts in astrobiology.
Since BioBricking each aptamer sequence would not be practical given the need for chemical modifications and cheapness of synthesizing short oligonucleotides (most RNA and DNA aptamer sequences are around 30-100bp) instead we have created a convenient repository of functional nucleic acid parts for synthetic biologists to plug our systems into. Functional nucleic acids have become increasingly important in sensing capabilities and transcriptional regulation.
Example aptamer. This is a picture of the secondary structure of the RNA theophylline aptamer, generated with the software program Geneious.
Legos like BioBricks depend on connectors to click them together in many instances; thus, we propose a new category of parts called BioClicks that click into systems and can be ordered at the click of a button. We have described clearly how parts should be ordered and manipulated for the desired effect. This not only provides a scalable and versatile platform to scientists but also allows for better transparency and broader reproducibility of these systems. Databases like Aptagen fall short in that these do not keep the customer (biologists) in mind for easy user accessibility, and all other sources have been contaminated with misinformation from open source tools.
As a pilot feature for these BioClicks, we are crowdsourcing information about small functional nucleotide sequences and curating them here. We are not allowed to house this repository on the iGEM Registry (although we hope iGEM will take note and adopt this useful feature that is unaddressed in the synthetic biology realm); however, we have included links here if you are interested in adding content or seeking functional BioClicks.

New England Biolabs Representative : Chris Cook
In the spring, a representative from New England Biolabs, Chris Cook, came to our school to discuss restriction enzymes and other products that we use in our lab.  The presentation was helpful not only on the scientific side, but also because he discussed career opportunities beyond a research lab.
Alverno California and CAPS_Kansas
Our team collaborated with Alverno Heights Academy, a fellow high school iGEM team in California, and the CAPS Kansas iGEM Team. We set up a video call with them and discussed our project as well as helped them with understanding the iGEM Jamboree, and emailed multiple times back and forth, answering questions about the process of competing in iGEM and various requirements for Jamboree.
Georgia State University
We collaborated with the Georgia State iGEM team in order to host our booth at the Maker Faire Atlanta. Members of GSU iGEM volunteered at the event and discussed their project with us during the breaks. They also generously donated materials we needed for our activities and were greatly helpful. We could not have hosted our booth without them!
Lambert High School: Engineering and MSA
In order to make our lightbox device, we collaborated with the engineering department at our school. A member of that department, David Park, helped adjust our existing blueprints and allowed us to use his 3-D printer. In addition, David also helped troubleshoot when we had problems assembling the lightbox and gave us ideas to improve future versions of it. We also collaborated with MSA, Lambert's very own Medical Science Academy, who helped us with events and volunteered for set-up and clean-up for our outreach.
iGEM Twitter Group
Thanks to Twitter, iGEM teams from all over the world are in a group chat where we can easily communicate and ask questions about iGEM, Jamboree, wiki, and much more! iGEM teams have easy access to other teams and can ask questions about their projects, send out surveys, or promote their apps/programs through this platform. A great and fun way to collaborate!"

From 2009.igem.org
Evan Evans and Ken Ritchie
Biophys J. 1997 Apr;72(4):1541-55
Abstract: In biology, molecular linkages at, within, and beneath cell interfaces arise mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These bonds will fail under any level of pulling force if held for sufficient time. Thus, when tested with ultrasensitive force probes, we expect cohesive material strength and strength of adhesion at interfaces to be time- and loading rate-dependent properties. To examine what can be learned from measurements of bond strength, we have extended Kramers' theory for reaction kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation under force and tested the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics) simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the force that produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests of breakage, i.e., the peak in the distribution of rupture forces. As verified by the simulations, theory shows that bond strength progresses through three dynamic regimes of loading rate. First, bond strength emerges at a critical rate of loading (> or = 0) at which spontaneous dissociation is just frequent enough to keep the distribution peak at zero force. In the slow-loading regime immediately above the critical rate, strength grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects initial coupling of force to the bonding potential. At higher rates, there is crossover to a fast regime in which strength continues to increase as the logarithm of the loading rate over many decades independent of the type of attraction. Finally, at ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain of molecular dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked frictional drag on the structure remains to retard separation. Hence, to expose the energy landscape that governs bond strength, molecular adhesion forces must be examined over an enormous span of time scales. However, a significant gap exists between the time domain of force measurements in the laboratory and the extremely fast scale of molecular motions.

Collaborating with other teams
We collaborated with three different teams in the 2016 iGEM season.        We assisted team Macquarie by making a graphical user interface on MatLab showing how the concentration of various intermediates including ALA (Y-axis) changes over time (X-axis) in chlorophyll.        We created a documentary for team Aix-Marseille focusing on the socio-economic and political issues facing the current platinum sector, including the Marikana strikes.        Team Heidelberg 2015 ran their MAWS software to provide us with a target specific aptamer, in exchange for numerous candidate PDB files for them to test their system on, as well as valuable feedback about how well their aptamer performed in our thylakoid binding experiments.       Furthermore, surveys from iGEM Evry , iGEM Groningen and iGEM UPO-Sevilla were posted on our social media pages, and we also provided content to iGEM XMU-China for their compilation of the iGEM Newsletter.

Collaboration with Aix-Marseille University
South Africa is regarded as having the largest platinum reserves in the world. The Merensky Reef stretching from southern Zimbabwe through to Rustenburg and Pretoria is the centre of platinum mining in South Africa. AMPLATS is the leader in platinum mining in South Africa, producing 40% of the total group platinum group metals. The Aix-Marseille University iGEM team identified problems faced by the mining sector which include limited sources, the use of hazardous chemicals to eliminate impurities, the disregard of safety measures and the lack of methods to recycle platinum next to highways.The solutions they came up with are to concentrate the platinum accumulated from roadside soil by phytoremediation plants and to transform it into nanoparticles. We assisted them by creating a documentary focusing on the socio-economic and political issues facing the current platinum sector, including the Marikana strikes. We also looked at the possible implications of their 2016 project. We"

Alternatively, if you are pushed for time, you could incubate the samples in the fridge overnight and carry out the rest of this protocol the next day.
4) Split the samples into Eppendorf tubes - each tube should contain 1ml of the sample. The next stage in this protocol involves centrifugation, therefore it is vital that the DNA sample solutions are transferred to Eppendorf tubes.
For example if we have a total volume of 8.8ml DNA sample solution, we will have to split the solution into 8 Eppendorf tubes.
5) Transfer the Eppendorf tubes to the centrifuge and spin the samples for 20 mins (at the maximum speed of 13,000 rpm)
To make things easy for the next step, when the tubes are placed in the centrifuge make sure that the tabs of the lids are facing the outside. By doing it this way you can be assured that the DNA pellet will have deposited on the opposite side in the Eppendorf tubes. In cases where the pellet isn't visible this is a really helpful consideration.
6) Remove the supernatant making sure that the pellet does not disappear with it.
7) Add 70% ethanol to the DNA pellet without disturbing it and then discard the ethanol, making sure that the pellet is still present in the tube.
Alternatively after placing the 70% ethanol (which serves as a rinse) into the tubes, you could centrifuge the DNA and 70% ethanol for about 15-20 minutes. This is to ensure that the pellet is secured onto the sides of the Eppendorf tubes and not washed off by the ethanol.
8) Ensure that the pellet is completely dried - remove the droplets of ethanol from each tube using a pipette tip, use a vacuum pump to remove any remaining ethanol in the tubes and then leave the tubes on the bench (preferably on paper towels) for a few minutes to dry.
9) Resuspend the pellets in 15 microlitres of sterile deionised water.
10) Either use the DNA now or store it in the freezer.

Adenine
Classify
As the same to the theophylline, we use mfold to predict the secondary structure of the adenine. From the results, we classified the aptamer sequences into 2 categories by their secondary structure. The sequences in the first category have the same secondary structures which have been usually reported and studied as the adenine apatamers. The sequences in the second category have varied conformation and owing to their relatively long sequence, they can fold to complex conformations.

Sequence alignment
To locate the consensus sequences and probe correlation between adenine apatmer sequences and theophylline aptamer sequences, we did sequence alignment in each categories and whole sequences (Table 2) (Figure7) . From the alignment result, we found that the sequences in category 2 are quite different and have relative short consensus sequences. We thought the data which have been collected are not well processed.
We compared the adenine aptamer sequences alignment results with theophylline, we found that there are more consensus sequences locating in different region and the entire adenine aptamer sequence show complex structure. Thus, the comparison indicates that adenine aptamer sensor domain and theophylline have less or nothing in common.
In addition, the adenine alignment has shown the same consensus sequences as Daniel A. Lafontaine reported(Figure 8) Who has pointed out the importance position in adenine aptamer sequences.

Finally, BBa_S05397 (K880005+csgD) was inserted before BBa_S05399 to complete the full construct (BBa_K2229300) (figure 3-13). Sequencing results from Tri-I Biotech confirmed that our final construct is correct.

Hypothesis
Figure 3-14 Overexpression of CsgD and/or OmpR234 upregulates the curli operon to different degrees. We hypothesized that biofilm production would be upregulated (in increasing order) if we overexpress A) CsgD, B) OmpR234, or C) both. Figure: Justin Y.
We hypothesized that biofilm production would be upregulated (in increasing order) if we overexpress CsgD, OmpR234, or both (figure 3-14). Overexpression of CsgD would result in more curli monomers, but no transport proteins to carry those monomers out of the cell. Overexpression of OmpR234 would allow curli monomers to be exported and form curli fibers and biofilm. Finally, when both CsgD and OmpR234 are overexpressed, twice the amount of curli monomers should be made and exported to form even more curli fibers and biofilm.
Expression of CsgD and OmpR234 Increases Biofilm Formation
To test the expression of CsgD and OmpR234, we ran SDS-PAGE using transformed and lysed E. coli cultures (figure 3-15). Cultures transformed with the basic parts BBa_K805015 (csgD ORF alone) and BBa_K342003 (ompR234 ORF alone) were used as controls. We expected to see CsgD around 25 kDa and OmpR234 around 27 kDa (Brombacher et al. 2006; Martinez & Stock 1997). Compared to controls, thicker and darker bands at the expected sizes were observed in both BBa_K2229100 (CsgD overexpression) and BBa_K2229200 (OmpR234 overexpression) (figure 3-15; proteins bands are marked by asterisks).

OVERVIEW
 
This year marks the 10th anniversary of iGEM. The decade witnesses the progress and boom of iGEM—more teams sign up for the competition and more programs of high quality are produced. Meanwhile, it is a trend which the open-minded iGEMers of XMU comply with that the communication among teams from all around the world is more frequency. We were active in communication and collaborations with counterparts at home and abroad, as well as propaganda and popularization of synthetic biology and iGEM. A biweekly newsletter, which was cofounded by iGEMers of Paris Bettencourt University and us, XMU team, provided broader communication and colorful later issues and had attracted participators from 30 teams. Besides, we enjoyed net-video conference with domestic and overseas counterparts and study visits to other iGEM teams. Moreover, during the popularization in Xiamen Library, we managed an iconoclastic way that we started with a hot issue, GM food (genetically modified food), which is worldwide popular.

One of today’s greatest concerns regarding Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) is biosafety. While talking to people about our project we realized that fears about GMO are still present in our society. Therefore, we paid special attention to public perception and understanding when discussing our project approach as explained in the Policy and Practices overview.
As a result, the Biosafety module was developed. This module has two objectives, to preserve the identity of the genetically engineered plant allowing its unequivocal identification by changing its color; and avoid its uncontrolled spread inhibiting the pollen production by male-sterility. We implemented this module in collaboration with NRP-UEA-Norwich team and Results can be checked here.
Additionally, our team successfully completed the Safety form updating it when it was necessary.

Thus, for our experimental setup, the raw measurements of A_600 should be multiplied with the conversion factor in order to calculate the corresponding standard OD_600 value.            In order to convert measured fluorescence readings to a concentration of expressed GFP, we constructed a standard curve by serial dilution of a 1 x fluorescein stock solution. The mean of the measured fluorescence for each concentration is described in table 2. The data from table 2 is plotted as Figure 1 to display the standard curve derived from the fluorescent measurements.

Figure 1: The standard curve derived from the fluorescent measurements.
The standard curve has an R^2 value of 0.9979 when assuming linearity. The high R^2 value means that it is be possible to calculate a concentration of GFP from absorbance readings with an acceptable accuracy.
Measurement
The transformants containing the test devices were inoculated into fresh LB CAM media, and incubated for 6 hours at 37C, with samples being taken from the culture every 2 hours. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 485 nm, and emission at 530 nm (530/30 filter). Using the fluorescence readings, the concentration of expressed GFP/cell could be calculated from the measured optical density. This yielded the results shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: The GFP expression per cell for each device.
Discussion
Our team was not able to measure fluorescence for the standard curve at concentrations of fluorescein above 12.5 uM, as the two highest concentrations of GFP yielded absorbance readings too high for the plate reader to measure. Despite the two missing data points, this standard curve was still submitted for the InterLab study, as the sensitivity setup used to create this particular standard curve proved to be the best setup for measuring our test devices. The team was not able to transform the Test Device 1 from the InterLab study, and we therefore have no real data for the expression of this device.
When looking"
McMasterU,2016,Team:McMasterU_-_-_TEXT.html," does, following the assumptions, plugging in the parameters.
So it may or may not resemble real phenomena, depending on whether the assumptions and parameters are realistic.
Two of the model’s three assumptions are either valid physical laws or assumptions made by other researchers publishing agent-based models in peer-reviewed literature:
Signals and factors both diffuse following the 2D diffusion equation.
That is really the only reasonable assumption. With express permission from the author, we used the Python implementation of a numerical approximation of the solution to the 2D diffusion equation from the Brick in the Sky
Bacteria produce signals at a lower rate when they are inactive; upon activation, when the signal concentration at their location reaches a threshold, they switch to a higher rate.  Signal production is thus a step function of signal concentration.
This is the the assumption made by Netotea et al. in their agent-based model of quorum sensing, modelling bacterial swarming (Netotea et al., 2009)
One assumption was just taken from conversations with wet lab members:
Bacteria produce factors only when the signal concentration at their location is above a threshold (not necessarily the same threshold as for signal concentration)
Then, we fiddled around with parameters, using trial and error until they showed the behaviour we were looking for - that is, that dense bacterial populations would produce the factor while sparse ones would produce none.
The parameters are all unitless. Unitless parameters are often used in models (such as this one) which aim to simply demonstrate an effect, without necessarily simulating real, physical behaviour.
Since we used unitless parameters, found through trial and error, our model does not necessarily closely mirror any phenomenon that might be seen in a lab. It wasn’t meant to; while its parameters do correspond with real-life properties of bacteria and the chemicals they produce and detect, those properties have unknown real-life values, too. Instead, the model and its results just tell us that there exists a set of parameters that give us what we want - knowing the values of those parameters, relative to each other, we can learn about how to make our quorum sensing work the way we want it to in the lab.
What we can learn
The important part of this model is what we can learn from it to guide our future research in the wet lab. In tweaking the parameters to display this behaviour - which we’ll also be looking for in the wet lab - we developed a few basic insights. The important parts are bolded:
Assuming we have no control over the diffusion and extinction coefficients of our chemicals, we only have control over passive and active signal production rates, as"

    Citizen Science Experiment
Introduction:
To get help with sampling organisms that might colonize or degrade polystyrene we set up a ""Citizen Science Experiment"" scheme to enable members of the public to take part. The section below shows the invitation to ""Citizen Scientists"" to take part as promoted on the team blog:
""Here's a part of our project that you can join in with!
As you may know, finding the elusive polystyrene eating micro-organisms is the first challenge of the project and this is where members of the public can become ‘Citizen Scientists’. As strains of bacteria that degrade polystyrene have been found in the soil using high density polystyrene as their sole carbon source, we're going to try and see if we can find anything naturally occurring, growing on expanded polystyrene by getting everyone involved.
To get involved all you need is the University of Leicester environmental sampling pack (Citizen Science kit), which can be bought from a team member or here on the Blog. In the kit, you will find a strip of expanded polystyrene in a self-seal bag (for sending it back to us in), experiment protocol, a risk assessment and a stamped, addressed envelope for returning the samples back to us. With the kit you can then bury your sampling strip wherever you like be that your allotment, garden, flower bed or plant pot leaving it for a few months for bacteria to grow and then send it back to us.”
What’s in it for me?
Once we receive the samples back we will culture the bacteria that will, hopefully, have grown on the strip using the carbon locked within as their source. If your strip is successful, you can get your contribution attributed in all of our work – Citizen Scientists whose samples harbour the most useful polystyrene-eaters will be invited to be authors on the paper reporting the team’s findings, with all participants being acknowledged.

The cells were grown overnight in YPD medium, and prepared by spinning down and washed twice. The preculture was then used as inoculum for minimal medium (substituents) to a final concentration of 0,001 (OD600) measured by Spectrophotometry (Shimadzu UV-1800). The cultivations were carried out in a cytomat (Thermo Scientific) shaking 900 rpm at 30 degree celsius. Cultures were grown, shaked and measured in a 48 well suspension culture plates (Cellstar, Greiner-bio-one). The measurements were carried out using a Hamilton Microlab Robot, (Hamilton Life science Robotics) connected to a plate spectrophotometer (BioTek Synergy 2).OD600 measurements were taken every 2 hours until the cultures reached stationary phase. Data was then analysed and visualized using excel and R-studio Figure 2.
Figure 2: A. Overnight culture: strains of Y. lipolytica and S. cerevisiae are grown in YPD media overnight at 30℃ (86℉)  to ensure balanced growth and comparable data. B. Washing- and inoculation steps: Cells are spinned down and washed to ensure removal of carbon-sources and other metabolites from the overnight-culturing. Washing and spinning step is repeated.                    Simple and complex substrates are inoculated with cells in 48 well suspension culture plates. The cells reaches final OD600 0.001 C. Growth-experiment: Plates are incubated and shaken at 900 rpm in a cytometer and before measurement of OD in a spectrophotometer. Data are recorded and compiled in an excel sheet with two hours intervals. This process is assisted by using the Hamilton Microlab robot. D. Data analysis and -visualization step: The data excel sheet (in step C.) are analyzed and visualized by plots using R-studio.
During the growth experiments we kept to strains that were wild type or closely related. This makes the results more general for the organism.

How to be a Craftsman
A compact machine requires bold ideas and careful practicing. Here comes how we built our Crown.
Construction Method
Above all, we used 3 sets of Connectee1 to build polymerization system. There are four main parts in a Connectee1 for testing.
Figure 1.3.3 ssDsbA-FP-Lgt-TAL-His Tag
ssDsbA: SsDsbA is the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent signaling sequence of DsbA. SsDsbA-tagged proteins are exported to the periplasm through the SRP pathway. With ssDsbA fused to the N-terminus, fusion proteins with Lgt are expected to be anchored onto inner membrane of E.coli.
FP: To visualize the localization of fusion protein with fluorescence test , we added FP in the Connectee1 and placed it just after the ssDsbA. We chose mRFP, CFP and YFP in our system.
Lgt: Phosphatidylglycerol prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) is an inner membrane protein that acts as a membrane anchor of E.coli with seven transmembrane segments and has been successfully overexpressed in E. coli without causing harm to cells.
TAL effectors：As mentioned earlier, we chose three kinds of combinations to build three different TAL proteins, based on the parts that 2012 Freiburg iGEM team offered. These three TAL proteins can identify three different 14bp nucleotide sequences on a Connector. Note that we added a His Tag at the end of TAL protein to facilitate separation and purification.
For the three kinds of corresponding Connectee2, we did not introduce ssDsbA-Lgt section to keep them in a free intracellular state.
In the final production of our construction, we added an easy-to-hand interface sequence between the Lgt and TAL protein in Connectee1 or just before the TAL protein in Connectee2, as sites to adding enzymes.

Overview
Our team thought that presentations would be an effective method to fulfill one of our goals that our human practice team set up: provision of information for the public. Our team originally planned to do one presentation for freshmen School of Science students at HKUST, but we ended up being involved in five different presentations. Three of the presentations have already been conducted, while the other two presentations will be conducted after the wiki freeze.
Presentations with other iGEM Teams
This year our team had the opportunity to interact with other universities: South University of Science and Technology of China (SUSTC), and Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). On August 17th, we met SUSTC team members at our university. We hosted a semi-formal event where each team had a chance to present and share their project. We also had a Q&A session after each project so that we could discuss the projects in more detail. After the presentations, we ate lunch together and had a tour around our campus. We also participated in a similar event in CUHK on 24th August. This time, three teams – the HKUST, CUHK, and SUSTC teams – participated.
Presentation for HKUST Students
Our team did a presentation for HKUST freshmen from School of Science on September 27th. During the presentation, we introduced synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, briefly described our project, and encouraged students to join the next iGEM team. We also did another presentation for freshmen of the School of Engineering after the Regional Jamboree on October 9th with similar content. Both presentations received enthusiastic response from the students.
Innocarnival
Our team plans to hold a workshop at the Hong Kong InnoCarnival event on November 10th. InnoCarnival is a flagship event of the InnoTech Month organized by the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC). It aims to let members of the public experience scientific and technological discoveries at a more intimate level. Our talk will introduce synthetic"

14.36 Purification of test expression
Aim: Purify PheA-Arc1p-C-1x on a small scale
The cell culture from 14.35 was centrifuged (17000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) and the pellet resuspended in 3 mL buffer A. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL and incubated on ice for 30 min. Afterwards the cells were lysed using ultra sound (2x 18 pulses, 30 s on ice inbetween). To clear the suspension of cell debris it was centrifuged (13000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was purified using QIAGEN Ni-NTA Spin Columns. An SDS-PAGE gel showed that the protein is produced and can be purified using Ni affinity chromatography.
60 mL LB-Kan50 medium was inoculated from the glycerolstock prepared in 14.35 and incubated at 37 °C and 220 rpm over night.

Yeast expression Part 1
Investigator: Roman
Aim: Induction of protein expression of CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 and eGFP
Operational sequence:
At first, the OD600 of the over night cultures were measured:
CaXMT1: 4,4/ml
CaMXMT1: 3,9/ml
eGFP: 4,5/ml
(1/10 dilutions have been prepared for measurment)
To obtain an OD of 0,4/ml in 50ml of SC -URA 2% gal medium, 4,5ml, 3,9ml and 4,5ml of the over night cultures were centrifuged at 1500xg for minutes at 4°C. Afterwards, the pellet was resuspended in 2ml SC -URA 2% gal. The suspension was then given to 48ml SC -URA 2% gal medium, followed by incubation at 180rpm and 30°C.
Afterwards, 5ml samples were taken of each culture after incubation times of 20min, 140 min and 320 min. The samples were first stored in the fridge and then centrifuged at 1500xg and 4°C for 5 minutes. After washing with 500µl sterile water, the pellet was stored at -80°C until further usage (cell lysis). Furthermore, the OD600 was measured:
After 20 min:
CaXMT1: 0,41
CaMXMT1: 0,40
eGFP: 0,42
After 140 min:
CaXMT1: 0,43
CaMXMT1: 0,42

BGU_Israel,2014,Team:BGU Israel#Notebook1_-_-_TEXT.html," negative population.  This might not the result of unsuccessful silencing – we are using a stable GFP  expressing cell line, but no matter how stable it is, always there will be a  portion of the cells that do not actually express GFP. Additionally, a  successful silencing is not expected to completely shut down the expression of  GFP in single cells. This creates the necessity to evaluate the expression of  GFP using another parameter.
Mean intensity of GFP  positive cells: This parameter will show difference between a negative control  and a successful silencing in light of the above. However, cells treated with  scRNA showed only a very small difference in this parameter, so we could not  observe a successful silencing.
For the next try, the following changes were implemented:
double the amount of scRNA in the  transfection
Change the protocol of  preparing Lipofectamine – scRNA mix to allow for better interaction between the  2 parts of the construct, and prepare the Lipofectamine- DNA mix separately.

Goal:  A second try of silencing eGFP in CT26 eGFP cells co - transfected with pcDNA3  mRuby2 and our scRNA construct. The scRNA construct is designed to be activated  by mRuby2 mRNA, becoming a dicer substrate and finally silence eGFP. 
Details:
The  changes concluded from former results:
Half of calls amount was  seeded (50,000 cells per well)
The cells were transfected  with double amount of scRNA:
pcDNA3-mRuby2-  1.0 µg 
 scRNA – both detection part A + hair pin part  B- 200 pmol for each of the parts (A+B)
This time, the lipofectamin  mixes were prepared separately for the pcDNA3-mRuby2 and for the scRNA (both A  and B parts together), so that both of the mixes will make its content ready  and prepared for transfection.
The  rest of the protocol remained unchanged ( protocol ).
Notes:
During this  transfection a mistake occurred. In one of the plates, an incorrect of volume  of Lipofectamine-scRNA was added due to a measurement error. Consequently, this  plate had unknown concentrations of nucleic acids and lipofectamine, with a  positive deviation in volume.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"). We experimented with different ratios between weight and PDY to find the best amount to add--while we were unable to generate a specific ratio by the end of our experimental time frame, the general consensus was the material should be damp but not soaked. Once the PDY is added to the substrate plates of mycelium were added. These plates were first divided into grids before being mixed in with the substrate in the bag. The larger the amount of substrate the larger the number of plates were added.
Once the bags were filled, they were sealed--making sure to leave plenty of air within the bag--and removed from the autoclaves. The bags were then placed in the 30°C for 1-2 weeks, depending on the rate of growth of mycelium into the substrate. Once there was a decent amount of mycelium grown the material was remixed under the laminar flow head, in order to distribute the mycelium more evenly, and then packed into molds (note that some bricks were also grown just leaving the mycelium to grow until the form was filled). There bricks were then left to fit, some in the 30oC incubator and others in a room temperature growth chamber, for another 1-2 weeks.
Once the mycelium had digested the substrate enough to form a solid block, it was removed from the mold, weighed, and baked at 120°C for several hours. Once the mycelium block was 30% of its original weight it was considered finished material.
Mycelium Glue
In designing our mycelium specific bioadhesive candidates, we looked for protein-based adhesive molecules that could be easily produced in E. coli and B. subtilis. We excluded highly glycosylated adhesive proteins as well as proteins with other significant post translational modifications (PTMs) simply because coordinating large PTMs in B. subtilis in space would be exceptionally challenging and beyond our capabilities for the summer. The last component of our criteria for identifying mycelium specific bioadhesive candidates revolved around the composition of mycelium itself. All fungus, mycelium included, contains an outer cell wall composed of chitin, which makes up the surface that would interface with the adhesive [1].
In nature, various organisms have evolved chitin-binding-domains (CBDs) that allow them to bind tightly to the fungal cell wall [2]. One of these organisms is Bacillus circulans from which we borrowed a CBD sequence [2]. Our first glue candidate uses this CBD in a fusion protein of four CBD’s with GSG"

The different between right and wrong is important to keep in mind when working with living organism’s DNA. A big part of our project have been to cover  some of the ethical aspect regarding our project and indeed the general use of synthetic biology. If you are more interested in our ethical work, please go to Ethics .
The use of laboratory animals is a grey area ethical speaking. We did a survey regarding the use of antibodies and test animals. People from different continents have answered this survey. It shows that people in general are a bit ambivalent about the use of laboratory animals. However, the majority would like if the animals in the antibody production could be substituted with an alternative, such as E. coli. To see the full analysis of the survey, go to survey .

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"ultures were induced by adding 0.5mM IPTG. Afterwards, one of the main-cultures was incubated at 30°C and the other at 25°C. We took samples of 500µL hourly and continued the incubation overnight.
Day 6
We took one sample of each main-culture from the day before and then lysed all samples in a sonication bath for about 30 minutes. The supernatant and the pellet of these samples were then tested separately via SDS-gelelectrophoresis.
Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain any clear results from the SDS gel and thus could not verify the expression of subtilisin E.
Testing the folding and activity
Day 1
We continued our experiments by performing a skim milk assay on agar plates. This assay utilizes the clearance of skim milk due to proteolysis to detect proteolytic activity. Therefore, we poured LB skim milk agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotic and streaked the E. coli BL21 cells containing the plasmid with the expression system.
Figure 1: Skim milk plates assay. Cells containing the empty backbone (right) and cells containing the expression system for native subtilisin E (left) after incubation for 3 days at 30°C.
Comparing the clearance of the skim milk plates, a proteolytic activity could be observed for the cells containing the expression system for native subtilisin E. As a result, we concluded that within three days these cells are able to produce the native protease which will then digest the skim milk in the agar plates, resulting in a clearance.
Conclusion
We were able to express subtilisin E in E. coli in amount high enough to be detected via skim milk assay.
Mutating the expression system
This phase of the project had two aims:
At first, we wanted to show that both the active site and the pro-peptide cleavage site of subtilisin E are essential for the activity of the enzyme. Thus, we planned to simulate the incorporation of ONBY and DMNBS by exchanging both amino acids at the target sites against bigger amino acids and then to analyze the activity of the mutated enzyme as a proof of principle.
Our second goal was to mutate our current expression system in order to exchange serine in the active site and tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site against the UAG amber stop codon in preparation for the expression of a photocaged enzyme.

The code was not sufficiently modularized and separated into functions to provide the dynamicism needed to handle varying numbers of graphs and equations.
Current code is more modularized and partitioned.

Human Practice
Last year, as Human Practice activity, we, five Japanese teams, sent out questionnaires to know how people think about biotechnology. (For more detailed information, please click here. From its result, we know that the public has little information on synthetic biology and gene recombination technology. (Fig1,2)
Fig1.Q-When shopping, do you buy ""not genetically modified food”?-  Avoidance index is an average when Always buy is 4 points, Tend to buy is 3 points, Hardly mind is 2points, and Not mind is 1point.
Fig2.Q-Have you ever heard the word, ""Synthetic biology""?- This is comparison between college student and the other.
The following were done to improve this situation.
Participating in
Science Agora
Science Agora , held at Tokyo Academic Park in November every year, is the largest science communication event in Japan. Participants are kids and parents, students, companies, researchers and so on.
We took part in it with two other Japanese teams last year after the end of 2010 iGEM competition. In this big meeting, we exhibited posters that we used in World Jamboree and gave an account of iGEM and our project to not only specialists but also the public by using new posters. This was also good chance to explain synthetic biology to the public.
Bio EXPO/ nano Bio EXPO
These are the Asia’s largest drug discovery and life science event. We visited booths of companies and explained iGEM and our works.
Official site: Bio EXPO / nano Bio EXPO
the alumni of TMU
We told about iGEM to alumni and alumnae of TMU (Tokyo Metropolitan University) and exhibited posters. Many people from not only the Biology Department but also other Departments were interested in our activity.
""Open Campus"" of TMU

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," for whole functional constructs     contributes to the complexity and makes specific explorations difficult     through the Parts Registry. So, assigning “reporter” for both atomic     parts and for whole constructs is not a good practice. Instead, we are     suggesting the usage of other available terminology for the parts listed     as reporters, which most of the constructs, now known as reporters,     can be grouped into, such as “protein generators”, “composite parts”     or “inverters”.
Devices are whole constructs which are functional and have specific     and distinct functions. But, as we have observed, unfortunately, the     term “device” is also being used for parts which are not functional     and do not have specific functional at all. Moreover, within the classification     of devices, we argue that some terms are also being used unnecessarily     and ambiguously. Devices are classified into five types which are protein     generators, reporters, inverters, receivers and senders, measurement     devices. For example iGEM defines protein generators as:
Protein generator = promoter + rbs +gene + terminator
Though we accept the definition for protein generators, we observed     that there exist numerous parts which are defined as protein generators     but actually most of them do not fit to the definition provided above.     Although some parts are not functional and do not generate proteins     at all, they are classified as protein generators, which makes searching     for the parts difficult in the registry. Furthermore, there are also     numerous parts which are defined as “composite parts” but actually they     fit to the same definition with protein generators. In order to overcome     the problem of misuse of device type we have extracted related image     ID information for the composite parts. Image ID information helped     us to correctly categorize composite parts depending on its individual     atomic parts and identify the ones with more than one function, such     as being both inhibitor and activator. In other words, we used image     and part IDs in order to merge an input for its outputs.
Subtitle working conditions, includes all the detailed information     about the experimental properties of parts, and the details about the     working process of individual parts and complete devices. Additionally,     we marked the subtitle “Working Condition” in our standardization template     as potentially the most important title that helps synthetic biologist     to better understand the parts functions at iGEM’s part registry database.     The main problem we have encounter with the subtitle “working condition”     is within most of the parts the details about working process is not     enough and not provided regularly.
Examples of Misuse of Terminology:

Moreover, the promoter would indirectly lead to the appearance of the red color. The timer and the counter share the same mechanism to output the signal.
(4)  Memory System
The basic idea of this memory system was first developed by KULeuven during the 2008 iGEM competition. It is composed of two conjugated sequences. (See more details here )
By the work of these sequences, the inducer (lactose) is distinguished and memorized, and then drives the whole device.  When the inducer is removed, however, the function of whole device can be switched to a contrary one.  ( It can only be switched on once and can never go back. )
We use the lactose to control the initiation and closure of the system. However, it’s contradictory that the system should initiate the counter only in the final stage but not in the second stage; even the functions in these two stages are both shut down. Hence, we can save the input signal into the memory system to solve the problem. The memory system can remember the input signal even when external conditions have changed.
In the memory system, we connect two sequences of tetR and CIIP22 proteins downstream the promoter which is repressed by the CI434 protein. During the lactose-accession stage, the translation of tetR and CIIP22 is repressed, and meanwhile promote the other sequence to produce the CI434 protein. It means that the repression of two conjugated sequences reverses. Thereafter, no matter what surrounding becomes, the product of this memory system doesn’t change.
(5)  LuxR Operon
Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) is a kind of auto-inducer. It serves as the communicative signal in the bacterial self-illumination mechanism
The LuxR protein is a membrane receptor which distinguishes AHL compound liberated by bacteria and passes down the signals. When external bacteria aggregate, the concentration of AHL will rise to the boundary level and cause the production of AHL-LuxR complex. This complex then becomes a translated factor and starts the translation of the Lux operon.
Based on the Lux auto-inducer mechanism, we can insert the target sequences into the Lux operon. By doing so, we can regulate any device we want. In addition, we inserted a sequence of LuxI protein downstream of the Lux operon. The LuxI protein impels the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to transform into AHL. This becomes another way of regulation"

BBa_K249002: Lumazine Synthase - Lumazine Synthase is an enzyme which creates Lumazine, a product which aggregates forming a hollow spheroid which can act as a mirocompartment, or artificial organelle. The Lumazine forms negatively charged pores, which can be used to introduce proteins. The proteins which are being introduced into the microcompartment must be equipped with an Arginine Tag. This is a protein coding part. Submitted.
BBa_K249004: N-terminal Arginine Fusion vector - pSB1A3 with an N-terminal Arginine tag. This particular plasmid utilizes the BioFusion (aka Silver Lab) Standard for BioBrick assembly at the suffix, and the regular BioBrick standard at the prefix. Adds 10 Arginine residues to the N-terminus of a Protein (includes Start Codon AUG).  This part is meant to work in conjunction with the Lumazine synthase microcompartment. Protein with the N-terminal Arginine fusion will be localized into the negative core of the Lumazine microcompartments. Submitted.

Unfortunately, we were unable to find a source showing an image of amilCP at a set concentration, and we didn't have the equipment to find this ourselves. This would give us an indication of when it became visible (eg,777nM could be invisible or very intense). We took this into account and tested to see if there would be any steady increase in amilCP levels on smaller timescales. We used t=1050 (30 seconds after translation begins) and t=1200 (arbitrary increase). These are the results:

As you can see, there is still the notable threshold iron level, below which amilCP is lower, above which amilCP is higher. There is no steady increase over the range of values we would need to test. We simulated for many different times, and even varied FURt to see if that made a difference, but the pattern continued.
Finally, we simulated a larger time scale of 24 hours and varied FURt again, but the same pattern emerged:

Finally, we tried varying DNA concentration. We did this by quoting a different value for k_tx from our literature. All previous values had been based on a DNA concentration of 60nM, but we can also try simulating 10nM, but changing k_tx. This is the graph it produced:

Summary
We set out to prove whether our simple iron test would work in an in vitro environment in a cell-free system. We first successfully modelled our reactions in terms of ODEs. We then attempted to solve the equations in with three different methods: analytically by integration, using the MatLab ODE function and using the Euler method. Unfortunately, it was not"

He also made liquid cultures of the 1-5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, and 18 T7-RFP variants and the T7-const/lac/lac2 Lysis promoters and the 3 variants (14, 16, 17). These are for a lysis and RFP experiment with IPTG planned for Wednesday.
Vincent received the sequences for Nadine's 3 colonies (J6 1 & 4 Plac-RFP, K1-TetR-LacI 9) but did not have time to analyze them.
Wednesday, August 31 2011
Vincent made new Gibson master mixes using TAQ ligase (there are now 12 tubes that can do 2 Gibsons each).
Vincent ran a plateread er experiment with thoe three T7-lysis constructs (const / lac / lac2) and the various T7-RFP variants. It looks as though lysis was induced in at least one T7 system. Vincent made more liquid cultures of the T7-lysis systems and their variants for another platereader experiment on Thursday.
Vdog also made a Gibson of J6 Plac-Lys and transformed it into BL21 cells (plated all 300 uL). He made another Gibson attempt at the elusive K1-Tet-Lac and transformed that into the DH5 alpha cells (plated 150 uL). He did not forget that one of the plates had ampicillin resistance and the other had kanamycin.
Vincent also made a colony PCR of the remaining 5 (out of the 18) RFP variants in DH5 alpha. He chose different colonies from the plates to see if those would fare better.
He also tried to clone the version of the psB3K1 backbone that does not have TetR (we think it's the one that's labelled 1:10 on the eppendorf top but we're not sure). He used the K1-extensino primers. Hopefully, these will be good for Gibsoning the remaining T7-Lysis variants into K1. It will also be used to make the negative control (co-transformed with RFP, eventually).

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ytosing region of the cell are taken into the cell.
R9 peptides seem to work effectively whether or not R9 peptides are fused with target proteins.  However, there are few examples about endocytosis of plants, so we needed to check the function of R9 when used on plant cells.
Fig.3-2  Mechanism of endocytosis by R9 peptide
1.R9 peptides adhere to a cell membrane of a plant because of their hydrophobic character.
2.The cell responds to this stimulus and starts to endocytose.
3.FT protein around an invaginating region of the cell are taken into the cell.
Given the R9 system, it induces endocytosis whether R9 peptides and target proteins are fused or not.
Considering this system, target proteins near the R9 peptides are taken into cells by endocytosis.  So, we assumed that the system would induce endocytosis in both cases where R9 peptides and target proteins were fused and not fused.
However, as we wanted to introduce proteins as efficiently as possible, we deliberated whether we should fuse R9 and target proteins.
We thought the shorter the distance between R9 peptides and target proteins is, the more easily they are taken into a plant cell. Therefore, we expected that fusing R9 peptide and a target protein would lead to higher efficiency.
So, we tried to fuse R9 peptides and target proteins to increase penetration efficiency
We transformed E.coli, fusing R9 pepetides and target protein's gene in line. By doing this, we tried to make E.coli express R9::GFP fusion protein.
In order to visualize the function of R9, we tried to prepare R9::GFP fusion protein. However, E.coli expressing the R9::GFP fusion protein was not effectively cultivated.(Fig3-3). Then, we checked whether R9 peptides had a bad effect on the expression of R9::GFP fusion protein by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Although we succeeded in confirming the existence of the mRNA (Fig3-4), we did not find the proteins (Fig3-5). These results are probably caused by poor translation or quick breakdown of the protein.
We used the existing GFP generator part, BBa_I746915 .

It is necessary to notice that DsbA-mbp has to be located on the upstream of other parts, for there is a PstI enzyme digestion site, resulting in the only way to digest DsbA-mbp with EcoRI and SpeI. To test the function of the device, both expression experiment and function test is necessary. As a result,the size of the expressed proteins have been verified with SDS-page and Western blot. Besides, to verify the efficiency of mercury binding, we also carried out the function test with ICP-AES, which can test the quantity of mercury binding by the bacteria with the device.
Results:
Expression of proteins
The Dsba-mbp, mbp and lpp-ompa-mbp are inserted into the commercial plasmid PET21A. Then the plasmid is transferred to E.coli strain BL21, which can generate T7polyerase when induced with IPTG. Both induced cells and uninduced cells(as control) are centrifuged to get the cytosol, the periplasm and the membrane separated. The SDS-page and Western blot of the expressed proteins in these three parts(figure2) show that induced cells expressed an identical IPTG-inducible protein at the proper place with the size of ~12kD for MBP, ~40kD for DsbA-MBP and ~27kD for LPP-OMPA-MBP, all of which are consist with the predicted size, indicating that all these three coding sequence can be expressed normally in the right place.

Function test
We mainly used two methods to evaluate the capability and efficacy of our bioabsorbent:
For qualitative measurement, we invented a creative method to directly visualize the detoxification process of our bioabsorbent.  Firstly, we synthesized a water-soluble metal indicator, TritonX-100-PAN-S, according to the method in reference. Treated with pure sulfuric acid by stirring reaction overnight at room temperature, 1-(2-Pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN) was sulfonated to make it water-soluble. (Scheme 2-1) After ether sedimentation and washing, we obtained the raw product, PAN-S, which was a reddish-brown solid powder. (Figure 2-2A) Then we mixed PAN-S and Triton"

It is suppose that its concentration reach such levels that aspartate will spread through bacteria membranes, because there is no glutamate exporter known in E. coli. This construction would be made in a high copy plasmid.
Glutamate causes lower chemotactic response than aspartate in Escherichia coli. That is why finally we focused on building aspartate and saliccylate devices and forgot glutamate as attractant to E. coli.
Salicylate
Also known as salicylic acid, salicylate is a beta hydroxy acid that is used in organic synthesis and as a phytohormone. Salycilate is biosynthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine. In our proyect we will use another route, that involves two enzymes: isochorismate pyruvate lyase and isochorismate synthase. This chemical has a lot of medicinal uses.
In our project, there would be used a designed device, under control of PprhJ/PfecA promoter, that converts chorismate into salicylate, because of the production of PchB and PchA enzymes. This fact will only happened in response to bacteria interaction with plant cell walls, in the same way that the other chemoattractants. It is suppose that its concentration reach such levels that aspartate will spread through bacteria membranes. This construction would be made in a high copy plasmid.
Salicylate is a chemoattractant for many bacterias but not for E. coli. That is why using this chemoattractant in our circuit it is necessary the utilization of Pseudomonas putida G7, a strain that is naturally chemotactic to salicylate, as chemotactic population, while E. coli play the role of sensing population.

This week we managed to construct our N-butyryl-HSL (Rhl system) inducible ampicillin resistance cassette (R0071-B0032-AmpR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0071) and our N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL (Las system) inducible ampicillin resistance cassette (K091117-B0032-AmpR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0079). Furthermore, the constructs of the amilGFP cassette (J23100-B0032-K592010-B0015), the N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL synthase LasI and eforRed cassette (B0032-C0076-B0015-J23100-B0032-K592012-B0015), the N-butyryl-HSL synthase RhlI and aeBlue cassette (B0032-C0070-B0015-J23100-B0032-K864401-B0015) and terminator-modified N-butyryl-HSL (Rhl system) inducible Amp-resistance cassette (B0015-R0071-B0032-AmpR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0071) are nearly finished. Additionally we started our first test runs with the new chromoproteins.

We digested the N-butyryl-HSL/RhlR induced ampicillin resistance cassette (R0071-B0032-ampR) , the Rhl transcription factor (RhlR) cassette (B0015-J23100)-B0032-C0071), the N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL/LasR induced ampicillin resistance cassette (K091117-B0032-ampR) and the Las-transcription factor (LasR) cassette (B0015-J23100-B0032-C0079) to ligate them to new constructs. The N-butyryl-HSL/RhlR inducible ampicillin resistance cassette (R0071-B0032-ampR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0071) is supposed to be combined with the RhlR cassettte while the the N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL/LasR inducible ampicillin resistance cassette (K091117-B0032-ampR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0079) is intended to be combined"

What is the problem?
Annually, over 400,000 US residents fall ill due to infections caused by foodborne antibiotic resistant bacteria. The antibiotic resistance in these bacteria typically originate from the misuse of antibiotics in agriculture. Unfortunately, in the animal sector antibiotics are still overused, accelerating the further development of antibiotic resistance ( Physicians Committee 2017 ).
How is it regulated now?
Currently, there are 3 strategies to combat antibiotic resistance: prevention, treatment and new therapeutics ( Netherlands Center for One Heath 2016 ). The problem with prevention strategies and new therapeutics is that they depend on very extensive clinical trials. These trials will take longer than the validation of a detection device, that can be employed for the treatment strategies. Therefore, we focused on developing a tool that could contribute to frontline diagnostics and new treatment methods to stop the increasing use of antibiotics, which we exploit to fight antibiotic resistance in agriculture ( van Mierlo 2016 ).
Our vision
In our project, we developed a versatile, RNA-based detection tool that can reveal antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria. Once you know that a bacterium is resistant to a certain antibiotic, you can develop a more responsible treatment plan, excluding the antibiotics that you know for sure will not work. This approach reduces the development of more antibiotic resistance, thus contributing to the fight against this huge problem.
Which infection?
In the Netherlands, the dairy industry contributes to a large amount of the total revenue of the Dutch food production  ( Statistics Netherlands (CBS) 2015 ). Through our interactions with farmers, veterinarians and health and safety experts we found out that the most common disease in the dairy industry today is mastitis (check out our Integrated Human Practices page for more information). Mastitis is an infection of the cow-udder, causing over 100 million euros of damage annually in the Netherlands alone ( GD Diergezondheid 2017 ). Like most infections, mastitis is treated with antibiotics. As mastitis is a very common disease, responsible treatment is essential to minimise the spread of antibiotic resistance. We did this by testing for whether the infecting bacteria is already resistant to a certain type of antibiotics.
Mastitis is one of the two most common diseases on the farm.
