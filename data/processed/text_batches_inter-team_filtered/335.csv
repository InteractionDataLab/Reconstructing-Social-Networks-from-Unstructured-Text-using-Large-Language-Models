Figure 2. Statistic of global resistant weeds
In the meantime, it is proved that these malignant weeds resist to 155 different herbicides and 22 of the 25 known herbicide acting spots became no effective. So they are too hard to manage.
Pollution
Today, more than 300 kinds of pesticides are commonly used in China. Their improper use has resulted in serious environmental problems.
In 1990, China's pesticides production was about seven hundred thousand tons. Only after 20 years, the output increased to 1.73 million tons with 13.4 kg/ha/year average dosage.
Unfortunately, 60%- 70% pesticides would be left in soil. It is proved that residual herbicide is harmful to crops by changing the soil PH, temperature etc, and this effect will last for at least 2 or 3 years. Some examples, The destructive herbicide sodium pentachlorophenol will cause potential phytotoxicity in a large area and result in crop failure. Gramoxone and 2,4-D etc these toxic pesticides, will easily volatilize and are able to drift over nearly 800 meters through spraying center, which could influence distant crops.
Poisoning
In Germany, the glyphosate content is 0.46-29.74μg/L in fourteen commonest beer which far exceeds the standard content 0.1μg/L. Because of bio-accumulation, human body becomes a container of chemicals under the long-term potential exposure of pesticides.
Then it causes mucosal congestion, gene mutation and various inflammatory reactions. With the toxicant being absorbed into the blood circulation, it not only results in the mononuclear phagocyte, lymphocyte and liver losing the function of defense and synthesis but also causes the pathological process of tissue diffusion, humoral diffusion even nerve diffusion.
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) lists more than 10 kinds of pesticide such as glyphosate and sodium chlorate in “probably carcinogenic”. And epidemiological studies have found that glyphosateharborsm mutagenicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity, cytotoxicity and reproductive toxicity. It has been estimated that at least three million cases of pesticide poisoning occur worldwide each year, including 220,000 deaths which caused by long-term occupational exposure.

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,", which probably means that I really, really need to get a life.  This summer I am looking forward to stepping outside the lab and tackling an entrepreneurial project. I am incredibly excited to see what we discover and hopefully see our FRED project from last year move into the real world. I’ll no doubt still be enjoying the late nights in the lab, but will hopefully be able to gain a good perspective on the business side of things. In my spare time I enjoy beating David at flight control, collecting stuffed pandas as well as taking drinks from my favourite water fountain in the Health Sciences Centre.
David Lloyd
This is my fifth year being involved in iGEM in which time I have had the opportunity to work with the Alberta team for two years as an undergraduate, two years as a team advisor for Calgary Collegiate, and now with the Calgary Entrepreneurial Team. I have completed a BSc and MSc in Biochemistry and now am pursuing the FREDsense Technologies venture full time. I am very passionate for using my synthetic biology experience as a manager, entreprenuer, and educator and hope to merge these passions into an exciting career in the future. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!

I have just graduated with my Bachelors degree from the University of Calgary. This is my third year being involved with iGEM, and my first trip into the entrepreneurial category. I was heavily involved in the technical design of FRED and am the electrochemist for our group. I will continue my technical role as a member of FREDsense Technologies by focusing on the development of our platform technology.
Lisa Oberding
I graduated recently from the University of Calgary with a degree in Cellular, Molecular, and Microbial Biology, and am now pursuing my M.Sc. in Petroleum Microbiology. This is my second year with iGEM, which I got involved with as a chance to gain more research experience, learn about synthetic biology, and further define my research interests. I was involved last year with developing the sensor element of FRED, however moving forward with FREDsense I have found myself taking on more of a business focused role. I find that I am enjoying the experience of learning a completely foreign skill-set as well as getting to see science and research from a completely new direction.

Mathias and Lau made good progress in investigating live imaging of Mycelia. The purpose is to nail down real parameters spaces for use in simulations. We handed in the safety assessment to DTU Byg (Mechanical Department) for review/verification and got a short tour of the material lab. Many different people were contacted in regards to material supply and modeling/simulation. More growth boxes were manufactured.

Experiment: First insertion of genes into a backbone
The purpose of this experiment is twofold. Firstly, to gain experience in using the basic techniques associated with molecular biology. Secondly, the scientific focus of the experiment is to perform an insertion of the MelA gene () and the CaMV 35S promoter (BBa_K1825004) into seperate backbone for amplification in E. coli This is followed by a miniprep to extract the plasmids.  The DNA delivered by IDT was suspended in EB buffer protocol . Using part 1 and 2 from the BioBrick tutorial (Later adapted together with the resuspension the parts were digested and ligated with the backbone from RFP (BBa_J04450)
Mycolab Overview

Reinoculation of plates: A. oryzae inoculated on new plates in three point inoculation with spores from spore suspension. So far, inoculation has been done with mycelia from earlier plates. Three plates were incubated as normally in 28°C and one at 4°C to see how the fungus fares at lower temperatures.
Boxes: Rice boxes were quite hard after only two days in the incubator, which was viewed as a very good sign.
17/7/2018
Baking of boxes: After autoclavation the boxes were quite moist and therefore fell apart quite easily. In stead of autoclaving, microwaving or baking normally was suggested to avoid the bricks being too wet.  Box from Skyttegaarden was put in the microwave. After 10 min it was still wet.
Protoplastation and transformation: Protoplastation was initialised according to the Protoplastation and Tranformation protocol .

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#Hardware#Pump_-_-_TEXT.html," sources of error such as inaccuracies in 3D-printing would not be within our power to resolve. Moreover, the angle was very slight and otherwise undetectable by visual inspection. An obvious solution would be to decrease the height of the central rotor column, and then shift the entire rotor assembly upwards, but this would not be ideal. As the load moves further along the shaft, the angular deflection of the shaft increases. While the increase in deflection would definitely be negligible in this case, such a solution would be bad design practice. Hence, we elected to countersink the bolts because this approach allows us to easily visually inspect the rotor to ensure clearance between it and the faceplate of the stepper motor.
However, a flat-head bolt of equivalent size could not be countersunk directly into the Aachen design as there was too little material remaining to hold the bolt in place. We then simplified the rotor base, and thus produced what you see in Figure 2.
CLOSE
IMPROVEMENT 2 - ADDING MATERIAL FOR FASTENER
Our second modification was to add material for the fastening screw. A drawback of the 2015 team’s design was the weakness of the bolt and nut combination fastening the rotor to the stepper motor shaft (Figure 3).
Figure 3. The wall separating the fastening nut and the shaft was less than 0.5mm thick. When we attempted to 3D-print the Aachen 2015 rotor, our 3D printer was not precise enough to produce such a thickness, or rather, thinness. While the rotor was still functional in this state, we felt that this design had room for improvement. The type of fastening nut here used was arbitrary.
We thickened the wall separating the fastening nut and the shaft by 2.75 mm, placing the nut 6mm away from the centre of the shaft (Figure 4). We also thickened the wall between the bolt head and the nut. This design can thus better withstand mechanical stresses, and is more durable.
Figure 4. The circled parts show where we have added material around the fastening bolt for a sturdier structure.
CLOSE
IMPROVEMENT 3 - REPOSITIONING INLET & OUTLET
The third modification we made was to reposition the inlet and outlet for the silicone tubing.
Aachen 2015’s design stacked several Plexiglass layers on the stepper motor’s faceplate, forming a housing to hold a silicone tube inside a circular path. We noticed that Aachen 2015’s silicone tubes had a smaller outer and inner diameter"

Participation in iGEM Japan
iGEM Japan is an alliance of Japanese iGEM teams conceived as a platform for enhancing communication and cooperation between teams, as well as collectively promoting iGEM in Japan. We participated in several meetings to discuss the direction, membership and activities of this group. Two of iGEM Japan's major activities this year were the iGEM Japan Meet-up and a comprehensive, nation-wide Human Practices survey. Please look at the result for further information.
Joint proposal for Request for Comments (RFC)
The iGEM teams of Osaka and Edinburgh encountered similar problems in designing PCR primers incorporating the standard BioBrick Prefix and Suffix. Together, we drafted and submitted a joint proposal for a Request for Comments which was accepted as BBF RFC 54 .

Videogames
We also decided to make two videogames in order to explain our project and to promote synthetic biology among the internet community.
“Allergen Beast Adventures” is an adventure platformer in which Allergen Beast (our green mascot symbolizing Pichia Pastoris) travels through a series of levels fighting each of allergy.  Meanwhile, in “Antifreeze Brotein: Ecoli´s Redemption” the player takes the role of our blue E.Coli mascot as he travels from the cytoplasm to outer space destroying ice crystals.
Both games are not only meant to be fun or aesthetically pleasing, but also educational. By exploiting the visual potential of the human brain, we decided to stimulate memory retention and emotional engagement with specially crafted games. They intend to transmit a positive message, how synthetic biology works a tool to solve problems.   The mix between fun and learning was planned from the beginning; the main concepts of synthetic biology were placed in the games’ storyline as a fundamental part of the structure. This allows the player to ignore any social taboos towards biotechnology and simply enjoy the game. The basic rules for gameplay come from terms and events happening at a molecular level. For example, Allergen Beast must consume YPD in order to restore life points; this game mechanic makes an analogy towards the medium that yeast organisms consume as they grow.
But why videogames?
Instead of choosing a more passive communication medium, we decided to establish more interactive dialogue with our audience. Videogames are used as a tool for learning since most of their design comes from Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development. This theory describes a mental place where a person’s intellectually ability, of what he or she can do with and without help, is constantly challenged.  Videogames give certain instructions and guidelines for the user to follow in order to proceed, once this knowledge is acquired the player may proceed to higher levels and continue to refine his or her skills.
Moreover, our culture has become mainly visual resulting in a high demand for aesthetically pleasing designs. The difference between this approach and the ones done face to face with students is the area of impact. Going to visit high school students and sharing ideas with them makes a profound impact in young people’s lives. However by expanding synthetic biology with the world, in a fun innovative way, we hope to reach a global audience, we hope"

NetLogo Environmental Simulation: A Stochastic Fish Population Model
The NetLogo Environmental Simulation helped the iGEM team visually represent the effects of minute concentrations of estrogen in a body of water when there is a food chain of algae, fish, and eagles involved. The employment of this model in a classroom setting engages students into the visualization of a population crash dependent on the variables, educates them about ecological systems, food chains, and endocrine disruptors, and excites them with the user’s choice around the parameters, offering a different outcome every time. A guide to setting up and using Netlogo can be found at NetLogo Tutorial

Conversion
i) Introduction
When examined in order, conversion is the second step of device system. While in literature searches, it is found that methanotrophs which live in either extreme conditions or in deep oceans, the process is the same, methane is converted to methanol which is the oxygenated form of hydrocarbon group. The searches directed us to organism Methylococcus capsulatus which is one of the mostly studied organisms among methanotrophs. We designed the conversion part of this organism and modified coding operon according to E.coli strain to enhance the expression. The monoxygenase coding part with  protein A, B and C products are designed for conversion step of  this project.
ii) Background
Methanotrophs - methane oxidizing bacteria- are ubiquitous in the environment and play an important role in mitigating global warming because they are a unique group of gram-negative bacteria that grow aerobically on methane as sole source of carbon and energy (Hanson and Hanson 1996). They are also potentially interesting for industrial applications such as production of bulk chemicals or bioremediation. Methanotrophs converts methane to methanol and subsequently to formaldehyde which is assimilated or further oxidized to CO2 for biosynthesis of cellular forms.In this biosynthesis pathway the conversion of  methane to  methanol is catalysed  by  methane monooxygenase (MMO) which is a non-specific enzyme complex that also catalyse the oxidation of  a wide range of aliphatic,  alicyclic  and aromatic compounds  (Colby  et a l . , 1977; Higgins et a l . ,1979). The first step in the oxidation of methane to precursors of organic compounds is the conversion to methanol by methane monooxygenase, the key enzyme, which exists in two forms: the cytoplasmic, soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and the membrane-bound, particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO).  sMMO components have been expressed in heterologous and homologous hosts. Therefore we searched more on soluble form of monooxygenase enzyme. When analyzed in detail, pMMo"

Curdlan has also found applications in non-food sectors. Its water-holding capacity is applied in the formulation of “superworkable” concrete, where its enhanced fluidity prevents cement and small stones from segregating [8]. It has also been proposed as an organic binding agent for ceramics [9]. In addition, curdlan gels have medical and pharmacological potential, for example in drug delivery through sustained and diffusion-controlled release of the active ingredient. [10]
Furthermore, Curdlan derivatives are members of a class of compounds known as biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal natural defenses. Useful properties include antitumor, anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant activities [11]. Hydrolysed Curdlan with a degree of polymerisation <50 are not effective anti-tumor agents but the carboxymethyl ether and the sulphate and phosphate esters of Curdlan, show an enhanced biological activity [12]. Furthermore, Curdlan sulphate has anti-HIV activity [13] and inhibitory effects on the development of malarial parasites in vitro [14]. All the other Curdlan clinical applications in cancer, diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia etc. are listed here . Curdlan also has potential for exploitation as a new biomaterial based on the self-assembling ability of (1→3)-β-glucan-megalosaccharides (DP 30–45) to form single, hexagonal, lamellar nanocrystalline structures (∼8–9 nm"

He and Mrs. Mattila explained to us that in the Netherlands it is assumed that the population only takes melatonin after             consultation with a doctor and that the number of studies on melatonin for             short-term use is sufficient since there are no worrying side effects when taken correctly,             but there are not enough studies on melatonin for a longer period. In addition,             we learned that it is apparently not enough to raise general awareness to the positive effects of melatonin in the society.
An amendment to the law in Germany could only be achieved by pressure from the pharmaceutical industry.             Then, melatonin could be available in Germany for humans under fifty-five, too.
To learn more about the process of drug approval in the EU and to inform yourself about the risks and when it is reasonable to supplement melatonin,             please read our interview below.
The Interview
Katrin: Have you heard about the correlation between Melatonin and neurological disorders, like depression, Parkinson's,            Alzheimer's disease and fibromyalgia?
Leon Bongers: We know that a melatonin disbalance can play a role in many disorders like the ones that you mentioned.             But I think there is too little data available concerning the effects on giving melatonin to correct the imbalance in this disorders,            there haven't been specific claims for melatonin disorders.             So it hasn't played a part in the authorization application that we have had so far.
Katrin: We think it would be interesting to know more about the process of the medical authorization in the CBG and also how             you work together with the EU.
Leon Bongers: The MEB and most regulatory authorities in Europe only work by paper.             The tests are being done by a pharmaceutical company that often relies completely on papers and literature.             A company submits to us a dossier with detail on the manufacturing, indication, and safety of the product.            Then the application is assessed by different specialized assessment groups, for example, clinical assessors like Taina,             but there is also a non-clinical assessment. The assessors make reports which are scheduled for a board meeting.             The MEB consists mainly of two parts, the board with about 17 highly educated professors who are making the final decision             on an application, and the drafters of the report, me as a regulator et cetera who are doing the work and prepare the reports for             the board.

We are programming E.Coli bacteria to sense the presence of a     specific substance and process the signal to produce a green light     as well as signal to neighboring bacteria to follow suit, causing a     chain reaction. This makes the green light visible to the naked eye,     alerting the consumer of the presence of the substance. Along the way, we plan to build (and make available to future iGEM     teams), many useful sub-systems which will include: a Histidine     Kinase two component signaling system (which will detect new     materials), 6 different double-repression toggle switches (along     with the proper characterization), a chemically synthesized     photo-switching molecule (activated by the green light produced     by the bacteria themselves) which can connect cells, creating a     synthetic biofilm, and a method of constructing genetic sequences     with Gibson addresses which will make the high-throughput     construction of complex biobricks possible.

OUR TEAM
The UCSF iGEM program was created in 2007, with the belief that      students regardless of age could participate in synthetic biology.      This year, UCSF and UCB have combined forces to produce a team      composed of five graduates from San Francisco’s Abraham Lincoln      High School’s Biotechnology Program, two returning iGEM alumni,      two undergraduates from UC Berkeley, and one exchange student      from Peking University. While we all have different backgrounds      and knowledge, we are united in our desire to learn, contribute,      and succeed.

Summary: In nature, many organisms must make multicellular decisions,     whether the cells are part of a community of unicellular organisms     or an organ in a multicellular organism. In some cases, the     decision reaches a consensus and all cells respond similarly, such     as in quorum sensing by some species of bacteria. Decisions may     also favor a diversified response, in which some cells respond     strongly to a signal while others are downregulated or"

At the first step, we transformed the plasmid we designed into the E.coli ,and inoculated it in M9 medium- which containing 36 g/L glucose, 5 g/L yeast extract,100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and 1,000th dilution of Trace Metal Mix A5 (2.86 g H3BO3, 1.81 g MnCl2 ⋅4H2O, 0.222 g ZnSO4 ⋅7H2O, 0.39 g Na2MoO4⋅2H2O, 0.079 g CuSO4⋅5H2O, 49.4 mg Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O per liter water)-into the first tank. Then, we culture the E.coli in 37°C  environment for three hours which means that we put the tank in the warm bath to let E.coli produce the intermediate,2-ketoisovalerate.
(2)30°C
Afterward, we put our E.coli into 30°C environment maintained by warm bath for 3 days incubation. Our low temperature control system would initiate expression of kivd which would convert 2-ketoisovalerate to isobutyraldehyde. Then, isobutyraldehyde would be converted into isobutanol by E.coli's own alcohol dehydrogenase(ADH).
(3) preliminary distillation
After incubating the “E.coline” in 30°C environment for three days, the concentration of isobutanol is high enough to be collected. We prepared two  flasks which contained half-filled cold water and each of them is equipped with a condenser. The three flasks were linked with pipes. One end of the pipe (air out) must be under the water level, so that the air would expose into water"

Histamine-Tar novel chemoreceptor
We successfully redesigned, cloned and tested a novel Histamine-Tar            chemoreceptor . The design was done with the Rosetta bioinformatics tool,            by following the protocol published by Moretti, R. et al. (1). The goal was to design a binding pocket for a selected small ligand.  The Rosetta’s design process for the new ligand, Histamine, produced 870 results, out of which 11 variants remained after filtering. The 11 variants were cloned into the native Tar ligand binding domain (LBD), out of these only 6 exhibited the expected sequences in sequencing and thus were subjected to chemotaxis tests. Out of all 6 tested variants only one showed chemotactic response, the ability to be attracted to Histamine. Furthermore, the sequencing results proved that the only mutations that were present in this variant were those planned by the Rosetta’s design.
Fig. 1: Histamine-Tar filtering process scheme.
We observed the bacteria’s response to the attractant, Histamine, by using a microscope assay. It is evident in figure 3b that roughly 20 minutes after the addition of the Histamine, the bacterial concentration in the vicinity of the Histamine is much greater than in the beginning of the experiment (figure 3a).

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM project.
As you may recall, the aim of our project was to create a bacterial Pico Plumber, capable of detecting and mending broken pipes. This required us to design three main modules, namely the AND Gate, the Quorum sensing device and the Latch. The AND gate ensured that expression of our two component glue commenced only in the presence of IPTG, released from the breach, and once a threshold population density was reached. The quorum sensing module was necessary in order for the e.coli to communicate and sense this threshold density and the latch ultimately induced timed cell-lysis, in response to the AND gate being switched into the ON state.
An emergent concern of the committee was the potential danger to an individual under the circumstance that our lysyl oxidase expressing E.coli be accidentally ingested, and subsequently replicate to high levels in the gut. In response to this issue we highlighted the theoretical ability of our system to self-lyse, once a critical population density is reached. This response can be seen in the section entitled ‘mitigation for potential from harm’.
We were, therefore, granted permission to commence our project under the proposed constraints: we were required to prove, with submitted experimental evidence, that the automatic holin-based cell lysis system worked, prior to expressing our two component biological glue (tropoelastin and lysyl oxidase components).
You can see the proposal document that we submitted to our Institute's Genetic Manipulation Advisory Group (GMAG) Committee here . This body reviews applications to manipulate genes at the University of Aberdeen, and issues approval for such projects once they have been assessed for risk. In the linked document, the section dealing with 'Mitigation of potential for harm' is highlighted yellow, and describes the precautions that were adopted in carrying out a synthetic biology project where the assembled genetic circuit was expected to exhibit emergent properties.
Overall the Local Genetic Manipulation Committee after extensive review, was satisfied that the project as outlined, and with the 'Mitigation of potential for harm' safeguards discussed above, posed no dangers. None of the BioBricks synthesised raised any safety issues.
Ethics in Synthetic Biology
Ethics are a substantial part of how we perceive ourselves and our society.  ‘Making an ethical choice depends on how we imagine ourselves, what we admire, how we are willing to be admired, what we are prepared to say we admire.’ (Saul, 2001). What then, are the ethics of synthetic biology?  Perhaps we need to start even further back and really agree on what synthetic biology is, as many, even arguably"

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," for genetic engineering of bacteria (40). The enzymes that covalently modify glyphosate have been successfully introduced into crops to increase herbicide resistance (43).  Recently, it has been also demonstrated that enhanced export of glyphosate can reduce toxicity of the herbicide. For instance, the overexpression of the uncharacterized membrane proteins MFS40 and YhhS from Aspergillus oryzae and E. coli, respectively, with similarity to the major facilitator secondary transporter superfamily, enhance glyphosate tolerance of E. coli (Figure 12) (44,45). It will be interesting to test whether these transporters are suitable for engineering crops to enhance glyphosate tolerance. Proteins of unknown function can also increase glyphosate tolerance. For instance, the overexpression of the igrA gene product from the Pseudomonas sp. strain PG2982 increases glyphosate tolerance in transgenic rice (46-48). Finally, many bacteria can survive in the presence of glyphosate because they are able to degrade the herbicide (Figure 12) (49-58). To conclude, several mechanisms of glyphosate resistance have been described over the past years and novel mechanisms allowing survival with the herbicide are certainly identified in the future. We have observed that the deletion of the gltT gene in B. subtilis confers high-level glyphosate resistance to the bacteria. The B. subtilis gltT mutant strain could be a suitable host to identify glyphosate uptake systems from plants by expressing cDNA libraries and by screening for transformants that are unable to grow with glyphosate.

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetoxification_-_-_TEXT.html," agricultural waste. Bioethanol and biodiesel can be blended or used as automobile fuel, among other uses. One way to produce biofuels from biomass is by using bacteria to ferment the sugars in plant matter to fuel alcohols. However, the bioenergy industry faces problems converting this inexpensive plant matter into high value fuels. Biomass is tough to break down and requires costly pretreatment processes before it can be converted to fuel. Pretreatment produces toxic byproducts, including furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), which will kill cell cultures and inhibit the conversion of biomass to usable sugars.
To solve this problem, we intend to engineer bacteria with a recently discovered metabolic pathway that consumes furfural and HMF. Koopman et. al. identified the six enzyme pathway from Cupriavidus basilensis and showed that it functions in Pseudomonas putida.  In C. basilensis or P. putida, HMF can be used as the sole carbon source. Engineering bacteria with this pathway would allow them to survive and produce biofuels but also use the toxic HMF as an energy source. However, this pathway does not function in Esherichia coli is commonly used to manufacture valuable chemicals, including fuels, because it is fast growing, easily manipulated, and well-studied.  Based on our recent experiments, the pathway also does not function in Pseudomonas fluorescens, a microbial relative of P. putida.
The first and foremost objective of our research is to identify the genomic differences that allow the pathway to function in one organism, P. putida, but not E. coli or P. fluorescens.  We will do this using a novel approach, combinatorial dCas9 gene knockdown.  Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that cleaves DNA at precise locations.  Cas9 binds CRISPR RNAs (clustered regularly spaced short palindromic repeats) in order to bind corresponding DNA sties.  The deactivated form of Cas9, dCas9, contains two mutations that block its endonuclease activity, but it still can stably bind DNA and block transcription.  Gene expression can be lowered 100- to 1000-fold. To carry out combinatorial gene knockdown, we will construct CRISPR RNA libraries containing all possible 3-gene combinations for the 19 target genes we have identified. These libraries and the dCas9 system will be co-transformed into P. putida construct containing the HMF pathway. These"

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#lab practice#notebook#calendar#dry lab_-_-_TEXT.html,"3 (24-30 June) Design of sequences to synthesize in order to save time : logic gates and our riboswitch regulation system in biobrick format.
A new idea for logic gates design came up : recombinases can turn terminators over , instead of genes themselves. So we had to find adapted terminators in the registry part, that is to say very efficient ones in both ways of transcription.
As far as the integration in concerned, reflexion keeps going. The final host can not have more than two plasmids, with two different markers and origins of replication. AND1/AND2 gates should be on a first plasmid and XOR1/XOR2 on an other to reduce recombination problems. Moreover a part of our system has to be integrated in the host’s genome. We did a research about this topic to understand how integrative vectors work. We asked the UNIPV Pavia Team (2010) about their integrative vector for E. coli. Yet, a pir+ strain is needed to make it works... Search has to be continued...

UFMG_Brazil,2013,Team:UFMG Brazil#humanpractice_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM. With a little more publicity we could help raise awareness of synthetic biology in Brazil and perhaps increase the number of Brazilian teams in the coming years.
A simple example of the lack of information in Portuguese about iGEM: there is no page on wikipedia (of course, we are working to solve this). In this chart below we see the comparison of the interess over time to organic searches on Google by ""synthetic biology"" and its counterpart in Portuguese. The numbers on the graph reflect how many searches have been done for a particular term, relative to the total number of searches done on Google over time (they don't represent absolute search volume numbers):
This other graph is the comparison of interest in iGEM competition in different Latin American countries:
So, our divulgation was made not just to communicate with other teams, but to inform and generate interest in public unaware of this new area of ​​research and this competition.
In the news
Besides the media of our university, two major Brazilian newspapers reported our project, and one of them (Estado de Minas) made this fine infographic explaining our project very clearly to the readers:

Our Materials
Together with our pleasure on promoting events that seed and grow knowledge about synthetic biology and the iGEM on people of many ages, we had to concern about a more practical problem: money to develop and travel to present our work! An iGEM team cannot live only from ideas after all… Due to it, part of the material we have created/provided, besides widely disseminating these concepts and our ideas, team and project, acted more directly on the seeking for sponsors and people that liked, learned and could become willing to support us financially.

Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Perceptions_-_-_TEXT.html," components. However, biology is not modular; different proteins and genes interact with each other in still unknown ways.  While piece by piece assembly works extremely well for other forms of engineering (such as electrical or mechanical), this is because engineers designed all of these components from scratch and have a very good grasp on how each part works and how these parts interact with each other. Synthetic biologists are not yet at a point where they can build components completely from scratch that act exactly as anticipated; the core components (genes) are usually isolated from nature. While fusion-proteins can be designed using existing proteins, synthetic biologists cannot reliably synthesize a DNA sequence for a specific function. When building synthetic systems using a mix of natural parts, it's difficult to predict with complete accuracy how the system will react in varying conditions and with the surrounding environment or with the human body [2].  An organism engineered to produce a therapeutic and deliver it to a site in the body could unknowingly also be producing a toxin or other harmful metabolite and releasing it into the bloodstream, an outcome that may not be evident until it has an opportunity to cause significant harm.
Another biosafety hazard involves the risk of contamination. How will synthetic biologists ensure that any microorganism they engineer will stay where they want it to [3]. Bacteria and microorganisms are extremely mobile, able to travel between places through the very air we breathe. Pharmaceutical contamination of drinking water is already raising concerns [4]. Contamination by engineered microorganisms would be worse still, as these organisms have the ability to replicate and evolve and spread in ways that are difficult to anticipate. They may evolve to fill new niches or compete against natural organisms, altering ecosystems and biodiversity in unpredictable ways. Genetic pollution may also occur through horizontal gene transfer [2], giving natural organisms unexpected and potentially undesirable capabilities. Microorganisms are able exchange DNA with each other or uptake DNA from the environment.  Leaked engineered bacteria could transfer resistance genes across species, similar to the StarLink corn controversy that surrounded genetically modified corn in 2000-2001. Aventis created a genetically modified corn called StarLink with  Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) derived insect resistance protein called Cry9c. Corn including this protein was restricted by the EPA to animal feed only due to potential for allergenicity, but traces of the Cry9c protein were found in human corn products due to genetic pollution of human feed, resulting in food recalls by the FDA and disruption of the food supply [5]. A similar gene transfer could occur in microbes; however, due to a shorter replication time, the suspect gene"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12)."

Safety
We experimented with the following conditions
in order to ensure ""researchers safety"", ""public safety"" and ""Environmental safety"".
The laboratory has the structure and equipment for basic biological experiments.
We inactivate waste, including living genetically modified organisms before waste.
We inactivate genetically modified organisms before waste or use the contaminated facilities, equipment or the instruments.
We inactivate genetically modified organisms on the bench immediately after it attached.
While experimenting, we have closed the lab door (Except when entering or leaving the lab.).
We have close the lab window in order to prevent entry of insects or etc..
In all procedures, we minimize the generation of aerosols.
When taken out from the laboratory of living modified organisms, we put them into the container and seal it.
We wash our hands after handling living modified organisms in order to prevent the infiction of them.
We have the parson who do not have knowledge of the experiments not to enter the laboratory.
In addition, our Biobricks do not have the safety issues.
We observed the law “Attacks for bioethics and safety ( English / Japanese )” (established by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan) and meet the safety standards.

GES_NCSU_Raleigh_NC,2014,Team:GES NCSU Raleigh NC#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," developed an app that enables users to weigh our principles according to their own value systems. Finally, the developers of The Glowing Plant tested the tool and help us refine it.
A key assumption that underlies our tool is that values can be measured quantitatively. We recognize that this quantitative approach cannot fully account for the complexity of value systems. Some people may interpret our tool as assuming that it is possible to release genetically engineered organisms beyond the laboratory in a responsible manner. However, we believe that ultimately, future versions of our tool will be able to reflect the values of people who don't think that responsible release is possible.
Challenges
Like all concept maps, ours shows only a fraction of the concepts that could help answer the question of what it means to act responsibly (Novak & Cañas, 2008, p. 12). Similarly, the current version of our app speaks to only a handful of the principles in our concept map--an issue that we will address in future versions. Both tools are also biased towards our team members’ values and priorities.
On a theoretical level, we struggled to translate complex principles such as “promote ethics and social equity” into simple statements to measure users’ value systems. On a pragmatic level, we struggled to find online concept mapping software that allowed users to weigh different concepts according to their values. Finally, inviting the developers of The Glowing Plant to serve as beta testers illustrated the tensions between various principles and helped us to see that it is difficult for a small corporation with limited resources to prioritize principles such as securing public trust and legitimacy that may require significant public outreach. We plan to refine the tool to better address these challenges in the future. We also invite iGEM participants and judges, as well as other users, to provide additional constructive criticism to strengthen the tool further.
Who Should Be Interested In This Tool
Because our tool enables people to compare their own values to the values of others, it provides opportunities for people with opposing value systems to discuss their differences respectfully, making it useful to people working in sometimes-controversial areas such as genetic engineering and synthetic biology. As the tool evolves, it may prove useful in other fields and in educational contexts. In addition, other iGEM teams may be interested in expanding upon and modifying our work to explore the different value systems that people draw on as they consider social, cultural and ethical questions related to synthetic biology or other forms of science.
How Does Our Project Relate To Other iGEM Projects?
Our project draws on the work of several previous iGEM teams, including the 2009 UCSF team’s investigations into potential safety"

Desk study concerning landmines
What is a landmine?
A land mine is a bomb that is buried in the ground and that explodes when someone steps on it or drives over it [1]. It can lay dormant for years until a person or animal triggers their detonating mechanism. Land mines cannot be aimed and therefore indiscriminately injure or kill not only their targets but also innocent civilians [2].
Types of landmines
There are two main types of land mines: Anti-personnel (AP) mines and anti-tank (AT) mines. Anti-personnel mines are specifically designed to reroute or push back foot"

I created a graph library which I call dongraphlib to handle our specific functions. I took a look of code from NetworkX and pygraph but made modifications and left out everything we have no need for. I included a bidirectional dijkstra algorithm to make the shortest path calculation go extremely fast (less than a second!).
Palak
This week I worked on creating a script that would determine whether or not the reaction is reversible. I also worked on a few administrative tasks. I spoke with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Research to discuss what kind of support they could provide us. I also took a look at a few grants that we could apply for in order to get funding for next year.

“The iGEM competition provides the students with an in-depth look into real science. The breadth of experience they gain with their own project is invaluable. Such a competition opens up completely new learning concepts and gets the students as well as the supervisors to break away from conventional schemes of thought.”

Protecting Our Technology and Our Business
In order to remain competitive in the market, protecting our technology is extremely important. To this end, developing a comprehensive intellectual property protection plan was critical. With our technology stemming from a previous iGEM project, we faced unique issues in terms of identifying key stakeholders and dealing with previously made disclosures.
Intellectual Property Protection
The technology platform which is being commercially developed was originally produced from the Calgary iGEM team in 2012.  This produced a unique intellectual property (IP) situation, as the technology came out of a collective project by a large team composed of professors, students, and numerous funding sources.  Additionally, all of the work which was completed was disclosed publicly through a variety of posters, presentations, and the 2012 iGEM Calgary Wiki .  This has created numerous questions surrounding the protection of our invention, and the type of IP protection to take.  The protection strategy that we have taken for our technology platform and business development is detailed below.
Figure 1. Overview of our intellectual property protection of which there are three major categories, regarding protection of our project, the right to operate within this intellectual space through our business development, and to assess the legal protection and ownership protection we require being a former iGEM project.

The technology that"
Harvard,2008,Team:Harvard#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," that if this were the case, then we should have seen an increase in all strains of the engineered mtrB knock-out if the repressor protein was being degraded. It may be that we would have observed this increase if we had run the experiment for a longer period. Future experiments may shed more light on this observance.
Co-Culture Experiment
Overview: One possible system for achieving inducible current could be to couple a inducible-lacZ system in E. coli to current production by wildtype S. oneidensis MR1 through the conversion of lactose to lactate. This leaves open the possibility of using a pre-existing E. coli lacZ reporter or creating our own.
In addition to genetically engineering S. oneidensis MR-1 to respond to chemicals and heat, we also sought to take advantage of its natural metabolic pathway of breaking down lactate to produce current. From our wildtype versus mtrB knockout experiments, we found that feeding S. oneidensis MR-1 lactate led to significant current production almost instantly. In wildtype S. oneidensis MR-1, the current production would increase and stay elevated for a period of twelve hours. This result occurred consistently, thus we sought to use controlled lactate release as a way to control current output.
We also knew that wildtype E. coli takes lactose and breaks down lactate. Thus, we hypothesized that it might be possible to couple E. coli’s lactate production with S. oneidensis MR-1’s lactate breakdown to produce current.  In addition, a great deal of genetic engineering has already been done on E. coli and the up-regulation or down-regulation of its Lac operon.  This means that instead of genetically modifying S. oneidensis MR-1 to respond to chemicals or heat, we can instead take advantage of the vast library of E. coli genetics and couple genetically engineered E. coli with wildtype S. oneidensis MR-1.
In this experiment, we tested different combinations of wildtype E. coli MG1655, S. oneidensis MR-1, and Lac-operon knockout E. coli MC4100 as follows:

A different wiki
Our way of showing the world what we accomplished - intuitively and thoroughly
Team members working hard to polish the wiki before the European Jamboree wiki-freeze. Most of our team members have never tried creating a wiki, so when Heidi’s boyfriend Kenneth offered to help us out a bit, we were quick to accept. As a professional software developer, Kenneth had a unique perspective, which shone throughout our preliminary meetings. We set out to present the best, most intuitive wiki possible; to improve the standard wiki experience. This very wiki is the result, and below are the keys to the wiki.
Better overview: A metro-map of all pages
A general issue observed on many wikis is that the user struggles to navigate. We designed a metro-style navigation bar at the top of each page, giving the user knowledge of his exact location. While allowing a custom experience and viewing order, the navigation bar ensures that the user is never lost.
Smarter tour: Usable by both casual and thorough readers
A lot of wiki-tours do a great job at introducing the reader to the project. However, users who want details are left to fend for themselves in a jungle of"

Facilities
At first glance, one might think that facilities are not an area in which scientists can take action - short of a complete overhaul of their laboratory, the overall energy consumption would only be marginally affected. However, energy audits have shown that simple actions can reduce the energy consumption of a lab, save money, and minimize waste production.
#1: Shut the Sash!
Fume hoods use a great deal of energy to keep safe air circulating. Over the course of a year, a fume hood uses as much energy as 3.5 large U.S. households. [ 1 ] Shutting the sash can save up to 25% of that energy . In addition, shutting the sash helps keep lab spaces safe by preventing chemical fumes from escaping.
#2: Last One Out, Hit the Lights
Much like turning off lab equipment when not in use overnight, turning off overhead and bench lights when they aren't needed will save energy. BostonU's lab facilities have lights that include motion sensors and timers so that even if we forget to turn them off, they won't stay on all night. Moreover, scientists can advocate for sustainable architecture for labs: Natural light in lab spaces can reduce the need for lights during the day, and LED light bulbs use less energy and have a longer life span. Turning off lights when not in use can save up to 50% of energy consumed .
#3: Run Full Autoclave Cycles
A single autoclave cycle can consume up to 900 liters of water. [ 1 ] Furthermore, autoclaves typically use about 45 kWh of electricity per day - about the same as 2 large U.S. househoulds. [ 2 ] By coordinating with other lab members to consolidate autoclave cycles, we can reduce energy consumption and conserve water .
#4: Recycle!
Make sure that your lab has recycling streams for waste! Although pipet tips cannot be recycled, cardboard, paper, and some plastics are still recyclable. If your lab doesn't already have a dedicated recycling stream, get in touch with the coordinator of facilities to implement one. Recycling lab waste diverts waste from a landfill and contributes to establishing a sustainable waste stream .

GFP + Terminator
The starting materials were GFP (BBa_J52028) and Terminator (BBa_B0015). Each of these biobrick underwent restriction digest to cut out the necessary part. Because the GFP gene is large enough to be separated in gel electrophoresis, it was cut out from the backbone with EcoRi and SpeI. In contrast, the terminator is too small for gel separation so it was not separated from the backbone. Instead, the backbone was cut with EcoRI and XbaI. For the first time, the gel electrophoresis yielded visible results where the cut biobrick plasmid appeared as two bands (the cut region and the leftover). Nanodrop quantification showed that the DNA concentration for each sample was very small as it was between 2-3 ng/uL. The GFP gene and the backbone, which contains the terminator, were combined through ligation reaction.
Throughout these processes, three ligation reactions were made and thus three petri dishes were prepared for each of them. The backbone used here also contains genes that encode for both kanamycin and ampicillin resistance, so petri dishes with either antibiotic can be used for transformation. But since there had been problems with the ampicillin plate where it did not selectively inhibit the bacteria that were not transformed (this was known when the negative control in other experiment yielded positive result), kanamycin petri dishes were used. On the next day, only one out of the three dishes contained bacteria cultures (there were 4 cultures, to be exact). Plasmid prep was done and 12 hours later, the opaqueness from each tube showed that a good number of bacteria amplification had taken place. No string-like substance was found at the end of the pipet tip in each tube. Miniprep was done and the results were: 48.4 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.80, 260/230: 0.89 (composite part 1) and 14.7 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.76, 260/230: 0.91 (composite part 2). The plasmids were kept in the -20C freezer and the corresponding plasmid preps had glycerol added before being stored in 2 places.

TECAN plate reader Sample preparation
5 mL of fresh LB containing necessary antibiotic resistances was inoculated with 50 µL of overnight culture and grown at +37 °C while shaking vigorously. After cell density reaches OD600 ~ 0.1-0.2, 1 mL was withdrawn and mixed with IPTG. Then, three 200 µL samples were taken and transferred into sterile 96 well plate (Thermofisher scientific, Denmark) and used for data analysis as a triplicate. Cells were later grown in TECAN Infinite 200Pro plate reader (Switzerland) at 37 °C, while shaking in orbital mode with 5 mm amplitude. Each 15 min fluorescence (excitation at 488±4.5 nm, emission at 530±10 nm; 25 flashes and integration over 20 µs) and cell density (absorbance at 600±4.5 nm; 15 flashes) measurements were taken.

This response and scepticism inspired us to come up with scenarios in which it would be vital to have a form of encryption on our BabbleBlocks. Read more about this here .
RICHARD BENNETT
Richard Bennett is an Executive Director at Goldman Sachs dealing with technology risk and information security. We were lucky enough to get in touch with him over email and get his advice on our encryption. He cautioned us to think very carefully about our system and come up with some clear reasons for needing encryption (see our scenarios here .).
He also made a point of encouraging us to think about our keys and the best way to exchange them. As he put it, “When it comes to cryptography the key is the keys!”; if your keys are compromised then there’s no security at all! This led to the development of our RSA Public-Private Encryption method. You can read more about it here .
DR JOYCE TAIT
Dr Tait is a bioethicist based in our University’s Science, Technology and Innovation Studies department. She has or is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, Scottish Science Advisory Council Working Group on Synthetic Biology and the UK Department of Health Emerging Science and Bioethic Advisory Committee. She has extensive experience with policy analysis and stakeholder attitudes in synthetic biology.
In our meeting we asked her a lot of questions about public perceptions of synthetic biology and how she anticipates people might react to our project. Her take-home point was that we can never assume or try to predict how people will respond. She also pointed out that from her experience people are never as worried or ignorant as you think they might be and the way in which people respond to your technology depends on how it is presented to them. For example, she introduced us to the concept of ‘gold plating’; 'gold plating' is the addition of extra measures or the over-implementation of a policy in order to make the policy seem better or safer. She said that’ gold plating’ is a term often used in a legal context, but the same can apply to researchers. As an example, if we put a lot of focus on how safe our BabbleBricks are and how they can never be dangerous, we may give people reason to think that there is some sort of risk we are trying to compensate for. She pointed out that as there are regulations in place to prevent ‘gold plating’ of EU law in the UK, we should be mindful"
Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," environmental changes. Hence, one way to measure the mutagenesis levels is simply to quantify the level of spontaneous antibiotic resistance acquisition. Therefore, E. coli were transformed with mutagenesis plasmids or remain untransformed (as control) followed by incubation in presence or absence of different antibiotics on agar plates. After 18-21 hours of incubation at 37 °C, colonies are counted. A higher number of colonies (i.e. clones with spontaneous resistance acquired) thereby indicates a higher mutation rate in the corresponding E. coli population due to the presence of the mutagenesis plasmid.
Results from the Study
To decide which mutagenesis plasmid to recommend to future iGEM teams for in vivo directed evolution approaches such as PREDCEL, it was essential to determine the mutagenesis plasmid setup most robustly functioning across different laboratories. The results of iGEM team BOKU Vienna, ETH Zürich, Freiburg and Stuttgart indicate that MP #1 induces mutations most reliably . Hence, we recommend to use mutagenesis plasmid #1 for PREDCEL experiments, which is also noted in our corresponding RFC .
Cloning a Positive
Control for Freiburg
Collaborating with the iGEM Team Freiburg we cloned a positive control for a subproject of their CARTEL™ project.
Under normoxic conditions HIF1A cannot interact with HIF1B to form the transcription factor HIF1, because its hydroxylated and marked by the E3 ubiquitin ligase for degradation by the proteasome
ziello2007hypoxia
.  Therefore the elimination of the two hydroxylated amino acids, that are prolines at the positions 402 and 564, would generate a HIF1A, that is stabilized and interacts with HIF1B under normoxic conditions
yasui1988expression
to activate the hypoxia response element (HRE).
Because we wanted to collaborate with this year’s iGEM Team Freiburg , we offered to help them with our  Golden Gate cloning expertise to perform a site directed mutagenesis and generate the constitutively active HIF1A. It would be used Freiburg as a positive control for CoCl2 induction in analysis of HRE.
For the aforementioned two amino acid exchanges alanine to proline we decided to utilize PCR amplification followed by Golden Gate cloning for site directed mutagenesis. To insert the two point mutations three steps were performed. We divided the ~7.9 kb plasmid into three"

Synthetic Biology Week
So members from CBSin organized to create an entire week dedicated to disseminate several subjects related with Synthetic Biology. During the Synthetic Biology week, our entity brought several professors, researchers and young entrepreneurs from others Brazilian universities to speak about Synthetic Biology, entrepreneurship, the maker movement (which is a DIY growing movement from Brazil) and its importance for a society in constant changes. We aimed to show the University community (students and teachers) our work and mission!
Just build it
One of CBSIN's core missions is to develop technology and bring the academic community closer to society. To be able to count on public participation, we held the Just Build It (JBI) event. The JBI was one of the biggest events idealized by CBSIN together with Hack.Atomic, Synbiobrasil and the Free Hardware group:
Hack.Atomic: is a student entity from EEL-USP, established in 2016. Its mission is to bring the ""Making"" culture to the college environment through workshops held in partnership with other entities, as well as offering free introductory classes to the Arduino. This way, Hack.Atomic manages to bring to the engineering students problems related to the logic of programming and basic circuits that helps in the formation of an engineer.
Hardware Livre: is one of the largest group in Brazil formed by students of the University of São Paulo that promotes studies related to the areas of Free Hardware. They teach to use the technology involved in some devices and their applications in research are explored by undergraduate, masters and doctoral students.
Synbiobrasil: is one of the most relevant group of synthetic biology development in Brazil. Every week the platform offers meetings between undergraduate and graduate students from various science areas to discuss open science. The objective is to generate interdisciplinarity on problems that can be solved with bioengineering,"

Salmonella and salmonellosis
Kenneth Todar University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Bacteriology [8] genus Salmonella has three kinds of major antigens with diagnostic or identifying applications:
Somatic (O) or Cell Wall Antigens
20 types of Antigen O
O antigen results in partial loss of virulence, suggesting that this portion of LPS is important during a host-parasite interaction
Surface (Envelope) Antigens
Surface antigen that is well known: the Vi antigen. The Vi antigen occurs in only three Salmonella serovars (out of about 2,200): Typhi, Paratyphi C, and Dublin
Flagellar (H) Antigens
Mixing salmonella cells with flagella-specific antisera  gives a characteristic pattern of agglutination (bacteria are loosely attached to each other by their flagella and can be dissociated by shaking)
[9] This website has a description of all the current tests used to detect Salmonella Typhi:
Widal tube agglutination test: involves the use of bacterial suspensions of S typhi and S paratyphi `A' and `B', treated to retain only the 'O' and 'H' antigens. These antigens are employed to detect corresponding antibodies in the serum of a patient.
Typhidot: allows separate evaluation of the presence of specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) g and m antibodies to OMP (50 kDa Outer membrane protein). Identification of specific IgG but not IgM in the serum of a febrile child is taken as a positive result.
Serotype Typhi IgM dipstick assay: based on the binding of S. Typhi specific IgM antibodies in samples to S. Typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen and the staining of bound antibodies, by an anti-human IgM antibody, conjugated to colloidal dye particles.

To take this into account it is necessary to add an intermediate step in the equations described in the previous section. This intermediate step is given by the following chemical reaction:
adding the one more differential equation to our system, which now becomes:
which in equilibrium will be:
The main difference that rises in this second case is the basal concentration of LasR, given that yC is different from 0, due to the dissociation of the LasR-qteE complex. In the case where the dissociation rate yC = 0, we recover the first case, where the value of [GFP]eq is dependent only in the difference between the values of [LasR] and [qteE].

Response
Since our diagnosis is based on the fluorescent feature of the GFP, it is important to evaluate whether or not our system produces enough GFP to be seen. This problems was already addressed by the 2013-USP-Brazil team , where they analysed the relative contrast generated by their reporter protein.
The main measure to be analysed is the relative contrast C(x) given by:
where I(x) is the luminous intensity of the signal in the position x and I_B(x) is the background light intensity.
The brightness generated by a fluorescent protein is measured in terms of the product of its Quantum Yield (QY)(the rate Phi between emitted and absorbed photons) and its Molar Extinction Coefficient(MEC) defined as the absorption force per mol per centimetre (M^-1 cm^-1).
The Beer-Lambert law states that the intensity I(x) suffers an exponential attenuation given by
where x(0) is the position of the source, x is the position of the observer and A is the Total Absorptivity of the medium with c(i) being the absorbing components and epsilon(i) their respective MECs. It is then assumed that the amount of light generated is proportional to the amount of background light available in the container, described by:
then, using the definition of the visual contrast C(x), we get"

Certain degrees of privacy and lighting are also requirements) and what new functions a habitat on Mars would need to fulfill (for example protection from the harsh environment and radiation). We also had to investigate the different options for Martian habitats that exist already, craft the mission architecture, and consider the laws and regulation of planetary protection that would certainly impact our project.
In order to get the best possible answers to these questions we engaged directly with experts planning the exploration of Mars, and overseeing the protection of the planet.
Our first contact was Oliver Morton, a British science writer and former editor of Nature. We presented our rough ideas about our project to him, and he gave us guidance on how to present the information more effectively and what areas we needed to explore more. And, perhaps most importantly, he also questioned our motives. He asked why we wanted to design a Martian habitat in the first place, when we could also easily focus on the earth and probably have a greater immediate impact. It was a difficult question that required us to be introspective about a notion that seemed so obvious at first. After a lot of dialogue we realized, while designing a Martian Habitat may not benefit the maximum number of people, designing in Space gives us the freedom to explore new ideas and materials without having to worry about the constraints of the market and competition on Earth. After our first interview with Morton, we had a better understanding of the direction we needed to go in and why. We were now ready to discuss with specialists in Martian and space travel.

We interviewed Dr. Michael Meyer, the lead scientist of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program (https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mgs/michael-meyer.html), to answer some of our primary questions about what the design of a human mission to Mars would like.  We asked about which options for martian habitats are currently being explored by NASA--he shared two, both 3D printed structures, one created from a composite made from Martian regolith the other ice--as well as questions about the longevity that is required of the mission, the estimated budget, the kinds of experiments that would be run, the benefit of having people on Mars versus and Rover, and how does NASA define acceptable risk.

As a way to extend the applications of our biosensor we decided to think about environmentally friendly biodegradable papers. This led us to microbial cellulose as it is inexpensive to produce and can break down easily into glucose. At the same time, the Stanford-Brown 2015 iGEM project focused on reducing the mass and volume of supplies required to send on space missions by making self-folding biological materials called biOrigami. They are seeking to incorporate sheets of microbial cellulose produced from Gluconacetobacter hansenii into their project as one of their folding mechanisms.
In an effort to improve these sheets, they are processing them which could affect their properties. From there, they are experimenting with attaching bacterial spores to sheets of the microbial cellulose, and then using the contractile properties of these spores in the presence of differing relative humidities to cause the sheets to bend. To attach the spores to the cellulose, they are attempting to express cellulose binding domains (CBDs) on the spore coats. The sheets of microbial cellulose that they processed and gave us allowed us to compare the usefulness of the microbial cellulose as a basis for a biosensor through our experiments in testing the binding affinities of a CBD on both processed and unprocessed sheets. In turn, our experiments testing the binding affinities helped guide the Stanford-Brown choice of cellulose processing technique for making sheets to which the spores will attach.
For this collaboration we expanded on the characterisation of BBa_K1321357 which is sfGFP fused to CBDcex driven by LacI and used our dissociation protocol . We chose this specific CBD because it was in the distribution kit with enough characterisation to ensure that the only variable we are testing is the processed vs unprocessed cellulose.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"

We picked the white colonies from the plate where the insert was put in pSB1K3-B0034-RFP- backbone which from now on be called red output with RFP (ROR). Hopefully this contains our insert and does not become induced by the TOP10-strain.

Point mutagenisis and O/N on pSB1K3-cph8_PstI since earlier mutagensis (first on) didn't work. Re-pleated, amplified and screening of earlier mutaded pSB1K3-Cph8_PstI.
Evaluation  The gel picture of amplified pSB1K3-cph8_PstI showed good result. It also seemed like the point mutagenesis of pSB1K3-cph8_PstI had an accurate length. The reason why we did a new mutagenesis is because we had a lot of trouble with our sensor before and we wanted to be on the safe side. The gel picture of envZ-KO and the red output didn't show any band and needs to be redone. At this stage the failure rate has increased leading reforms in the standard procedures so far. However, we are coming closer to the goal and need to keep to going.

The two other gel pieces we analyzed turned out with high probability to be ribosomal proteins.  However, an additional SDS-PAGE revealed that loading the peptide without the purified protein resulted in the same pattern of fluorescing bands (data not shown). While neither the MALDI experiment, nor the fluorescence assay were able to confirm the activity of our intein, the SDS-PAGE does suggest that the intein is active at least insofar that N-Cleavage can occur.
For further experiments the used concentration of peptide for the coupling assay would need to be adjusted to allow the lower fluorescence of the product to be picked up by the instrument. Further, the buffer conditions may be optimized to match the conditions described by [Appleby 2009] . Further MS experiments would have to be conducted on more thoroughly purified samples, with more tightly cut bands and on a more powerful instrument."

The Golden Gate product is purified using the ZymoResearch Kit and then 1 µl is
electroporated into 25 µl of S1059 E. coli. After 4 hours incubation in 3 ml SOC medium the cell culture is used for an plaque assay. A plaque PCR showed that the Tet(X)-insert is not included in the Golden Gate product and
therefore new Golden Gate overhangs are designed.

Lethbridge_Entrepreneurs,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html," Three finalists were chosen from 24 entrants that submitted business plans for the challenge. The winning plan came from the University of Lethbridge student researcher/entrepreneurs who form the Synbiologica Ltd. team.
This is the second win for the Synbiologca team, comprised of CEO Isaac Ward (3rd year, Neuroscience), first-year Biochemistry student Erin Kelly and Chemistry and Biochemistry masters students Mackenzie Coatham and Harland Brandon. They developed a new method of detecting hormones, which they expect will bring next-generation hormone detection to the research agriculture and medical market. They are in the process of patenting the the a biomedical device technology -- called “Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-Time"".
Not only did the group win $10,000 in the South Venture Business Plan Competition in March, they also took first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge. With that, came another $10,000, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect Centre for New Commerce (a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge), as well as a variety of other assistance, including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and thousands of dollars in media services.
Because the biomedical technology is in a patent phase, not many details can be released. However, it is designed to improve the way in which hormones are detected and provide more accurate information in a reduced time frame. The new technology also has the potential for a wide array of applications.
Quoting a U-of-L release, Ward stated the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
“The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,” Ward said. U of L teams have claimed several top international honours at past competitions, and three of the Synbiologica entrepreneurs are off to Boston Massachusetts, toward the end of June as advisors to the U of L's high school iGEM team. The university-level competition takes place in October, 2013 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, MA.
The Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge is an annual business planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region. The competition evaluates and awards business plans submitted by entrepreneurs who have taken advantage of the free business training provided by Community Futures across Southern Alberta.
On Wednesday, in Lethbridge, the Community Futures Lethbridge Region acknowledged the Synbiologica group for their win, and announced the additional winners of the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge. Outside"

Overheating of the PCB
As the PCB has a cold and a hot zone, it is necessary to evacuate the heat generated. The hot zone can achieve more than 80º degrees and can be a potential danger. A resistance is responsible of heating and a peltier plate is responsible of chilling. Peltier effect is based in a semiconductor metal where you apply a potential difference. Then, you create a hot part and a cold one in that semiconductor. We use the cold part to extract the energy and stabilize the temperature via conduction of the PCB's hot zone.
Ventilation
The peltier plate is responsible of chilling the PCB but ¿How do we evacuate all the energy generated? Well, the answer is simple, Printeria just needed ventilation holes and watercooling to do it. Watercooling is based in the higher thermal capacity of fluids (water in this case) to absorb energy. Water is pumped through microfluidic tubes to reach the peltier and chill it.
Electroporator
This device is capable to reach high voltages, so if you require one of these in your design first of all, ensure no one can harm himself/herself. This is the reason why we designed our own electroporator in a dedicated and compacted printed circuit to isolate it from any exposure. It can reach until 1600V, which is not a joke.
Tips
Tips which go in the revolver wheel are disposable to ensure the purity of each reaction.

Tumor and DVS evolution versus time
First step : Tumor development according to time
We consider the tumor is non metastatic and its growth is exponential.
Let the tumor have a volume V1 in cm3 at an instant t1.
Let the same tumor, at an instant t2, have a volume V2.
The tumor is considered in exponential growth phase and without metastasis therefore its development equation, Tumor Growth Rate (TGR), is equal to :
Thus, the tumor volume according to the time (V(t)) is equal to :
Finally, knowing the Average volume of a cancerous cell (Vcc) (experimental data), if we regard the tumor as fraught (without cavity or blood vessel),  we can determine that the Number of cancerous cells according to time (Nc(t)), without treatment effect, is equal to :
Back to top
Second step : Development of the tissue vector
The tissue vector is injected to the patient at an instant t, near t2. The Number of injected vectors (Nbi) is 1x10^6. The pulmonary tropism of the vector isn’t perfect, only a Percentage (Pp) goes to the lung. The total number of tissue vector in the body increases, because this vector is bacterial and therefore possesses  a Doubling period (DTB).
Thus we can establish that the tissue vector number in the lungs (Nb(t)) is equal to:
The number of Tissue vectors increases until injection of  doxycycline. F rom then, tissue vectors lysis releases the cell vectors in the lung.
This injection time is not insignificant. Indeed, si if we wait long enough, tissue vectors number is sufficient to eliminate the tumor or at least to significantly reduce it. On the other hand, if we wait too long, a higher dose of doxycycline (and so potentially toxic) is necessary for cell vector release.
Thus we can use modelling to determine the optimal injection time of doxycyline (Tdox).
Back to top
Third step : Release of the cell vector
Once the doxycycline injected, the cell vector is released. The cell vectors number is proportional to the tissue vectors number in the lung. And yet, we know the average value of recombinant phage vectors released by M. avium (Npl) is equal to 100.
We can write cell vectors number at the injection instant (Np(Tdox)) is equal to :
The cell vectors number does not increase such as the tissue vectors . Indeed"
