Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices2_-_-_TEXT.html,"When it comes to bacteria however, what point of view do we have? Humans generally have a vision of the world which is anthropocentric, we consider ourselves superior to other organisms. For example, during the Nuremberg trials against Nazi doctors, Carl Brandt (health minister and part of the German military) was sentenced for having lead experiments on humans in concentration camps believing that he was superior to them. When do these acts become wrong? Recently, in China, certain tests are being done on human embryos. Where should we draw the line for embryonic therapy? In Europe, questions of ethics slows down research on such topics but in Asia, research seams to be without limits.
How can we define intellectual property?
In sciences, the question of intellectual property is recurrent. Concerning synthetic biology, all of the objects used can be patented. Among these are genes, plasmids, biobricks, genetic circuit broads, software modeling of mechanisms etc. However, these aren't necessarily considered as dicoveries which we can define as a revelation of what was previously unknown, but already exist. Indeed, the scientific discovery is supported by publications which are in free access for who wants it. So, we can consider it is a part of the common knowledge, ownerless.  However, the creation is a process or a product which brings a solution for a particular problem. So it is a new element, previously a lacking element. An invention is supported by a patent.
In our case, in synthetic biology, the invention can be a whole organism, a gene or a DNA sequence. The National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE) tries to delimitate these processes by making it impossible to take ownership of organisms which already exist making sure that a discovery doesn’t become an invention. Also, the patentability of an element won’t be possible when it was extracted of its natural environment to live in a synthetic environment, or an element which was reproduced in a synthetic environment, but already naturally being.
Here, it is a polemical subject because in synthetic biology, we are making “organic inventions”. So, there is a question: “Is it acceptable to be a living being’s owner?” “What about an interior component of it?” In this last case, who does the element belong to, the organism or at that one who modified it?
The relation to living and its simplification
With the emergence of synthetic biology, the definition of living may be modified. Indeed, in this field, researchers can generate or modify the genome of an existing organism, insert a whole artificial genome in an existing organism or create a new"

Alternative selectable and counter-selectable markers:
Introduction
Genetic modification requires us to discriminate between bacteria which have taken up the DNA of interest and those which have not. This is traditionally done by using antibiotic resistance markers – cells that have taken up the DNA of interest (along with these markers) will be able to survive on media supplemented with the relevant antibiotic while those that do not have the DNA will not grow.
Selectable markers select for the cells which have taken up the gene of interest (eg. sucrose hydrolase) while counter-selectable markers select against the cells which have the DNA of interest (nitroreductase and SacB), which may be useful if we want to get rid of the cells that still contain a no longer wanted DNA insert.
The problem with this system is that international law does not allow the release of genetically modified organisms which contain such antibiotic resistance markers because these might aid the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes in the wild population.
We have questioned the legacy and safety of using antibiotics for selection and counter-selection and thus we aim to provide alternative markers that do not necessarily rely on antibiotic resistance genes for selection or counterselection. This would allow iGEM projects (and other projects where genetic engineering is used) to pass this hurdle on their way to releasing their constructs into"
Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PHA_-_-_TEXT.html,"(3HB) more feasible on a lunar or Martian base. The main project was increasing P(3HB) yield; preliminary data was obtained for the lysis system; and, we were successfully able to make sheets of P(3HB) by improving on the protocol developed by the 2012 Tokyo Tech iGEM team.
(1) Increasing P(3HB) Yield
Increasing the yield of P(3HB) from a cell culture would decrease the time needed to complete the plastic production and extraction process by making smaller cultures more efficient. We have used the phaCAB operon from Ralstonia eutropha H16 that encodes the three genes required for P(3HB) production: PhaA, PhaB, and PhaC. Previous iGEM teams (Tokyo Tech 2012 and Imperial 2013) were able to successfully produce P(3HB) in vivo using BioBricks that encode these three genes. The pathway for P(3HB) production is as follows. First, 3-ketothiolase, encoded by PhaA, combines two molecules of acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-CoA. This is then reduced by acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, encoded by PhaB, to form (R)-3-hydroxybutyl-CoA. This is then polymerized by PHA synthase, encoded by PhaC, forming poly-3-hydroxybuterate.
To increase the yield of P(3HB), we looked for a way to increase the amount of acetyl-coA, the precursor molecule to P(3HB) formation. Acetyl-CoA is composed of an acetyl group bound to coenzyme A. Coenzyme A consists of a beta-mercaptoethylamine group linked to pantothenic acid. On the Tokyo Tech 2012 iGEM team’s wiki, their results showed that adding pantothenic acid into their culture media led to increased yields of P(3HB). Therefore, we decided to increase the production of coenzyme A, which would then allow the cells to synthesize greater amounts of P(3HB).
Coenzyme A biosynthesis is a five-step process that is primarily regulated by the first enzyme in the pathway, pantothenate kinase (encoded by the gene PanK, which is also called CoaA) [4]. Pantothenate kinase stringently controls amount of coenzyme A produced in E. coli because the pantothenate kinase produced by E. coli is significantly"

Background
The global burden of fungal infections
Fungal pathogens are a major public health threat with significant global effects which, surprisingly, are not being addressed as they should. Globally, invasive fungal infections take around 1.5 million lives, and the number of people who die each year from the top 10 invasive fungal diseases is at least equal to those dying from tuberculosis or malaria. Moreover, the mortality rate of invasive fungal infections is usually greater than 50%.
In contrast, funding for medical mycology is highly underrepresented, accounting for 1.4-2.5% of the total of what the Welcome Trust, the U.K. Medical Research Council and the U.S. National Institutes of Health spent in the last 5 years. This under-representation could be just an effect of the number of applications for funding in the area, but even so, the need for an increased awareness and engagement by funding institutions and researchers is no less urgent: the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools is critical to improve the situation of high-risk patients.
The most common fungal infections are superficial skin, nails and mucosal infections, which are caused in most cases by fungi of the genus Candida. These infections are usually not life threatening and have such common manifestations as athlete's foot and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
Invasive fungal infections, on the other hand, have unacceptably high mortality rates. Patients with a compromised immune system -such as AIDS patients and post-transplantation patients taking immunosuppresants- are at special risk as they do not have the usual barriers that prevent invasive infections in healthy individuals.
According to Brown et al., (2012), more than 90% of the reported deaths caused by fungi are associated with species from four genera: Cryptococcus, Candid"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#model features_-_-_TEXT.html," can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription speed will decrease significantly. In order to express this alteration, as mentioned above, we use another part of pLacI* with decreased transcription speed instead of pLacI in the species.
The structure of binding sites is shown in figure (see Figure 3). The graph indicates that LacI monomers first bind together to form LacI dimer, then LacI dimers forms LacI tetramer, and finally LacI4 binds with pLacI* to form pLacI*:LacI4.

Figure 3: Tree structure of binding in pLacI*:LacI4
Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species with structure ANY - pTetR - ANY represents any DNA with part pTetR.
Figure 4: Template DNA species
A reaction with template species as its reactants, modifiers or products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism."

TCP Biodegradation achieved
Growth of E.coli strain MC1061 transformed DhaA+P2A+HheC and DhaA gene in LB medium with inducer and 5mM TCP respectively, as the substrate was monitored in batch culture. The concentration of the products were confirmed using GC column(AC5). Growth resulted in disappearance of the substrate and simultaneous formation of biomass, 2,3-DCP,  epichlorohydrin, chloropropanol, and glycerin. The result was screened by GC analysis. Above the degradation of TCP and the intermediate product 2,3-DCP indicate that multistep biodegradation are working. (Fig.1 and Fig.2). And cultivating  in medium with 2,3-DCP, the concentration of epichlorohydrin can be detected(Fig.2). It means HheC degrade 2,3-DCP to epichlorohydrin. The degradation followed the desired path, TCP will be degraded to glycerol finally. The deficiency of our project is chloropropanol and glycerin couldn’t be detected by the columns. In the future, new columns and new methods will be used.

Wilderness International
A foundation that aims at the world-wide preservation of unique wilderness areas for future generations
We cooperated with Wilderness International an environmental foundation located in Dresden to compensate for our GHG emissions. For this purpose, we donated the prize money we won in a photo contest hosted by New England Biolabs. These EUR 500 will guarantee a long-term nature conservation of another 640 m2 temperate rainforest in Canada that is endangered by the wood and mining industry. According to Wilderness International every square meter compensates for 104,79 kg CO2, so with our donation we compensate for more than 67 tons of CO2. Furthermore, they offered us to convert The iGEM Goes Green GHG Emissions Calculator into an online tool and publish it on their homepage.

Safety Expertise
Legal assistant Ms K. Michalk from the Institute for Technological and Environmental Law at TU Dresden and team member Lydia Kirsche
As our team aims at applying encapsulated bacteria in facilities other than our laboratories we had to consider the biological safety of our project. Therefore, we met with the legal assistant Ms K. Michalk from the Institute for Technological and Environmental Law at TU Dresden. She informed us about the procedure during the safety evaluation of a biological project and what is needed to make our Peptidosomes with the encapsulated biosensor applicable in e.g. a sewage treatment plant. According to her provisional assessment, the encapsulation of the biosensor into Peptidosomes represents a huge improvement in contrast to a biosensor that is placed on the market without further immobilization. She estimates this additional safety measure as pivotal for the potential prospective approval for a placement on the market. However, she also recommends the installation of further safety levels into our proposed portable system described here . Hereby, so-called indestructible materials could be suitable, preventing bacteria from escaping the system.

CAS conference Munich
From the 23th to 25th of July 2012 the CAS Conference took place, which was organized by the LMU Center for Advanced Studies in Munich. The conference was arranged in order to bring scientists of different expertise together to promote projects by an interdisciplinary discussion. Several notable speakers working on Synthetic Biology informed about their field of work, as for example Martin Fussenegger (ETH Zürich), Víctor de Lorenzo (CSIC Madrid) and Jay Keasling (University of California, Berkeley). Apart from this, two poster sessions were organized for companies, working groups and also the iGEM teams to present their work. For the program and a list of all speakers see here .
Several members of our iGEM team attended the conference. This offered us the possibility to extend our knowledge as well as to take part in interesting discourses on different fields of Synthetic Biology. Moreover we got the chance to discuss with experts about aims, achievements and problems of our project as well as to get to know some other iGEM teams and to inform us about their projects. We debated with the experts about the active center and the wide substrate spectrum of our laccases, about the production of them in our two chosen expression systems as well as about advantages, risks and alternatives especially for the use in wastewater treatment plants. We also held an interview to the iGEM team UCL London about the topic ""Collaboration and competition in the iGEM competition"". In this connection a collaboration between the team UCL London and us was planned (see here ).
Furthermore the philosopher Alfred Nordmann (TU Darmstadt) presented his point of view about Synthetic Biology during the CAS conference. To provoke some thoughts about Synthetic Biology, he chose the following main topics:
Do we produce a shift in biology?
Do we educate a new generation of scientists"

Team Attributions Collaborations
In order to best find collaborations that matched our project, we read the backgrounds of every team’s wiki, finding teams that were also involved in pollution cleanup, environmental issues or crude oil. One of these teams was NU Kazakhstan, who is also cleaning up oil in their local environment. With NU Kazakhstan, we organized a Skype call. In this Skype call, we talked about our two projects, and compared them, talking about how they were similar in that they both degraded toxic substances, but different because of the methods of doing so. This was helpful for us as we were in the stages of forming our applied design, and hearing their ideas for them helped us build on our sponge idea from last year and create something different.
Another collaboration was with Team Bulgaria-The EureCAST. With them we created an environmental pamphlet, with the goal of spreading awareness about tips to be more sustainable in the lab, but also in life. We want people to be more environmentally conscious, as small lifestyle changes can make a big difference if everyone implements them.
The final collaboration was with Team USP-EEL-Brazil. We asked them if they would like to be apart of our outreach how to video series, which was aimed towards giving new iGEM teams tips and tricks we wish we had learned before starting our competition. Team USP-EEL-Brazil contributed in this video series, adding their own ten minute video to our collection. This was important to us, as we wanted the videos to appeal to international audiences as well as teams of all three levels. Including a high school and undergraduate team, allowed for variety as both our teams had different struggles to overcome and therefore different tips they wanted to include."

Impression 5 Science Center
In order to educate children about synthetic biology and get them excited about science, we held an outreach event at Impression 5, a science center in Lansing, Michigan on June 29, 2018. The event started with a brief introduction to our team and what synthetic biology is. Then, in efforts to entertain the children, we hosted some hands on activities. These were organized into separate stations. Some of the stations consisted of practicing pipetting, extracting DNA from strawberries, constructing an alien with randomized selection, and colored leaf imprints. Over 50 children participated in the event. Our main goal in collaboration with Impression 5 was to teach children more about science and how it may be applicable to their interests and future careers.
East Lansing Public Library & Capital Area Public Library
Using Impression 5’s event as a model, we also reached out to the East Lansing Public Library and the Lansing Public Library. The East Lansing Public Library’s event took place on July 13th 2018 in East Lansing and the Lansing Capital Area Public Library’s event was held in the Lansing on the 26th of July. Both of these featured the activities previously mentioned from Impression 5 (practicing pipetting, extracting DNA from strawberries, constructing an alien with randomized selection, and colored leaf imprints).

The hazards with the research would of course be the human material as well as the virus or viral components. In the field there would be little opportunity for working aseptically unless the plan would be for a mobile lab to be in place. The best you can do there would be best practice or universal precautions, the idea being that you would treat all samples as potentially pathogenic or infectious, but there would likely not be an opportunity to set up a BSC or any type of clean work space.  You would want proper PPE which at a minimum would be clothes that cover skin (long sleeve etc.) gloves, eye protection and a lab coat.  Depending on how samples will be obtained there may be additional requirements needed.  All the waste should be hazardous material/biowaste"

A band around 3000 bp or 700 bp is visible for colonies transformed with PCR product amplified using primer 3. B. subtilis colonies which were transformed earlier in the summer (late June) and expressed RFP were used as a positive control, cPCR amplified a 3000 bp region. Invitrogen 1Kb plus ladder was used.
Figure 5: A cPCR using thrC specific primers was done on B. subtilis colonies transformed with PCR product. Untransformed colonies (UT) were compared with colonies transformed with PCR product containing 293 bp and 190 bp of homology. Invitrogen 1kb plus ladder was used to determine the size of the products.
Over the weekend we had our aGem workshop. We were fortunate enough to talk to Dr. Karmella Hyne, an experienced iGEM judge.  We told her that our transformed cells were not expressing RFP despite the fact that we had cells growing on selective plates and had results from the colony PCR which suggested that we had successful transformation. She suggested that RFP might be toxic to the cell or there was a transposon inserting into the gene inhibiting expression. As a team we decided to try this experiment using lacZ, an enzymatic reporter which we believed would be easier on the cell.
Week 20: September 8- September 14
After encountering many trials of unsuccessful transformations, we thought the issue with our transformations might have been due to the addition of inconsistent volumes of xylose. We were adding enough xylose to make the final absorbance 1.0 at 600 nm, but the starting absorbance was often not consistent. This meant that even though we were keeping the final absorbance and thus cell density consistent, the volume of xylose added was not consistent. There is the possibility that for some trials, not enough xylose might have been added for competency, which could be a potential explanation for our failed transformations. We thought that there might be a threshold for the addition of xylose required for competency, and that adding volumes beyond this threshold will still result in the competence of all cells. We reasoned that flooding the cells with a high concentration of xylose might be better to ensure that all cells are competent, instead of adding small amounts. We attempted transformation with final xylose concentrations of 3% and 5%, but we obtained the same results as previous trials with no growth on spectinomycin plates and thus no transformation.

Fig.8 (a) the growth curve of E.coli with JIM; (b) the growth curve of S.cerevisiae containing BirA & Bap
From the image we can tell, when the yeast and E.coli grows at 28 ℃, the culture time needs to be longer than 48h in order to make the yeast take a dominant proportion. We adjust the YNB-CAA galactose medium containing S.cerevisiae initial OD600 to 1.
Meanwhile, we used HPLC to measure the consumption of galactose.
Adhesion validation
In order to illustrate that in practice, the co-culture of S.cerevisiae and E.coli can truly form the collaborating platform of heterologous cells, we will cultivate the two strains together by adding E.coli to the galactose-induced yeast. The co-cultured samples will then be dyed with rhodamine-biotin and FITC-streptavidin.
As is shown below, we can see that there are quite a few areas of overlapping red and green fluorescent in positive group where there are both S.cerevisiae and E.coli in the sample, indicating that they are very likely to have linked to each other. The negative control of S.cerevisiae and E.coli however, has either red or green fluorescent. And for the empty group, there is no fluorescent detected at all.
Fig 2.10 The observation of confocal laser scanning microscopy(Nikon A1). The rhodamine-biotin is a solid dye, so it may have impurities in this picture.
（tips: please maximize the intensity of your screen when looking at this picture)
One step further, we want to confirm the connection between E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae by FACS analysis, because this analysis method can observe in single-cell level.Unfortunately, however, we found the Beckman flow cytometry (FCM) in our university couldn’t excite our fluorescent dye rhodamine-biotin so we were not able to use it to catch dyed E. coli.
Finally, we use the scanning tunneling microscope to shoot the microscopic structure of the connecting system and get a clearer picture of the connection structure. So far, we can say our adhesion platform is successfully established.

The results as follow:
Figure 5. The analysis of questionnaires of NEU-China.
As the result shows, there are lots of people think detecting tumor cell depending on their VOC is not an accurate way, but there are still 34% people think the accuracy can be more than 60%. Most of people think the cancer probably can be cured if it can be detected early. Only a few people think early detection has no beneficial to the cancer.
When we asked them what their attitude towards the iSmeller are. The majority of people thought it was really convenient to detect cancer at home, they hoped this technology can be developed quickly. But a few people still suspected its accuracy. And many people hoped it won't spend too much money. All in all, people really wanted iSmeller can work and develop a new way to detect cancer. Here is the link to their wiki
Since we wanted to get the feedback of our project, in September, after we got some results, NEU-China helped us interview associate Prof. Peiyong Liu, vice Dean of college of life and health sciences Northeastern University. They introduced what we did, and discussed with professor. Then, they asked her some views towards our project. She thought that the usage of Geneguard system was an innovative idea and it was feasible to control the engineered bacteria in the environment. She also thought that our project was meaningful when concerning biosafety issues. Solving this problem using synthetic biology methods was a nice attempt. She spoke highly of our project and wished the best for us. Her suggestions were meaningful to us and gave us confidence. We appreciated NEU-China for the interview.
5.Built an Alliance
On 12th of August, we had a voice conference with Tianjin, XMU-China, FAFU-China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, SCUT-China_A, and UCAS. After the conference, we decided to build an alliance and a worldwide database for the contents of heavy metals in local soil. We took charge of sample collecting in the northeast China. Because of the huge sample size, we still continued to do this work after wiki freezing. We hope we can build the database in China, and guide our future work.

In order to eliminate the public's fear, our team decided to proceed from two aspects. The first thing to do is to give the public an appropriate science popularization education to eliminate subjective fear, and in the meantime, to use the means closest to people's lives to eliminate people's potential fear. Finally, we broadened our project and designed convenient and feasible software for enterprises to select metabolic plans in biochemical plants.

Collaboration
During the project, of course, it is indispensable to communicate with other iGEM teams. Therefore, we exchanged opinions with many other iGEM teams to solve the problems we encountered together. Among them, we have carried out further cooperation and communication with the two iGEM teams: Sun Yat-sen University and South China Agricultural University. We finished an indispensable part of each other’s projects and made critical work.
SYSU-software is a friendly and open team. We had a meetup and exchange our project. With a presentation, they introduced their software to us, a multi-functional collaboration platform. Their software amazed us and we thought it can be useful in genetic circuit collaboration design. However, they ignored a fact that experimental protocol was also an important element in collaboration. So, in the meetup, we came up with this idea. They took much amount of it and verified their software based on our suggestion, adding a new function of editing protocol.
The team from South China Agricultural University is also friendly and accommodating. In our project, they helped us determine differences in yeast growth and tested for its activity. At the same time, we helped them extract the Acetobacter xylinum genome. Both of us have made a contribution that cannot be ignored to each other.
Self-enhancement
As scientific researchers, we must have a scientific basis for all our work, and repeatedly verify the arisen, upcoming and potential problems. Therefore, we need experts from different fields to help answer our questions in various fields. To learn about the latest research trends and enrich our project, we came to the 4th Seminar on Synthetic Biology Young Scholars.
Safety
Although Yarrowia lipolytica has undergone many tests and is a relatively mature engineered strain, but if we still have to ensure that they are always within safe limits through good laboratory practices and careful awareness. In addition, we understand environmental and personal protective measures and strictly comply with the requirements in the laboratory to prevent leakage or contamination risks.
Education
Although more and more people are paying attention to synthetic biology and molecular biology, there are still many people who have misunderstandings about biology or fear of biological tools such as transgenic technology and gene editing"

Preparing for the workshop
We received an invitation letter from NYU-Shanghai for iGEM team communication on 1st August 2015. They invited six iGEM teams from five famous universities located in southeast China. We displayed our projects to public at shanghai Science & technology museum and had had a lively communicated with each other. We prepared a poster about iGEM and our project, as well as a video to show the XJTLU-CHINA iGEM team and Xi`an Jiaotong-Liverpool university.

Introducing our project to other iGEM teams
The poster showed the topic and proposals of our project. The project involves the use of various colored E. coli to draw a world map; they in turn could change their color with an increase in temperature. Therefore, the color of world map will be changed as well, which could mimic the process of global warming. The poster also illustrated two creative ideas; one was using RNA thermometers controlling the translation of chrome-proteins, another was the constructing of genetic circuit which made protein expression ordered. We displayed the poster and introduced the project to other iGEM teams. They in turn, also gave us many useful suggestions on completing our project and improving parts quality.
This participant from USTC said: “First, I consider that your ideas are amazing! You can stimulate the process of global warming by culturing bacteria on medium. That is so creative. Furthermore, although you are just doing art design, your team has too much work to realize it. In all, your project this year is excellent！I can give you a little advice. Your project could closely stimulate the global climate. Why not go and achieve the up-date data of global climate? Therefore, you can control the temperature to display more detail information. If so, your bacterial map will be closer to the real world.”

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Collaborate_-_-_TEXT.html,"eningen UR
This year’s project of Wageningen UR consisted in a device for the diagnosis of tropical diseases, which featured sensitive perishable material in the form of engineered cells.
As TU Delft also aimed to manufacture a device intended for the broad audience, we were aware that one of the biggest challenges to both of our projects was the shelf-life or storability of the biological material. To circumvent the previous issue, our team dedicated a part of our project to research the applicability of tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) in order to enable the stabilization of all fragile material with just a simple drying step.
Consequently, TU Delft shipped three of his developed plasmids encoding for the production of the TDPs that conferred the most protection (CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094 and SAHS 33020) to Wageningen, so that they could test it with their cells.
Figure 2: Bacteria desiccation tolerance with TDPs. Number of colonies remaining after desiccation and rehydration for the empty vector,  TU Delft’s BioBricks for the production of CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094 and SAHS 33020 in BL21(DE3). Experiments performed by iGEM Wageningen UR.
As depicted in Figure 1, the survival of the bacteria upon drying overnight and resuspending is greatly enhanced for all the samples featuring the BioBricks with respect to that of the empty vector. In addition, Wageningen resuspended the samples with both Milli-Q water and PBS buffer, achieving additional results that indicated that the survival of the cells producing CAHS 94205 was improved in PBS while that of the cells with SAHS 33020 was instead worsened.
In return, TU Delft iGEM tested an additional preservation method researched by iGEM Wageningen UR, consisting of drying cells in combination with kaolin clay. In the experiments, TU Delft dried BL21(DE3) along with different amounts of kaolin in a laminar flow cabinet overnight
Bacteria desiccation tolerance experiments with Kaolin. Kaolin tube forwarded by iGEM Wageningen UR and resulting plates dried and resuspended with Kaolin.
After plating the resuspended kaolin and colonies and incubating overnight, the results were unfortunately inconclusive:  the plates were either overgrown or had no colonies at all. Furthermore, after performing Wageningen's  protocol, TU Delft shared a list of suggestions for its improvement"

Homing coli: Engineering E. coli to become tracking dogs
The model organism Escherichia coli is naturally capable of sensing substances in its environment and consequently moves directionally towards these, a phenomenon known as chemotaxis. Here, we apply directed evolution to chemoreceptors by targeting five amino acid residues in the ligand binding site to enable E. coli to perceive novel substances. In order to investigate mobility and directed movement towards a substance, an effective mobility selection method using special ""swimming plates"" is designed. Additionally, we attempt to improve E. coli's swimming velocity by creating new parts derived from its own motility apparatus. Based on our selection system, we identify variants of chemoreceptors with new binding specificities in the mutant library. By these means, we aim to train the bacterium to"

pCAMBIA as the Shuttle Vector Panel Toggle
pCAMBIA is an open-source plasmid repository specializing in plant genome integration. Their vectors are meant for use in conjunction with Agrobacterium that have disarmed Ti plasmids (virulence genes will act in trans to                             integrate genes between the border sequences of the pCAMBIA plasmid). pCAMBIA 1200 (GenBank: AF234292.1) is a shuttle vector with chloramphenicol resistance and origins of replication for both Agrobacterium (pVS1-REP) and                             the plasmid-construction friendly E. coli (pBR322) (figure 3). The vector contains a basta resistance gene and a multiple cloning site between its border sequences; successful transgenic seeds get screened by surviving basta                             herbicide, and the multiple cloning site sits within a lac Z alpha coding sequence for blue-white insertion screening on X-gal media. Once the Cas9 and sgRNA sequences are cloned into a pCAMBIA 1200 vector, it gets electroporated                             into a strain of Agrobacterium containing only disarmed Ti plasmids. Successful transformants can be screened in chloramphenicol supplemented media then grown up to and allowed to infect 4-week-old plants.
20 base pair gRNA portions of three sgRNA sequences were substituted for three different sequences complimentary to the P6 coding sequence of the CaMV genome. Each of these sgRNAs were designed to have flanking 40 base pair Gibson Assembly ends that are                             complimentary to one another such that each sgRNA will anneal to the other in a Gibson reaction. A plant-codon optimized Cas9 was found through AddGene (Plasmid #52254) and primers were designed to amplify it out and add flanking                             Gibson Assembly ends - one end was designed to be homologous with the left side of the pCAMBIA multiple cloning sequence and the other end was designed to be homologous to the left-most Gibson Assembly end of the first sgRNA. The                             Gibson Assembly sequence on the right side of the third sgRNA was designed to be homologous with the right side of the pCAMBIA multiple cloning sequence.

This primer works for all parts cloned in the CIDAR ICE plasmids as well as all parts cloned in any plasmids derived from iGEM’s “pSB1C3”.
Promoter characterization in live E. coli cells and Fluorescence Assessment
Promoter Sca6-2 was characterized in E. coli TOP10 cells. Colonies were picked and grown overnight at 37 °C, 250 RPM in 50 mL conical tubes in 10 mL of LB medium with its respective antibiotic (50 ug/mL kanamycin). Cell density was measured in a Jenway 7305 spectrophotometer, the obtained data was processed using Excel Data Processing tools. Cells were then subcultured into opaque-walled 96 well plates and adjusted to OD600 0.05 in 290 µl of LB medium supplemented with antibiotics as well as their respective inducer concentration (0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mM iPTG) in triplicates. Plates were then placed in the Fluostar omega microplate reader from BMG labtech, and grown at 37 °C for 20 hours at 300 RPM. Aside from monitoring OD600, fluorescence was determined by measuring emission wavelengths using three fixed excitation filters (584 and 544 nm) and three fixed emission filters (590 and 512 nm) every 30 minutes. Triplicate replicates were performed for each inducer concentration. All data is presented in relative fluorescence units, which represents the relative amount of the specific wavelengths of light collected by the plate reader at the conditions described above.

Overview
Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.
Eliminate Chinese’s prejudice about biotechnology
After hearing the community's concern about biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 200 booklets to expand publicity.
Background
In China, because of the UN human issue that scientists used 60 children to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.

Background
    Registry of Standard Biological Parts is a website that provides a collection of biological parts with known functions used in synthetic biology, ranging from plasmids to protein generators. The parts conform to BioBrick standard and form a categorization system so that new genetic parts can be simply constructed through hierarchy implement. Based on the ""get some, to give some"" principle, the continuous improvement of resource and cooperation among researchers is achieved. The active role of the website in promoting the development of synthetic biology is self-evident. On the other hand, the ubiquitous mobile device shows that traditional websites cannot satisfy our needs to update data and disseminate the information timely. A client on mobile devices seems necessary. According to statistical data, the user amount of iPhone is rather huge, which implies that iPhone client might be an excellent choice.
  
  
Motivation
  Nowadays, the focal point of electronic devices is shifting from the fixed to portable, people use mobile devices in routine to save time. With a nice appearance and the support of APP store , which is the biggest market for smartphone applications, iPhone attracts a huge amount of consumers, and is becoming an important office platform. However, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts website does not fit the operating system of iPhone. Therefore, considering the wide range of users of iPhone, and to benefit those who are interested in or working in synthetic biology, we’re going to build and improve a search engine of BioBricks.
  
  
Expected Results
  As shown in the figures, two ways will be provided to search BioBricks .
  The first method is a kind of web-of-knowledge-way searching technique which resembles the website www.webofknowledge.com. A common vocabulary for varied search terms related to Bio"

INPNC is a kind of modified INP with truncation of the entire internal repeating domain. We chose to work   with INPNC because it has been reported to be an excellent surface display system used in E. coli in recent   years [2,3]. INPNC can be be expressed on the cell surface at a high level, without affecting the cell   membrane structure and cell proliferation, which is really crucial in our case. Also, the size and structure of MVN   are both proper for the INP display system [2].
The plasmid containing INPNC coding sequence that we used came from the iGEM distribution 2014 (BBa_K523013).
Figure 1. Schema of the surface display system using INP and INPNC. INP N-  domain, which is relatively hydrophobic, anchors INP in the out membrane. INP C-domain is hydrophilic and exposed to   the medium, which can be used to link the passenger protein on its C-terminus. The internal repeating domains serve   as the template for ice nucleation, and are not necessary for protein display. Depicted are the (a) full-  length INP with no truncation and (b) INP with truncation of the internal repeating domains.
MVN is a lectin isolated from the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806. It is an 108 aa   protein that consists of 2 domains. According to a carbohydrate microarray carried out previously, MVN binds to   carbohydrate and the highest signals are observed with structures that contain α(1 → 2) linked mannose   residues [1]. A binding partner of MVN was identified in the lipopolysaccharide fraction of M.   aeruginosa PCC7806 and it possibly represents the O-antigen of a LPS. MVN has been previously expressed in E.   coli and its binding effect to cyanobacteria cells is highly species-specific [1]. The availability   and specificity are the reasons why we chose MVN in our project.
We optimized the gene sequence of MVN at first and de novo synthesized this gene from commercial company   (Genscript, Nanjing, China).
Figure 2. Solution structure of MVN. MVN consists of 2 domains, domain A   and domain B, which are colored yellow and blue respectively. Domain A is formed by residues 38-93 while domain B is   formed by residues "
XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html," These advantages will promote oscillatory gene circuits a better use in biosensing.
1. Arsenic sensing array
Jeff Hasty from UCSD used the same kind of oscillate circuit to engineer two kinds of arsenic-sensing macroscopic biosensors. These circuits are rewired by a native arsenite-responsive promoter, which is repressed by ArsR in the absence of arsenite. Due to the different mechanism, the sensor outputs are not the same. Figure 1 shows two constructed sensing modules and Figure 2 compares the outputs of two sensors[1].
Figure 1.Two different constructed sensing modules.                 Figure 2. Two different outputs of corresponding biosensors.
2. Cytotoxin sensor
Due to the accuracy and specific condition in the field of bio-medicine, the oscillatory biosensor needs to meet the requirement such as synchronization. For example, all cells expected to twinkle at the same time only when cytotoxin existed. In addition, the period or amplitude of the oscillation needs to indicate the concentration of the cytotoxin. Our circuit has the potential to accomplish this kind of job. By further exploration in the relationship between oscillatory parameters such as period and amplitude with other environmental factors such as concentration of antibiotic or cytotoxin, we may create a oscillatory biosensor which can sense different kinds of biological toxin.
Cancer cell killer
1.Cancer cell stalking
Nowadays cancer becomes one of the greatest enemy of our human being. Our main methods used to diagnosis of cancer are based on tissue and organ level, such as MRI, CT, PET, etc. These are mainly physical diagnostic methods.
With the development of science and technology, we create various methods into molecule level concentrated on molecular recognition and signal transduction of tumor marker, such as AFP(alpha fetoprotein), CEA (carcino-embryonic antigen), PSA(Prostate Specific Antigen) and so on. Level of these special molecules in human bodies has become the main basis of diagnosis of cancer. These are mainly chemical diagnostic methods.
So how about using synthetic biology to do something for diagnosis of cancer? Our project can be a potential biological method to assist diagnosis of cancer.
ROS is reactive oxygen species in cells, which has been proved to be associated with several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's diseases[2][3][4]. Concentration of ROS indicates the level of cell metabolism. Normally the stronger cell' metabolism is, the more ROS it will produce. In the recent decade scientist found that the occurrence of cancer is closely related to the level of ROS. But it is"

When handing their products over to consumers, Blacktrace noted that they spent the most time covering thorough cleaning of microfluidic devices. When receiving a chip for the first time, many users underestimated the impact a tiny blockage or strand of hair can have. Although we cannot offer a two-day training seminar for researchers using our chips, this feedback led to us including the “Cleaning” tutorial video and protocol in Microfluidics 101. To see these protocols, please click here.
We were also able to discuss their quality control motto which is to avoid testing every chip and instead ensure their fabrication process is airtight. Although this did not feed into our Fluid Functionality checklist directly, it inspired us to broaden the MARS archive through tutorial and how-to videos. Through this we will be able to streamline and simplify our workflow in order to reduce the number of errors future users experience.

nbsp;Light-dependent                                 input signal and proteases
Three light inducible split proteases were designed and shown to rapidly                                             respond to stimulation with blue light.
 
In the recent years, light has been extensively explored as a trigger signal for                                 activation of different biological processes. Small molecules and other chemical                                 signals lack spatial resolution and their temporal resolution is limited by the time                                 required for cell permeation. In comparison, induction by light as developed by                                 optogenetics offers many advantages. It is fast as well as inexpensive and allows                                 for excellent spatial, temporal and dose-dependent control.
Further explanation ...
There is a plethora of various light inducible systems available; however, not                                         many are applicable to our purpose. Red light induced systems like the PhyB/PIF6 system                                          require an                                         additional phytochrome

. Therefore, we selected systems responsive to blue light for the purpose of our iGEM project.                                         Of these, the FKF1/GIGANTEA system displays slow association and dissociation rates

Zhang2015
, making it unsuitable for successful heterodimerization of split enzymes.
Initially we decided to test the LOVpep/ePDZ system. This system has been used                                 previously at iGEM, by EPF_Lausanne 2009 , Rutgers 2011 and Rutgers 2012 and in mammalian cells by Freiburg_2014 .                                 AsLOV2 is a small photosensory domain from Avena sativa phototropin 1 with a C-terminal Jα helix. The Jα helix is caged in darkness but unfolds                                 upon blue light (< 500 nm) photoexcitation, which is crucial for phototropin                                 signalling.

Which company introduced glyphosate to the market?
4/24
Glyphosate was registered and placed on the market in 1974 by the American company Monsanto for agricultural use under the trade name Roundup after the chemist Dr. John E. Franz who was working for the company realized its mode of action against the enzyme EPSP Synthase in plants, fungi, bacteria and archaea.
In September 2016 Monsanto was acquired by the German multinational pharmaceutical and life sciences company Bayer (for US$66 billion). The German chemical company BASF however bought it´s share in the herbicide glufosinate
Glyphosate is ...
5/24
As mentioned before, glyphosate inhibits the the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase in plants, fungi, bacteria and archaea and was therefore placed by Monsanto as a herbicide.
Since glyphosate inhibits the aromatic biosynthetic pathway in many bacteria and parasites, glyphosate might also be effective as an antimicrobial (antibiotic). In 2003 Monsanto has filed a patent for the invention that the herbicidal agent glyphosate can be used in combination with the polyvalent anion oxalic acid to prevent and treat pathogenic infections caused by protozoan parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa (Patent No.: US7,771,736B2) ( Background ).
Should the usage of glyphosate be forbidden or reduced?
6/24
In december a European Citizen' s Initiative which demanded: ""Ban glyphosate and protect people and the environment from toxic pesticides"" was signed by 1 070 865 people of 22 different European countries after the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic in humans"" and after  EU member states agreed on a five-year renewal period for the controversial herbicide glyphosate, used by Monsanto in its Roundup product. (November 2017). The decision was taken by EU member states' experts, with 18 votes in favour, nine against and one abstention.
In the beginning of 2018 Julia Klöckner, the Federal Minister of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection of the CDU party announced that she wants to agitate for a reduction of glyphosate usage in Germany. Why?
“It is a very effective weed killer. Therefore the application in  small amounts is okay. But by its wide use arable landscapes turn into monotonous fields and insects don‘t find enough food anymore. It should not  be"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#pTet_-_-_TEXT.html,". aTc is a derivative of tetracycline, tetp’s native inducer, which has shown stronger binding affinity to TetR (Gossen & Bujard, 1993). On top of that, it has also exhibited much lower antibiotic activity on Escherichia coli (Oliva, Gordon, McNicholas, Ellestad, & Chopra, 1992), making it a more suitable inducer for our Tristable Switch system.
Mechanism of tetp - TetR - aTc Interaction
Figure 2. Behaviour of TetR in the presence/absence of aTc
In the absence of aTc, TetR would bind to tetp, inhibiting transcription and thus bringing mTagBFP expression to a halt. In the presence of aTc, however, TetR would lose the ability to bind to tetp, allowing transcription to proceed, resulting mTagBFP expression.

In this occasion, we talk about how much did they, as representatives, knew about the topic and answered some of the doubts that they were unable to understand through their personal research. Also, we talked about the more important and general aspects that the delegates were addressed in the first draft of their posture that they handed in for review. We believe that is important to mention that most of the High Schoolers focus or understand the medical part of the antibiotic resistance. In other words, they were only talking about how ingesting the wrong dose for the wrong amount of time of antibiotics could develop antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, they never discussed antibiotic resistance because of genetic modification or agriculture, for example.
Therefore, our next step was to provide first-hand information about all the different aspects of the problematic to the representatives so they could also have a more abroad perspective. Plus, they asked us if we could talk directly to the delegates. So we prepared a presentation tackling the causes, effects, and possible solutions obviously taking in consideration and as an example our project.

Experiment Handbook
According to UNESCO’s Integrated Science Education report, most educational programs in Latin America include the teaching of the specialized sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) in their upper and middle levels. However, most programs are not able to establish relations between these sciences, because each of them is perceived as an independent field isolated from the others. Nevertheless, this perception is wrong, for all sciences are integrated and interrelated. Hence the main observed issue is the educational trend of “packaging"" the teaching of sciences.
With the reason to solve this problem from the root; elementary school. The following Experiment Handbook (aimed at students) has been designed. We wish to foster a pleasure for science at the basic levels. The handbook includes 30 experiments divided into three blocks: 6-8 years (easy), 9-11 years (intermediate) and 12-13 years (expert). Each category is slightly more difficult than the previous one. Additionally, each experiment has been designed according to the required knowledge determined by SEP for each year of primary education.
The guide will consist of 30 experiments designed to motivate and involve students"

This has happened because scientists cannot have an opinion: they only work in the labs, but they do not get enough freedom of expression.  20. They also need more time to think about the possible implications of their projects.  21.  Issues related to responsibility. Who should take responsibility for a bacteria that has been designed to produce drugs?  22. Liar bacteria: someone designs a bacteria that can lie 23. Issues related to monopolies and economic benefit: who will benefit from developing a talking bacteria?  24.

We await for their opinion and advice.
27/05/12 Artefactando replied.
After our first attempt, we were told what aspects could be improved or are difficult to produce. -We should focus in less ethical aspects (probaly one or two) because the length of the movie limits our possibilities. -We should try to make a more realistic film if we want people to connect with the situation. -We shouldn't include so many locations, characters, special effects and resources in general because of our budget and time limitations. -We should avoid wtiting dialogues
In the forthcoming meeting with Ana in Valencia we will restructure the project to make it feasible.

Researchers believed that this localized increase will have little effect on cellular MAPK pathways unless Ras-GRF1 appeared in the nearby region (such as binding to specific region of NMDAR). Therefore, without the help of Ras-GRF1, the ChR2 cannot activate the signaling pathway. While Ionomycin works as a transporter which increase calcium level in the whole cell rather than in local regions. As a result, when induced with Ionomycin in the previous experiment, the expression level does increase.
To solve this problem, we have designed fusion protein with ChR2 and Ras-GRF1. It could restrict Ras-GRF1 in the region where Ca2+ influxes through ChR2. However, the result of this experiment is not shown hear.

The Actuator module of our design features Oct4 as well as col2 gene. Since time is limited for us, we checked the expression of Oct4 gene.
Below is the western-blot image we took in the experiment to check whether our cloned Oct4-myc (with myc tag attached to the peptide chain) can be expressed correctly. You can clearly see the band of Oct4 at about 39kD, which is exactly the molecular mass of Oct4-myc.
This photo indicates that our main part of Actuator, the Oct4 protein, is expressed successfully in ATDC5 cell line.

Yupeng He built and tested the hypoxia-inducible promoter, fdhF promoter (PfdfF, Part:BBa_K387003 ). In this test experiment, we expected to see that, at the same OD600, the activity of PfdhF is higher in hypoxia than in normal oxygen pressure (20%). At the beginning, both the hypoxia group and control (20% oxygen partial pressure, i.e. in air) group were incubated with 200 microlitre suspension of bacteria with the testing part (PfdhF followed by firefly luciferase). Then, we sampled both group and measured OD600 and value of luciferase every 30 minutes (control group) or 1 hour (hypoxia). The figure was the result of this test. Our result showed that this part worked as we expected: under hypoxia, the efficiency of this promoter was much higher than that under the condition of 20% oxygen at the same OD600"

Modeling 101
We wanted to simulate our system in silico to answer some questions and to explore the dynamics of our systems. Moreover, since we wanted to characterize and refine the transfer function for our interfaces, from photon flux to Pop flux, we chose to simulate our system as 6 individual modules.
We chose to use Simbiology as a modeling platform in order to take advantage of the implemented solvers in it. Eventually we realized that we wanted a stochastic simulation. So we took a look at the Kappa platform. In our search for ways to use the Kappa syntax, and having trouble with the RuleBase.org edition, we joined the KappaUsers forum and made a Tutorial on .ka scripts.
The Model, Original Idea
We decided to try some different approaches at modeling. At first, we were planning on a three level implementation where we could fall back on simpler levels should experimental data be scarce. The levels are thus:
.
The most complex level was the third, where we would have ODEs trained by a Neural Network (multilayer, minimal error, perceptron) describing the system's behavior. However, to do this, we needed the working system. In absence of this, we fell back to the second level.
The second level required the PopS characterization, however it used existing models (notably mass action kinetics) to simulate the rest of the system. In absence of PopS characterization, we fell to the first level.
The basic level required nothing but what should be found-able in the literature. We did found enough parameters to do the Simbiology model, however we didn't found the required for Kappa. In theory, we could have generated said stochastic parameters from the deterministic ones, but these required an extreme amount of computational time.
The Real Model
So, nearing the WikiFreeze craze, we decided to simply stuff. We got rid of the differential equations, and instead focused on using the existing implementations of the Master Chemical Equation found within Simbiology and Kappa to simulate our model. For simpler dynamics, we simulated with mass-actions kinetics.

Therefore, our strategy depends on providing production of pexiganan enter the mucosa according to presence of H.pylori or not. This system is based on the penetration of our engineered E.coli under the mucosa, and production of pexiganan under the control of the AND GATE system. After the production of pexiganan under the mucose, if this peptide is toxic for mammalian cells, this cannot be used for H.pylori eradication in the gastric mucosa. Therefore, toxicity level of pexiganan for mammalian cells must be higher than the requirement of H.pylori eradication. The potential toxicity of pexiganan has been investigated systematically by measuring the peptide’s hemolytic activity in human red blood cells in other studies. The reports suggested that at least 250 μg/mL is necessary to induce 100% hemolysis. (Navon, V; Feder, R et al. 2002 and Eren,T; Som, A et al. 2008) Two phase III clinical trials have reported that no adverse side effects have been found for pexiganan.

DAMP,  a four-helix bundle protein connected to Pexiganan, used to ensure pexiganan’s intracellular antimicrobial activity was prevented successfully. A design, as showed above, was used to attach DAMP to Pexiganan with a cleavage site. That cleavage site makes it possible to release Pexiganan in an exact concentration. In addition, DAMP provides high levels of solubles in recombinant bacteria. It also forms a four helix bundle structure that  has thermo stability and remains soluble at high salt levels. Finally, pexiganan embeds into DAMP and this provides limitted electrostatic of pex. It prevents damage to the cell membrane in the E. coli.

Background
Introduction
Biomining, is used to describe the novel approach in mining industry when microorganisms are applied to the extraction and recovery of precious and base metals from ores and concentrates[fig.1]. Technicially, it consists two branches, the bioleaching and biooxidation. The bioleaching strictly refers to the case when microorganisms are used to solubilize the metal. While biooxidation mainly focus on the pretreatment of target metals by bio-processsing minerals that occlude target metals, such as thiosulfate encompasses the gold.
Fig.1 Biomining is used to extract copper from copper ore.
Although the same biological process had been unknowingly used to extract metals at mine sites in, for example Spain, the UK and China, for several hundred years, the modern era of bioming began with the discovery of the bactreium, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans(now Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans) in the mid-1940s. In 1958 Kennecott Mining Company patented the use of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans for copper extraction from waste rock dumps at the Bingham Canyon mine in Utah, USA. A recent survey illustrates that currently bioming is commercially praticed in the production of 15% of copper, 5% of gold.
Why biomine?
Bio-extractive techniques have to compete with alternative approaches for extracting metals from ores and concentrates. Some, such as pyrometallurgical technologies[fig.2] (ore roasting/smelting) have been refined over millennia and often represent major investments by mining companies, while others, such as pressure leaching, are more recent non-biological innovations. Main microorganisms involved in mineral oxidation processes are autotrophs, and the processes operate usually at atmospheric pressure and at relatively low temperatures (20–80 °C). Biomining is generally perceived as a much more environmentally benign (‘green’) approach, involving much lower temperatures (and hence energy costs) and smaller carbon footprints, which contrasts with current biomining operations, relied on the blasting and grinding of ore bodies, emitting large amounts of CO2, consuming 5% of total global energy production. Bio- processing also has niche advantages in two circumstances: first, when the ore or concentrate contains significant quantities of arsenic; second,  for processing lowgrade and complex (polymetallic"

They are slightly bigger than the expected size between 7 and 9 nm, and thus it cannot be ensured that these particles are really produced by that enzyme.
Figure 11: Automatic identification of two gold nanoparticles (7 and 9 nm) in the gold silver mutant ferritin sample (BBa_K2638999) . These nanoparticles are approximately 30 % smaller than the nanoparticles produced by the wildtype ferritin.
Figure 11 shows two gold nanoparticles of 7 and 9 nm diameter that were produced by the gold silver mutant ferritin (BBa_K2638999) . They are exactly in the expected size range, although it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from this small size and number of particles.
Outlook
We could show that commercially available metal nanoparticles can be printed and melted to produce electronic circuits using temperatures as low as 350°C compared to the very high melting temperature of 1083 °C required to melt bulk copper. To use the NP we produced ourself for the printing of conductive circuits would have required higher amounts of the synthesized nanoparticles and would also have required further purification steps. Through our talks to Benjamin Lehner working at NASA we knew already that proteins mixed with the nanoparticles would lead to no or very poor conductivity when trying to sinter them without further purification. Using our own nanoparticles would be the logical next step.
Figure 12: Commercially available copper nanoparticles of 40 nm size were prepared under a nitrogen (N2) gas atmosphere in a rather simple setup using a plastic bag with inlets for the hands. The NPs where enclosed by putting two microscope slides on top of each other to prevent oxygen from reaching the NP during the sintering process. The NPs between the glass slides were heated to 350 °C for 10 minutes. The heating step was repeated 3 times resulting in a solid surface with a measurable conductivity of around 0.9 Megaohm. Heating experiments at lower temperatures of only 250 °C showed no conductivity. Also heating to 350 °C under an oxygen atmosphere (no glas slide was put on top) only lead to structures which where not conductive. We also tried to solve the NP in water which was deoxidized by bubbling N2 gas through it for 20 minutes. The NP solved in water and later dried under the N2 atmosphere also showed no conductivity after treating them at 350 °C despite putting them between glass slides to avoid the oxidising"

Chromoprotein Constructs
Design
Aim of the construct
Chromoproteins represent ideal reporter genes. Unlike fluorescent protein, from which chromoproteins were originally derived, they require no specialised optical equipment for detection. Our aim is to use a selection of such proteins, donated by the iGEM 2012 Uppsala team, as our most basic and main output in regards to the Marchantia framework.
We decided to test the following chromoprotein constructs:
35s - eforRed - nosT
35s - eforRed - N7 - nosT
35s - amilCP - N7 - nosT
35s - tsPurple - nosT
35s - tsPurple - N7 - nosT
35s - asPink - N7 - nosT
35s - aeBlue - N7 - nosT
By expressing the chromoproteins in the pGreen vector with the 35s promoter and the nosT terminaor, we control for the possiblity of the promoter/terminator not functioning in our chassis. The N7 fragment allows for the selected constructs to localise chromoprotein to the nucleus. It is believed by Bernardo Pollak that this may end up increasing the likelihood of detecting the chromoproteins with the naked eye.

The following ÄKTApurifier data were generated during purification:
Fig.10 ÄKTA_LCmut
Nonspecifically bound proteins were first removed by minimal addition of elution buffer (at 50mL and 68mL) and the LCwt was collected at 95mL in the fractions.
In the second phase of protein purification, fusion proteins and their negative samples were purified to test different assays for the evaluation of our Shuttle system and to further characterize the proteins.
pHluorin2
pHluorin2 is a GFP variant that displays a bimodal excitation spectrum with peaks at 395 and 475 nm. The protein is pH dependent.
The pHluorin2 is tagged with a Polyhistidin-Tag.
The following ÄKTApurifier data were generated during purification:
Fig.11 ÄKTA_pHluorin2
The graph shows an elution of the protein at even the smallest elution buffer concentrations. This should be taken into account when purifying pHluorin2 again to obtain more concentrated protein solutions. However, since the amount of protein was excellent, a second purification was not necessary.
The final protein concentrations and degrees of purity can be seen in the results - protein purification.
Results
To demonstrate the purity and expression of our various proteins, purification and expression assays were performed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentration was determined via the nanodrop. The specific extinction coefficient of the respective protein was determined using the ExPASy ProtParam tool and the measurement was adapted accordingly.
SNAP25
SNAP25 is a 25kDa large protein with an extinction coefficient (E) of 74000.  The expression and purification can be seen in the assays shown.
Fig. 12 SNAP25 expression
Fig. 13 SNAP25 purification
Even though the expression was not very strong, SNAP25 was obtained even purer. The concentration was 2.01mg/mL which could be directly frozen to -80°C.

Given this offset and the maximal expression, the signal over noise ratio can be derived. This ratio, which can then be compared amongst all curves, characterizes the impact of leakiness on the behavior of a system. The leakier a construct in its native form is, the more impact the riboregulator will have, and the more likely it is for the riboregulator to increase the signal over noise ratio. Our final constructs (Promoters with a riboregulating system ) have the following parameters:

We took the leakiness coefficients into account in our whole cell model .
Cross-talk
We investigated the existence of cross-talk between three quorum sensing systems (Lux, Las and Rhl). Each quorum sensing system is based on three components: a signaling molecule, a regulatory protein and a promoter. Cross-talk implies non-orthogonality of the communication systems. It corresponds to the fact that LasAHL can activate the Lux promoter, even if it is not its native communicating pathway. There are 27 combinations possible and only 3 native combinations between signaling molecule, regulatory protein and promoter.
Figure 4 Each quorum sensing system is based on three components: a signaling molecule, a regulatory protein and a promoter. These elements are here ordered into three layers. Cross-talk evaluation can be done by comparing all combinations of those three elements. After collecting the experimental data of all possible pathways, we modeled their influence.
From the exhaustive experimental data , the central role of regulatory proteins was identified, allowing the characterization of two-levels of cross-talk. The following parts in the Registry are presenting our results:

Aims of the project
One of the most important challenges in the field of modern medicine is to invent the efficacious anticancer therapy. The gene therapy appears to be the most effective strategy for metastasis remission without dangerous side effects, which are common disadvantages in the case of both radioand chemotherapy. Use of bare DNA particles is very inefficient, therefore new DNA delivery system is needed. The most common vectors used in genetic therapy are genetically altered viruses. However they generate problems that have not been solved yet. An integration into the host genome may lead to unpredictable sideeffects and increases cancer risk. Moreover this type of vector could cause acute immune response or symptoms of viral infection. Artificial systems of DNA or RNA delivery such as liposomes or alkaline polymers are characterized by low effectiveness and high toxicity.
The main aim of this project is to design a model system based on genetically modified Escherichia coli bacteria able to invade eukaryotic cells. This approach is the new alternative for established for years techniques. It has most of advantages of previously known viral vectors and, importantly, it does not induce negative changes in the patient’s genome. The created bacterial system will be applied to two problems. The first one is to create special bacterial strain, which is able to conjug"

Effect of the synthetic organism on the environment
In case the modified bacteria finds a niche in the environment, it may interact with other organisms as well as with the environment itself (e.g. changing the composition of the soil). The risk of a synthetic bacteria affecting the food webs and the biodiversity of the ecosystems is difficult to assess, as it will depend on the environment considered, and a lot of unknown factors will come into play (e.g. the bacterial composition of any ecosystem is still unknown). In our opinion, the best approach would be to decide the most likely environments where a spread of the synthetic organism might happen, based on two conditions: native environment of the unmodified parent strain and the environments where the synthetic cell will be applied. Once a limited number of environments have been selected, samples will be inoculated with the genetically modified bacteria in a controlled environment. Using metagenomic analysis, the samples will be studied to look for synergistic or toxic effects that the synthetic bacteria might have caused in the natural population.
Evolution and adaptation of the synthetic organism
Environmental supplementation happens when the environment contains a component that will render the biocontainment method useless and therefore will allow the bacteria to proliferate. Both horizontal gene transfer and mutagenic drift work at the DNA level, directly inactivating the biocontainment mechanisms, or unlocking an alternative way for the bacteria to survive. Although the environmental supplementation and horizontal gene transfer might be difficult to predict (because they depend in great extent on the specific ecosystem where the organism has been released), the mutagenic drift can be easily assessed by detecting escapees after the biocontained population has been inoculated in non-permissive media. The recommended limit for the number of escapees is 1 out of 108 [9].
Gene transfer from synthetic to natural organisms
Inactivating biocontainment mechanisms is not the only problem associated to horizontal gene transfer. Genetic material can also be transferred from synthetic organisms to natural ones, with possible threatening consequences (e.g. antibiotic resistance). Therefore, the ability of the synthetic organisms for sharing genetic material should be assessed. This could be assessed by mixing the synthetic strain with the natural one. After a time of co-culture, the genetic transfer could be identified through FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), using three different markers: one for the synthetic sequence, a second one for a sequence specific in the synthetic strain and a third one for a specific sequence in the natural strain. The number of genetic transfers will then be analysed through microscopy or flow-cytometry. The recommended limit of genetic transfer is the same as the limit for mutant"

Electron microscopy works similar to light microscopy (figure 1), but instead of visible light being used to illuminate the sample, it is done by electrons [1]. The EM has multiple lenses to focus the beam to magnify and light the sample. The lenses are electromagnetic instead of glass and therefore allow a much higher resolution than conventional light microscopy. In theory it is possible to reach a resolution of around 0.005 nm, but in practice it is mostly around 1-2 nm [1]. Possible reasons are certain errors of the lenses, inexperience of the operator (for example our team members) or the sample not being thin enough. All these factors can reduce the resolution of the electron microscope [1]. We investigated various samples obtained in our experiments with the help of the EM. The wild types of the Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and Hepatitis B (HepB) were detected.  Multiple variations of CCMV have been tested too, unfortunately with mixed results.

EM Course
The goal of the course was to get familiar with the EM and to handle it safely. Dr. Jan van Lent of the Virology department of Wageningen UR gave us an introduction to EM with a small presentation. During this instruction he explained in detail the electron microscope itself, the preparation of good samples and how to operate the EM properly. Afterwards he showed the sample preparation in the wet lab. Preparation of the sample is critical to have a good resolution and during the course we learned how to do it. The sample must be thin, between 2 - 300nm, and stable in the electron microscope. This can be done by drying or cryo-freezing the sample. After drying or freezing, the sample is stained with a coating containing a heavy metal salt. This coating reflects the electron waves of the microscope, whereas the spots with the VLPs have no coating at all. The missing coating allows the electron waves to go through unhindered. The information of reflection and permeability is processed to a full image which shows the VLPs.
After the preparation of the samples Dr. van Lent explained the whole procedures of visualizing a sample. After this last introduction we were able to analyze and investigate multiple samples ourselves. At the end of the day we were able to use EM for our own experiments starting with sample preparation, handling of the microscope and proper visualization. After the course, the attending team members, were trained and allowed to use the EM without supervision.

Human Practice
We have organized many different forms of human practice surrounding our project’s main goal: create genetically modified (GM) probiotics. From our visitation to Yili (the largest Diary enterprise in China) and our questionnaire posted, we learned general public’s attitudes toward GM food and the necessity of promoting biotechnology to them. So we reached out in many different ways. We held a street science exhibition, established a synthetic biology club, and collaborated with school medias including Student Television Station and our school magazine, which made abstract biology concepts more relatable. The responses we got from Yili also reminded us about the issues involving antibiotic marks we used in colony selection in lab, helping us to see the future of our project: add our target genes into the chromosome. Without having an integrated human practice, we would not be able to make our project accepted by the general public nor the government.
Poll: people’s attitude on Genetically Modified (GM) food
We posted a questionnaire on social media to investigate people’s attitudes toward GM food and how they get the information about GM products.
Fig. 1 People’s attitude towards GM food
Fig. 2 Source Reliability
The results indicate only 8.2% of people acquire their knowledge of GMO from very credible sources, suggesting to us that it is necessary to further promote the concept of synthetic biology and GM products.
Yili, Diary Enterprise
We visited Yili dairy enterprise, one of the biggest diary companies in China, to learn about the openness of the government’s attitude towards GM food, especially GM probiotics. The Yili representative, however, suggests the government currently has an unfriendly policy towards GM probiotics. This response demonstrates the importance of further promoting GM probiotics.
Media
School Student Television Station
In order to introduce iGEM and GM food to more students in our school, we collaborated with Student Television Station (STS), the most influential and dependable news media of our high school. We incorporated interviews on the subject of GM food with teachers and students, the general public’s attitude toward GM food, a brief introduction of iGEM and our team by Zhongxiu Hu, and a short segment about biology experiments in the video.

MC-RFPflip-A,B,C showed a higher fluorescence than MG-RFPflip-A,B,C.
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that, even after the marker excision process, the phenotype of the engineered cells is maintained.
Figure 9: relative RFP synthesis rate for all the RFP-expressing clones after marker excision. In this figure, the bars corresponding to the fluorescence of the clones before marker excision is also reported to facilitate the comparison between them. Note that all the three flip clones are derived from MC-RFP-A for the MC1061 clones and from MG-RFP-A for the MG1655 clones.
Discussion
A novel integrative vector for E. coli has been successfully designed, constructed and used to integrate two proof of concept protein expression systems in two commonly used E. coli strains.
The results showed that the vector is fully functional and can integrate into the correct targeted locus of the host chromosome through the Phi80 site-specific recombination system by using <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo>, an existing BioBrick helper plasmid from the Registry. In most cases, the integration occurs in tandem copies, probably because of the too high Chloramphenicol concentration used during the selection of integrants, which forces multiple integration of Cm-resistant constructs. This concentration was the same used during the pSC101 low copy plasmid (~5 copies per cell) selection. In some cases, it is desirable to have a single copy of the desired BioBrick in the genome, for example when the gene dosage is important. In [Haldimann A and Wanner BL, 2001] the usage of Chloramphenicol at 6 ug/ml yielded a very high percentage of single integrants. However, when tested in our lab, the MG1655 strain could survive on LB plates with Cm at 6 ug/ml and also at 8 ug/ml. For this reason a higher concentration of Cm was chosen for selection. Further studies should investigate the optimal antibiotic concentration to yield the highest single integrants percentage as possible.
The Flp/FRT mediated excision of the R6K and, most importantly, of the Cm resistance marker also worked by using the pCP20 helper plasmid. The estimated efficiency of this process was 100%. In addition, multiple tandem integrants became single integrants after the marker excision. This"

Spin down the DNA tubes from the Competent Cell Test Kit/Transformation Efficiency Kit to collect all of the DNA into the bottom of each tube prior to use. A quick spin of 20-30 seconds at 8,000-10,000 rpm will be sufficient. Note: There should be 50 µL of DNA in each tube sent in the Kit.
1.
Thawed 2 tubes of 100ul competent cells on ice.
2.
Pipet 2µL of DNA into each microcentrifuge tube. For each concentration, use a separate tube.
3.
Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
4.
Heat-shock the cells by placing into the waterbath @ 42C for 1 minute.
5.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
6.
Added 400 µL of SOC media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 2 hours. Prepare the agar plates during this time: label them, and add sterile glass beads if using beads to spread the mixture.
7.
Pipet 100 µL from each tube onto the appropriate plate, and spread the mixture evenly across the plate. Incubate at 37°C overnight or approximately 16 hours. Position the plates so the agar side is facing up, and the lid is facing down.
8.
Count the number of colonies on a light field or a dark background, such as a lab bench. Use the following equation to calculate your competent cell efficiency. If you've done triplicates of each sample, use the average cell colony count in the calculation.

To take an inappropriate example: a dangerous person, as long as he has enough reasons, he can buy all the materials to make explosives and create a terrorist attack.
In 2016, China's ministry of education finally began to pay attention to the issue of biosafety and forced some universities with laboratories to conduct biosafety training for students, such as Tsinghua University. Their training method is two hours offline course (basic experimental safety teaching) + follow-up meticulous teaching. (starting in 2016, self-study of online answer questions. You have to pass the exam to get the certificate, otherwise you can't graduate, and all new students have to attend 4-6 class hours on site. Each course has different safety training, for which a safety training system has been established.
In 2018, during an exchange between foreign students at Tsinghua University and Yale university, they learned about biosecurity training at Yale university. The biosafety training at Yale University is mainly online training, with a total length of 2-3h, and will be conducted online. 60 points will be passed, and only a few qualified certificates will be able to enter the laboratory. Although it’s not as strict as Tsinghua University, but to implement more strict than domestic in ordinary laboratory, such as security division (door), biological safety level, more strict processing and so on. Besides, the experimental area and living area are distinguished strictly and subsequent teaching is more meticulous, according to the different theme have supplementary teaching (e.g., radioactive safety training), thoughtful. It's more like a science lab than a teaching lab. They also conduct daily inspection during summer vacation, such as the use of protective equipment, shorts, slippers, etc.
In addition to laboratory safety issues, the limits of synthetic biology applications have been a controversial topic. Synthetic biology technology has impact on the meaning, value and meaning of traditional ""life"". But this ideological shock is not enough to justify the rejection of synthetic biology. First, even if synthetic biologists create life in the future, it is only biological ""life"" and cannot give ""life"" in the socio-cultural sense. If the public can participate in the evaluation, supervision of synthetic biology, the impact of this concept of life will be reduced greatly and the communication between scientists and the public will be enhanced. Second, with the development of modern science and social progress, the concept of human life is changing. Both Darwin's theory of evolution and Copernicus' heliocentric theory"

JOINN
In mid-october, our experiment has been basically completed. And we have completed the goals which we want to achieve before. We went to JOINN Laboratories, Inc. (one of the most famous biotech company in China) to communicate with our project. We had a clearer picture of the value of our project. They were interested in our project very much, and they gave us much advice about targeting the market.
Among these proposals from JOINN Laboratories, Inc., the followings are the more important ones:
(1) With the improvement of the life quality, people’s pursuit of health is getting higher and higher. People's appetite for food is mainly concerned with the followings:
① low calorie
② good taste
③ high sweetness
④ a sense of happiness
So on the basis of detecting the sweetness of sweet substances，we should think about taste and calorie of sweetness, which is important for our product to enter the market.
(2) Our biometric method involves the growth of the fungus, which may cause people to think about safety and health, so we should pack our items and ensure that the strain are safe and harmless.
(3) Before entering the market, we need to consider our project cost. Compared to the existing physical detection technology, our project cost shoule be an advantage.
ITCCC
In October, 2017, BIT-China was invited to take part in the the CGEM conference held by INTERNATIONAL TEENAGER COMPETITION AND COMMUNICATION CENTER. About 8 teams participated in the conference. All of them made splendid speeches to present their own projects and discuss with each other. During the special journey we got to know plenty of exciting ideas and got many useful help.
Conclusion
In our human practice, we got the idea of the project. Through this idea, we attached this idea to synthetic biology step by step. Finally, we completed it. In this process, we first understood the importance of sweetness for food through the form of social surveys. And we realized that people prefer natural sweeteners. Later, in order to target market, we went to one of China's most famous food companies, COFCO, learned that if we want to enter our project idea to the market in the future, we still faced with many problems.

We also struck out the 4 colonies on a plate and put them in the incubator.
We made 2 gels that were about 0.8% agrose.

We phosphetase treated the cut pSB1C3 plasmid that was cut with PstI and EcoRI that we got from the Denovo group (1μL anarctic phosphetase, 2 μL buffer, 10 μL plasmid that was 10 ng/μL, 7 ddH2O).
The UV g-block and pSB1C3 were then purified and eluted using 10μL. Assuming only 8μL came through, we nanodropped 1μL each. The UV was 4.5ng/μL and the pSB1C3 was 7.7ng/μL.
We ligated these two pieces together. Based on their sizes, and using a 1:3 ratio of insert to backbone, we needed to use all of the μL of both. This gave us approximately 50ng of backbone and 30ng of insert. So we used 7μL of each, 2μL ligase buffer, 1μL ligase, and 3μL water.
Then the new order of stuff came in so we digested the UV+pACYC184 and the GFP+pBR322 and HSP G-block with XhoI and KpnI so that we can swap promoter and reporter genes into our system.
