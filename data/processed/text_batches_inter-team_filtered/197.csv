Preface
A mechanism or an innovative invention or Bio part in genetic engineering would never become useful if there is not a useful application in the real world. And the best way to carry out a plan is through a machine. Our goal, the reduction of the severity of danger and the labor demanding throughout the process of production of Chitosan, would be perfectly carried out through the invention of a fully the automatic machine that can optimally utilize all the materials provided and the further reduction of loss throughout the whole process. Given so, it is the reason why we decide to carry out a machine.
Foundation
Throughout our team’s visit to Xian, we are able to visit a highly advanced pharmaceutical company that provided us with abundance academic training and also provided us with the basic foundation of machine building. We were able to travel to a different location of the factory and learn about the ways that existed for the better promotion of efficiency.  Formal history
Our team captain Jeff, a formal member of SDSZ-China( team for last year), visited the Tianjin pharmaceutical company last year during mid-July and he was in last year’s team. Last year team project is about finding the substitute of bear bile, a medicine that targeted people with diabetes and was livelily extracted from bears. The last year team recognized this issue but was unsuccessful in designing this year’s machine. However, Jeff and the last year team work extensively after the ending of iGEM 2017 and they were able to shadow scholars in the factories about the designing of a machine, They knew a lot. Jeff is able to spread the knowledge we knew from the factory visit and put it into application in this year’s team.  For example, in most factory, they progressively opened up the volume of the container being tested, eventually reaching one ton. We are able to replicate the process in a setting similar to the real world machine. To begin with, we started with testing the entire procedure under a normal setting of the lab. We successfully proved that the transformation works. And progressively we tested this in a larger setting. Wich is in a larger container. Now we successfully proved that we will be able to do that and we are"

What are PCBs?
PolyChlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), are a family of man-made aromatic organic chemicals which consist of two phenyl rings and several chlorines. The first PCB was synthesized in 1881 and several of them were developed during the 1940’s. The production of PCBs peaked in 1970’s, before the comfirmation that PCBs were for harmfull for human health. In 1979; the production of PCBs was banned in the U.S.A. In 1987, the total interdiction of production and usage of PCBs was promulgated in France.
www.nyacknewsandviews.com/2012/08/tal_hudsonpollution/
The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) was signed in 2001, which aims to eliminate or restrict the production and usage of PCBs and other persistent organic pollutants. The PCB world-wide ban is effective since May 2004.
PCBs are highly stable molecules. Although they are not manufactured anymore, they are still present in nature and they constitute a threat for the environment and human health. The aim of our project is to engineer, via synthetic biology approaches, bacteria that would efficiently of biodegrade PCBs.

Surveys
As none of the team members had actually been confronted with a bed bug infestation, luckily, we had to learn more about the subject.   Reading scientific articles and discussing with experts was a first necessary step but it wasn’t enough.  We needed to know more about people’s experience and feelings about bed bugs and to test the general publics opinion of our solution. That’s why we chose to conduct several surveys.
To ensure the widest possible audience, we made these surveys both in French and in English. Surveys were done through different forms: directly in the street or via google forms that we shared on our crowdfunding platform and with other iGEM teams (tec-Monterrey and Leiden).  Here collected the answers from 131 people:
As we are a student team, a high proportion of answers were from students, this may cause a bias in the answers and should be taken into account.
As we can see on these two graphs and this map, people are quite concerned by beg bugs and not only in places where surveys were done (France, Mexico, The Netherlands) but also in Senegal, Egypt and in Brazil. Bed bugs are a worldwide issue.  Then, we wanted to get a general idea of how people manage bed bug infestations.
These results show that even with current decontamination methods, the infestation persists in time and current solutions (like chemical treatment, steam, fumigation, diatomaceous earth, and canine scent detection) are not efficient and remain very costly as people can sometimes be charged up to 5,000€.   Knowing that, we presented our concept and asked for people’s preferences and opinions.
The real problem that people perceive is the lack of efficiency of existing disinfestation methods. This is the major point that these answers reveal. 45% of respondents care more about an efficient solution than about an affordable one or an individual/personal solution. They are concerned about an ecologically friendly solution and speed of action was also an important point.
As GMOs are the heart of our project, we wanted to have the public's opinion about the use of Genetically Modified Organisms. "
UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#LightToColor_-_-_TEXT.html,"FMO and gusA can react with X-gal, tryptophan and Rose-gluc, respectively. The products of these enzymes can form insoluble precipitates and color the plates. We also used enzymes to test our system under a more complexed situation, to prove our concepts.
Figure 3. The compositions of four plasmids we constructed.
Six plasmids composed the whole system, pJFR1 (BBa_K2598049), pJFR2 (BBa_K2598050), pJFR3(BBa_K2598051), pJFR4(BBa_K2598053), pJFR5(BBa_K2598052) and pJFR6(BBa_K2598061). The ‘sensor array’ module and the core fragment was integrated into pJFR1. The ‘circuits’ and ‘resource allocator’ were integrated into pJFR2 and pJFR3. And the ‘actuators’ containing fluorescence proteins, chormoproteins and enzymes were integrated into pJFR4, pJFR5 and pJFR6, respectively. We transformed four plasmids into our E.coli and finished our artwork.(For more information, see PARTS ).
Mixing Colors in Cells!
Although more fluorescent proteins and chromoproteins are edited to generate more and more colors, the number of colors produced by organisms is still limited by the number of the kinds of proteins. Once a new color is needed, researchers have to modify the chromophores of the proteins, which takes much time and effort.
So how do we create more colors, to make our rose more colorful in a reasonable and convenient way? Here, we put forward a new concept—mixing color in bacterial cells! Unlike the mix of different bacterial cells which produce different colors as the previous iGEM teams have done[5], we used tandem expression and RGB system to control the ratios of the expression of different colors in bacterial cells, to achieve mixing color in bacterial cells, and stain our roses with more bright colors.
Mixing Color by Tandem Expression!
To prove our concept, we firstly use the tandem expression of chromoproteins. By putting two chromoprotein RBSs and genes under one promoter, we constructed six plasmids(BBa_K2598043, BBa_K2598044, BBa_K2598045, BBa_K2598046, BBa_K2598047, BBa_K2598048) to tandem express eforred, amilCP, amilGFP and fwYellow chrom"

Phillippines - Developing Nation, Limited/ Improving Public Investment
The Philippines Department of Health has started an Insulin Access Program in 2009, however cheap insulin is only available from a short list of government sponsored hospitals. When available, the subsidised price is 500 Philippine Pesos (~$US10). For many in the market, this simply hasn’t been an option until now. It is likely the government can’t afford the expense to expand access. Otherwise more work needs to be done to raise awareness of the program and the possibility of switching insulins. [23] The Philippines is expected to have one of the highest rates of newly diagnosed diabetics by 2025, prompting the government to investigate further options. The national insurance system does not allow comprehensive coverage of diabetes management, is only limited to certain household members, and provides limited medication coverage. “Out-of-pocket” health care continues to be the main mechanism of patient–doctor relationship and compensation.[23]
Metformin and sulfonylureas are the most commonly prescribed medications due to their availability and cheaper cost. SciLin R is an available generic from Singapore, but at $262 yearly expense - it is far from the price of generics in other countries.[21]
“Even if I have work, it's really a burden for me to buy Insulin because it is indeed very costly. Imagine Lantus Solostar 3mL Pen costs around 850+ pesos and I consume it for only 6 days, Humalog 3mL cartridge I consume for about 10 days that costs 800+ pesos. If I'm going to sum all my expenses on medicines and syringes alone it will cost me around 6,000 pesos a month, that's roughly half of what I am getting from my job, and I still need to pay for the house rent, water, electric and telephone bills and of course my son's therapy and food. I haven't included the cost of blood glucose strips yet, that's gonna be around 5,000 pesos if you test pre and post meals in a month. For an average earner like me, it's gonna be a challenge on how to budget my monthly salary with everything that's coming my way. No wonder some people give up and die from diabetes complications, especially the poor that can't afford to pay for Insulin to live.”[24]
“Humulin N is 1,345 pesos in Drugstores and I got it for 413.40 pesos only because of the Insulin Access Program of DOH."

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," using their biobricks that enable rapid immobilization of organisms via nanowires, together with the ability to accurately print these in the form of biofilms, one could create coatings that would be easy to produce and ideally suited for bio-composite leaves. A coating of cyanobacteria could simply be printed on a piece of porous paper and placed in the gas-phase of a photobioreactor for a steady supply of CO2, where it would function much in the way as described by Bernal et al. [2014]. Further leveraging Amsterdam’s consortium design, a layer of cyanobacteria would be printed on top of a layer of chemotrophic cell-factories like E. coli, who would use the constant supply of carbon provided by the cyanobacteria to produce end-products like biofuels, which would be transported to an extraction chamber where the product would be isolated.
Previous method based on extrusive coating method described by Bernal et al. (2014). .
Together, the work of team Amsterdam and TU Delft shows how combining separate iGEM projects can unlock new solutions to existing problems that could lead to new innovations. Indeed, the sustainable product formation enabled by Amsterdam’s consortium and the ease of printing biofilms with immobilizing nanowires developed by TU Delft could turn the type of biocomposite devices described by Bernal et al. into the cheap, versatile biofactory of the future."

UCL,2015,Team:UCL#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"-mic based in an old underground venue of East London, and with the help of Patrick, its coordinator, we were able to promote our event and spark some curiosity among the City’s creative scene. Having discovered the mental health and arts charity CoolTan Arts, we got a taste of how creativity could be implemented as a means to recovery and stigma challenging. This way, we decided to bring our initiative of promoting this by including some of the artwork produced by patients suffering from mental distress. During the evening, the exhibition showcased in the back of Mully’s basement bar, our chosen venue. Next to it there stood a range of art postcards, donation boxes and books on the anthropological, poetical (and even cooking for our mind!) ways of perceiving mental health. The money fundraised went towards supporting charity’s principles based on something that really resonated with the purpose of our efforts within Mind the Gut.
Interviews
We have been been involved in a number of discussions with leading scientists and healthcare professionals in the field of synthetic biology and mental health.
Prof. Dame Sue Bailey: Chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges as well as Consultant Child and Adolescent Forensic Psychiatrist. She is particularly involved in young people who experience mental health issues, social justice and youth justice systems.
Prof Glyn Lewis: Director of UCL Division of Psychiatry, Chair in Clinical Trials & Applied Epidemiological Psychiatry. He advised us on how to better understand the field of psychiatry and current treatments available for patients, as well as introducing us to the need for novel treatments that reduce side effects.
Dr. Eben Kirksey: we interviewed Eben about our project, a lecturer from Princeton University who has contributed to theoretical conversations in the social sciences, biology, the humanities, and the arts. After a long talk about the anthropological implications of our project and our ‘Hypersymbionts’ in which he was particularly interested, he told us that he would feature our collection in his latest book for Duke University Press.
Prof John Cryan: leading neuroscientist in the field of psychobiotics and the gut-brain axis, who was recently featured in the World’s most influential scientific minds. Our team travelled all the way up to Cork, Ireland, to meet up with Cryan, who updated us on current research and helped us to see our project potential. Furthermore, he helped us to gain a better understanding of gut-brain axis and redirect our research in some areas.

As it will be described later on, POPs have a tendency to adhere to the plastic 105 to 106 times more than reamin in the ocean. As curli synthesis is induced by the POPs this means that curli synthesis will be the specificity to our system.
2. Cell: NahR is a constitutively produced mRNA product (R9) of which around 3% degrades (R10). When POP diffuses into the cell (R2), it forms a complex with intact NahR (R3) which then binds to the pSal promoter (R4) to induce the curli gene cluster (R5).  This starts translation of five proteins which make up curli fibrils.  Here we focus on those controlled by the CsgAB operon, CsgA (R7) and CsgB (R6), as these are the most important in curli synthesis as described on our research page .  The CsgA and CsgB that do not degrade (R11, R12) diffuse out of the cell.
3. Outside2: Outside of the cell the polymerization of CsgA by CsgB takes place (R8) to make a curli fibril.

Our transformations in JM110 with bio bricks BBa_K516030 (RBS + RFP + TT) and BBa_I712074 (promoter) dind’t grow, we think that this is because the bacteri efficiency is too low. To solve this, we’re going to use the same method as on the first team transformations, two months ago: first cloning in DH5α and after in JM110 to remove the dam methylation from the Xbal restriction site. For more details, please, access Methods.
Besides the transformtion of DH5α with bio bricks BBa_K516030 and BBa_I712074, we made a new test with mercury discussed yesterday.
We made inoculum in liquid medium LM (LB + Mercury chloride) with concentration of 2ug/ml, 5ug/ml and 10ug/ml the construction and the hosts:
- Only DH5α, without resistence to Hg.
- DH5α with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3
- DH5α with BB_Essential + E0840 in PSB1C3
- DH5α with BB_Essential + K346004 in PSB1C3
We also made inoculum in liquid medium LM 50ug/ml and 100ug/ml 10 colonies from Negro River and the stream contaminated with industry residuals (samples A1, A2, A3, A4; E1, E2; P1, P2, P3; S1) that already showed to be able to grow in medium LM, in high concentrations! We’re being really careful!
In three days we’re gonna have the results. We’re cheering that DH5α with BB_Essential + E0840 in PSB1C3 and DH5α with BB_Essential + K346004 in PSB1C3 grow up in LM!!!!
Today we also started a new journey: Sequencing our Bio bricks. On these first steps we’re going to adjust the"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Localization_-_-_TEXT.html," showed a RNA integrity number (RIN) above 9 which means that the total mRNA is pure and does not have any contamination. During the first step of RT-qPCR the total mRNA in converted to cDNA by a reverse transcriptase, which is then used in the actual quantitative PCR to quantify the amount of a specific mRNA was produced by the cells. For this reason two primer pairs were designed. One of them was designed to bind the exact same region in all of the different receptor mRNAs and amplify the same part of the receptor. Contrary to that the second pair was supposed to bind only in the biotin presenting receptor and amplify a part that is unique to this receptor. By this method we wanted to observe if only one part of the mRNA is unstable or if the general mRNA level of this receptor is decreased.
For the evaluation of the raw data we used the ΔΔCP method [22] in which the crossing points (CP values) of a gene of interest and of a reference gene are compared and normalized with a constantly expressed HKG, to get an idea of the relative amounts of the mRNA of interest.
In the following you can see the results of our experiments. We compared the expression levels of T-REx cells which were transfected with our different receptor constructs and with non-transfected (NT) T-REx cells.
Fig.x
As can be seen the ΔΔCP values of the mRNA of the eMA and scAvidin constructs are with a 1,2 x  106 fold increase for scAvidin and 1.5 x 103 fold increase for eMA, significantly higher than those of the BAP construct. The analysis of the different primer pairs in the two regions of the BAP construct also showed similar values and thus confirms the reliability of the measurement. A difference in CP value is tantamount to relative mRNA differences between cells.
Together with the result that the integration of the constuct into the genome was successful we can conclude that our first assumption, that the missing RFP signal in cells, which were transfected with the BAP construct, is caused by a reduced mRNA stability, is correct.
High resolution imaging using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
As we wanted to obtain high resolution images from the transgenic cells transfected with our modular membrane proteins we contacted one of the experts on electron microscopy in Munich and luckily Prof. em. Dr. Wanner (LMU Munich) agreed to support our project by contributing scanning electron microscopic (SEM) imaging. Even better suitable for our purpose Prof. Wanner has developed a"
NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", we tried to use different voltages to transform the plasmid. Sadly, all of these attempts rendered negative results.
We considered whether the luxS gene is toxic for GR286, and the bacteria tends to reject the gene when a strong promoter is inserted upstream of it. So, we planned to use inducible promoter to reconstruct our expression vector.
The plasmid pWH1520 contains a strong xylA promoter originating from Bacillus megaterium, and transcription initiated by this promoter is xylose-inducible. Also, the gene of interest carries its own ribosome binding sequence (RBS) and translation initiation codon. Based on these points, we redesigned primers.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2012,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Project#project2.3_-_-_TEXT.html," recruited naphthalene degradation pathway in Pseudomonas species, which has been well characterized. Six crucial enzymes are involved in naphthalene degradation pathway.
Fig1: Demonstration of naphthalene degradation pathway in Pseudomonas species
In the first catabolic step, an oxygen molecule is introduced at the 1,2-position of the aromatic nucleus to produce cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene by naphthalene dihydrodiol dioxygenase(NahA). cis-1,2-Dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene is then dehydrogenated to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene by cis-naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase(NahB). 1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene is cleaved by 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase(NahC), and the resulting ring-cleavage product spontaneously cyclizes to form 2-hydroxy-2H-chromene-2-carboxylic acid. Enzymatic reactions by an isomerase(NahD) and a hydratase-aldolase(NahE) result in the production of salicylaldehyde, which is then transformed to salicylate by salicyladehyde dehydrogenase(NahF).
Design of Experiment
To test whether Membrane Accelerator could accelerate naphthalene biodegradation pathway, we are trying to link six crucial enzymes (NahA, B, C, D and E) to orderly organized membrane anchors and expressed them in E.coli. E.coli expressing the same type and amount of cytoplasmic enzymes is set as control group.

Biodesulfurization of Dibenzothiophene (DBT)
Background
We found that many iGEM teams wanted to express enzymes of biodegradation pathway in E.coli. However, it doesn't have significant superiority compared to traditional strain screening strategy. The power of synthetic biology is not fully demonstrated here.
We got inspired by project of 2012 iGEM team Calgary. One of their goals is to achieve desulfuration of dibenzothiophene in E.coli. Sulfur in crude oil could contribute to global warming, acid rain, and various health issues.

Pasteur_Paris,2016,Team:Pasteur Paris#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"zymatic digestion by Xba I and Hind III followed by electrophoresis revealed the presence of the C2 insert.
Once checked, we cloned our construct into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain, a specific dedicated strain to produce high amounts of desired proteins under a T7 promoter. Bacteria were grown on large scale (4 l), and we made a growth curve (Fig. 5). Protein expression was induced with IPTG overnight at 15°C. Protein purification was achieved using the His-Tag. Owing to the intrinsic affinity of C2 for cellulose, we had to revert to a polystyrene column for purification to work. We eluted our protein using a gradient of imidazole-containing buffer, and two peaks were detected (Fig. 6). We checked the presence of proteins in the fractions by SDS-PAGE. We clearly noted the appearance of bands at about 25 kDa, the expected size of our fusion protein (24 967 Da), but also at about 50 kDa (Fig. 7). We hypothesized that it could be monomers (25 kDa) and dimers (50 kDa). Indeed, since Si4 of C2 is able to condense silicic acid, it could potentially form dimers via Si-O bonds that resist reduction by β-mercaptoethanol.

Welcome to KIT-Kyoto wiki page
KIT, Kyoto Institute of Technology, is a national university in Kyoto, which had been the capital city of Japan for more than a thousand years. KIT was founded to do research on silk and textile, important for artistic kimono industries for Kyoto.   Though its name has 'technology' in it, KIT is a fusion of science and arts. KIT has been committed in the genetics more recently. A good example is the Drosophila Genetic Resource Center (DGRC), which collects stocks of Drosophila, an essential model organism in life science research, from laboratories around the world. There are only two other such centers in the world. The institute has also collaborated actively with industries in Kyoto and beyond.   KIT's competence is beyond science. It also has arts and design courses.   KIT is a place of robust science and creative arts.  We will exert our strength As students of KIT, we are very proud of competing with wonderful students in other universities in iGEM. We will show you what you will get when arts and science merge. See you in Boston!

Investigator: Saskia
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was to pellet the 1.67 l cell suspension 18 h after expression induction and to wash the pellet with breaking buffer. Then the cells were lysed using glass beads.
Operational sequence:
At first, the OD600 of the suspensions was determined:
CaXMT1: 0.424
CaMXMT1: 0.384
CaDXMT1: 0.516
The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 25 minutes at 4°C. Afterwards the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml breaking buffer without PMSF. The cells were centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 25 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in 13-14 ml breaking buffer with PMSF for the cell lysis. An equal amount of glass beads solved in breaking buffer were added and the cell supsensions were votexed and stored on ice each for 30 seconds. This two steps were repeated 30 times. Then the suspensions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored and the beads were washed again in 5 ml breaking buffer with PMSF and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. 1 ml was stored at - 80 °C for enzymatic analysis. And the rest was used for dialysis and purification for detection of all three enzymes via LCMS.

Results: Binding of anti-phyA to phyA was not observed in RIfs. Yet, at both measurements was faced some problems: much of the protein was washed away from the spotted spot. → We have to take lower concentrations for spotting (100-400 ug/ml) Anti-tYFP to YFP binding could not be detected aswell: Actually, this wont work on PDITC since all of the expression mix proteins also bind to the spot, compete with the (already low concentration) YFP for binding → almost no YFP can bind to the spot.  We have to repeat experiment for cellfree expressed YFP/GFP with specific surface (e.g. Ni-NTA)

In quorum sensing (QS) process, bacteria regulate gene expression by utilizing small signaling molecules called autoinducers in response to a variety of environmental cues. QS molecules secreted by bacteria are small, diffusible signaling molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the external environment. When the concentration of the autoinducers reaches a threshold, an alteration of gene expression is induced, allowing the bacteria to adopt behaviors that are only productive when the bacteria are working together as a group [8].
Many quorum sensing molecules have been identified until now. In contrast to other autoinducers that are specific for a narrow range of organisms, the widely conserved AI-2 has been hypothesized to be a universal language for interspecies communication [9]. In every case, AI-2 is synthesized by LuxS, which functions in the pathway for metabolism of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a major cellular methyl donor. In a metabolic pathway known as the activated methyl cycle, SAM is metabolized to S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is subsequently converted to adenine, homocysteine, and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD, the precursor of AI-2) by the sequential action of the enzymes Pfs and LuxS [10].
The regulatory network for AI-2 uptake is comprised of two other important components, lsrR and lsrK, which are located adjacent, but divergently transcribed from the lsr operon (Figure 1). LsrR is the repressor of the lsr operon and itself. LsrK is a kinase responsible for converting AI-2 to phospho-AI-2, which is required for relieving LsrR repression. It has also been postulated that phospho- AI-2 binds to LsrR and inactivates it to derepress the transcription of lsr [11].Since LsrR contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain, it was hypothesized that LsrR represses the expression of lsr operon and itself by binding to their promoter regions [12].
Two independent groups demonstrated that H. pylori secretes AI-2 into its extracellular environment by a luxS-dependent mechanism.[13,14] Therefore we planned to use LsrR system to sense AI-2 molecules synthesized by H. Pyl"

After a day we find some single colonies in the TOP 10 plate. So we use TOP 10    cell to make competent cell. To make sure the PKD46 plasmid transfer into the TOP 10 cell, we extract plasmid and use electrophoresis technology to verify, the result was correct. It means PKD46 plasmid was in the TOP 10 cell.

1.5 To summarize…
Tissue vector
Tissue vector function is to carry cell vector to reach the organ of interest, the one containing the target cell.
It should contain three essential characteristics. As a bacterial vector, it should not be pathogen for the patient, or at least not much harmful. It should have an interesting tropism, which means to be able to attain the target tissue. And finally, the most important characteristic, it must be able to foil the immune system, in order not to be destructed or eliminated before reach its objectives.
During this chapter you will discover on which characteristics we based our reasoning to choose the best bacterium in term of efficiency.
Then, you will discover in more details its properties through different constraint imposed by DVS concerning its pathogenicity, its resistivity and its tropism.
Finally, we will present you an improvement brought to the bacterium in order to make an optimal tissue vector.
Back to top
The tissue vector: Mycobacterium avium [1,2]
We studied several bacterial types to determine the best ratio between a low pathogenicity, an interesting tropism and a good resistance to the immune system, to choose the best tissue vector.
A hard task, cause in general rules, a microorganism which resists to the immune system is potentially dangerous for its host. We had to find a resistant microorganism but which does not have a high pathogenicity for humans. Indeed it is easier to reduce the pathogenicity than improve the resistance, we have chosen this last factor for the selection.
At first, we list bacteria presenting a resistance to the immune system."

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html,", terminator genes or inhibition of reproduction).” Semantic containment will allow to be sure that the synthetic genome/organism is not any more able to share its genetic data with the Nature. Implementations of semantic containment could be to design a different genetic code that could reside in using
new codons,
new amino acids
new nucleotides
new DNA backbone
new DNA polymerases
new ribosomes
The French page of wikipedia remind us that noon of the four “bolts” offer “certain, definitive or complete protection”, but that has to be considered all together to get to a high level of security. These new framework has to be setup at world level. Industry could use Extreme Genetically Organisms, if and only if, they implement these 4-level procedures, which could be defined in a future ISO norm .
Protocols to fight hazard
George M Church’s article, A Synthetic Biohazard Non-proliferation Proposal (Church 2004), is surprising in its aim and representative of a certain spirit of synthetic biology. This more academic source does not go through material modes of containment and biological systems of security. It proposes, in a very precise way, to set up an ensemble of procedures of control that are more or less institutional, to create a series of agencies, administrative protocols and organisms of regulation in order to “decrease risks while minimizing impact on legitimate research”. Thus, a licensing system of reagent and instrument is proposed, as “non-profit or government DNA Instrument & Reagent Registry (DIRR) database and web site would allow manufacturers and customers to register their instruments”. A chain of checking and responsibilities is described, from the seller to the customers, through entities as States, manufacturers and distributors of agents, shipping companies, etc. Registers, websites and databases are also presented as needed to manage “existing machines, the resale of used machines and confirmed destruction of machines.” Checking methods as developed by the Drug Enforcement Agency are promoted. That precision and proceduralization in the aim to answer to security imperatives is well described in the article and we won't reproduce it in detail here. But, we must wonder about that proceduralization. Two explanations seemed important to us. The first is about the structure of production in modern life science. Scientists in that field, especially Americans, have to answer to strict security specifications about biological materials needed for their research and handling. Thus administrative “machinery” is admitted as legitimate, integrated in the scientific process andused daily by researchers. These habits of scientists, in their ordering of biological materials or in their conceptions of necessary conditions of security, will determine their ethical disc"

However, in the tube that had more differentiation between steps, the band was very faint. this may be why the band disappeared when a more specific gradient was ran. Now that we know where normal T7 bands, we will be able to extractabove and below the band for small and large mutants.

Part 2: Growing Electrocompetent cells
1. 100 mL LB media was added to 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (total 200 mL of media)
2. 100 µL of Streptomycin was added to each of the Erlenmeyer flasks.
3. The optical density (OD) of cells grown overnight culture was measured.
4. The Erlenmeyer flasks were inoculated with enough of the overnight media so that the OD in each Erlenmeyer flask was 0.01.
5. The two flasks were then put in a shaker at 30 C with 300 rpm. *Note: Growing the cells at 30C instead of 37C will alter the growth of the cell membrane
6. Once an OD of 0.5 was reached in the flasks, they were removed from the shaker.
Part 3: Harvesting Electrocompetent cells.
1. While the cells are growing in Part 2, 50 micrcentrifuge tubes were labeled and then set in a box in the -80C freezer.
2. The centrifuge was turned on an cooled to 4C.
3. The contents of the Erlenmeyers flasks were transferred to 4x50mL Falcon Tubes, while making sure the tubes remained chilled.
4. The tubes were put in the pre-chilled centrifuge and spun down at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes.
5. The supernatant was poured out, being careful not to disturb the pellets at the bottom.
6. 25 mL of 10% glycerol was added to each of the tubes and used the gently resuspend the pellet.
7. The contents of the 4 x 25mL Falcon tubes were transferred so that there were 2 X 50 mL Falcon tubes.
8. These 2 tubes were then spun at 4C and 4500 rpm for 10 minutes.
9. Again, the supernatant was poured out and the pellets were resuspended in 25 mL of 10% glycerol.
10. The contents of the 2 x 25mL Falcon tubes were transferred to 1 x 50mL Falcon tube.
11. The tube was spun down again (making sure to balance the centrifuge) at 4C and 4500 rpm for 10 minutes.
12. The supernatant was discarded.
13. This time, the cells were resuspended with 2 mL of 20% glycerol.

Nylon-6 Biosynthesis
Nylon is a designation for a family of semi-aromatic polyamids that can be worked into various useful forms. Thin films of nylon have similar properties to polyvinyl chloride plastic wrap, capable of stretching under stress before tearing. Nylon fibers are lightweight and have high tensile strengths, making them very useful when woven into fabrics. Besides its applications in clothing, woven nylon is most commonly used in hot air balloon membranes and sailboat sails due to its durability. Properties of nylon materials such as tensile strength, heat resistance, and abrasion resistance can be increased by crosslinking the polymers using various methods. [1] The most common forms of nylon in the textile and plastic industries are nylon-6 and nylon-6,6, both of which have similar physical characteristics. While nylon-6,6 is a copolymer, nylon-6 is a homopolymer, making it a more appropriate candidate for biosynthesis. For these reasons, our team identified nylon-6 as one of our candidate biomembranes.
Nylon-6 is industrially produced through the chain-growth polymerization of caprolactam, the cyclical form of 6-aminocaproic acid (6-ACA). Our team investigated potential biosynthesis routes for this monomer, looking for pathways with common starting substrates to design a production system for 6-ACA that could be implemented on an extraterrestrial body. Past retrosynthetic analyses have uncovered two fermentative pathways for the production of 6-ACA, which both lacked required biocatalytic steps until 2015.

Coupling with the two mechanisms together, we are able to discern for both the presence of Pgt as well as if the strain is virulent to the crops. If a signal is produced in the detection step but not profiling, the race of Pgt is virulent to Sr35."

Domain A is formed by residues 38-93 while domain B is   formed by residues 1-37 and 94-108. The mannan binding site is only found in domain A. This figure is taken from   Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2Y1S).
We fused INPNC and MVN together to anchor MVN on the outer membrane. MVN is oriented outwards into the medium to   recognize and bind to the specific cyanobactera cells. We added a 10 aa flexible protein domain linker in between to   make sure that MVN and INPNC can function separately without much mutual interference. The fusion protein INPNC-MVN   is expressed under a library of constitutive promoters including BBa_J23106, BBa_J23105, BBa_J23114, BBa_J23117 and   BBa_J23113. We also designed our E. coli to express GFP at the same time. The E. coli cells were later   co-incubated with M. aeruginosa and observed under the fluorescence microscope afterwards. The fluorescence   of GFP and chlorophyll A can help mark our E. coli and M. aeruginosa so that we could identify the   binding effect later.
Figure 3. Schematic representation of the binding reaction between E.   coli and Microcystis aeruginosa. INPNC anchors at the outer membrane of the E. coli and displays   MVN on its C terminus. Linker1 is the blue strand between INP C-domain and MVN . MVN has one Man &#945(1 &#8594 2)   Man binding site which is a typical component in the LPS of the M. aeruginosa. E. coli and M.   aeruginosa are bound together by the intermolecular force.
In addition to this E. coli - M. aeruginosa binding assay, we also designed two additional tests.   One test is a direct binding assay with M. aeruginosa and purified MVN protein to prove the binding ability   of MVN directly and the other test is a rTEV protease digestion assay to estimate the amount of MVN oriented   outwards. Detailed information will be described in the Results.

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"osamides can be inhibited by methylation of the A2058 adenine in the 23S rRNA. This modification prevents the antibiotic from fully binding to the ribosomal E site such that protein synthesis proceeds. Mutations in either the A or B subunit of DNA gyrase offers resistance to quinolones. Mutations in the β-subunit of RNA polymerase can offer resistance to rifampin by reducing the binding efficiency of the antibiotic to the exit of RNA polymerase such that transcription proceeds normally. Similarly a mutation in the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome confers resistance to streptomycin. Mutations in the enzymes which are active in tetrahydrofolate synthesis also occur and offer resistance to trimethoprim and sulfonamides. Bacteria have evolved to render antibiotics ineffective by changing the target of antibiotic activity, either the primary structure of the protein or by the addition of chemical groups.[1]
Finally, certain antibiotics require activation and resistance can be conferred by preventing this from occurring. This is true of metronidazole and isoniazid used to treat ulcers and tuberculosis respectively.[1]  Given enough time, bacteria evolve mechanisms of resistance to practically any antibiotic.
http://groundupstrength.wdfiles.com/local--files/health%3Aantibiotic-resistance-questions-and-answers/antibiotic-resistance.jpg
Transmission of antibiotic resistance:
Bacteria utilize a variety of methods to propagate antibiotic resistance. Genetic transfer of resistance genes may take the form of transposons, integrons, and conjugative transposons. Transposons are pieces of DNA flanked by insertion sequences coding for the enzyme transposase that can insert themselves into the genome or plasmid of a cell. These can potentially carry, and thus spread a resistance gene. Integrons are transposons that also have an integrase gene and an attachment site. This allows circular pieces of DNA, like plasmids, to be integrated into the genome. Conjugative transposons (CTn) differ in that they transmit themselves from the genome of one cell to the genome of a second cell. The CTn excises itself, circularizes, is passed by conjugation to another cell, and integrates itself into the genome.[1]
While random mutations can and sometimes do confer resistance to an antibiotic, transmission of resistance genes already present in the population from natural selection and genetic drift is far more time and energy efficient for a bacterium. Plasmids are one mode of transmission of antibiotic resistance genes. When two cells conjugate, one which has a pl"

I’m an undergraduate student          in Biology in the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH). I love the          science and the nature; my principal attraction are the insects. But I’m          interesting in the Synthetic Biology because for me it is a field to solve          social and economic problems, that's why I like so much iGEM. And my free time,          I like reading, watching romantic movies, swimming and dancing.
Armando Romero
My name is Armando Romero, I`m 26          years old. I was born in Honduras, a country located in the heart of Central          America. I am a medicine student. Actually I am an intern in the last year of          my career. I love Medicine, Philosophy and Science.
 I love science because it is a way to          get near to the truth. It is one of the ways to discover the world and how it          works. The opportunity to participate in this investigation represents for me a          space to learn, learn about synthetic biology, the scientific method and how          others are walking in the same  path to help their comunities.

Introduction
IGEM encourages participants to conduct human practice, to see the world, and to exchange experience with other people. We love this idea because it offers us a chance to get inspired by the society, allows us to better understand the meaning of our scientific research, and constantly reminds us how and why we should contribute back to the society. Therefore, we strived to integrate human practice activity closely into our project advancement.
We began by surveying the public knowledge of intestinal diseases and by interviewing three leading professionals (doctors and researcher) to get a vivid understanding of the severity and incidence of intestinal diseases. We realized intestinal diseases including IBD, are big threats to human health, yet without a cure and without sufficient public acquaintance. We therefore decided to tangle IBD by engineered bacteria and succeeded in proof-of-concept experiment in using bacteria produced therapeutic agent (EGF) to alleviate IBD symptoms. During the communications with other teams , we received concerns on safety issues that we must deal with. So we upgraded our biosafety strategies by not only using two types of kill switches, but also using a 'warship' (which limits bacteria spreading and still allows nutrient and chemical exchanging). In addition, in the spirit of raising public interests, we established an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI) to advertise the beauty of synthetic biology to the community. Meanwhile, we used posters and popular social media to introduce intestinal bowel disease and our work to the society.
Interviews
At the beginning of our project design, we thought of many possible treatments but during the process of reasoning we encountered some difficulties. In the spring of 2016, at National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, we interviewed Professor Pengfei Lu who was a researcher at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in the University of Manchester.

TU-Eindhoven,2016,Team:TU-Eindhoven#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," In this lesson the steps of a protocol for cloning are described in an interactive way. The steps that are included in the lesson are: digestion, ligation, transformation, culturing, sequencing and expression. We filmed some of these steps and used those videos in the lesson. This lesson is aimed at final year high school students.
Figure 2: Presentation slide from one of the lessons
The goal of our education course is to connect the knowledge that students already have about synthetic biology together and to fill in the gaps in their understanding of synthetic biology. This includes the societal effects of synthetic biology and the process of forming an opinion on how we should deal with those societal effects.
Together with several biology or chemistry teachers of high schools in the region of Eindhoven we discussed our synthetic biology lessons. With their feedback we adjusted the lessons so they could really fit into the curriculum of the high schools. There were some schools that are very interested to use the lesson package, they will use the lesson package this school year and hopefully in the coming school years. One of the schools, Novalis College , replaced their 15 year old lesson program about ethics in biotechnology by our lesson about ethics in synthetic biology. The interesting and actual cases in our synthetic biology lesson were very appealing for the biology teacher of this school. Other schools used the lessons as an extra to the current curriculum with the possibility of using it in future years. Other schools that will make use of the lesson package this year are: Carolus Borromeus Lyceum and Augustinanium .

At the 24th and 25th of April the TU Eindhoven celebrated its 60th anniversary with the Dream and Dare festival. The first day, the anniversary was celebrated with various music performances of famous Dutch musicians. The second day, a science tour was organized. This science tour was especially aimed at children, but was open for everyone to visit for everyone who was interested. The tour visited several buildings of our university. We had the opportunity to be part of this science tour. We cultured bacteria from smartphones, banisters, tables, etcetera on petri dishes to teach the children about bacteria. We explained the iG"

Summary of Week 4: June 27 - July 1
In the fourth week we implemented a color-coded box system in our -20 freezer to accommodate for the growing need of organization of the growing number of DNA parts. We began learning and using the Gibson reaction to create the gene part AVPR2-TEVs-GV16, which is expressed to produce a vasopressin receptor bound to Gal4-VP16 by a TEV sequence that can be recognized by the TEV Protease.

Afterwards, the LabPats ran the “RhlR” and “CheZ” on a gel in order to perform a gel extraction. However, they were disappointed to find out that their “RhlR” plasmid did not produce a band on the gel in order to perform a gel extraction. Disappointed but not defeated, they knew that their plasmid worked, though they could’ve messed up on the PCR.
Lab 2
The students of the RX lab began their day at their lab reviewing the work they performed the previous day.  They looked at their cultures and began work to place colonies into culture tubes for further experimentation.  They then gave their culture plates to the USAFA iGEM team in order to assist them in their work of their interlab.  The students then headed back to UES in order to prepare for the team meeting that was to occur that afternoon.  Once the meeting began, the entire team discussed with Dr. Carter about events and progress that had occured the week before. Discussion points included: Logo, spirit wear, safety forms, mini-prep, USAFA, and the Michigan State Meetup. After the discussion the students practiced their presentation for the Michigan State Meetup and then worked to improve the presentation.
Thursday (06/28/18)
Lab 1
After yesterday’s failed attempt at PCRing the RhlR and CheZ bands correctly, the students arrived in the lab with a new desire to accomplish what they didn’t yesterday. They meticulously followed the protocol, taking extra care this time to ensure everything was right. After gel electrophoresis, they were ecstatic to find out all of their PCR’s had gone according to plan and they were ready to perform a Gibson Assembly tomorrow. Even though the Gibson Assembly from Monday (with RhlR and iGEM backbone) produced a shockingly low concentration, Amy decided to have the students attempt to grow up the cells in DH5a on Chloramphenicol plates anyways.
Lab 2
The RX team started their day on base where they began work on the calibration portion of the iGEM mini-prep.  The team split up with Max and Jonah to continue work on the interlab while Chris and Travis went to UES to work on the presentation and finishing the safety forms.

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," goal this summer was to translocated Cas9 to the periplasm.
Figure 2: Translocation of Cas9 to the periplasm for eventual encapsulation into an OMV.
To translocate a protein as large as Cas9, we tested four distinct mechanisms of translocation. We assembled three varieties of signal sequences and a protein fusion with Cas9. For our experiments, we chose to use the smallest type of Cas9 we could find: Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (saCas9), which is approximately 114 kDa 10 . (SaCas9 is still a massive protein relative to GFP, which is approximately 27 kDa.) We speculated that a smaller Cas9 makes for easier encapsulation into OMVs. SaCas9 also recognizes longer PAM sequences than other Cas9 proteins (such as spCas9), which makes it a useful addition to the Registry. SaCas9 has been shown to have fewer off-target effects than SpCas9 10 .
Signaling Sequences
A signaling sequence codes for a mechanism that mediates protein translocation to the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria. Three methods we have tested are the twin arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, general secretory (Sec) pathway, and Tat/Sec-promiscuous localization (which can utilize either pathway). These three methods were tested to determine the most optimal pathway to transport Cas9 to the periplasm of E. coli.
Tat Translocation Pathway
The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway translocates fully-folded proteins through the cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Tat depends on a complex of three proteins: TatA, TatB, and TatC, as well as a ~20-base-pair signal peptide sequence (TorA, naturally optimized for E. coli). The mechanism of Tat translocation is not yet fully understood. Proton motive forces drive the protein towards a membrane channel that is predominantly made up of TatA 11 . A concern with this pathway is speculation that Tat has a relatively small size limitation for the maximum folded protein size that can be translocated. The largest protein translocated via Tat has been reported to be 142 kDa 12 .
Figure 3: Model of Tat pathway. A fully-folded protein binds to the twin arginine signal sequence (“RR”), and is directed to the TatABC protein complex for exit from the cytosol to the periplasm 11 .

Abstract: Melbourne 2008 team seeked to build a biological clock that can count up when  it is ""ticked"" by input light pulse signals. As the signal ""ticks"" the clock, the clock changes color and observer can use the color or combination of colors to tell what ""time"" it is. Their team built a linear clock which can be used to keep track on what metabolites are present and what are being produced in the biological system.
In their construct, ribolock 1(CR) prevents translation of gene Y and in the presence of ribokey1(TA), gene Y is translated to activate transcription of another ribokey2(TA) which can open up the loop of another ribolock2(CR). Although they claimed to design and construct some of the parts including key3C and lock3d, no characterisation result was found regarding these CR and TA.

Abstract: Peking 2007 project concerned with the ability for bacterial cells to differentiate out in homogeneous conditions. They aimed to build devices conferring host cells with the ability to form cooperating groups spontaneously and to take consecutive steps sequentially even when the genetic background and environmental inputs are identical . In order to achieve this,  they needed two devices responsible for temporal and spatial differentiation.
To meet the need of spatial differentiation in an assembly line, the system of hop-count conjugation for cell-cell communication was developed in E. coli.  The signals transferred are represented by DNA sequence, and record the times of transfer by losing tandem region at every conjugation event. To construct this system, tandem oriT pairs are inserted into signaling plasmid, and relaxase responsible for initiating conjugation events are removed from natural conjugation system and (attaching a terminator) inserted between these oriT pairs."

The forward primer of the first PCR fragment must be homologues to the reverse primer of the second PCR fragment and so forth. The assembly system can be seen below. It works with either the up-stream or down-stream PCR amplification of the vector and gene.
Afterwards the PCR fragments can be fused into a pre-engineered vector containing an antibiotic resistance gene, by creation of single-stranded regions made by the In-fusion enzyme. [5] .
Difference between Plug'n Play and In-Fusion assembly
Just like the Plug 'n' Play reaction, the In-Fusion reaction is fast and has a high efficiency. However, the main disadvantage of the In-Fusion assembly system is that it is expensive. .

Next, we asked him about biocontainment policy in broad terms to get a better  idea of what it is like for policymakers that do not understand the technology to also  make regulations for it. He used the example of a different new technology, drones, to  explain the importance of scientists and policymakers to interact, educate each other,  and collaborate on regulations that both parties can agree on. He mentioned that it is  most important, and most difficult, to make policy in such a way that does not inhibit  future progress, but also protects those who do and do not use the technology.
Along with this long discussion on biological policy, he asked us many questions  about our project. He had several concerns that we were able to address on the spot,  but a number of other ones that we did not have an answer for. This was not only good  practice for the iGEM presentation, but also a new way of gathering information on our  project. By asking experts about their concerns or recommendations for our project, we  could cater to the needs of the people that would actually use our technology one day.  Additionally, we discussed his major concerns and, in some cases, implemented them  into the design of our project.
Overall, we gained a lot of insight on how we wanted to direct our interviews in  the future. We used all the information that Professor Greely provided us with and used  it to further inform our research. Some of this information can also be found in our  biological containment pamphlet that we constructed specifically for iGEM teams to use  so that they can have access to the same information and resources that we collected  and used throughout the summer.

We spoke to Dr. Lisa Lee, the current Executive Director of the Presidential  Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (PCSBI), this summer. During our  conversation, we discussed the role of the Commission and compared it to the ethic  committees of other countries. Dr. Lee explained how PCSBI is given a subject to review  by the President of the United States, and upon completion of the review, the  Commission moves on to the next project. The Commission has no regulatory power so  it can only make recommendations that is then up to other agencies to follow through on.  Dr. Lee also said many countries have a standing ethics committee, whereas the  establishment of PCSBI and the appointment of its members are dependent on the  President of the United States; in other words,"

Through her help as our social science expert, she could give us feedback and we could construct the following survey questionnaire:
Survey Questionnaire: LiU iGEM .
To get a broad perspective of samples, we went to central Linköping to find participants for our survey.  This resulted in a total of 92 participants and a mean age of ~37 years (see figure 1).
Through this survey, we got the opinion of the public concerning our project (and Synthetic Biology in general). With that in mind, we could let it influence our work. For one, we adjusted our way of presenting the project to the public, but we also made changes in the lab.
In the survey, the participants were asked to rate their knowledge about synthetic biology.  The results can be seen in the diagram, figure 4, where people had to answer a multiple choice question. The answers varied from “none” to ""very much”.
The results also showed that the public prioritises synthetic biology in research over production of pharmaceuticals and other industrial production, as can be seen in figure 3. The blue bar correlates to the amount of people who put research as the highest priority, the red one to industry and the green bar to production of pharmaceuticals.   This result, together with discussions within the team and with our PI's, made us switch from a focus on trying to understand the mechanisms behind protein folding in E.coli to one focusing on trying to increase the amount of correctly folded proteins. Because the survey showed that the public is more concerned with research than with e.g. industry, we chose to test our system of chaperones on proteins used in research at Linköping University. The type of research we focused on was the research of neurodegenerative diseases because our PI’s research focuses on this particular field. That gave us easy access to material and proteins related to a specific research.

Basic parts - auxotrophic selection marker for transformed yeasts
We started by searching parts and DNA that could be used for working with yeast and other fungi. However, there were only few data related to this kind of organism, actually we could not find any selection marker for yeast in the delivered Biobrick plates. This situation took our efforts to create a Biobrick which allows the selection of positively transformed cells by means of auxotrophic markers. We are working with strains that are deficient of either the LEU2 gene or the TRP1 gene. Both of them are essential during amino acid biosynthesis of leucine and tryptophane respectively . The TRP1 gene encodes for a phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase, an enzyme needed in the third step of tryptophane synthesis. The LEU2 gene codes the β isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, which is necessary for the third step in the biosynthesis of leucine. Therefore, these 2 specific genes were chosen for BioBrick construction. For amplification of plasmids in yeasts, we also created the 2 micron ori (see table 1) for plasmid replication in the yeast cells.
Table  1| Created basic parts for registry.
We used genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae to amplify the genes. We checked the sequences and noticed that most of the yeast genes contain EcoR1 or Xba1 restriction sites; this could be the main reason of the absence of many BioBricks of such type. Hence, we decided to mutagenize our genes with primers that allow the introduction of a point mutation (shown in figure 1). With this mutation, a so called silent mutation,"

New BGL-A sequence is still under experiments and please make the presentation as the standard. Even if we can’t get a BGL-A expression, we can also try to modulate the endogenous BGL-A by our CRISProgrammer system to realize the indigo synthesis.
Design of Regulation in Practice
Here, we report the Indi.coli system to achieve the on/ off (storage/ dyeing) switch of indoxyl bio-synthesis pathway. The combination of indoxyl synthesis switch and the customized CRISProgrammer, is a great evidence that our CRISProgrammer system can regulate the metabolism pathway in an engineerable, customizable, and adjustable manner. (Figure 1).
Figure 1. The logic circuit of Indi.coli.
P0 represents for an inducible promoter, while p1-p4 represent for constitutive promoters that can be targeted by sgRNA orthogonally. One constitutive promoter can be suppressed by related sgRNA in same colors. The function of three enzymes are shown below each of them, respectively. Indoxyl in blue dashed outline can be oxidized into indigo naturally.
At the start point, indole is added in the system as substrate, while no inducer is added. The enzymes FMO (flavin-containing monooxygenases) is constitutively expressed, catalyzing the reaction from indole into indican. Since the expression of BGL (β-glucosidase) is inhibited by sgRNA4, indican could not be deglycosylation and would be accumulated. This is the transport and storage stage of indi.coli (Figure 2a).
When inducer is added to the system, sgRNA1 controlled by inducible promoter p0 is highly expressed. The expression of the sgRNA2, sgRNA4, and UGT are inhibited, while BGL is produced. In this situation, the indican accumulated from last stage would be deprotected into indoxyl, which can be easily oxidized into indigo. In the dyeing stage, Indoxyl is embedded in the voids of fabric fibers and reoxidized to form indigo, which makes the fabric dyed successfully. (Figure 2b).

tetp Module
The tetp module consists of a Tet repressible promoter upstream of the CDSs of PhlF and LacI, which are then followed by the reporter gene, mtagbfp. When tetp is activated, the two repressor proteins, PhlF and LacI will be expressed along with the reporter gene, mtagbfp. This results in"

Now, we arrive at outdoor venue of the biochemistry theme. There are two tasks, Draw something and Bio-hopscotch, that you need to accomplish. Draw something is the game that one person draw some required biochemical terms like t-RNA, chromosome, and the other guess what the picture is. One who paints can't speak or write any words. Bio-hopscotch test the gamer's knowledge of biochemical reactions. You can choose lower difficulty of Draw something for five questions to match higher difficulty of Bio-hopscotch of glycolysis and Kreb's cycle. Or higher difficulty of Draw something for eight questions match lower difficulty of Bio-hopscotch of Hatch-Slack Cycle. This outdoor activity also attracted many passersby to engage in it.

Booklet
We asked some questions about liver cancer in the survey.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common and the third most lethal cancer in China, accounting for 85–90% of primary liver malignancy. It is particularly prevalent in China because of the high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection.    Among the 200 participants, up to 11% report that their relatives or friends have been diagnosed with HCC.  However, the interviewees generally only have a brief understanding about this disease, only 3% knows its early symptoms.  Therefore, it is of vital importance to popularize relevant knowledge to the public so that the development of HCC might be discovered or prevented at an early stage.

The World Health Organization believes that more than 40% of cancer can be prevented.  Studies have shown that the occurrence of HCC is closely related to viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, aflatoxin and alcohol intake, all of which are preventable.  Healthy lifestyle (e.g., regularly taking vitamins E and B) may also reduce the risk of HCC.  Contrary to such facts, only half of the interviewees agree that cancer can be avoided with"

Transforming pSB1C3 Plasmid Backbone
Made 1.5mL LB liquid cultures of pSB1C3 from the plate streaked on 19-05-2010 and added chloramphenicol.
Experiment continues on 26-05-2010 .
Assembly Method
Discussed an assembly method. Will start with a polyA tail Anchor oligo which will connect to a polyT tail which is bound to the bead. The anchor will consist of a primer region, a BsaI cut site, a buffer region, and finally, an A prime or B prime end. A byte with an appropriate end can be added to this anchor, and another byte can be added onto that, etc... The last thing to be added to the construct is a Terminator byte consisting of a buffer region, bsaI cut site, primer region and a polyT tail. This second primer sequence must be as uncomplimentary as possible to the anchor's primer site so as to minimize primers binding to each other when PCRing the assembled construct. The primers melting point must be around 65 oC. After the construct is assembled on the bead, it is heated off and the polyA tail of the anchor binds to the polyT tail of the terminator and a plasmid is born.
We will purchase NEB oligo dT magnetic and cellulose beads which have a polyT tail (5' to 3') 25 nucleotides long. They are meant for mRNA isolation, but should work fine for our purposes. Used the IDT Analyzer software to determine what length of polyA tail is required for our anchor to have a melting temperature of 30 degrees Celcius (decided to change this melting temp later). This melting temp is sensitive to Na+ and Mg++ concentrations, so referred to ligase buffer and elution buffer for these concentrations.
The BsaI A end should look like this:<---diagram--->

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," The 4 experimental groups are MG1655 with target plasmid transformation. And the treatments are: 1) adding nothing, 2) adding IPTG, 3) adding ARA, 4) adding both IPTG and ARA.By comparing the data from these 5 groups, we can find if there is any leakage of the two promoter, and validate the circuit.     
2. Quantitative experiment
        We set a series of concentration gradient for ARA and IPTG from 10-7M/L to 10-3M/L. The specific setting is as follows.
         The group that neither ARA nor IPTG is added is set as the control group, in order to proof the rigor of the logic gate, and explore the minimum concentration to trigger the expression of the circuit.     
3. The exploration of the response time
        In order to explore the response time of the logic gate circuit, we change the time of adding ARA and IPTG. We set several experimental groups at one-hour intervals, and measure the fluorescence intensity to find the response time.
Oscillation
    
1. Determination of the relationship between the concentration of AHL molecule and the pluxR response strength
        In order to understand and describe the state of the single period oscillation system better, we need to know the relationship between the pluxR response strength and the AHL molecular concentration. To this end, we designed the AHL concentration gradient from 10^-11 to 10^-6, and used it for the induction of bacteria that contain pLuxR-sfGFP report loop. After fully cultured, the fluorescence intensity was measured, and we can get the concentration of AHL -- fluorescence intensity diagram.     
2. Detection of single period oscillation system
         In order to detect single-period oscillation system composed of pTD103aiiA and pTD103luxI-sfGFP, these two plasmids were co-transfected into MG1655.The selected positive clones were cultured overnight. We inoculated them in 96-well plates in 1:1000, culture under 37°C and check the fluorescence intensity of GFP, to monitor the occurrence of oscillation.     
3. Validation of the single period oscillation system in a microfluidic device
         By analyzing the data, we found that, because of the increase in the amount of bacteria as well as the accumulation of AHL, the oscillation will become unstable, and the whole system will collapse, too. In order to eliminate the influence of all"

Summary and Conclusions
Executive Summary
Synthetic biology is becoming the dominant term in describing an innovative multidisciplinary field with both promising scientific benefits and important ethical issues at the same time. The surge of interest in engineering living systems is largely due to a reduction in gene sequencing and synthesis costs as well as the completion of the human genome project and developments in automation techniques.
Although the term has been abundantly used for almost a decade, there is no consensus on a definition for synthetic biology. Different practical approaches to synthetic biology research and engineering emanate from different disciplines, resulting in an almost intangible characterization. An attempt by the European Commission to describe synthetic biology resulted in the following working definition: “Synthetic Biology is the engineering of biological components and systems that do not exist in nature and the re-engineering of existing biological elements; it is determined on the intentional design of artificial biological systems, rather than on the understanding of natural biology”.
The goals in synthetic biology range from creating an open source registry for standardized biological parts (initiated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) to environmental control, development of pharmaceuticals and renewable fuel production. There are two main practical approaches involved in pursuing such goals. The bottom-up approach starts by creating synthetic biological systems out of partially artificial components, whereas the top-down approach reduces existing life forms down into its individual components.
Now that research has enabled to change individual biological components, focus lies on constructing complex networks in single-cell and multi-cellular systems. Recently realized accomplishments include the development of nonnative behaviors such as bi-stability, oscillations, bio-sensing and spatial-pattern formation. Furthermore, as the capabilities of synthetic biology advance, applications within biotechnology, pharmaceutics, environment, information technology and renewable energy will emerge.
The issues concerning synthetic biology are partially acknowledged by the scientific community. Unfortunately different stakeholders usually raise only a limited number of concerns, dependent on personal interest or due to insufficient data or unfamiliarity. The concerns that typically appear in literature include bio-safety, bio-security and intellectual property rights. Topics"

Welcome to the award winning 2009 Bacterial Relay Race
Our team acquired a Gold medal and was awarded with Best information processing project , during the 2009 iGEM Jamoboree at MIT, Boston.
In our project we aim to create a cell-to-cell communication system that allows the propagation of a multi-task message with the capability of being reset. To achieve this, the system will include a reengineered conjugation system, a time-delay genetic circuit and a self-destructive plasmid. This system could be the basis for creating a long distance biosensor and/or be applied in reducing antibiotic resistance of bacteria. Furthermore, we have done a parallel research on the different perceptions of iGEM participants and supervisors on ethical issues in synthetic biology . We focused on the consequences of the ultimate conditions of the top-down and bottom-up approaches as applied in biology. We thank everyone who participated in our survey on these ethical issues in synthetic biology.
The Project - Bacterial Relay Race
Project description
Our project is the Bacterial Relay Race. As our team logo and the animation below show, we want to build an improved cell to cell communication system. We choose this subject since most applications or tasks we set to our synthetic biological systems are generally completed by a population of cells, not a single cell. Gaining new insights into cell to cell communication and designing manageable cell to cell communication systems will provide us with a wide range of new possibilities. Manageable cell to cell communication systems could have applications in different fields like therapeutic applications or fermentation technology applications. We are attempting to construct an E.coli strain which is capable of passing a GFP signal through conjugation to other E.coli cells only once, with communication appearing population wide. Our work builds on projects of previous iGEM teams from Berkeley UC and Peking University.
Our project is made up of three modules:
1) Conjugation
Our cell to cell communication system is based on bacterial conjugation. We use this to pass a message, initially GFP, along to other bacteria in the culture.
2) Self Destructive Plasmid (SDP"

To prevent overheating of the samples, the samples were kept on ice as much as possible. Hereafter, 250 µL of 24 mM MgCl2 was added and the samples were incubated for 10 minutes on ice. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged for 35 minutes at 21130xg at 4⁰C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was dissolved in 400 µL solution buffer. Again, the samples were centrifuged for 35 minutes at 21130xg at 4⁰C. Repeating this resolving and centrifugation step was done 1 or 2 more times to remove more 6-carboxyfluorescein free in solution. Finally the pellet was dissolved in 200 µL. The samples, now containing BBMVs incorporated with 6-carboxyfluorescein, were stored at -20⁰C until use.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
For making the images of BBMVs, HAAFD TEM (high angle annular dark field imaging transmission electron microscopy) was used. The following protocol for negative staining was followed before placing the sample in the microscope:
1.       Take plasma cleaned 400 mesh carbon grid.
2.       Put 3 µl of sample on the carbon grid and incubate 1 min.
3.       Absorb sample with a filter.
4.       Wash the sample 3x with MQ, absorbing the MQ every time with a filter.
5.       Add 3µl 3% of uranyl acetate and incubate for 30 seconds.
6.       Remove stain with filter.
Performing Dynamic Light Scattering on BBMVs
Before analysing the BBMVs samples with Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), 10 µL of sample was diluted to a final volume of 1 mL. This was placed in a glass tube. The glass tube was thereafter placed in the DLS machine. Laser light of 532 nm was used to analyse the sample and the scattering pattern was measured under an angle of 90⁰C. The lit of the laser was only opened after placing the sample in the holder and the gain was adjusted before starting of the measurement. Every T. molitor BBMVs sample was measured 5 times for 20 seconds and every sample V. destructor BBMVs sample was measured 20 times for 20 seconds to gain more reliable data. Afterwards the"

DESIGN
In our project,  E. coli needed light and sound as inputs to produce color and odor as outputs. The process was mainly divided into three parts: sound to light, light to color, and light to odor. The light-color and light-odor conversions were achieved with the RGB system[2] which was based on the phage RNAP system[3] as a resource allocator. As for the sound-light conversion, we developed a software that allowed users to upload their own music to generate their unique dynamic pictures, with which people could color and ‘ensoul’ their own roses.
LIGHT TO COLOR
We introduced the RGB system to stain our rose using light.
We also put forward a new concept—mixing color into bacterial cells! Unlike the mix of different bacterial cells which produce different colors as the previous iGEM teams have done[4], we used tandem expression and RGB system to control the ratios of the expression of different colors in bacterial cells, to achieve mixing color in bacterial cells, and stain our roses with more bright colors.
LIGHT TO ODOR
Our roses are colorful now, but only with added fragrance can the rose bloom  more vivid, appealing and with a soul as a real rose. So this is our second part, light to odor, making our roses more soulful and real. We first tried to use CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system[5] to knock out the original gene of E. coli producing smell to prevent E. coli from giving off a nasty and unpleasant smell. Then based on the light-control system, we changed the actuators with genes which could produce various kinds of odors.
SOUND TO LIGHT
We could paint a colorful and fragrant rose with light , but it was sound that brought a unique soul to the rose.  To create his/her rose with a unique soul, we developed an online software—Orpheus—to convert music into unique colorful pictures. The users could choose their music or their own voice, and the pictures that they want to ensoul, to color the pictures with random colorful dots. When the music is input, after a specified time, the sound waves will be read and the amplitude and frequency of the music will be extracted. The diameter and the color of the dots vary with the amplitude and frequency of the music, and the pictures thus they are painted with beautiful colors.

Kyoto,2010,Team:Kyoto_-_-_TEXT.html,", this device can prevent ecosystem disruption by introduced bacteria [3] [4] . Also, it can be applied to other ideas such as E.coli capsules which scatter drug or aroma by cell-lysis responding to a certain signal. Therefore, the cell-death devices based on diverse approaches, including previous iGEM projects have been developed [1] [3] [5] [6] . However, present cell-death devices are not useful because they have two problems as follows:
They are not quantitatively characterized [7]
They are not applied to many promoters [8] .
Therefore, we attempted to solve these problems and design new BioBricks that are better characterized and more applicable cell-death device to contribute to every future projects.
Problems of Present Cell-Death Devices
1.Need for Quantitative Characterization
In previous iGEM, many teams focused on λ lysis cassette, which is a killer-gene derived from λ phage and causes cell lysis. However, they have only characterized its lytic activity qualititatively. Quantitative characterization of its lytic activity is necessary in order to design a universal and applicable cell-death device. For example, we wish to analyze when cell lysis occurs after induction of λ lysis cassette, how many cells lyse, whether all of cells lyse or not, and so on.
2. Solution to the Restriction on Application of Promoters
In constructing a simple circuit consisting of an inducible promoter and λ lysis cassette, the combination are limited by the promoter's basal expression, strength of killer-function and many other factors.  We looked for the solution to this problem and came up with an idea; using both the lysis cassette and its antikiller-gene, SΔTMD1, which lacks the code for trans membrane domain 1 of killer-gene. We can use two promoters (a constitutive one and an inducible one) for regulating cell-death balance. Into this circuit, we can apply more promoters to this device by using an appropriate constitutive promoter.
We considered that lysis cassette and SΔTMD1 are the most appropriate to killer-gene and anti-killer gene [5] . This was because we found some articles which show the effect of SΔTMD1 in the yeast [9] and also because previous iGEM teams already dealt with lysis cassette.

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Infiltrate_-_-_TEXT.html," treatment for persistent TB must enter infected macrophages and kill the pathogen there. In our system, E. coli is both the vector and the therapeutic agent agent by expressing the listeriolyin O gene LLO to enter macrophages and TDMH to kill mycobacteria.  Additionally we thought about how we could deliver the E. coli to the lungs and decided that the most effective way would be through an inhaler.
 BOX 1: Why is it difficult to treat tuberculosis?
Mtb can survive and replicate for years inside the macrophages by supressing the normal process of phagocytosis.
The cell wall of M. tuberculosis is thick, waxy and rich in mycolic acids. It it difficult to penetrate with a small-molecule drug.
The pathogen grows very slowly inside macrophages. Most conventional antibiotics target processes like DNA replication that are specific to growing cells.
TDMH and the mycobacterial cell wall
  Mycobacterium species share a characteristic cell wall: thick, waxy, hydrophobic, and rich in mycolic acids. The low permeability of the envelope to hydrophilic solutes contributes to the intrinsic drug tolerance in mycobacteria.
  Trehalose Dimycolate Hydrolase (TDMH) is a cutinase-like serine esterase that triggers rapid lysis of the mycobacterial cell wall by degrading the mycolate layer. The enzyme was first isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis and subsequently shown to hydrolyze purified TDM from various mycobacterial species. Exposure to TDMH triggers an immediate release of free mycolic acids, ultimately leading to lysis of many mycobacteria including Mtb (Yang et al. 2012).
  We have used M. smegmatis as a model system because Mtb are highly pathogenic and difficult to culture in the lab. M. smegmatis is a close relative of Mtb, shares many of its membrane properties, and is commonly used as a stand-in for Mtb physiology in the lab.
  In our system, described in the methods below, we used E. coli BL21 (DE3) as a chassis to express TDMH from an IPTG-inducible strong T7 promoter.
Killing mycobacteria with TDMH
  Figure 1 describes how we performed the setup of our experience by making a coculture of M.smegmatis and E.coli.

Quorum Sensing and Synthetic biology
This system has already been used in the field of synthetic biology to create new behaviors. For instance, Lingchong YOU et al. (2004) designed a bacteria that regulates the maximum density of bacteria inducing a controlled suicide via intercellular communication. With this system, even if the population is stable the genome is expressed as if they were in exponential growth.
Fig 2 : Structure of two different AHL. In orange the common part to all AHL. A : 3OC6-HSL synthesized by LuxI. B : 3OC1-HSL synthesized by LasI
Other quorum sensing systems has been described in different species of baceteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The system has the same architecture with protein LasI that synthesize the AHL that binds to LasR, the intracellular receptor. One of the differences between those to systems is the structure of the AHL (Figure 2.)
The use of two quorum sensing system is possible. This is one of the challenges that Frederick K. BALAGADDE et al. (2008) carried out successfully. They constructed a synthetic ecosystem that imitates the prey-predator relationship in two different strains of E. coli.

Note that this sequence is not simply the same sequence repeated multiple times, but instead contains several motifs on the order of 10 - 20 amino acids in length that occur several times. When this sequence was run through the codon optimization program for expression in ''E. coli'' provided by a major DNA synthesis firm, the resulting output could not be synthesized by the very same firm: the ""optimized"" DNA sequence contained too many recurring short (> 8 nucleotide) DNA sequences to allow for synthesis.
Manually correcting for repeats in the codon-optimized DNA sequence is a sub-optimal solution: not only is this process time-consuming, but it has the tendency to undo the codon-optimization: if a sequence of amino acids occurs several times, one may be forced to use all possible codon-combinations to represent this sequence to avoid nucleotide-sequence repetition. Unless corrected for by skewing codon usage elsewhere in the sequence, this will tend to make the codon usage more uniform than is optimal for the expression vector. Additionally, any changes made in either correcting for repeats or re-correcting for codon usage may in turn introduce additional repeats.
Solution: DoubleOptimizer
DoubleOptimizer is a software tool we have created to optimize codon usage in a gene both to match a given codon usage distribution and to avoid repetition of nucleotide sequences. Given a DNA or amino acid sequence and a desired codon distribution, DoubleOptimizer will produce, within a matter of seconds, an equivalent sequence that has substantially reduced DNA sequence repetition, while also closely matching the desired codon usage.

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2015,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". This workshop was called “A day as a scientist in CUHK”, targeting students of F.4-F.6 from various Hong Kong secondary schools. This workshop aims to benefit high school students by providing a platform for learning synthetic biology and a chance to work in a lab at university. Firstly, introduction and ice-breaking session were held in the morning. Secondly, the first lab session was provided for the students to experience the lab work like pipetting, making agarose gel, dye loading as well as performing gel electrophoresis.
5. Talk
Aside from holding workshops, we have also provided a more formal talk targeting the secondary school students to provide basic knowledge over the background and advantages of synthetic biology. The talk did more than just inspired interest in synthetic biology, but it also encouraged students to think more about the impacts of synthetic biology. We hope the talk could help them to think and understand the change synthetic biology can make in environment preservation, novel energy sources, medicine, and as a whole, improving the quality of life. Most importantly, we also encourage students to consider the ethical aspects of synthetic biology, which is a controversial issue and probably the major reason people hold a skeptical view toward synthetic biology. Meanwhile, with the raise of interests on synthetic biology, it even paved the way for them to join iGEM in the future when they become university students. We have also introduced our project to them in which they found meaningful, and we were delighted to found many of them asking thoughtful questions regarding our project enthusiastically.
6. Promotion to freshmen
On our university’s - CUHK registration day on the 9th of August, which is when freshmen registered for orientation camps and attend to information talks. Our team members grasped the chance to introduce synthetic biology and our project to them and many other senior students. We were glad to have passed our enthusiasm towards iGEM to them, as many of the students we’ve reached showed much passion towards joining the team next year. As most of whom have only heard of synthetic biology for the first time, they were eager to find out more and excited about this competition. During the process, we have received many surprised comments, as most people felt so amazed that they could also have the chance to participate in such a competition and contribute to the development of synthetic biology.

Fig.2 The Gaussian plate Using this chip, we can know the C. elegans’ preference and repulsion through their distribution in the chip.
One important thing is to know how long the diffusion process will cost from the layer1 to layer2, and we are able to know the “delaying time” of the response of the worms to the chemicals. (Fig.3).
Fig.3 A) The chemicals diffuse downward across the PDMS. B) The chemical can across the PDMS to enter in the M9 buffer (KH2PO4 3 g, Na2HPO4 6 g, NaCl 5 g, MgSO4 (1M) 1 ml dH2O 1 L). The M9 buffer is injected into the layer2 continually so the chemicals will not be accumulated in the M9 buffer, on the other words the concentration of layer2 is always equal to the concentration at the bottom of the PDMS.
Physical Process
For nonsteady-state diffusion, there is an equation named Fick’s second law [1] : \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}
The constant of proportionality D is called the diffusion coefficient, which is expressed in square meters per second. Concentration C is plotted versus position (or distance) within the solid x and the time t.
For t=0, C=C0 at 0≤x≤∞;
For t>0, C=Cs (the constant surface concentration) at x=0;
C=C0 at x=∞. And then there is a general solution: \frac{C_x-C_0}{C_s-C_0}=1-erf(\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}})
Where Cx represents the concentration at distance x after time t.
\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}}
=constant, so if this constant can be calculated, the equation of distance x and time t can also be gotten.
In our model, C0=0, so the equation is changed to \frac{C_x}{C_s}=1-erf(\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}})
Cx represents the concentration at distance x that C. elegans can feel.  Cs is the concentration set by our own and it is a constant. x is 5mm (Fig.4).

A common vocabulary for varied search terms related to BioBricks will be provided.Such terms are browsed by functions, browsed by types, etc. And users can choose the terms they need on their own. This will provide a powerful search function. The second way is a keyword-way search technique. This kind of search is simple yet quick. A keyword is input and a set of BioBricks with this key word is returned. We believe that users can find their target BioBricks quickly with the aid of these two search techniques.
  Besides, we hope that all of our members can enjoy the process of preparing and presenting our project.
