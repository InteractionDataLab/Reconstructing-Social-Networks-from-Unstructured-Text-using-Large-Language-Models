Product Description
Using the Vestibulizer, it is possible to cure damage to the vestibular system, or to compensate for specific conditions leading to disturbances in rotational and positional sensing. Disorientation in a drunken stupor, motion sickness, sea sickness, nitrogen narcosis and the increasingly important space sickness are problems of the past.
The Vestibulizer consists of many bacteria that attach themselves to the hair cells in the inner ear, which is a part of the vestibular system and thus controls the sense of spatial orientation. These bacteria are synthetically modified so that they sit at right angles to the hair cells and swim forward when receiving a command. By distributing bacteria around many hair cells, it is possible to correct every conceivable problem that a person might have with their sense of balance. The bacteria receive information about the position of the body from chemical messengers that are produced and interpreted by a kind of gyroscopic compass bacteria, which make up the second part of this two-component system.
A treatment lasts for a month and is easily renewed. There is no risk of developing a tolerance to either component, so the Vestibulizer will work just as well after years of use.
Technical Description
The Vestibulizer consists of many bacteria that attach themselves to the hair cells in the cupula of the vestibular system. Their movement can be controlled by chemical messengers, thus influencing the user's sense of balance and spatial orientation.

SKLMT-China,2018,Team:SKLMT-China#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," genomic DNA preparations [14]. The strategies reviewed in this article are applicable to modification of DNA molecules of anysize, including very large ones, and present powerful new avenues for DNA manipulation in general.
Furthermore, we have found some small defect on the recombination vector and did some improvement about it.
In conclusion, we constructed a promoter library in
Pseudomonas fluorescence pf-5
and used a mathematical model and the resulting data to achieve promoter strength prediction. In order to further verify that our promoter can function well in the fluorescent chassis, we constructed a nicotine-degrading engineered strain and used different strength promoters to regulate the expression of key enzymes to achieve optimal degradation efficiency. In addition, we have introduced and improved a new method of gene recombination for iGEM, Red/ET recombination system, which can more easily realize direct cloning of large fragments, multi-fragment assembly and seamless modification of DNA sequences.

Comprehensive Environmental Assessment
Introduction to CEA
As scientists, we are often inclined to reduce complex procedures down to simple, step-by-step protocols. Assessing risk and evaluating environmental impact are no exception; our first instinct this year was to create a universal checklist of regulations that every environmental iGEM project could fulfill in order to ensure environmental safety, the idea being that we could easily and systematically find answers to questions of environmental safety in scientific literature. However, upon speaking with Dr. Christina Powers, a biologist at the US Environmental Protection Agency, and further exploring the concerns relating to our own project, we decided to adopt a new approach to issues of human practices: Comprehensive Environmental Assessment (CEA).
CEA differs from traditional methods of risk assessment by recognizing that risk assessment is fundamentally a decision-making process in which scientists, experts, and the public should be engaged. The goal is to foster transparent discussion and use collective judgment to evaluate limitations and trade-offs in order to arrive at holistic conclusions about the primary issues that researchers should address in their research planning.

CEA & Synthetic Biology
While the Environmental Protection Agency primarily uses the CEA approach for nanomaterials, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., recently launched efforts to lay out a framework to apply CEA to synthetic biology. This groundbreaking project set out to assess the CEA approach’s relevance to synthetic biology, in anticipation of the growing demand for synthetic biology-based solutions to global issues. They arrived at the conclusion that scientists should focus on four major areas of risk assessment: altered physiology, competition and biodiversity, evolutionary prediction, and gene transfer.

During her studies, Xiaoting became highly interested in gene therapy due to several internships at the German Cancer Research Centre, different departments of the University of Heidelberg and Imperial College London. In her opinion, synthetic biology can revolutionize gene therapy by creating non-existing parts which will reduce side effects and increase the efficiency of gene therapy methods. She is glad to work with a nice group of students and advisors and is looking forward to the jamboree!

Instructors
Dr. Dirk Grimm
Dr. Grimm is the leader of the junior research group ""Virus-host interactions"" which was founded in late 2007 as an integral part of the Cluster of Excellence CellNetworks as well as of the Dept. of Infectious Diseases/Virology at Heidelberg University. Central goals of his team are to basically understand, rationally improve and therapeutically harness the exquisite potency and specificity of human RNAi mechanisms as well as of gene transfer vectors derived from molecularly evolved Adeno-associated viruses. In his first year as an iGEM instructor, he very much enjoys and appreciates the unique opportunities provided by this exciting competition, by the interdisciplinary teams of highly motivated, clever and talented young students from all over the world, and in general by the rapidly emerging field of Synthetic Biology to juxtapose science and engineering. Like all iGEM participants, he cherishes the fact that we currently witness the dawn of a thrilling new research era in which SynBio will mature into a powerful and thriving goal-oriented force with extraordinary potential to synergize with analytical approaches and to ultimately transform biotechnology and many further central aspects of our lives.
Jens Keienburg
Jens is a PhD student in Systems Biology and works on the parameterization of the circadian oscillation network in Neurospora. He has continuously been an iGEM instructor since 2008, when he co-initiated the Heidelberg team. The acquaintance with so many diverse team members, the innovative and popular projects, and the intensive work with the team make iGEM for him every year a new entrepreneurial adventure. To describe iGEM in three words: vision, passion, and teamwork.

MIT,2018,Team:MIT#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our conversation with Suman lead to us to discover the technique of microencapsulation and how we could potentially devise             injectable capsules with sizes as small as 300 microns. The validation and extra literature provided to us by Suman really             helped us along to start designing potential experiments that could illustrate how we could encapsulate and inject our             engineered cells into the gingiva.
Derfogail Delcassian, PostDoc, Langer Lab
Our conversation with Derfogail allowed us to become aware of various hydrogels that are biocompatible with the oral cavity,             as well as start thinking of a semi-permeable membrane that would allow CSP(~18 amino acids), our sensing molecule, to enter             and our output protein (~190 amino acids) to exit the capsule. In the future, we plan to do a simple encapsulation experiment             under Derfogail's supervision to verify if the sensing and output efficiency is the same as before (i.e. the encapsulated system             reduces biofilm concentration the same as the non-encapsulated system).
Conversations with iGEM Experts
Dr. Traci Haddock-Angelli
The team met with Traci Haddock-Angelli, director of the 2018 iGEM competition, to clarify the necessary requirements             for part acceptance by iGEM headquarters.  During the conversation, Dr. Angelli showed us past work and clarified exactly             which cloning methods are necessary to prepare parts for registry submission. The team has been investigating the Loop and             Phytobricks assembly method to better craft a system suited for both the team and iGEM's needs.  Creating a library of parts             that would allow for further integration of the Golden Gate system into the iGEM registry, while still maintaining traditional             iGEM requirements (such as BioBrick assembly) is one of the team's goals. Team MIT will continue to investigate these systems             while following iGEM's standards.
Hassnain Qasim Bokhari
Team MIT wanted to reach out to the iGEM Human Practices (HP) committee and get some feedback on our initiatives so far.             The team contacted one of the members of the HP committee and an iGEM Ambassador, Hassnain. In the meeting he put emphasis             on having a vision for all the initiatives and not doing things just because other people had done it. Continuing past efforts,             especially those that have inspired us, is also a critical part of a great human practice initiative. Based on this feedback the             team decided to make a formal responsible science"

Overview
Jiangnan iGEM team has stepped out of the lab to disseminate knowledge on synthetic biology, vaccination and the concept of our project to the public.
Interactions
with
kindergarten children
(June 4th and June 8th)
According to our preliminary market research, we found that the public didn’t pay sufficient attention to children’s education on vaccination. We are thus motivated to organize a compulsory teaching to kindergarten children on vaccine related knowledge.
In June, we went to Xuelang Kindergarten and Swan Lake Kindergarten to let children understand the importance of vaccination, remind the teachers and parents of these children on the vaccination status of their kids so that these children could get vaccinated in time.
In order to introduce basic concepts and roles of vaccination to small kids, we prepared a cute slide and some small gifts. We also brought some painting materials and guided these kids to draw some bio- and vaccine- related cartoons . In this way, we could know what biology looks like and how vaccination functions from children’ eyes.
One of our team members, Bingyan Shen, has ample experiences in teaching small kids. Firstly, she showed them a cartoon of vaccine downloaded from the internet as the warm up to catch children’s attention. Then she asked them some simple questions on vaccine, and interacted with the children using gifts to stimulate their enthusiasm. Finally, she asked them to show what biology and vaccination looks like in their imagination through painting. Not only the children felt full of fun while learning, we also took it as a precious opportunity to learn something about vaccine and bio-world.
Besides direct interactions with the children, we also care whether parents are aware of the importance of vaccination. So we designed flyers and questionnaires on vaccination related information and asked parents to give feedbacks.
Lecture

We went to Wuxi No. 1 High School to introduce and stimulate students’ interests in synthetic biology. We also introduced our project to them to help them gain a deeper understanding on synthetic biology.

The modular design of FREDsense’s technology will allow the company to adapt quickly and easily to changes in the regulatory landscape in the oil sands market as well as expand into different markets. This will allow FREDsense to expand the breadth of its detection products without investing significant resources into research and development.
Regulatory Hurdles
Biotechnology products in Canada are regulated by three federal agencies: Health Canada for foods, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) for seeds and livestock feed, and Environment Canada for new substances intended for environmental release. Our product thus falls under regulation set out by the latter. This regulation falls under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (jointly administered by Environment Canada and Health Canada).  Environmental Technology Verification is also required for our technology to be used in this industry.  Risk is assessed based on relative toxicity as well as relative amount of exposure to the environment. Specific products are assessed on a one-to-one basis through a dialogue with Environment Canada and Health Canada.
Safety Approval from CEPA
With respect to safety, we need to make our organism approved according to the “New Substances Notification Regulations (Organisms)"", SOR/2005-248, which is a part of the Canadian Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA) act. Due to our organism being an innocuous, ubiquitous, microbe that is indigenous to soil, we anticipate that performing the experiments required for approval will eventually lead to permission to mass produce this organism. In spite of this, to obtain agency approval we are required to perform extensive tests on our organism and have adequate protocols to prevent accidental release of our organism.
The most important characterizations that we need to disclose include:
Methodology to identify FREDsense microorganism: describe the organism such that it can be accurately identified in the incidence of escape.  This includes genus, species, strain features, and the genetic changes we induced to enable reporting of our sensor. The necessity for these characterizations are already in line with our need for further technological development of our micro-organism sensor, and we hope to have this complete by July 2014.
Impact and toxicology characterization: environmental impact and toxicological studies are necessary to discover if our strain could impact the local ecosystem, or be a danger to terrestrial and aquatic organisms. To perform these studies we will perform standard toxicology experiments in which it is cultured in the presence of model test organisms. We will also co-culture the strain with indigenous aquatic and soil micro-organisms to determine if gene transfer occurs from our strain and if so, at what rate. With regards to the"

Implementing Our Final Product
As the summer drew to a close, we put our biosensor to one final test. From one of our earlier interviews with MSP Susan Deacon, we learned that we should look for ways our biosensor could be implemented with harm reduction measures.
Much of our work with Synenergene was then focused on trying to find the most feasible and effective way our biosensor could be used in this manner. From the very beginning, drug consumption rooms - i.e. government facilities where individuals can bring and use drugs under medical supervision with legal impunity - were a top consideration. Using some of the grant we received from Synenergene,  and with our final prototype in hand, we went and visited the Locatie Amoc drug consumption room in Amsterdam.
Whilst there, we had the opportunity to ask both end users and staff whether our final biosensor is pragmatic . Fortunately, the feedback was primarily positive on both ends. Staff and users agreed that the actual design of the biosensor is practical, and the fact that it is cheap and made of paper made it very appealing from a monetary standpoint. Staff further commented that the ability of our biosensor to adapt by changing which contaminants it tests is a major strength because, though certain contaminants remain relatively constant (e.g. PMA in MDMA), they tend to change over time. Thus, the proof of concept behind our device was strong in their opinion.
They did, however, share a piece of critical feedback that had to do with the software application we incorporated into our design. That is, since the smartphone application would have to be downloaded off the internet, it might put the privacy of users at risk in the case of a hack or data breach, jeopardizing them at both a personal and professional level. With that being said, this problem can be circumvented by keeping a designated phone with the application at the drug consumption room to be shared by users, thereby preventing the need for the app to be downloaded individually.

Discussion
Due to some restrictions in wetlab, we only finished the above-mentioned experiment. We found that the number of Hela cells who possesses high copy number is   comparatively low. We also noticed the circuit C’s output is higher than expected in Figure 1.This may cause wrong judge when use the design to detect miR-21. Some measures will be taken to solve this question. Besides, we are going to endeavor to construct the other networks mentioned in modeling work.

Due to the use of two different resistant plasmids, kana and chloramphenicol, we used a plate containing two resistances of kana and chloramphenicol for screening, grew more colonies, and randomly selected 9 singles. After the colonies, we made colony PCR (Fig. 5) and the results showed that both plasmids were transferred.
Fig. 5.  A total of 9 single colonies were verified. Lane 1-9, recombinase expression plasmid validation; line 10, DL2000 DNA Marker; line 11-19, reporter gene expression plasmid validation;line 20, DL2000 DNA Marker.
The verified E. coli was separately placed in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube containing antibiotic-containing LB medium, and the culture was grown at 37° C and 200 RPM for 6 hours, and then the culture was aliquoted into two portions, one of which was added with an inducer (10 mM Arabinose). Two cultures were grown for 12 hours at 37°C and 200 RPM, and the mixture was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature prior to testing. Both lasers are used to excite both sfGFP and mRFP.
Fig. 6. After adding inducers to induce the production of Bxb1 recombinase, no expected red fluorescence signal representing the ability of recombinase to reverse was detected.

(B)Two repetitions were selected and the results showed no obvious green fluorescence
(C)Two replicates were selected after addition of the inducer and the results showed no obvious red fluorescence
The result shows no obvious fluorescence. We changed some conditions, such as lowering the temperature, adjusting the rotation speed, adjusting the time, etc. But we still did not get the expected results. We consulted the teacher and the teacher replied that there might be weak fluorescence but our instrument couldn't detect it.
Although the prokaryotic function verification of the Bxb1 recombinase plasmid given by Peking University failed, unexpectedly, we successfully verified   the function of the Bxb1 recombinase optimized by codons function in eukaryotic cells. We have not yet found out the reason for the failure. But we decided to shelve our doubts for the time being and continue other experiments.

Wells
One of the assets of the device is that the design is based on standard well plates. Instead of reinventing the wheel, the decision was taken to choose a more commercially available solution. However, there are a wide variety of well plates on the market, the design of which differs in three key aspects:
Number of wells
Well cross section
Well Depth
Number of wells:
Common well plates exist in 24, 48 and 96 well formats. We knew we wanted our device to fit one of these configurations so as to keep the barrier to wider adoption of our product as low as possible. After speaking to various teaching and diagnostics labs we decided on the 96 well configuration. This has a variety of advantages, for example, in our AMR case study ideally, we will be able to test up to 10 types of antibiotic with 2 controls at various concentrations (12*8) requiring 96 wells.
Well cross section:
The shape of the cross-section of the well was important to consider for a variety of reasons. Circular wells were decided upon when designing the 3D printed construct as they would provide the best solution with regards to the structural integrity of the device and light leakage between wells. Having circular wells allowed the addition of dividers that separate out wells so as to remove any light leakage between wells leading to inaccuracies in our data.
Well depth:
After speaking to various academics it was highlighted that to increase the accuracy of our device, the volume of liquid in each well is irrelevant, and what is more impactful is the path length of the light rays (the length of light that travels through the well). A simple monte carlo model, was derived and simulated, showing the difference in sensitivity of our device at different attenuation lengths using Beer Lambert's law. Figure 3 shows the graph that the simulation produced, showing absorbance at different concentrations for various well depths. The well depth increases as we move up the graph so wells with a greater depth have a greater gradient.
Figure 3: A graph to show how, as the path length of the light increases, so does the attenuation of the light.
In order to increase and show the maximum potential accuracy, deep well plates were utilised and a company called Eppendorf was contacted in order to obtain their advice and test a variety of samples before settling on a specific well plate.

The Cph8-OmpR and YF1-Fixj system are both light–intensity sensors so that we simulate their expression by simply increasing the light intensity input. 4. Steady-state response with respect to light intensity of these light sensors can be described by Hill function. Hill function describes the fraction of the macromolecule saturated by ligand as a function of the ligand concentration. In our project, it is used in determining the degree of cooperativeness of the ligand (CcaR, OmpR) binding to the promoters 5. Fluorescent protein quantity is perceptually uniform which means the lightness can be perceived by human’s eye is proportional to the quantity of fluorescent protein thus can be obtained from the RGB values through linear transformation.
RGB components
Here we works with The CIE 1931 color space standard which consisted of monochromatic primaries red, green and blue.
The tristimulus value extracted from sample image can be associated with a RGB color space where axes range for 0 to 255.
We use Matlab to perform this color-protein-color transformation.
By importing the sample image into Matlab, we get its RGB matrix from which we extract each primaries separately so that we have three two-dimensional matrices for red, green and blue. Labeled as r, g, b.
Protein expression output
As mentioned in assumption, we assume that two colors that are equally distant in the color space are equally different in the amount of fluorescent protein, which means relationship between the RGB values and required protein quantity can be characterized by a linear function.
We believe the Hill function can describe the ligand-binding situation in our light-sensing system by determining the degree of cooperativeness of the ligand binding to receptors. This has also been demonstrated in previous papers.
$$P=b+\frac{aI^n}{I^n+k^n}$$
I-light intensity input.
P-protein quantity produced by sensing light.
For green and blue sensor, required light intensity is thus
$$I_g=k(\frac{a}{P-b} – 1)^{-\frac{1}{n}}$$
$$I_b=k(\frac{a}{P-b} – 1)^{-\frac{1}{n}}$$
However the green sensor needs to grow under red light to perform a similar response as the red one.
For red sensor
$$I_r=k(\frac{a}{P-b} – 1)^{-\frac{1}{n}} + r_0$$

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#MAK_-_-_TEXT.html," assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.
Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of some of our parameters. Oxford recommended we used Karzburn’s 2011 paper, ‘Coarse grained dynamics of a cell free system’ for the translation constant. They also pointed out that we had forgotten to change some of the parameters’ units so our model was not dimensionally consistent, and we updated the model to fix those.

One of the biggest potential problems we identified was that if enough translation of closed switches occurred, it would be difficult to see any meaningful results. The kleakage parameter represents the ratio of translation rate on the closed and the open switch. We concluded that would not get any observable difference if translation on the closed switch was above a ten thousandth of the rate on the open switch, something we would never have been able to quantify easily without the model.
Without the model we wouldn’t have realized quite how crucial reducing leakage was. We spent a lot of time designing our switches to minimize leakage.
The lab team also asked us to find the optimal concentration of DNA for both output variation and overall output. By varying ktranslation and the concentration of DNA we found that a higher concentration was better in general, however it would plateau eventually as miRNA consumption became the limiting factor. In the specific case of miRNA degradation being 2 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of degradation of the other RNAs the GFP concentration plateaued around 5×10-9 mol dm-3.

Groningen,2009,Team:Groningen#Brainstorm#Growth Control_-_-_TEXT.html," cell density, etc.). Because obtaining a steady state requires at least 5 volume changes, chemostats require large nutrient and waste reservoirs. Creating biological ""chemostat"" would circumvent these drawbacks.
Approach
What we want to reach is an early stationary phase that is inducible and can be relieved to continu onto its natural stationary phase upon depleting its nutrients. To be able to leave to early stationary phase the inductor needs to be degradable or blockable. However, to speak of an actual phase the degradation or inhibition should proceed slowly so not to end the phase too soon.
In undertaking such an endeavour there are several approaches possible, one is to create a switch that could simply stop cells from reproducing and focus them on to production. The other is to create a culture that upon induction begins to oscilate between cell death and cell growth. Because creating either possibilities should yield some difficulties, the project could be divided into three parts.
Inducing an early stationary phase (that focusses its metabolism on protein production, visualized by GFP)
Leaving the early stationary phase (leaving the early stationary phase should be optional in practice)
Creating an oscilating culture that remains between predefined limits.
Possibilities to think of might be a time switch so to continu growing after a set period of time, or continu growing as soon as certain demands are fullfilled (certain amount of production). However, both ways of leaving the early stationary phase are then induced intrinsically and not determined by us. The same problem for the idea of adding a substance that induces the production of an autoinducer simultaneous with an slow promotor of an autoinhibitor, as the concentration of the autoinhibitor rises to a certain point the effect of the autoinducer will be block sufficiently to continu growing.
It would be nice to work with NICE

By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should be but also when the treatments should happen. Thus they complement each other to minimize the amount of anthelmintics used; thereby helping to prevent resistance development.
The Worm Buster
The first thing the team did was to define the desired characteristics of the worm buster and outline the project strategy.
Requirement
- Our Bacteria needs to live in the intestinal tracts of horses.
- They also need the ability to report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces.
The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment depending on the level of small strongyle infection.

Modelling
1 - Worm Culturing
The first step was to obtain live nematodes by the recovery of the eggs from the feces. After this process the large strongyles were divided from the small strongyles using a 3D printed microfluidic chip (figure 2) or a microscope and stored for successive use.
Figure 2: The worm separator.
2 - Transcriptomics + Phage Display
Bigass heading
Transcriptomic
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we needed an approach that would allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we developed new applications of two existing approaches.
For the first one, we have been developing a custom transcriptomic analysis protocol. This was necessary because transcriptomics is a new application for Oxford Nanopore technology. The transcriptomics procedure relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA. This will ideally reveal which genes are upregulated when the worm is next to the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!
As our result show, transcriptomics with the nanopore MinION works if a better technique to reduce the amount of RNA in the sample is discovered thus we have discovered a new application to Oxford Nanopore Technology.
Figure 3: The minION device used for the sequencing.
Phage Display
The second approach used a technique called “Phage Display”, which utilizes a random peptide library    expressed on the surface of phages. By repeated rounds of affinity screening, only phages with high affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information"

The presence of finO and FinP genes impede the cell to conjugate. Moreover, we aimed to insert the repetition AGCT10 between the Cre recombinase start codon and the rest of its ORF; when Cre recombinase ORF is in frame with the start codon, it will be translated and act on the Lox based construction, excising the FSTK, FinO and FinP genes; so, the cell will lose its division skills, however it will be able to conjugate.
Constructions
The constructions we´ve developed to this part of the project are described below.
1) BBa_K284043 : AGTC repetition and CRE recombinase under constitutive promoter  After the amplification of CRE recombinase by PCR, we cloned it into the PSB1A3 vector, according to the standard assembly strategy, resulting in the biobrick BBa_K284031. The following steps were also based on the standard assembly strategy, joining the biobricks BBa_R0040 (pTet promoter), BBa_284040 (AGCT repetition), BBa_284031 (Cre recombinase without the start codon) and BBa_B0015 (double terminator), resulting in BBa_K284043.
2) BBa_K284090: Upstream construction flanking FSTK gene  This construction was developed to be inserted in the upstream region of the FSTK gene. Lox 71 is a cleavage site for CRE recombinase. This biobrick was assembled according to the standard protocol, joining the previously existing biobricks BBa_I718017 (Lox 71), BBa_R0040 (pTet promoter), RBS (BBa_B0030), BBa_E0040 (green fluorescent protein ORF) and BBa_B0015 (double terminator).
3) Downstream construction flanking the FSTK gene
This construction is a composite part formed by the biobricks BBa_K284060, BBa_K284071 and BBa_I718017.
3.1) BBa_K284060 : FinP under constitutive promoter
After the amplification of FinP (from E. coli F plasmid) by PCR, we cloned it into the PSB1A3 vector, according to the standard assembly strategy, resulting in the biobrick BBa_K284033. The following steps were also based on the standard assembly strategy, joining the"

6. Transformations of Bacillus megaterium
The pSMF2.1-has2 and the pSMF2.1-has2-UDP-glcDH plasmids were transformed into Bacillus megaterium. Transformants were lysed and the plasmid DNA was isolated. Presence of the two expression plasmids was verified by control digestion showing the same result as in figure 9. Finally the B. megaterium chassis is ready for the first attempt to produce the high molecular mass hyaluronic acid.
7. Control of Protein Expression
7.1 Control of HMM-HA synthesis by means of viscosity measurement
The outstanding water binding capacity of high molecular mass hyaluronic acid (HMM-HA) should increase the viscosity of the cultivation medium. An altered viscosity can be measured with a rheometer. Samples of B. megaterium cultures transformed with pSMF2.1-has2 and pSMF2.1-has2-UDP-glcDH were prepared for viscosity measurement 24 h and 48 h after induction of protein expression. Supernatant of the cultures was used for measurement in case of secretion of HMM-HA into the medium. Cells were disrupted by sonication and lysozyme treatment in order to release the HMM-HA in case of its accumulation inside the cell. The results of the viscosity measurements demonstrated no significant differences in the viscosity between non-induced and induced samples. Even co expression of UDP-GlcDH didn´t lead to a significant increase of the viscosity. Consequently production of HMM-HA failed. Further steps comprising the characterisation of anti carcinogenic effects of HMM-HA on human cancer cell lines could not be performed.
7.2 Control of protein expression and localisation of a GFP tagged hyaluronan synthase
Protein expression and particularly localisation of Has2 in Bacillus megaterium was checked by using a c-terminal GFP tagged Has2 variant. The necessary fusion gene was created by SOE-PCR digested with MluⅠand SacⅠ and inserted into pSMF2.1 plasmid.

Introduction of 1 bp just after ORF-401 removes the frameshift fusing the two coding regions together which results in a functional short tail fibre protein consisting of 774 aa [2]. The C-terminal end of the stf protein (i.e. ORF-314) offers host receptor recognition for OmpC (Outer membrane protein C) on the surface of E.coli, widening receptor specificity and host range relative to λ-PaPa which only recognises the E.coli Maltoporin (lamB gene product) through its tip attachment protein J [1],[3]. Additionally, the C-terminus (ORF-314) displays a high level of homology with the gp37 of bacteriophage T4 [4].
The gene has been assembled using the synthesised ORF-401 with a linker sequence (removing the frameshift mutation) and ORF-314. The sequences were optimised to remove illegal restriction sites to make the sequence BioBrick-compatible. We cloned the two open reading frames and a linker into a single in-frame coding sequence (into a pSB1C3 backbone) using Gibson assembly. Success of the cloning procedure was confirmed by restriction with EcoRI and SpeI restriction enzymes followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 2) and in part by Sanger sequencing. This BioBrick was registered as part BBa_K1846004 .
tfa gene (BBa_K1846002)
The tfa (tail fibre assembly) protein of bacteriophage lambda assists in the assembly of the stf (short tail fibre) protein into a functional short tail fibre [4],[5]. Tfa gene displays a high level of homology (~40%) with the gp38 of bacteriophage T4 [1],[4],[6].
Sequence was optimised to remove illegal restriction sites. The gene sequence is currently available only as part of a composite part BBa_K1846001 .
J gene (BBa_K1846008)
The bacteriophage lambda J gene encodes the tip attachment protein that forms the base plate of the bacteriophage's tail. It is responsible for host protein recognition and specificity. C-terminal residues of protein J have direct binding interactions with the maltoporin (LamB), a membrane protein of E.coli, allowing irreversible attachment of the phage to the host and facilitating DNA injection [3],[7].
We obtained this sequence as part of a collection of bacteriophage lambda parts from Technion, Haifa, Israel; this specific sequence was part of their previous"

Abstract
This time the mutation is successful, but we still don't finish building our vector.
Week 5
8.26.2012-8.31.2012
8.26.2012
Because the PCR production is OK, we know that we have built the right vector. So we picked up some colonies from the petri dish, cultured bacterium in shake-flask.
This process usually takes one night.
8.27.2012
We picked up the plasmid from the bacteria this morning, then digested it with two kinds of enzymes xba I and Pst I. Only in this way we can connect the terminator with the vector.
Despite the fact that we have already digested the vector to leave the restriction enzyme cutting site, we need to test the vector again. So we digested the vector with AflⅡ. If the vector is right, we should be able to see a stripe appear around 4kbp. We have already digested the GFP, RFP and plasmid the day before yesterday. Today we need to do an electrophoresis to recover the gel, and get the purified GFP, RFP and plasmid.
Then we used T4 DNA ligase to connect GFP and the plasmid together.
During the 2 fragments ligation, we did an electrophoresis to see whether the vector ligased with 3 fragments successfully. We got disappointed that this vector is false positive which means we didn’t link GFP RFP and plasmid well.
We need to analysis why the experiment failed again. We think that the essence of our experiment is to digest the plasmid well. Because we used two different kinds of enzymes and a buffer to digest the plasmid, we can’t promise the efficiency of both enzymes are high enough. So we probably should spend more time on digestion next time.
After the discussion, we did"

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to control the many pieces of hardware that surround these photobioreactors (e.g. LED panel, online OD measurement, temperature, etc.). PyCultivator, as it is called, is freely available at https://gitlab.com/mmp-uva/pycultivator , and while it provides one platform for modelling and interacting with these devices, it still requires further implementations to tailor it to the purpose of the experiments - here mimicking industrial conditions in the lab.
In order to model the light-dark cycle, we chose a sinusoidal function as represented below:\[y=\alpha \sin(2 \pi \frac{t}{24} + \Delta t) + \Delta y\]where y is the light intensity (μE s -2 ) at time t (hr). By setting the amplitude (α) and Δ y (y-offset) appropriately, we can simulate cycles with unequal periods of light and dark. An example of a 8hr -1 6hr light-dark cycle with a peak light intensity of 120 μE s -2 is shown here . Additionally, to avoid potential errors, this function was clamped such that the minimum value allowed was 0 μE s -2 .
To model the effects of self-shadowing and mixing on the perceived light for single cells, we calculate the 2D light distribution of a simulated culture within a cylindrical vessel illuminated by an external light source. The simulated culture is described by three parameters: (i) the extinction coefficient of the culture, ε (L gDW -1 cm-1), (ii) the biomass concentration, C (gDW L -1 ), and (iii) the radius of the vessel, R (cm). The values for these three parameters will be used in the fluctuation experiments are listed in Table 5.3.
Table 5.3. Parameter values for the fluctuation algorithm
For a specific position within the simulated vessel, given in polar coordinates, the perceived light can be calculated using the following equation [16]: \[ I(r, \theta) = I_0 10^{-\epsilon C (\sqrt{R^2-(r \cos(\theta))^2} - r \sin(\theta))} \] where I0 is the incident light intensity (μE m-2 s-1), and r and θ are the polar coordinates of the simulated position. Additionally, we also use the following two equations to calculate the average light intensity and the minimum light intensity, respectively, within the simulated vessel: \[ I_{ave}  =  \frac{1}{"

Assay Protocols
This page describes the assay protocols for each genotype and stimulus. These assays were chosen because we wanted to assess the biofilm phenotype thoroughly as well as evaluate the components of the biofilm that are most critical towards the transition to the sedentary lifestyle. Our battery of assays contains assays to assess overall biofilm development: Crystal violet, Aggregation and Adhesion assays. However we also examine curli expression with the Congo Red assay, cellulose expression with the Congo Red and Calcofluor assays, Exopolysaccharide expression with the Colanic Acid assay and fimbriae expression with the Yeast Agglutination assay.
Input into these assays are a series of microtiter wells with a culture volume of 300 μL and phosphate buffered LB as the reference medium.
In terms of a qualitative biofilm assay, our petri dish-based Colony Morphology assay assesses the appearance, colour and texture of E. Coli colonies subject to varying stimuli.
Cell density
Principle: OD600 is used as a surrogate for number of cells.
Materials:
       •Plate reader
       •96-well plate with clear bottom
Procedure:
       1. Measure OD600 for the entire plate of cultures in the micrometer plate  reader.
Aggregation
Principle: Measure cell density in culture below surface, aggregated cells will have  sunk to the bottom of the well.
Materials
       •Plate reader
       •96-well plate with clear bottom
Procedure:
       1. Remove 150 μL of culture volume from overnight culture plates.
       2. Place it into the empty microtiter well, at the edge of the plate. To prevent  bubble formation, make sure to stop pipetting at the first stop.
       3. Measure OD600
Crystal violet
Principle: Crystal violet binds to polysaccharides of the biofilm matrix. By measuring the binding to adhering biofilm, the amount of biofilm produced can be quantified. A stock solution of crystal violet is incubated with the culture, the supernatant is "

Recognizing that EMS vehicles may be reservoirs of pathogens, we next wished to meet the need for a rapid and on-site pathogen detection technology that uses specific antibodies for detection. Towards this we engineered a library of synthetic single domain antibodies (Nanobodies) as well as a bacterial two hybrid system for antibody selection.

The system can be altered into therapeutic application when the bioluminescence signal is changed into drug delivery. With boundless creativeness, the application diversity of this system is limitless.
2.    Is the design of BioWatcher better than the current blood test?
Yes! Current blood test is the most direct approach for everyone to learn about his/her bodily health. However, it’s rarely performed due to its several drawbacks, invasiveness, time-consuming procedure and the fact that it can only be carried out with the help of medical professions. Although new smart wearable devices attempt to deal with these problems by offering noninvasive measurement and instant report, what the trackers can tell the users, such as heart rate, steps taken and calories burned, are not direct and useful indicators for early-stage diagnosis.
BioWatcher aims to overcome the disadvantages of both blood test and current smart wearables and combine the advantages of both:  using noninvasive measurement wearables providing instant report to directly assessing disease indicators.
3.    Are we sure that this system can be used in humans?
Not until the experiment can successfully prove feasibility will we be able to give a confirmed answer. However, even at the worst scenario--failing to apply this system in humans-- this design can be widely apply on other experiment animal model. BioWatcher is going to be a great help to scientists and bring them immense convenience and efficiency in lab.
We are very grateful for all the questions asked that once again examine and improve BioWatcher.

Fractions that spectrophotometrically indicated typical protein peaks at 280 nm were combined and concentrated. Purity and integrity of proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and by Western blot. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred for 60 min at 350 mA to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham). Membranes were blocked with 0.2% I-Block (Tropix) in PBS-T (1x PBS/0,1% Tween-20) for 60 min, then incubated sequentially with primary mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) for 90 min at a dilution of 1:1000 and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min at a dilution of 1:3000 at room temperature. The signal was detected with chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). As proteins were determined, we dialyzed them two times against 1x PBS buffer. Secondary structure was examined by CD spectroscopy.
 
CIRCULAR DICHROISM
Circular dichroism (CD) is a form of spectroscopy based on the differential absorption of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light. It can be used to help determine the structure of macromolecules (including the secondary structure of proteins). This method was used to confirm that intact protein with it's proper secondary structure was isolated. CD spectra were  taken the far-UV region between 190 and 250 nm on a Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics). The cell path length used was 1 mm with sample concentration 0.5 mg/ml in MQ water.

Formal Lab Session - 1st September 2009
Overview
Stochastic Switch Team - analysed cut pSB1AT3 plasmid (successful) and also cleaned up ssbp PCR product. Also froze down strains of transformant E. coli containing BioBricks
Metal Sensor Team - prepared the newly arrive pMA1 and pMA2 primers and then used these primers to amplify czrA from B. subtilis genome (PCR). Also used PCR to amplify sac, ara and sspb for Stochastic Switch team.
Promoter Library Sub-Project - attempted to amplify the three sets of sigA promoter using PCR

Goksel cleaning up products from a successful PCR reaction involving sspB
Today we run the gel for pSB1AT3 plasmid backbone purified last week from the gel. It was cut with EcoRI and SpeI sites. The length of the band confirmed that we have the right product.
We also used PCR clean-up kit to extract sspB from last week's PCR. We used sigma-d's PCR clean-up protocol. The final volume was measured as 48ul. We measured the concentration and run it on the gel using 5ul of sspb + 4ul of water + 1ul of the loading buffer. The band confirmed that we had the right product after the clean-up process.
The concentration of sspB was 37.5ng/ul

As results shown below, some green cells were detected among the cells co-transfected with both plasmids. But few green cells were detected among the cells transfected BBa_K758006 alone.
And we also compiled statistics on the ratio of green lighted cells. In consequence, in the group transfected with pAct5C-GAL4, there were 45 green colored cells (12.6%) among 356 cells in total. And, without pAct5C-GAL4, there were only 2 cells were colored green (it is 0.5%) among 350 cells in total.
Cells transfected with BBa_K758006 and pAct5C-GAL4
Cells transfected with BBa_K758006 alone
These results indicate that BBa_K758006 was activated by GAL4 protein and BB_K758006 EGFP expression was induced by GAL4 protein.
In these circumstances, BBa_K758006 was working as expected.
BBa_K758005(UAS-LacZ)
We transfected Drosophila cells with this plasmid, too. We devided the cells into two groups. One group had been co-transfected with pAct5C-GAL4 again, and the other group had been transfected with this plasmid alone.
If BBa_K758005 was assembled accurately, the former group expresses LacZ strongly and the latter expresses weakly.
Generally, to test the activation of LacZ, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) is used by mesuring blue color made by the degradation of X-Gal. However, in this experiment, we conducted immunostaining by red color to test the expression of LacZ (picture F, G, I, and J). Also we use 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) that binds and emit blue light in order to count cells (picture E and H).
As results shown below,some red cells were detected among the cells transfected with pAct5C-GAL4. They prove that LacZ is activated in this group. But the other group without transfection with pAct5C-GAL4 contains no red cells.

The  transportation system of oxygenated medium is also needed perfection. After  some optimizing experiments, we can finally accomplish our digital display  device.   
4. E-ink
“What will we get in this project?” We have been asked for many times but still  have no idea, until an E-book displayed on our lab. We were inspired by this magical  device and got our answer.
E-book is a book-length publication in  digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, and produced on, published  through, and readable on computers or other electronic devices. [2] Its core is E-ink. E-ink is a specific proprietary type of  electronic  paper  manufactured by  E-Ink  Corporation , founded in 1997 based on research started at the  MIT Media Lab . However,  E-ink has some shortcoming, like it just can display monochromatic figure. But,  the E.coli in our project in this  year can replaced the E ink. And the microcapsules, which are used for  nurturing bacteria, can also replace the pearls, which are used for carrying ink.  We concluded all above for 4 reasons.
Digital display and E ink share  the same working principle;
There are both microcapsules on  their solution;
We can control their station by  controlling the input signal;
Comparing monochromatic E-ink,  we can construct different logical circuits in the engineering bacteria, and  add different inducer. Then the bacteria will generate chromatic GFP. In  another word, we could create multicolor E-book.
In a word, if we can improve technology, the  digital display will probably replace the traditional E-ink.

PcelA and PcomFA promoters have high specificity to σx for activation, so genes downstream the promoters will be translated only if σx is present. Hence, by using fluorescence protein as a reporting mechanism, this σx, PcelA and PcomFA promoters system could be further utilized as a specific reporter device in E. coli DH10B strain that could be used by iGEM communities.
σx-ComW mechanism
Figure 2. σx - comW Interaction Diagram
σx and ComW protein are both produced by a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for PcelA and PcomFA promoters induction, and ComW protein is required for σx stabilization. ComW protein acts as a barrier that protects σx from being degraded by ClpXP degradation enzyme, hence it increases the production of σx. The increase in σx production will increase the expression of green fluorescence protein by PcelA and PcomFA promoters.
To complete the story of competence regulation mechanism from S. pneumoniae, we would also like to integrate another positive factor involved in competence regulation which was later found out to be ComW. Prof. Morrison's lab released another research paper on the identification of a new component in the regulation of genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae. The gene comW (SP0018) was found to be       regulated by the quorum-sensing system and is required for a high-level of competence (Luo, Li, and Morrison, 2004). Coexpression of ComW with σx restores the accumulation of σx and the expression of late genes as ComW contributes to the stabilization of the alternative sigma factor X against proteolysis by ClpXP and is required for full activity of σx in directing transcription of late competence genes (Piotrowski, Luo, and Morrison, 2009).
Based on these findings, we tried to integrate this ComW into the mechanism to see whether and how the presence of ComW affects σx. First, we cloned out the comX gene expressing σx and comW genes from the genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 strain. We then used BBa_K880005 (consisting of constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and strong RBS BBa_B0034 ) from the BioBricks to express those genes.

Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#PROJECT#attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," The only exception was that the advisors helped students with operating the instruments for SPR and HPLC ad MS analysis, which was done by the MS operator. Student team members were also assisted for the use of confocal microscope at the beginning.  
 
In this way we were encouraged to try and learn as much as we could every day and to take benefit from all the various techniques and protocols we got in touch with. Apart from the fact that the project was quite intensive and laborious, we were given so many beneficial knowledge it is really hard to imagine. Not only the final goal or destination, the path we have taken makes all the difference.
During the summer we also helped other teams participating in iGEM with filling their surveys (check the results here: https://2010.igem.org/Team:METU_Turkey_Software ) and with characterization of several parts previosly existing in the Registry ( BBa_I0500 , BBa_K165007 , BBa_K165006 , BBa_K274002 ).

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Queens_Canada,2015,Team:Queens Canada#Circ AFP_-_-_TEXT.html," the results of one round of IAP. The single band in the last lane indicates the purified circAFP, isolated in the ice fraction. The liquid fraction represents all compounds not incorporated into the ice.
Thermal Hysteresis Activity
To further ensure that the circAFP was still active in ice growth inhibition, a thermal hysteresis assay was performed on the crude cell lysates before purification. This assay has been developed through collaborations with the Davies Lab at Queen’s University and the Biochemistry labs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. This technique involves freezing the unpurified AFP solution and slowly melting it to a single crystal. Once isolated, the solution is slowly dropped further down below zero until the single crystal bursts into many. The difference between the melting temperature and the temperature at which the crystal bursts is known as the TH gap. In our crude lysate sample (with quite low concentrations – about 0.2mg/ml – of circAFP), we achieved a TH gap of about 0.3 degrees oC.
Figure 6. Bar graph of TH assay results, comparing wtAFP with our circAFP at various activity test conditions. Data shows that circAFP retains almost 80% of its antifreeze activity after being subjected to 90 oC . The wild-type AFP quickly loses its activity after exposure to such high temperatures.
AFP Thermostability
To test circAFP’s thermostability, we treated three samples at three temperatures 37, 68, and 90 oC for 10 minutes each. Wild type samples were also treated at these same conditions. After treatment, TH assays were performed and TH gaps were compared based on percent retention of activity, relative to the untreated sample. Figure 6 shows a bar graph which illustrates these results.

Overview
""Technology is only a means,  in itself it is neither good nor evil.   Everything depends upon what man makes of it,  for what purpose it serves him,  under what conditions he places it."" - Karl Theodor Jaspers
iGEMers should never be restricted in laboratory. To solve a real-life problem, STEP was created for cellular immunotherapy. But will it serve people in a responsible way? How can we perfect it by involving the world into our project? What shall we do for the public? Inspired by the idea of opening science, we delivered several lectures to students from kindergarten to college, from Shanghai to Canton. A video, a set of cartoon ‘tuanzi’ and a reportage were created to help the public better understand our project and the true living condition of sci-researchers in China. We contacted experts and stakeholders to help us add social, ethical and juristic considerations to our project. Professionals from synthetic biology, pharmaceutical industry and computer science also put touches into the design and application of STEP.
Silver Medal Criteria
Education & Engagement
Synthetic biology has its unique magic:  every element works together for one purpose in the system we design, just like an imaginative idea can act as a magnet to draw people together. Involving the public stays on in our mind. In this spirit, we delivered a set of lectures and mini-labs to students of all ages to unlock a world of synthetic biology for juniors. Excitedly, vibrant students from High School Affiliated to Fudan University applauded the idea of synthetic biology and newly established an iGEM team on our instruction. In addition, inspired by the principle of opening science, we interviewed"

Summary
When we were doing our project of the community of synthetic biology, we were always thinking that public should know more about it and they need to join our community. Synthetic biology is powerful, but to most of the citizen, they haven’t heard about it. After comparing of different ages, we thought high school students and college freshmen are the most suitable groups for popularization of synthetic biology. So in the presentation parts, we focused on guiding them. We went to the best two high schools in Shenzhen, and we had a public course on synthetic biology to our freshmen.
High Schools
Shenzhen Experimental High School
In Sep 25th, we went to Shenzhen Experimental High School to give the students there a public course, and we answered their interesting questions.
The public course included the history of synthetic biology, and we described it with a very easy way for understanding. Then we talked about the basic idea and knowledge of synthetic biology, and helped them to understand how we can build a new circuit. After that, we focused on the safety and humanity of this new subject, which is the most important part to let citizens accept this mysterious thing. The last part was about iGEM, and this was the most interesting part; those students were very interested about it.
They provided us a lot of questions, such as “Why do we need to use E.Coli to be the basic part of synthetic biology”, and “Were the project commercialized?” We answered these questions in detail.
And they showed a lot of interests in iGEM high school competition. We gave them our brochures of synthetic biology and iGEM, so the students who didn’t have the chance to take part in the public course could know and learn things about synthetic biology and iGEM.
Some students in Shenzhen Experimental High School stayed here then for they had many questions. And the guys who wore our team clothes were answering the students' questions.
The students were trying our "

A notable aspect to mention here is the huge amount of square meters that have to be initially detected. For instance  in the initial survey 100.0000 square meters are identified; this is brought down trough triangulation of data, to 20.000 square meters. There are square meters included by other organizations, that shouldn’t be included and should be discarded from the beginning.
Next,  we asked the opinion about using ELECTRACE as a detection system for landmines and how feasible would be to detect landmines by taking samples from the groundwater were the samples are supposed to leak.  Mr. Brady confirmed that there is a leakage, but that is difficult to attach a number to it, or to say how much. However, our sensorial system will work on the same principle as the dog detection. What is sure is that  there is enough leakage, as none of them are 100% sealed. But how much goes into the soil and can be detectable in the ground water is hard to say.  Yet, Mr. Brady see our device as a great potential to identify areas where there is contamination and then that area can l be further process. Currently there is a long process trying to discard areas, if there would be a device that can tell about the contamination and quickly discount areas, and the effort could go toward areas where there are heavy contaminations.
To conclude the interview, we asked his opinion about using the synthetic biology approach to detect landmines. The response was positive and encouraging:  “If we can get a tool that can help people ( …) personally I don’t foresee any principle objections from the community at all ”.
Report meeting with Prof.dr.ir.  Ibo van Poel
To address the ethical issues surrounding our iGEM project, we had a meeting with Prof.dr.ir.  Ibo van Poel. He is a Professor in Ethics and Technology at Delft University of Technology.
During this meeting, we had the chance to present him our project and to ask his opinion about the main ethical issues and aspects that our iGEM team should have into consideration as the main developer of the ELECTRACE.  He mentioned that here are several generic issues related to the usage of  synthetic biology and other issues raised by the specific usage of the end product -ELECTRACE. The general issues include: safety, security, justice, and “Playing God”.
Safety is important at two stages- both during the development and production process, but also during the usage of the end product."

Module Integration - Autoinduction
Overview
The autoinduction process switches on Module 2 following the accumulation of a predetermined concentration of polypeptide. The term 'autoinduction' was chosen as the flipping of this switch is triggered by the chemical composition of the media in which our chassis is grown.
The 'on signal' orginates from inside the system: hence 'autoinduction'.
Module 2 Timeline
Rationale
Before embarking on the creation of an autoinduction switch, we reviewed a number of possible alternatives. A genetically encoded timer was initially considered however these present a considerable number of problems that were absent from an autoinduction switch.
Genetic Timers
Autoinduction Switch
Existing genetic timers are unable to provide a long enough delay.
The length of our delay can be tuned by altering the composition of our media
They are liable to fall out of phase.
Since the whole population are exposed to the same media, a greater proportion will begin Module 2 in synchrony.
They require multiple genes.
Only a single promoter is required for our autoinduction switch.
We believe that the advantages and modularity of our autoinduction switch is such that future iGEM teams will be able to deploy it in a broad range of senarios.
Initiation
Module 2 is triggered by a rise in levels of cyclic Adenosine Mono Phosphate (cAMP). This is because cAMP facilitates the dimerisation of the transcription factor CRP which induces transcription downstream of the PcstA promoter ( BBa_K118011 ). The rise in cAMP is correlated with a fall in levels of the primary carbon source (glucose). Thus, by controlling the initial amount of glucose present in the system, we achieve a timer function for the start of Module 2.

Module 2: Autoinduction Testing Construct
To characterise the properties of our autoinduction switch, we put the fluorescent protein GFP under the control of the PcstA promoter () as shown above.

Week Six
Apparatus work with Daniel Ludwig and Professors Tayhas Palmore and Jerry Daniels.
PCR work with the PVJ4 plasmid in order to Biobrick.
Week Seven
Began to explore other ideas for a reporting system.  Biological means of detection included placing a Green Fluorescent Protein under the control of the same inducible promoter that controls the Cell Lysis Cassette. We also considered an AND Gate where the S and R genes have different promoters.  This would allow us to test for multiple toxins within water samples.
Previous PCR's have been unsuccessful.  Ordered ""Middle"" primers that started within the sequence of the pVJ4 Cassette.  The initial and final 100 base pairs of the Cassette would be within the amplified sequences.
Week Eight
UTRA Symposium at Brown.  Team Toxipop shared the summer's research with the Brown scientific community.
Continued sensitivity testing of our the apparatus with Daniel Ludwig.
Different concentrations of bacterial cells tested with varying amounts of Arabinose.  The control of these tests was either a pVJ4 culture without added Arabinose or a plasmid containing the Cell Lysis Cassette under a different promoter, for example pRG1 - on a Plac plasmid.
Week Nine +
Wrap up of the summer.  Work resumed in September.
More sensitivity testing with NaCl and Milli-Q water.
Made the switch to conductivity measurements.  Obtained a conductivity probe and obtained beautiful results.  Cells were not concentrated.  Arabinose added and probe left in solution for four hours.  A steep curve resulted!
Much of our efforts were concentrated on Biobricking our different parts.  Team Toxipop had problems over the summer obtaining PCR products.  We were finally able to Biobrick the pVJ4 plasmid, the S105 gene, and the lysis cassette with S105,R,Rz genes.  The pVJ4 plasmid contains the Cell Lysis Cassette under the control of an Arabinose Inducible Promoter.  All tests run throughout the summer were done with pVJ4.  The team received the S105 cassette and gene in September from Ry Young's Lab at Texas A&M.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," and enumerators. Usually when we have to conduct a survey, we invite the enumerators depending on how big the survey is. Usually they are trained for two to three days because we have to explain to them the project itself. Because when they go into the field they meet a lot of questions which they have to be able to address. We also need to introduce them to the app and make sure they collect the data correctly. Otherwise, if they mess up it means that also the data is messed up and we cannot rely on it. But we have a lot of enumerators so most of the times it’s just a refresher training because we have already trained a lot of them. Sometimes they have found jobs that’s why they can’t come and we have to train new enumerators.
For the surgeries, in case we organized a camp and want to do some trachomatous trichiasis operations, one of the BICO staff goes there before to capture the data. And the surgeons have also been trained on how to capture the data. So when they are doing the operation, they are also entering the data into the phone. Then the data is uploaded to the server and we can access it.
Daniel C.:
Wow. It sounds like a smooth operation. You don’t have to do any paperwork.
Salomi:
Yeah, there is no need for paperwork. And in case the project officers organize an operational research [project], we just ask him or her to give us the questions and we put them on the server and download them on the phone so they can use it.
Dominika:
Could you show us some of the questionnaires and the app?
Salomi:
Yeah sure. We are using Motorola MB865 phones for the surveys and data collection. For example, after mass drug administration we have to do coverage surveys to see if the people received the drug, or how many people received it. And then after six months there is the impact assessment survey. All that data is collected using these android phones.
Daniel C.:
How much data do you collect from one district for example?
Salomi:
It depends on how large the district is. For the impact assessment surveys, we usually have a sample size of 1090 children per district […].
Daniel C.:
I am really interested to see what questions are in the questionnaire.
Salomi:
Yeah we are going to show you. So this is the questionnaire that the surgeon fills out when he has finished the surgeries. He has to fill out the summaries like how many were males, how many where females, how many have been operated on both eyes, how"

Two-step protocol for gene replacement using a selection-counterselection cassette
This protocol is useful if you want to replace a gene X with another gene Y. The example used here will detail the replacement of the Citrobacter freundii cephalosporinase gene with the limonene synthase gene, what makes our cells less antibiotic resistant and more citrus-scented (Figure 1). The idea was pioneered by Edinburgh's 2010 iGEM team - you can read more about their BRIDGE (BioBrick Recombination In Direct Genomic Editing) project here
Figure 1: Two-step gene replacement strategy, simplified schematic.
The first step in the process is creating homology arms by PCR for the selection-counterselection cassette that are homologous to the regions flanking the cephalosporinase gene. The arm upstream of the cassette should have an EcoRI site at its 5’ end and the arm downstream of the cassette should have a PstI site at its 3’ end.
The upstream arm can then be digested with EcoRI and the downstream arm with PstI and these can then be ligated to the selection-counterselection cassette that was digested with both"

Fig. 4 Final form of Lipodrop.
Coating LipoDrop with PVA
Final and critical step in preparing the chip is the selective coating of post-junction channels with PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol) to render them hydrophilic. It is required to prevent the lipid/octanol solution from wetting the inherently hydrophobic inner channel surface of the device. Without this additional coating, liposomes are unable to form. To coat only a part of microfluidic channels is a challenge: PVA must only remain in post-junction channels without any leakage to the other side. To counter the spreading of PVA to pre-junction channels, air is introduced from separate inlets. A correct interphase between air and PVA must form and stay stable for at least several minutes to let the PVA molecules adhere to the surface (Fig. 5). Any PVA contamination to the opposite side makes the whole device unusable. Not only is this process time consuming (at least 15-20 minutes for each microfluidic device) and requires constant supervision, the procedure quite often fails due to human error while controlling the infusion rates of air and PVA.

Lipovision software for fully automated microfluidic experiments
In pursuit to substantially reduce the manual effort in performing coating procedure, we have designed a software called LipoVision. LipoVision software reduces human labor down to the bare minimum and optimizes the coating procedure entirely. The LipoVision software is based on the open standard computer library OpenCV and is written in Go. It is available on all operating systems and made to be accessible to any custom microfluidic experiment. Eventually, we are planning to apply this software for the fully automated synthesis of the liposomes. To learn more about LipoVision, refer to Software .
The synthesis of liposomes
After successfully coating the chips, the devices are finally ready for liposome synthesis. An experiment is conducted utilizing an octanol-assisted liposome assembly (OLA) method. Liposomes are formed when three unique phases (s"

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Idea#Pre study_-_-_TEXT.html," p-HPP is converted to HGA through the oxidation of HPPD (Lindstedt and Odelhög 1987; Lindstedt et al. 1977). In the study, the transaminase for the initial step should exist in clone fss6. Three aminotransferase capable of converting tyrosine into p-HPP have been identified in E. coli (Pittard 1987). We propose that tyrosine is first catabolized by aminotransferases of E. coli host, then, the produced p-HPP is converted to HGA by the introduced HPPD gene products. Lastly, the accumulation and polymerization of HGA results in the formation of melanin."" - Characterization of a Deep-Sea Sediment Metagenomic Clone that Produces Water-Soluble Melaninin Escherichia coli p. 130
Andreas: I find this part quite interesting and will look more into it. Since melanins are very small molecules, I’m not sure about using CPP as a shuttle into the cells, but since you say that melanin is produced by melanocytes, secreted and then enters the keratocytes, our bacterial melanin might be able to enter the keratocytes the same way.
Johan: Melanin is stored in organelles called melanosomes, this is a problem I’m looking into.
Nina: Mats found this part with the melanin very interesting and he told me to continue the melanin work by studying “eumelanin”.

Clotho applications.
Introduction Circuit List TTEC Back to Homepage
Introduction
Clotho is a popular software framework in synthetic biology. It provides many applications which are very useful in synthetic biology. It can also extend itself by utilizing applications developed by others. So, in order to enrich the function of Clotho and to make more people experience our software, we developed two applications, Circuit List and TTEC.
Circuit List
We developed a Clotho verion of Circuit+, Circuit List. Though it's not very perfect, it can make users experience Circuit+ on Clotho.
TTEC
TTEC, which is short for Transcriptional Terminator Efficiency Calculator, was developed by team SUSTC-Shenzhen-B in 2012. It calculate the efficiency of transcription terminator from the primary nucleotide sequences. We transplanted TTEC to Clotho platform to make more people use this useful tool. And this is prompted by iGEM that use existing iGEM software to develop new tools.If you want to know more about TTEC, the older one, please visit wiki of SUSTC-Shenzhen-B 2012 .

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

OUC-China,2018,Team:OUC-China#mb9_-_-_TEXT.html,", use the certain keys to cleave the RNA and fall down, gather the golden coins and arrive the destination eventually.
Fig.21 Some small icons that we designed in our game.
Many different cleave sites random are generated from four different kinds of ribonucleotide. At the beginning, Csy4 only have the ability to recognize and cleave several sites. Players should get the ability to cleave at new site by passing more game levels or buying in the store using the money gathering during game.
Fig.22 Six kinds of RNA with specific structures.
In this part, we enact the game rules:
a. Csy4 cleaves the RNA by certain cut site instead of special structure.
b. Csy4 starts at one side of the screen, it's supposed to go the diagonal side.
c. Players should use RNA to help Csy4 reach the end.
d. The golden coins gathered during the game can be used to buy more skills (active cleave sites) to cut the RNA.
e. There will be several levels,and every time you pass a level you can get a new ability.
After discussing with the computer games designer Mingjie Shen, we started our design!
3.3.2 The first step of our game:
During programming, we designed 6 RNA with different structures carrying one or two sites on it. Players can choose the certain sites and cut it to help Csy4 fall. And Csy4 is designed as a little cute white devil in the game.
The game was divided into 6 parts on the basis of the properties of proteins: Immune, Secretion, Transport, Constitute, Recognition, Catalyze. The difficulties among those parts from Immune to Catalyze is in gradient.
We also designed many other widgets we need in the game.
In this part, we've done:
a. Designed the 6 kinds of RNA with specific structures.
b. Designed the cartoon character of Csy4.
c. Designed the gradient difficulties in game.
d. Designed other widgets in game.
Fig.23 The cartoon character of Cys4.
3.3.3 Meet some troubles
While programming, we found that the RNA rolling sidebar is hard to realize. And it's difficult for most players to control the movement of Csy4 and arrange the certain RNA at the same time. So we modified the game rules -- delete the rolling sidebar and immobilize RNA to lengthen the path and make the rolling background picture come true.
In our original vision, Csy4 can only move horizontally. It can not jump or fall down at both ends of the"

Anaerobic cultivation
We cultivated E. coli KRX with BBa_1465102 under anaerobic conditions to characterize the activity of the fumarate reductase Frd ( BBa_1465102 ) under control of the T7 promotor. We used M9 minimal medium with 50 mM xylose as carbon source and 50 mM fumarate as substrate of the fumarate reductase Frd. We focused on growth characteristic and metabolite analysis. Under anaerobic conditions E. coli cells use different alternative electron acceptors instead of oxygen. In part the bacteria use fumarate respiration, whereby fumarate is reduced into succinate. There are also other potential pathways for bacteria to release their electrons, for example anorganic compounds like nitrate (NO3-) or sulfate (SO42-). As a result of this the expected level of produced succinate is very low. We analyzed fumarate and succinate concentrations in the culture supernatant via HPLC analysis .
We expect mid-level succinate production of the E. coli KRX wildtype under anaerobic conditions. Strong expression of Frd ( BBa_1465102 ) leads to an increasing succinate production and fumarate consumption.
As a control we are going to use E. coli ΔfdrA730::kan , an E. coli strain with a reviewed knockout in frdA gene. This strain does not show any fumarate reductase activity and so succinate concentraion should be on a low level. Furthermore we transform BBa_1465102 into E. coli ΔfdrA730::kan to compensate functional defect of fumarate reductase in this strain.
Unfortunately the results of the cultivartion of E. coli ΔfdrA730::kan and E. coli ΔfdrA730::kan with complementation by BBa_1465102 are not successful. HPLC analysis could not evaluated because of a mistake in the process.
Figure 9: Results of the anaerobic cultivation of Escherichia coli KRX wildtype in M9 minimal medium with 50 mM xylose and 50 mM fumarate. Induction occurred after 72 h with 0.1% rhamnose and 500 μM IPTG. Fumarate and succinate concentration were measured duplicated via HPLC.
