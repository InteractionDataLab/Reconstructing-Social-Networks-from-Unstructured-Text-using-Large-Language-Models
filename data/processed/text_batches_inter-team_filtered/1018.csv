Apart from spectrophotometry, the resuspension of beta-carotene or retinal in acetone can be subjected to analysis by HPLC. HPLC can be used to separate retinal from beta-carotene, to get a better indication of whether or not our retinal-generating part actually produces retinal from beta-carotene.
In this experiment cells were prepared and harvested according to protocol EX1.2 . This experiment was performed with six different strains of E. coli:
Wild type TOP10
Wild type MG1655
TOP10/pSB1A2-K274210
MG1655/pSB1A2-K274210
TOP10/pSB1A2-K274210/pSB1C3-K343005
MG1655/pSB1A2-K274210/pSB1C3-K343005
Both K343005 and K274210 were constitutively expressed.
MG1655 containing PSB1A2 with K274210 or PSB1C3 with K343005 were both under a constitutively active promotor
The measurements were preformed on cells after 20 hours of growth. The resulting graphs is presented beneath the text.
Figure 4: HPLC analysis of samples from the 19th oct. 2010 Beta-carotene Peaks are clearly present, but no retinal peaks are observed. Measurements were made after 20 hours of growth
Figure 5: HPLC analysis of samples from the 22nd oct. 2010 Beta-carotene Peaks are clearly pressent, but no retinal peaks are observed. Measurements were made after 20 hours of growth
When looking at the retinal and beta-carotene standards analysed on the HPLC, peaks for both chemicals are clearly present. The retinal retention time is 3,480-3,490 minutes and the beta-carotene retention time is 23,300-23,600 minutes.
The spectra for the first run of samples show large amounts of beta-carotene, smaller amounts of which also are products produced by the K274210 biobrick or absorbed form the media in the cells where the K274210 biobrick is absent.
The spectra shows no measurable amounts of retinal in neither of the samples, but the samples produced by bacteria containing the K343006 brick have a lower amount of beta-carotene, which can indicated that either the bacterial production of beta-carotene is lowered or that some of the beta-carotene has been metabolized in the cell, either to a non"

Considering the fact that not every iGEM Team has the same laboratory and the same appliances, we wanted to find a way to detect desired proteins in a way that would be cost efficient, simple, and accessible to people all around the globe. What better way than to use a pregnancy test? Pregnancy tests are readily available all around the world at little to no cost, for some, and require no extra care. They are simple to use and depending on the brand and its sensitivity, they can detect minute amounts of hCG. Table 1 below shows how remarkably cheap it is to purchase a pregnancy test in different countries. Teams iGEM IIT Madras and iGEM DTU Denmark provided us with the cost of the pregnancy test in their countries.
Education and Public Engagement
Accessibility is a big part of our project, both in the lab and in our community. Our project aims to make protein detection more accessible worldwide, by providing an affordable, readily available detector system utilizing pregnancy test strips. In keeping with our theme of accessibility, we participated in multiple events in the Atlanta area, promoting science education and lab accessibility to all students.
First, we participated in Discovery Day at GSU and the Atlanta Science Festival. These two events are education focused and cater primarily to children, and our activities there reflected that. Our focus was to introduce children to science, showing them the techniques and equipment we use every day in an effort to get them excited about science.
The next part of our community outreach was STEM camp at iGEM. This STEM camp was catered to deaf and hard of hearing high school students from around the state of Georgia. Our team was determined to not only teach the students but also to learn about how to make our lab more inclusive.
Finally, we moved our educational outreach to a more general audience by participating in Dragon Con. This event gave us an opportunity to interact with people outside of the lab, and without a science background.
These opportunities all helped shape our communication and education abilities, giving us perspective on including everyone in our lab. Our most influential activity this summer was hosting the STEM camp. We gained valuable perspective on how to open our lab up to everyone, especially the deaf and hard of hearing students. We hope that our efforts, as well as the efforts of all iGEM teams"
Rice,2016,Team:Rice#Humans Of Syn Bio_-_-_TEXT.html," the comparison simplifies the complexity of biology systems. One day I would like to be part of an innovative invention, one that can change the way we think, for example coding pictures, files, or any other data into bacteria’s DNA so we can get endless space to store data and a platform that won’t break over time — like today’s computers. And if there is one sentence that I can say to the public, I would say that synthetic biology is already very common, and there is no reason to fear the future; bacteria should be man’s second best friend!”"

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," switch based on the toxin-antitoxin system-mazEF- a natural                     toxin-antitoxin system found in E. coli. MazF is a stable toxin protein, and mazE is an unstable                     antitoxin protein [1]. When the bacteria are inhibited by environmental stress and the expression                     of mazEF is inhibited, the unstable antitoxin protein is preferentially degraded, and the relative                     content of the stable toxin protein increases to a certain extent, which will lead to the death of                     bacterial [2, 3]. The mRNA mediated by the cold-acting promoter CspA can only be efficiently                     translated at a low temperature of, for example, 16 ° C [4], so we use it to activate the                     expression of mazF at low temperatures. In this way, when the engineered bacteria leaves the                     intestine and enters the environment, it will be killed by our cold shock kill switch. In the                     future, we hope to integrate the genes contained in our system into the genome of engineered                     bacteria to provide genetic stability [5] and to avoid the use of plasmids with antibiotic genes.

This figure shows that E. coli JM109 (marA) cells that overexpress the marA product is more survived on 1.0 % geraniol solution overlay plates than the counterpart control E. coli JM109  wild type cells.
Fig. 9: Comparison of colony numbers after addition of 0.5 %( V/V) geraniol hexane solution (geraniol solution).
Time interval for treatment was set every 1 hour from 1 hour to 4 hours. A: E. coli JM109 (WT) + hexane; B: E. coli JM109 (marA) + hexane; C: E. coli JM109 (WT) + 0.5 % geraniol solution; D: E. coli JM109 (marA) + 0.5 % geraniol solution. As shown in Figs. 2 A and B, treatment with hexane of E. coli JM109 (WT) and of E. coli JM109 (marA) showed similar colony numbers during these treatment intervals to those of time zero. This result suggests that hexane at this concentration and duration of time for 4hours did not affect both cell growth. In contrast, treatment with geraniol of E. coli JM109 (WT) and of E. coli JM109 (marA) showed toxicities to both strains (Figs. 3 B, C and D). If we watch the colony numbers carefully, E. coli JM109 (marA) had more than E. coli JM109 (WT) during these treatment intervals ((Figs. 3 C and D). These results demonstrate that toxicity of the geraniol was less to the strain E. coli JM109 (marA) than the strain E. coli JM109 (WT)."
Lethbridge,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html," Biochemistry student Erin Kelly – have developed a new method of detecting hormones, and are in the process of patenting their idea.
Their proposed biomedical device technology is expected to bring next-generation hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.
Their idea and business plan recently landed them $10,000 as the first-place winners in the 2013 South Venture Business Plan Competition, and they are now looking to the next phase of the challenge – a trip to Edmonton in April to face off in the provincial arena, with even more money and networking opportunities on the table.
While he has to be a bit cautious about revealing details because of the patent process – an expected six to eight-month timeline -- Ward said their idea will significantly improve the way in which hormones are detected.
“Hormones – and hormone imbalances -- play very important roles in understanding behaviour and mental health, pregnancy as well as development and aging of all populations,” Ward said.
“We are pursuing new technology for the detection of hormones that provides rapid results that are 93 per cent more cost effective than traditional antibody technology.”
The team’s market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of this device will occur this summer at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience in collaboration with neuroscience researcher Dr. Gerlinde Metz.
Ward said the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
“The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,” Ward said.
“iGEM is run out of a student-operated lab provided by the department of Chemistry and Biochemistry here at the University of Lethbridge and coordinated by Dr. HJ Wieden. We have been encouraged at every turn by our professors and others to move this idea forward, especially by the people at Alberta Innovates -- Technology Futures (AITF) who promote entrepreneurial engagement from scientific innovation.”
Ward said the group will not just run off into the biomedical business world once the ink is dry on their patent documents -- they need to finish school first.
“Education is one of the team’s top values and we will be working on this business while we complete our degrees. This is a learning process that will, we hope, carry us far beyond the classroom, and we are very pleased to have received the South Venture prize, because otherwise it would not be possible for our company to pursue funding opportunities and further develop our project.”

As specific components wildly fluctuate in price and often go out of stock, we tried to use as many generic components as possible (the exceptions were the cuvette holder, the light sensor and the LEE filters swatch book). These components can be bought from any distributor, allowing  teams from across the world to build their own.
In a real-world environment using generic components would reduce production costs due to lower shipping costs by sourcing them from a nearby manufacturer and there is more competition amongst generic components. As such we can’t give direct purchasing links but you should be able to find them online easily.

From the perspective of GlycoWeb the optimistic outlook was to finish the week with a working website, capable of accepting a user defined list of sugar units and returning the appropriate expression enzymes. There exists a small probability that the website may even be hosted on the University of Exeter server by the end of the month!
Our Biologists and work experience student Chris have been busy doing science in the laboratories.
It’s at the end of this week we’ve said good-bye to Liam as he jets off to study his 3rd year in America! Freddie baked a lovely repressilator cake, as seen below (it tasted amazing!) and also brought in lots of American candy including delightful Twinkies something which this poor physicist hadn’t seen the likes of for many a year!
Sadly we won’t see Liam now until Christmas, unless of course the team make it to MIT in November..

NCTU_Formosa,2018,Team:NCTU Formosa#HumanPractice#Education_-_-_TEXT.html," workshop for National Taichung First Senior High School students. The workshop covered all the skills required to produce a successful iGEM project. Students were first introduced to the fundamentals of synthetic biology before getting hands-on practice by transforming GFP into E.coli. Finally, they learned how to properly research science topics by referencing published papers and visiting sites such as PubMed. At the end of the workshop, the students combined everything they’d learned into a presentation of a project that they brainstormed from beginning to end. The workshop seemed to pique an interest in synthetic biology in many of the students, and we sincerely hope they decide to continue pursuing this passion.
High School iGEM Introduction
National Luodong High School visited us over the summer to learn more about the iGEM competition. To start, we introduced the field of synthetic biology. We then presented some of NCTU_Formosa’s previous projects, such as Pantide and Parabase. The students left with a better understanding of what goes on in the field of synthetic biology as well as the competition.
60 th NCTU Campus Fair
During the school year activity our team participated in our school’s annual club fair. Our goal was to teach more people about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, as well as earn some money to spend towards our project. We sold popsicles and explained several previous NCTU projects to any willing listeners. By the end we managed to recruit a few members for next years team while netting a profit. It was quite a successful day!"

Proof of concept
Demonstrate your work
What is your chassis organism?
E. coli K-12 JM109, DH5α, BL21
Do you plan to experiment with any other organisms, besides your chassis?
In our project, we will make a food preservation box with antibacterial fragrances such as geraniol and farnesol that are produced by engineered E. coli. To assess an effect of antibacterial fragrances against microorganisms, we utilize and Bacillus subtilis var. natto as well as E. coli.
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
The marA activating AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, also efflux antibiotics from engineered E. coli, resulting more resistance of the engineered E. coli to antibiotics. Because the host E. coli has no toxic to human, there may be no risk to human safety. All engineered E. coli have been sterilized by autoclave sterilization. We use hexane to dilute geraniol and farnesol and use decane to collect antibacterial fragrances from E. coli culture. Hexane and decane are flammable. These solvents are not used beside the fire. We have worn rubber gloves and have sterilized all wastes to reduce the risks, including safety level 1 procedures.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
The food preservation box have the risk that the engineered organisms grow in food. We must need to separate them from food area by packing or separating with membrane filters that the engineered organisms cannot pass through. Only fragrances should be dispersed into food area. This approach will decrease the risk of food contamination by engineered organisms. In our project, we have used E. coli JM109 strain, a derivative of E. coli K-12 strain encoding auxotrophy"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," model more accurate, especially for the lower miRNA concentrations we decreased kopen to 105, the lowest possible value in our range.
Another way to improve the lower miRNA concentrations was increasing the decay rate of just the miRNA. We had assumed it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in our system. Increasing just the miRNA decay rate had similar effect to decreasing kopen.
With our initial parameters our model was a poor representation of our system. Once we updated our parameters, it was able to represent our results relatively well.
Stochastic model
The Oxford iGEM team kindly ran stochastic simulations of system for us. They ran both intrinsic and extrinsic simulations and provided us with the final uncertainties.
Intrinsic Simulation
Intrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty caused by the changes in reaction rate due to the fact reactants collide randomly. This is more accurate than mass action kinetics for low reactant concentrations.
For our stochastic simulation, each time step a reaction rate was determined randomly using the Poisson distribution. As this is random, multiple stochastic simulations have to be run for a large enough sample size. A time step of 0.01 seconds was used.
The intrinsic simulations gave an uncertainty of only 0.0096%. This validated our use of mass action kinetics to model our system. As the intrinsic uncertainty is negligible we could assume rate of reaction was proportional to concentration of the reactants, i.e. the law of mass action.
While we later updated the parameters with our experimental data, the concentration of reactants did not decrease to invalidate this result.
Extrinsic Simulation
Extrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty cause by the uncertainty of our parameters. The extrinsic uncertainty is by far the more significant of the two uncertainties in our model.
The extrinsic simulation assumes our parameters were normally distributed and runs multiple simulations randomly choosing parameter values.
The specific conclusions of our extrinsic simulations, such as the test being complete in 37 minutes in 90% of cases, are unfortunately no longer useful after our experimental results showed some of our starting parameters were significantly off. However, the extrinsic simulation demonstrated that biggest weakness with our model was our parameter's uncertainties.
Cost model
There's two parts to our cost modeling; the cost analysis which works out the cost of the test, and the much more impressive screening cost-effectiveness model that works out the value of rolling out a screening programme.
Our screening programme's cost per quality year of life gained would be just be £8300 at the current lowest threshold for lung cancer screening, and taking into account cancer recurrence. Treatments under £20,000 per quality year"

Fig.2 The object to be tested changes the orientations of the liquid                                     crystal alignment
Results and outlook
Based on the above principles and design, we firstly verified that there was a significant                         correlation between the liquid crystal brightness and the concentration of fixed mountain 2M,                         and through the optimization of the parameters of the detection system, the liquid crystal                         brightness changed significantly when the antigen concentration was 150ng/mL-400ng/mL. In                         addition, the antibody with long chain modification is selected for detection, and the                         brightness changes of the liquid crystal are more obvious, which can achieve the purpose of                         effective and reliable detection.
At the same time, we designed a test box of 5cm × 5cm × 10cm to demonstrate our product. The                         short-term goal of this project is to make the patients in the home use of our test kits, only                         need to add a drop of urine and auxiliary drops wait for a period of time after taking a                         picture, can intuitive understanding to your beta 2 m concentration in the urine and kidney                         function, when he will photos uploaded to the mobile terminal, can generate individualized                         treatment guidelines.
Of course, we have a better idea. We can use this test to determine a variety of proteins. After                         all, there are many diseases that require more accurate diagnosis using one or a series of                         proteins in urine or blood. For example, AD7c-ntp in urine can be used as an indicator of                         alzheimer's disease. The index of coronary heart disease is 15 kinds of urine polypeptide                         combination. To do this we simply need to design a new type of 96-well plate that imparts                         different antigens to the substrate to enable the determination of multiple proteins and even                         proteomics.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

As control, to prove that H2O2 has effect on the K079050, one sample of the same culture was diluted in 5ml LB medium with antibiotic without H2O2.  Additionally, to demonstrate that H202 induction has not interferences with the LacI regulated promoter we also tested the K079029 (Figure 6) that was grown in the LB medium with 2.2mM of H2O2.
Figure 6. K079029 GFP expression controlled by LacI repressor under the J23114 promoter
Tubes were kept to the dark by using silver paper and let them growing for 2 hours at 37°C.  1 ml of bacteria sample has been collected and transferred inside 1ml tube and  spinned at 6000-8000 rpm for 3 minutes. The supernatant was discard and the pellet  resuspended. Slides were prepared for the fluorescence bacteria image acquisition that were elaborated with the Visual Fluo Bacteria Software .
Figure 7. K079050 with H2O2
Figure 8. K079050 without H2O2
Figure 9. K079029 with H2O2
It is possible to see that GFP is sinthetized only in the construct with Lex A operator. In addition to prove that K079050 construct can be used in the Flip-Flop circuit without interference with IPTG,  we induced both K079050 and K079029 as positive control for 2 hours with 1mM of IPTG.
Figure 10. K079029 induced by IPTG
Figure 11. K079050 induced by IPTG
As expected IPTG was not able to induce the construct with Lex A operator but it induced  the circuit  with LacI repressed promoter. We conclude that H2O2 induction gives an uniform activity of the regulator promoter (J23100) and the level of promoter activity can be used to set ON the memory.

Public presentation
One of the most important tasks in iGEM competition is human practice. This task aimed to let more people in different fields to synthetic biology and iGEM.
We paid much effort to human practices. During the workshop, we explained thorough detail of our project to many visitors including a museum staff who presented all projects on the museum website for online visitors. Many of the attendees have no background in biology, thereby we used the simplest way to introduce synthetic biology and show our project. Additionally, we gave an academic presentation to an expert from Fudan University. He was very drawn to the ribosome meter and predicted that this technology would have a huge application. During workshop, we were surprised to find that a little child was able to participate in the NYU-Shanghai exhibition. Giving education to next generation may be the best way to resolve the issue of global warming.

您在这份调查之前是否听说过合成生物学的概念？
iGEM competition is an annual, world wide, synthetic biology event. This question is aimed to find whether synthetic biology is well-known in China or not and let more people know about this field. According to this result, only a quarter of people heard about bio-synthesis before our survey. Over a half of people did not know about synthetic biology before. Also, 16 people were not sure that they had a clear idea about synthetic biology. We considered that most of people did not have biological background. Furthermore, industries that are working on bio-synthesis have just been developed recently in China so it is not popular right now. Therefore, we should provide some associated information for public. If people chose ‘B’ and ‘C’, the definition of synthetic biology would be displayed. Additionally, we found that they were also willing to search synthetic biology on internet and wanted to learn more about this novel field>

Chemotherapy treatment costs 5-6k RMB (around 890$) each time, and interventional treatment charges the same. Medicare reimbursement for cancer patients covers about 50% of the expense, including repayment for about 90% of drugs costs, but this does not include imported drugs or molecular targeted drugs.
Mr. Zheng also had a good knowledge of gene therapy and other new therapies. From the perspective of patient and his family, gene therapy in Japan is currently more advanced and developed, including a relatively well-known therapy called AK therapy. The patient told us that, molecular targeted therapy treatment can cost hundreds of thousands RMB per years. Molecular targeted drug costs as high as 20 thousands RMB (30,000$) per month. Added with fees of chemotherapy and infusion of nutritional supplement, the monthly treatment will be costing at least 30 thousand (4,500$) RMB. Therefore, Mr. Zheng cannot afford the treating charges, although he believes that treatment consisting of chemotherapy controling the disease and targeted drugs is ideal.
At present, the unaffordable price of molecular targeted drugs still block the way towards actual clinical use.
Ms. Meng (30-year-old)      Gastric cancer sufferer
Several months ago, Ms. Meng felt stomach pain very occasionally, but she thought it was just a small stomach problem. Until an examination in May 23rd, 2016, Ms. Meng was told that it was gastric cancer. So far she has been treated for nearly half a year.
Now Ms. Meng mainly takes the treatment of chemotherapy combined with medicine taken orally. Her treatment period is 3 days chemical injection every 24 days and her temporary treatment cost is about 20k RMB (3,000$) as she has just started chemotherapy. Ms. Meng quitted her own work, and her husband frequently ask for time off work to take care of her. Currently the treatment cost has became a massive burden for her family. At present, the main side effects of chemotherapy on Ms. Meng is nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite etc..
Since Ms. Meng hasn’t been treated for a long time, she did not know much about the updating treatment method specifically. As for the molecular targeted therapy, she has only heard of it. Ms. Meng decided to follow the doctor's suggestions. If the doctor considers her suitable for molecular targeted therapy, Ms. Meng will be really willing to try the new drug.

Protein expression output
As mentioned in assumption, we assume that two colors that are equally distant in the color space are equally different in the amount of fluorescent protein, which means relationship between the RGB values and required protein quantity can be characterized by a linear function.
We believe the Hill function can describe the ligand-binding situation in our light-sensing system by determining the degree of cooperativeness of the ligand binding to receptors. This has also been demonstrated in previous papers.
P=b+(aI^n)/(I^n+k^n )
I-light intensity.
P-protein quantity produced by sensing light.
For red and blue sensor, required light intensity is thus
Ig=k(a/(P-b)-1)^((-1)/n)
Ib=k(a/(P-b)-1)^((-1)/n)
However the green sensor needs to grow under red light to perform a similar response as the red one.
For green sensor
Ir=k(a/(P-b)-1)^((-1)/n)+r0

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM Team
We have been working with the University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM Team on the curriculum development aspects involved in both of our projects. Their project focuses on producing a cell-free system that would be used as a teaching tool in high schools. As both of our teams need research completed on curriculum development, collaboration is the perfect idea. Research done by both teams was shared with each other. For example, a team member from the Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM Team interviewed a group of science teachers from Winston Churchill High School for further opinions and suggestions on integrating another scientific component to the curriculum. This interview expanded to include a member from our team as well. Members of our team also reviewed the education modules that they developed. Another aspect in this collaboration includes having our team act as a practice audience for a project presentation from the collegiate team, to evaluate our level of understanding of their project. Their team also attended meetings of ours to provide feedback on our presentation prior to two competitions this season. In addition to this, members of their team have been mentoring us in lab work, and coding, and have also provided general guidance during team meetings as advisers to the team.  Their team also tested our melanin construct (BBa_ K281401) using the PURExpress system to see if it could be successfully produced. This helped provide further characterization of the part. As the collegiate iGEM Team's project focuses on creating a cell-free system, their system should be able to produce pigment as well.

For Snip Equip Flip to be fully implemented within a PNC-based delivery system, the donor DNA and integrating plasmid would also need to be co-encapsulated. Although several ideas were discussed for implementing such functionality, the development of those designs was decided to be beyond the scope of respective projects.
After leaving the Kickoff with renewed excitement for the collaboration, the teams went forward to plan the scope and details of their collaboration. It was then decided that P22 PNCs would be most suitable, and work proceeded in Lethbridge to prepare the Cas9-P22 scaffold fusion and P22 capsid vectors. An sgRNA generator, customized with Calgary's Cas9 target sequence, was also assembled. After meeting again at aGEM in late September, the Lethbridge team worked tirelessly to send purified proteins to Calgary. While the results are not ready for presentation on the wiki, both the Calgary and Lethbridge teams are hopeful that results will be prepared for presentation at the jamboree. Stay tuned!
Queens Canada
As a fellow Canadian team, we hoped for an ongoing relationship with the Queens Canada iGEM team . Coincidentally, both members of the uCalgary team and the Queens team were also participating in a second research competition called the Canada Reduced Gravity Experiment (Can-RGX). Can-RGX is a nationwide competition wherein four collegiate teams were selected to prototype and test an experiment in micro-gravity through parabolic flight. Through Can-RGX, relationships were formed very early in the year between members of both teams, which continued to pay dividends for the remainder of the summer.
Cooperative planning and troubleshooting was performed throughout various meetings, both in person and over Skype. Topics such as the acquisition of funding, the ordering of complex DNA parts, and opportunities to take advantage of were shared and debated. The Queens Canada team alerted us to a promotion offered by Genscript which provided free DNA fragment synthesis, which proved integral to our project design. They also provided advice on re-designing DNA fragments which were too problematic to synthesize as single strands, aiding us in getting the ball rolling with our wet lab research. It was rewarding and refreshing to have a cooperative team with which we shared a running conversation and friendship, even for the simple ups and downs of undergraduate research.

Design
The main target in our project is to insert the sequences into the E.coli which serve the functions of both timer and bacteria counter. Once we turn on the device, the medium will become green. Afterwards, when the time is up or the concentration of bacteria invaded rises to a certain level, the medium will turn from green to red.
The whole reaction can be divided into three stages:
Standby: The E.coli only grow but other specific metabolism is excluded.
Lactose-accession: The lactose is added and the timer and the counter functions started.
Lactose-consumption: When the lactose consumes or that the amount of the bacteria invaded is large enough, the alarm                                         system starts and the E.coli suicide later.
(1) The Switch and The Input
The lacI operon serves as the switch of our project, and lactose works as the starting signal. At the beginning, the constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23106 ) unceasingly produces the LacI protein (BBa_C0012), which represses the LacI promoter ( BBa_R0010 ). When fixed amount of lactose is added, the lactose-lacI complex releases from the promoter and causes the transcription and the translation of downstream sequences begin.
(2) The Timer
Within the reaction, the lactose degrades by a constant rate. The promoter sequence will be repressed again while the concentration of the lactose is getting low enough. That is, to fulfill the timer function, we can control the reaction time by controlling the amount of lactose.
(3) Output
We use the green fluorescence protein (GFP) ( BBa_K145015 ) and the red fluorescence protein (RFP) ( BBa_K145150 )as the output signal. The green indicates “on”, whereas red indicates “off”.
We insert a part of sequence which encodes the GFP downstream the LacI-repressed promoter ( BBa_R0011 ). When switched on, the promoter starts translating and directly lead to the appearance of the green color. Moreover, the promoter would indirectly lead to the appearance of"

Introduction
Our modeling part consists of two main parts:
The mathematical modeling of virus production and infection based on a model of ordinary differential equations (ODE).
The modeling of the three dimensional structure of the virus capsid based on X-ray crystallography data.
The first model describes the dynamic behavior of the virus production in terms of the law of mass action (Sidorenko & Reichl 2004). Therefore the temporal changes in concentrations of titrated plasmids, synthesized proteins, replicated single-stranded DNA and formed virus capsids and finally concentration of viral particles are simulated using MathWorks® MATLAB R2010b.
Virus infection is modeled in a similar way but receptor binding has to be considered (Gurevich 2004). Starting with a given concentration of infectious virus particles, complexes with dimerized receptors emerge which can be internalized to the cytoplasm and transduction takes place.
The third part follows a different approach: X-ray crystallography data (Xie et al. 2002) has been used to reproduce the three dimensional structure of the virus. The resulting 3D visualization is obtained by using the open source software PyMOL (Schrödinger 2010).

ULB-Brussels,2009,Team:ULB-Brussels#Project#Biological_-_-_TEXT.html," above we also added a Lux box promoter (BBa R0062).
The second plasmid contains a very strong promoter controlled by the CI434 repressor (BBa R0052). This promoter controls the expression of the c2 P22 repressor gene included in the c2 P22 generator (BBa P0153 ). In that way, if there is IPTG, there will be no c2 P22.
The third plasmid includes a hybrid promoter (BBa K145150) consisting of the lux box and binding sites for c2 P22. Transcription from this promoter can be activated by a LuxR-HSL complex and repressed by c2 P22. The downstream gene codes for the LuxR protein (BBa I0462) which can sense 3OC6HSL ( Appendix ). When there is IPTG, as there is no c2 P22, the LuxR protein is therefore synthesized at a low rate, the quorum sensing takes place and enhances itself.
The fourth plasmid includes the same hybrid promoter (BBa K145150) and the LuxI generator (BBa K092400) that allows the synthesis of 3OC6. As well as the LuxR protein, this occurs after activation by the presence of IPTG.
The glue device itself is also under control of the hybrid promoter (BBa K145150) and allows the expression of hfsG (a glycosyltransferase) and hfsH (a polysaccharide deacetylase) genes and the toxin parE.
This circuit remains theoretical. The mathematical model is discussed in the section ""Mathematical modeling"".
Further, another aspect we should bear in mind is what would happen if the bacteria do not reach the target. A solution involving the synthesis of a toxin ""after a while"" should be considered.
Circuit validation
In order to validate experimentally our biological circuit and to characterize some of its parameters, some tests should be carried out. We divided the circuit in different parts.
Circuit I
This circuit (Experimental model:Construction : Bba R0011+BBa P0152 ; Part: BBa R10522 + Part: BBa E0240 ( see figure below) allows us to characterize and verify the performance of the C0056 inhibitor. For this purpose the C0053 gene needs to be substituted by a GFP.  Without IPTG no fluorescence should be detected. Chemical kinetics illustrating the fluorescence rate should be measured after adding IPTG to the substrate.

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"XP218-Cup1
Compared to other model organisms, yeast is underrepresented in the iGEM registries. As our biobrick contribution, we characterized the ADH1 promoter. We also characterized the promoters Gal1 and Cup1 as controls against which we could compare our experiments. A high copy number plasmid was used in this case (compared to the low copy Hsp104 plasmid) to maximize the promoter activity for quantification.
Cup 1 is a positively regulated promoter (induced with copper) found on the Sup35 plasmid [BB8]. It is less leaky than other inducible promoters which makes it useful for the study of Sup35, allowing us to control for the amount of Sup35 in the cell to see how the PSI+ state causes further misfolding of Sup35. Characterization of this promoter was therefore important for quantification of the prion response.

Dual Coloured Reporter Plasmid
This part is a composite of an RFP gene and a GFP gene from the previously made BioBricks: BBa_I20260 and BBa_J04450, respectively. It can be used in CRISPRi experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of sgRNA-Cas9 targeting. It can also be used for other gene expression suppression systems to provide quantitative feedback and data. It has been characterized using flow cytometry to demonstrate the expression of both RFP and GFP proteins. Further characterization of this part being used in a CRISPRi system can be found with the BBa_K1645998 BioBrick.
We performed a simple experiment to demonstrate that both genes in this part are properly expressed. We aim to compare their relative fluorescence to each other, and demonstrate their usability in a more complex system with CRISPRi (found in the characterization of BBa_K1645999).
To produce the data, we inoculated the appropriate E. coli culture into LB and grew it for 12hr at 37 degrees Celsius on a shaker at 200RPM. We diluted the culture four-fold into chilled formalin (1X PBS, 4% formaldehyde, 1.5% methanol). We used flow cytometry (Aminis ImageStream MKII) to run a sample and detected fluorescence using an excitation laser wavelength of 488nm at 200mW, as well as SSC at 1.5mW.

In the same sense, they did not consider biologically synthesized drugs a different issue than GM food.
On the opposite, the respondents who answered that GMOs are harmful to health and the environment, charts 3 and 4, said they would not trust a product synthesized by a GMO and if these products were labeled as GMOs, they would not by them. Similarly they did consider biologically synthesized drugs a different issue than GM food, responding that drugs and pharmaceuticals were even riskier than food products.
In between, the rest of the respondents who had a neutral attitude towards GMOs, presented in chart 6, had a balanced position on those questions, saying that while they do not know if they would trust biologically synthesized adrenaline, most of them would buy products labeled as GMOs and they do not consider biologically synthesized drugs a different issue than GM food. The majority of all respondents considered it would be best to label GMO products and they already knew that several products are produced by GMOs or are GMOs themselves.
From the results of our survey, we can infer that those who do not consider GMOs as harmful also do not fear them. Considering that a majority of respondents in our survey are students who have a medium (37%) or high (44%) level of knowledge in biology, we can also suggest that those who are educated on that matter do not fear the resulting technologies of that field.
Another survey of public attitudes regarding synthetic biology found that nearly two-thirds of respondents supported continued development of the field, including additional research on its possible effects on humans and the environment[31].  There was a strong correlation between self-reported awareness of synthetic biology and support for ongoing research, as 80% of those who had heard a lot about the field believed it should move forward, compared to only 52% of those who had heard nothing about it. Overall, 73% of those surveyed reported having heard “just a little” or “nothing at all” about synthetic biology. These data indicate both the need for broader public engagement regarding synthetic biology and the positive impact of such efforts on public support for novel technologies.
In another vein, there are oppositions to synthetic biology that come from important areas of religions and ethics. Unlike the debate regarding human embryonic stem cell research, the Catholic Church does not oppose synthetic biology. Following the publication of a paper from the J. Craig Venter"

Public engagement includes taking our science out of the lab, and into the hands of common people. To present our concepts to school students, we arranged a presentation for a group from a school for underprivileged students from Kolhapur city. We gave them a brief introduction to biotechnology, synthetic biology and iGEM. We also explained simple concepts like transformation and cloning and showed them our petri plates with RFP transformed colonies.
We demonstrated how to use your phone camera and a drop of water to make a simple microscope, as well as how to use a Fold-Scope, which is an inexpensive and easy-to-handle substitute for simple microscope.
We also gave a presentation to a group of students from prominent Junior colleges and high schools in Pune city about synthetic biology and iGEM. We also presented some of our work related to the Hijack module to them ( modelling as well as lab work). We showed them our iGEM lab and showed them different equipments that we use including the laminar hood, the PCR machine, incubator ,gel electrophoresis station. They were fascinated to see all the machines which they had only heard of or read about in textbooks.
To reach a wider audience and facilitate easy exchange of ideas, we hosted an all-India iGEM meet-up in July 2017. 9/10 Indian IGEM teams attended this meet-up, while IGEM team Peshawar joined the conference via skype. Our audience consisted professors, students from our institutes and members of other iGEM teams. We introduced iGEM, synthetic biology, and the concept of open source biology. Each team presented their project concepts while the audience participated in troubleshooting and strengthening of concepts. We arranged public lectures by Dr. Sanjeev Galande, Dr. Nishad Matange, Dr. Sandeep Krishna and Robert Ramirez Garcia, a former iGEMer from Team Avery, France, where we discussed different topics like research in biology, open source biology, modelling and experiments in biology.The entire"

Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at John Hopkins University
On July 16, 2017, thanks to the help of a senior NYMU-Taipei team participant, we contacted a Ph.D. student from Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at John Hopkins University, Chien Ting Li. Through Skype webcam, we discussed our project with him, including experimental design, theoretical mechanism, and the follow-up application. Chien Ting also shared with us how academics and industries in the US view biomass energy, and how we can improve our co-culture system and simulation model. This exchange was inspirational and fruitful, and we really appreciated that Chien Ting pointed out what we missed in the process of brainstorming."

Plated them out and put in the incubator around.  Split each plate into halves.  On one half, used 10 uL of transformation liquid.  On the other, used 100 uL of transformation liquid.
Also, since there was contamination in the LB + AMP control from last night, we decided to throw out the overnight cultures for pRS303, pRS425, and GPD.  We innoculated fresh cultures  (30 mL of each) and put them in the shaking incubator around .
Received a response email from Dr. David Drubin at Harvard, who was co-author with Dr. Caroline Ajo-Franklin on the paper detailing the memory device.  He indicated that they had more intermediates that we could consider using.  This would include a biofusion version of CFP.  Will ask him if he has a list of parts that we could look at.

Mission Statement
The ultimate goal of the University of Illinois 2012 iGEM team is to construct an RNA-based PUF protein toolkit which can be utilized for the manipulation of gene expression. Customizable manipulation will involve gene silencing by specific RNA scission. Also, the PUF protein's properties are suited for optimizing multi-step enzymatic pathways. In this way, we aim to improve the versatility and cost efficiency of biological production systems. With a protein-based RNA-binding toolkit, researchers will be able to transmute the biobricked PUF for use in their scientific endeavors. In addition, we seek to standardize and characterize the nature of PUF.

Our Research Outside of PUF Itself
Aside from researching the RNA specific affinity of PUF and its endonuclease fusion protein variants, we have also explored and tested other potential applications for PUF. Mainly, our ancillary projects directly related to PUF include our RNA scaffold and an enzymatic assembly line based on such a scaffold. Additionally, we have characterized the 2011 University of Washington iGEM team's Petrobrick (BBa_K590025) .
Outside the dry and wet labs, we have invested ourselves in a human practices project and public awareness and education about synthetic biology and science in general. To learn more, please visit our Outreach section .

Enzymatic Assembly Line
In utilizing the versatility of the PUF based toolkit we are developing, our current research involves an engineered metabolic pathway. The characterization and standardization of these genes in biobrick format is underway. Future goals involving the PUF toolkit will focus on tethering enzymes of productive artificial or natural pathways for kinetic favorability.

This creates the potential for it to produce everything from the exterior of the habitat to the softer interior products such as furniture and clothes. And as long as you have a few dormant spores, you can continue to grow more materials by simply activating them with sufficient oxygen and nutrients.
Stanford Brown RISD's proposed Mars Habitat, made of mycelium that is grown within a light-weight mold. Rendering by team member Emilia Mann.
The versatility of mycelium as a material, and its self-growing abilities, paired with the fact it is completely biodegradable, means it has the potential to completely revolutionize the housing and manufacturing industries on earth. With a few modifications, our habitat design could be brought to earth to build eco-friendly houses that require minimal effort to assemble. We also took advantage of these properties in the creation of products beyond our habitat – creating furniture items and filters. These prototypes created in our lab, most notably our stool (see images below) demonstrate the potential for its use on and off planet, as an alternative, eco-friendly alternative to plastics and other soft goods. To see more about our research of the industrial potential of this material visit our human practices page with the section “Sustainable Industrial Design”.

Overview
Although the science is an integral part of our project, we put some emphasis on human practices as well. Every team member contributed so that we could have a diverse and engaging set of human practices. We reached out many individuals, including one of our MLAs, who is also the Minister of Environment to get her support of our project; rural beekeepers in Southern Alberta to ask about the viability of our project; we also talked to our city council, and an urban planner to see how we could make our city more “bee-friendly”. We interacted with the public by handing out seed packets in parks, and informing them about the decline of bees and the city by-law that makes urban bee-keeping illegal; many signed a petition that we created to remove this by-law. To promote iGEM, we went to two middle schools to tell the students a little bit about our project and what iGEM is.
Government
Meeting with MLA—Shannon Phillips
City Council By-Law
Prior to 1983, residents of the City of Lethbridge were able to beekeep within city limits. However, an amendment to Bylaw 3383 that pertains to bees now prevents residents from being able to do so. In Southern Alberta, bee populations are currently decreasing with reports saying that North American beekeepers are losing approximately one third of their bees each year. As a way to help the bee population, our team made it a goal to try and have this bylaw amended to allow urban beekeeping within city limits.
Community
Seed bombs
We made seed bombs to help spread awareness about the decline of bees, while simultaneously promoting bee population growth. A seed bomb is basically a ball of soil, clay, water, and seeds. The idea is that people plant them in empty lots, undeveloped fields, or even their backyards so that flowers can grow, giving the bees more access to food. We used Smooth Blue Aster, Purple Prairie Clover, and Prairie Coneflower to make our seed bombs because they are native to Southern Alberta, and they would not be considered an invasive species.
We distributed seed bombs to members of the public and informed them"

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Techniques_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Because there will be more reactions than metabolites in any realistic large-scale metabolic model, there is no unique solution to this system of equations (there are more unknown variables than equations). The set of possible solutions to the system of equations (2) is called the solution space. We can make the solution space smaller by imposing constraints on the system. For instance, we can constrain the maximum or minimum allowable flux of a certain reaction. However, generally the solution space consists of multiple solutions.
To obtain a solution, the FBA method maximizes or minimizes an objective function Z, which is defined by the user. The objective function can be any linear combination of fluxes. The resulting system of equations with constraints and an objective function is optimized by a linear programming algorithm, and a solution is obtained. Still, the solution space can consist of multiple solutions. In this case, the linear programming algorithm will choose one particular solution. The multiple solutions can be explored by using Flux Variability Analysis (FVA), as we will do for our project. [1]
The fact that the solution is at steady state means that the FBA method is not suitable for investigating the changing behaviour of a system over time. However, it is very useful for obtaining insight in often very complex metabolic networks. For our project, we will apply the FBA method to the extracellular electron transport (EET) module . Our goal is to gain insight in the carbon metabolism providing the electrons for our EET module. The results of this analysis can be found in Flux Balance Analysis .
Percolation Theory
Percolation theory is a mathematical theory that describes randomly placed connections in latices [2]. It finds many applications in real world problems. One example where percolation theory is applied is in the spread of forest fires. Imagine a field that contains a large grid, like a chess board. Each of the squares can contain a tree. The chance that a square has a tree is \( \ p \). Say that there is someone who throws away his burning cigarette and a tree catches fire. Say that this burning tree will also ignite its direct neighbors in all possible directions. At chance p, what is the probability that a path of burning trees exists that connects two opposite sides of the forest. Percolation theory says that when the field is infinitely big, ie. it has infinitely many squares, there will always be a path of burning trees that connects the two opposite sides when \( \ p > \ 0.5 \). Below this particular value of p, no such path will exist. \( \  p = \ 0.5\"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Software
The Constructor was created with the intention of supporting the complete iGEM community. Our vision of synthetic biology is that the fields of software development and wet-lab ultimately work together. However, in the iGEM competition there is a distinct line between the software development and the experimental aspects blocking the synergy between both fields. Teams are therefore not able to contribute in both fields as one team, without being excluded from special prizes from other tracks.
Due to the fact that the Wageningen University's budget was only sufficient for one iGEM Team we planned to support the software development within the wet-lab group. This led to the creation of a web-application that advises the user with the selection of BioBricks to develop their desired construct.
We have aimed for the highest iGEM quality level for our software, and therefore we aimed at satisfying all medal criteria as well as the criteria for special prizes available within the software track.
The Constructor
In the field of synthetic biology, engineering principles are combined with molecular biology. To construct parts, a repository is required and for the iGEM teams, The Registry of Standard Biological Parts is such a repository.
In 2011 an attempt was made to develop an application for the construction of parts from The Registry of Standard Biological Parts. This application was functional, however it"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectModeling_-_-_TEXT.html," we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
What are special reactions and How to handle with them?
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions (RNA polymerase are ignored). The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
What are differences from single compartment to multi-compartment?
Consider an example first. AHL molecules outside diffuse into E.coli cells with rate k1, while AHL molecules inside E.coli cells diffuse outward and enter into the bio-reactor with rate k2. We assume diffusion reactions are all driven by concentration gradient.
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
Chains in our Chain-Node Model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those with definite structure.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: Compare first the partReference and partType defined in database of the first part of two chains in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or the end of either chain. Meanwhile, a part in bound and unbound state(这里多了半句？)

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today, the plate will be checked for the presence of colonies.  If they are present, then a liquid culture will be started in order to grow more of the Yeate’s bacterial strain.  Aliquots will be taken and glycerol stocks will be made for use in the future.  In addition, colony PCR may be done in order to verify that the plasmid of interest is still in the bacteria that grew.
There were colonies on the plates!
Observation:  Much of the colonies were lawns, as the entire tube was used to plate yesterday.  There were several individual colonies that grew from the later streaks.
Notes for growing E. coli from Qiagen website:
Growth of E. coli strains
Good microbiological technique will always ensure the best yield and quality of plasmid DNA. To prepare the perfect bacterial culture for your plasmid prep, follow the steps below.
1. Prepare a starter culture by inoculating a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate into 2–10 ml LB (Luria-Bertani) medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. Grow at 37°C for ~8 hours (logarithmic growth phase) with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm).
Tip: Do not inoculate directly from glycerol stocks, agar stabs, or plates that have been stored for a long time, as this may lead to loss or mutation of the plasmid.
Tip: It is often convenient to grow the starter culture during the day so that the larger culture can be grown overnight for harvesting the following morning.
2. Dilute the starter culture 1/500 to 1/1000 into a larger volume of selective LB medium, as indicated in the appropriate plasmid purification protocol.
Use a flask of at least 4 times the volume of culture to ensure sufficient aeration.  Do not use a larger culture volume than recommended in the protocol, as this will result in inefficient lysis and reduce the quality of the preparation.

dCas9-\(\omega\) and dCas9-VP64 structures
It is often important to visualize proteins, as their 3-D structure can give information about functionality. Unfortunately, a PDB (Protein Data Bank, [17]) file for dCas9-\(\omega\) or dCas9-VP64 is not available as X-ray crystallography data on this protein are lacking. However, it is possible to extract the \(\omega\) subunit directly from the RNA polymerase (RNAP) and align it with the dCas9 protein structure.
We will focus here on dCas9-\(\omega\), as for dCas9-VP64 the same conclusions hold. All manipulations are performed with the VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics, [18]) software and final images are rendered with Pixar's RenderMan rendering engine. We extracted the \(\omega\) subunit from the E. coli RNA polymerase (PDB 3LU0, [19]). This subunit is then aligned to the dCas9 protein (PDB 4ZT9, [20]) in order to keep the continuity on the DNA sequence. This means that the subunit is placed at the right place with respect do dCas9, but its orientation may be wrong.
dCas9-\(\omega\) structure with gRNA. In grey we have dCas9, in red the gRNA scaffold, in blue the gRNA 20bp specificity determinant sequence and in green the \(\omega\) RNAP subunit.
From the protein structure we can estimate the size of dCas9 on the DNA: the length along the direction of the DNA binding site is approximately 80 Å. In E. coli the distance between the activating and inhibiting sequences is of 33bp or 37bp (remember, we have two possible inhibiting sites), while in S. cerevisiae  this distance is of 67bp. Now the length of double stranded DNA is of 3.1 Å per base [22], therefore the distance between the activating and inhibiting sites in E. coli spans from 102 Å to 115 Å while in S. cerevisiae it is 208 Å.
As activating and inhibiting sites are 20bp long (62 Å), we see that in E. coli the dCas9-gRNA targeting of one site is not necessarily independent of"

Successfully transformed cells with LITMUS28i (probably with dCas9 and gRNA with anti-luxS) The concentrations of the fragments of mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3 were too low (negative values)… L2 may be the correct Gibson assembled phagemid. However, there is an extra segment with a length approx. 6000 bp. Probably, the enzymatic activity of AlwNI is slower compared to EcoRI and PstI, hence some fragments were not cut by AlwNI. In order to verify this, another sample of L2 was cut with AlwNI and EcoRI and incubated overnight at 37℃.

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," tube. Hopefully, this should allow the vet to take a blood sample as normal, but also ensure the cell free kit isn’t saturated with blood.
Design 4 - More Suggestions
The membrane in design 3 was selected such that it would allow a certain volume of blood to flow through it and into the cell free system. However after consulting with various advisors we realised this would either be very expensive or not even possible.
Upon speaking to Prof Peter Winlove, professor of Physics at our university, although initially impressed with the idea he again reinforced the above opinion. However he proposed a solution to the problem, by changing the membrane to a pore then using hydrostatic pressure it should also only let a certain volume through.
Below is the maths used to calculate the necessary parameters to make sure that the required amount of blood (ΔV) flows through into the cell free kit.
The top of a Vacutainer
showing the material
proposed for use in the
membrane.
ViPi = VfPf
Vf = Vi - ΔV
Pf = Pi + ρgh
(Pi + ρgh)(Vi - ΔV) = PiVi
He also mentioned that we would need to have an anticoagulant to prevent the blood from clotting during the test. He informed us that we could purchase tubes with this already in them, hence simplifying the whole process as we could just purchase these.
Another thought proposed by our very own team member Joe was to use a membrane based system as described above. However we would design it so it was made of a similar material to lid of the Vacutainer. Then by training the vet to insert the needle through both the lid and the membrane letting only a few drops though first in the cell free kit, pulling the needle back into the top chamber to release the remainder of the blood. This prevents saturation of the cell free kit and provides a low tech, low cost solution to the problem form design 3.
The Current Methods and Their Limitations
The final prototype of our bTB test has been honed and revised several times as we considered the practicalities of TB testing for the vet performing the test. We took in to account advice from vets local to South West England (namely Phil Leighton and Dick Sibley) and incorporated this into our prototype design. This allowed the design to ‘evolve’ and advance; we now have a final prototype which should maximise the ease of testing and minimise any error in the testing.
Firstly we had to consider where we would take the testing sample from. The current skin test"
Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Practices#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html," small populations, yet sit at the table with the devolved administrations and the UK government as equals. It’s similar to the European Union (EU) inter-governmental system, the big decisions are taken in the council, by the member state governments, and they each have permanent representation in Brussels, and civil servants who are working there all the time. The UK has about 200 civil servants looking after its interests in the EU, maybe not as much as that, Ireland is a small country around a tenth the size of the UK, maybe less, it has about 100 civil servants working in Europe. What I’m saying is that there are other models of co-operation that don’t involve you having to send your MPs to Westminster, where we are always outvoted, and where we get governments we didn’t elect.
A: How would it work with Scotland becoming independent and having to join the EU again?
JE: That has been an issue of some contention; some people have said that because we would be an applicant nation, we would have to take our place at the end of the queue. I don’t think that that is realistic. Scotland has been a member, albeit as part of a larger member state, for 40 years, the idea that we would be rejected is… it’s actually very difficult the leave the EU, even if you want to, as Greenland found out, so there is no precedent for expulsion of a member state, or part of a member state. The truth is, yes, we would have to negotiate our terms of entry, but we would be doing that from within the EU. The problem is that we are in an independence debate where no side want to give the impression that this will be very difficult, that there will be obstacles and barriers to be overcome. The reality is that Scotland has two very important negotiating or bargaining counters, one is fishing, one is energy. Our contribution to energy supply in Europe is significant because of North Sea oil and gas, and the fishing grounds that Scotland has which are currently part of the common fisheries policy, mean that, for example, Spanish fishing can fish pretty much right up to the Scottish coastline. They’re not going to want to sacrifice that, and that’s why you won’t find the Spanish Government saying anything against Scottish Independence, despite the fact that they have their own independence movements that they’re keen not to push. They’re not taking a formal position before the vote, and that’s exactly as it should be.
What’s really positive is that the Scottish and UK governments have agreed to what’s called the ‘Edinburgh Agreement’, so that means that the"

Our members are involved in the construction of the parts, and has achieved some results. The functions of all components are tested and validated under controlled laboratory conditions and normal conditions, and data and phenomena demonstrate that they are valid. At the same time, all components are standardized, which makes them a convenient and powerful tool for others.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#team:amsterdam#collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," most carbon efficient. As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2 directly into fumarate, fuelled by sunlight. For E. Coli , on the contrary, you needs to grow sugar crops, harvest them, and extract the glucose as a carbon source to grow. Taking the whole process into consideration, cyanobacteria will yield more fumarate per CO 2 . Exploring other options such as these could provide an efficient and possibly cost-effective way to produce the fumarate that would lower methane emissions in cattle.
Conclusions
From this pleasant collaboration, we can conclude that adding fumarate to cattle feed remains a promising strategy to reduce methane emissions, although some hurdles have yet to be taken. Some studies report conflicting results about the effect of the addition of fumarate to cattle feed on methane production. Thereby, the absence of oxygen in cattle rumen opposes challenges for the growth of photoautotrophic organisms and oxidative growth of heterotrophic organisms.
On top of that, the exact yields of the strains developed by iGEM team Amsterdam and the proposed E. Coli mutant in this paper have yet to be defined. Nevertheless, as shown by the UNL iGEM team, methane emissions pose an enormous problem to our world, that need interdisciplinary teams to come up with out of the box-solutions such as these.

For our iGUT project, we designed a new composite BioBrick part (BBa_K2072000) (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2072000:Design) and submitted it to iGEM registry for medal qualification. We did some preliminary characterization of this part. In addition, we used one BioBrick part from the toolbox of 2016 in our project iGUT.

New application of BBa_1450004
Since the cell wall of notoginseng root cells is composed of a high percentage of arabinose, we hope to use arabinose-inducable promoter to express our sugar degradation enzyme. One biobrick part, BBa_1450004, designed by Univ.British Columbia in 2014, controls T7RNApol expression through pBAD promoter. We co-transformed BL21(DE3) E.coli cells with pSB1C3-BBa_1450004 and pET28a-β-glucosidase. We measured the enzymatic activity of double-plasmid containing cells in different culture conditions, including variable concentrations of lactose, arabinose, IPTG, and kanamycin. For comparison we also measured the enzymatic activity of E.coli cells with single or no plasmids. The results indicated that our synthetic β-glucosidase gene was successfully expressed from the pET28a construct.
We added lactose, arabinose, PNPG, and diluted bacteria culture into each well of 96-well plates. After a period of time of culturing at 37C, we measured the A620 and A450 using a micro-plate reader (A450 reflects the concentration of PNP and cell density, A620 only reflects cell density). To calculate the PNP concentration, we used this formula：A450real=A450-1.5*A620. We validated this method using PNP solution in combination of bacteria culture over a wide range of concentrations (A620: 0.01-0.9).

Open Day of BNU Lab
October 17th, 2014 was a special day for BNU team, because we finished most of the demanded work of iGEM 2014 and this is also our Open Day. Students from middle school, high school and other departments of BNU, and even some professors visited our lab. We displayed our poster and taught them do some basic experiments. Some stickers were also handed out to them, so they can stick their feelings on our black board. This is a good change to foster scientific awareness, especially in the area of synthetic biology.
Ma Di led the students from senior high to our lab and taught them basic skills such as aseptic technique, bacterial culture, plasmid transfer. The senior high students were very happy to see that interest things.

We had a few meetings in framing our human practice part.  Professor Chang at NYMU also gave us great suggestions on human practice part.  We think our project is involved with two parts: food safety and synthetic biology.  Thus, we think we should devote efforts on understanding the social justice, security and social impact related to the food safety part.  In terms of synthetic biology, we need to know related professional knowledge, such as intellectual property rights, safety and popularity of this new technique.

NJU-China,2017,Team:NJU-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"at), or regulating the metabolism of fat. [7]
We have seen the traditional methods to lose weight. Many of them are prevalent, and we cannot deny their efficacy. However, it’s not hard to find these traditional methods’ defects: changing lifestyle is usually unpleasant and perseverance-needed, and even if you get the positive feedback, the probability to regain weight is also quite high. [7] As for medications, they may bring out inevitable side effects, like oily stool. Some company had to retract their medications for safety concerns. For example, Sibutramine, an Australian drug, had to be recalled for harmful influence on heart diseases. [7]
Therefore, undoubtedly we need a better solution to address the obesity issue.
Left: fat mice treated by inducing adipocytes’ apoptosis
As we trace back to the source of obesity, we can see its relevance to adipocytes, which store fat derived from the diet and from liver metabolism. There are two types of adipose tissue, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which are also known as white fat and brown fat, respectively, and comprise two types of fat cells.
When fat accumulates, the size of adipocytes increases. If the adipocytes in the body reach their maximum capacity of fat, they may replicate to allow additional fat storage.Since the number and the size of adipocytes affect human’s weight status, and it has been proved valid to decrease mice’s weight by targeted ablation of adipose tissue. [8]
Thus, we decided to use design a specific gene-targeted delivery system to help regulate the apoptosis of adipose tissues. To fulfil such a goal, a targeted gene, a gene-regulating tool, a targeting tool and a delivery vesicle have to be selected or created.
1) BCL-2 gene
BCL-2 gene encodes BCL-2 protein (B-cell lymphoma 2), the founding member of the Bcl-2 family of regulator proteins that regulate cell death (apoptosis), by either inducing (pro-apoptotic) or inhibiting (anti-apoptotic) apoptosis. [9][10] Since BCL-2                     Can inhibit the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins in adipose tissues, we can induce adipocyte apoptosis by decrease BCL-2 gene’s expression.
2) RNAi
RNA interference (RNAi) is an endogenous regulatory pathway that is triggered by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and by the activated RNAi pathway, siRNA can silence the expression of any genes with high efficiency [11].

Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#Project#miRNA Kit_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 construct was cotransfected with a Tet repressor construct tagged with 4 perfect mir122 binding sites. Fig. 7 shows a rescue of Luc2 expression in case of shmir122 expression (hcr construct), indicating, that the on-targeting is working. The right picture is the comparable control experiment using a not-binding site tagged TetR construct. As expected, no rescue of gene expression occurs in this control experiment (Fig. 8). Those results indicate, that the on-tuning is working, in principle. In order to increase to rescue of gene expression, different TetR/pBS_SV40_TetO2_Luc2 ratios could be applied.

Discussion
The On-construct measurments showed very promising results as well, having a clear firefly (Luc2) expression rescue in case the mir122 binding site TetR is cotransfected with the hcr (mir122) expression construct and not when being co-transfected with the control TetR (not binding site tagged). Therefor, the On-Tuning strategy is working. Adjustment of promoter strengths and ratios of TetR, hcr and the pBS_sv40_Tet02_Luc2 construct should be done in order to increase the rescue of gene expression compared to basal expression level of the Luc2 construct cotransfected with the TetR.

Application of miTuner
In Vitro Regulation of a Therapeutic Gene hAAT
We further tested our kit using a gene that is an interesting candidate for gene therapy, i. e. human alpha-1-antitrypsin (hAAT). Tight control of the genetic activity is fundamental, since deficiencies of hAAT can cause emphysema (Lu et al., 2006) . With our tuning kit we have a powerful mean at hand to mediate expression levels. In this approach, we tagged hAAT, that we used as our GOI, with binding sites (for miRsAg) that we measured and characterized with our miMeasure construct beforehand (data not shown). There is some evidence, that the principle works also with this therapeutic gene in HeLa cells (fig. 7). This is a first potential therapeutic approach applying ELISA for measurements.
Figure 7: hAAT expression in relative units depending on binding site properties. SV40 driven hAAT was fused to binding sites for miRsAg that was expressed from a co-transfected plasmid in HeLa cells.
It is obvious: different binding sites result in different knockdowns of gene expression. Some imperfect"

As the inaugural iGEM team at Broad Run High School, and also as one of the first iGEM teams in the Loudoun County school district, our 2015 iGEM experience has been founded on multiple collaborations. Without these collaborations, we would not be at this place with our iGEM project; with a working part that met our design goals of removing undesired starch in industrial wastewater and attending the Jamboree so we could share and learn more about the complex wonders of synthetic biology!
Armstrong, Lancaster, PA
When we reached out to Armstrong as a potential sponsor, we began a partnership where first they learned more about what iGEM and synthetic biology can do to solve real world problems, and we learned of problems that plague industrial manufacturing as they adapt to become more environmentally responsible. With their sponsorship, we furthered our understanding of Armstrong's water problem; through skype meetings with our team including our mentors Dr. Schiefele and Dr. Burkett, emails exchanges and querries on their manufacturing plant and process, documentation, schematics, photos of the plant. We collaborated with Armstrong’s Mr. Paul Hough and Mr. Hoosier, the technical expert for the plant who took time away from his job to attended one of our skype meetings just so we could get a better handle of the starch problem in the water. We worked together during the design phase of our project with their input and feedback, crucial to our solution. During the testing phase of our project, we also worked with Armstrong for water samples. We have communicated our findings to them with images of our results and received positive feedback and support for future collaborative work to refine our synthetic biology approach leading to an implementable solution.
BUGSS, Baltimore Underground Science Space, Baltimore, MD
Even before we had formed a team, during that very early stage of trying to bring iGEM to our school, our school’s administration rightfully raised concerns about fulfilling the ethical and safety requirements for carrying out an iGEM project. Because of this and the fact that our school lab did not have the resources for an iGEM project, Marissa Sumathipala and Adriel"
