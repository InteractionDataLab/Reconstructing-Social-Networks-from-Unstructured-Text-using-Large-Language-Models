Mathematical modeling: Introduction
Mathematical modeling plays a central role in Synthetic Biology. One of its mayor abilities: to predict the behavior of a biological circuit. Therefore, it is an important bridge between the ideas and concepts on the one hand, and biological experiments on the other.
The main idea is to interact with the experimental part of the project in two ways. On the one hand to characterize the constructed biobricks, and identify parameters of the models thus allowing to a better understanding of the biology behind. On the other hand, to direct the way in which experiments are performed, so as to verify a prediction done from the modeling world.
The first step, with a little knowledge, was to develop a mathematical model based on a system of differential equations. Then, the equations were implemented using a set of reasonable values, taken from the literature,  for the model parameters. This way, we could validate the feasibility of the project. Here, one of the main characters of the play came into the ""cheaters"" . We saw the “cheaters” could appear from an original population of “normal” microorganisms. This lead us to perform several experiments to measure the metabolic burden that arises when cells carrying a synthetic plasmid want to effectively synthetize the desired protein, as compared with cells that are NOT producing the protein. This could lead to increase the fitness of the “cheaters”.
Then we started the characterization of each part created in the lab. Some of the mathematical model parameters were estimated thanks to several experiments we performed within the project (others were derived from literature) and they were used to predict the final behavior of each construction.
Experimental procedures for parameter estimation are discussed and simulation experiments performed, using ODEs with MATLAB and Global optimization algorithm for MINLP's based on Scatter Search (SSm by Process Engineering Group IIM-CSIC).

To characterize this biobrick, we grew an overnight culture of the temperature-sensitive CDC28 mutant and wild-type yeast cells. After diluting the cell solutions to an optical density of 0.1, both strains were grown in SC media at 24°C and 37°C in microplates. The OD at 600nm was measured every 20 minutes for 24 hours using a Tecan Sunrise machine to create growth curves for both the wild-type and the CDC28 mutant at the two temperatures. The results clearly indicate that at the nonpermissive temperature of 37°C there is a significant difference between the growth of the wild-type and mutant. The CDC28 mutant strain stays at a low OD while the wild-type displays a typical growth curve. At the permissive temperature of 24°C, there is little difference in the pattern of growth between the two cell strains. This confirms the ability of our biobrick part to inhibit growth at a specific temperature of 37°C.
BBa_K274001 MelA Cambridge
iGEM Concordia 2016 aimed to synthesize nanoparticles for the overall goal of equipping cells with ""nano-weapons"" and having them fight in a microfluidics chip, in our project titled ""Combat Cells: League of Enhanced MicroGladiators."" One of our methods of nanoparticle synthesis and attachment to cells is titled the recombinant method. Through the use of the protein MelA with its substrate L-DOPA, eumelanin is formed, which forms gold nanoparticles from gold ions in solution.
IGEM Concordia 2016 aimed to improve the characterization of MelA by determining MelA's ability to use tyrosine as a substrate in place of L-DOPA. We cloned MelA's sequence into a plasmid, with MelA expression under the control of a constitutive promoter. This would allow us to determine if MelA had any cytotoxic effects.
After transforming this plasmid into DH5alpha E. coli cells, we set up an experiment to test MelA's ability"

Characterization of BBa_K747096
During DNA assembly, we found that this promoter was activated in Escherichia coli. Then we decided to characterize this promoter activity by comparing with constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) using GFP (BBa_E0040) (Figure 1).
As seen in Figure 1, this promoter shows weaker activity than BBa_J23101.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," mutagenesis, for toxic gene cloning or for preventing unwanted methylation.
In the beginning of our project we did next generation sequencing for our Vibrio natriegens strain and performed bioinformatic analysis and identified several other candidates for deletion and other genome engineering methods. One design feature for our 2.0 strain would include deleting methylase and restriction modification systems, which are present in our genome. In common cloning strains for E.Coli (DH5𝛼, Top10) restriction modification systems are deleted (Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) to enable cloning with DNA from different sources and to protect the DNA from endogenous restriction enzymes. That's why a desirable goal for the next generation of our cloning strain, would be to design a strain, similar to E.coli, which is deficient for all for those modification systems.
When we performed next generation sequencing in the beginning of our project for our wild type strain, we subsequently did a bioinformatic analysis and genome annotation. By utilizing these information we were able to identified several methylases and restriction modification systems.
Type I restriction - modification system subunit M
EC 2 . 1 . 1 . 72
Type I restriction . modification system , specificity subunit S
EC 3. 1.21.3
Type I restriction modification system restriction subunit R
EC 3 . 1 . 21 . 3
Type III restriction - modification system methylation subunit
EC 2.1 . 1.72
We are sure, that more methylases and restriction modification systems can be found in the genome of Vibrio natriegens by utilizing and combining different bioinformatic tools such as the rebase database.
Additionally we found several phage associated sequences and it has been shown that deleting phage related regions could make a bacteria more genetically accessible. In general a genome reduction could have advantages for a cloning host, as it has been shown that it could increase genome stability, reduce mutation rates and improved recombinational stability for cloning repetitive DNA sequences.
The most ambitious idea for our VibriClone 2.0 strain would be to free up chromosome II for utilization as a low copy plasmid in order to clone big DNA fragments or whole genomes and thereby establishing a synthetic chromosome for challenging cloning applications. In the future this could enable cloning of small of hole small genomes, such as the mycoplasma genome in order to make the genome engineering process easier and especially much faster, compared to common methods, where whole genome cloning heavily relies on yeast as a cloning chassis.

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota_-_-_TEXT.html," Wisconsin Lutheran to facilitate a week’s worth of synthetic biology curriculum by sending detailed lesson plans developed by our iGEM team, along with strains of microorganisms used to facilitate trainings. In addition, we participated in Columbia iGEM's low-budget lab exercise, who in turn provided UMN iGEM with an interview with a local environmental health specialist who has extensive knowledge of the mercury contamination problem within Columbia.
Requirement 3: Describing and evaluating questions beyond the bench
The primary goal of UMN iGEM 2014 has been to design a project in line with the major safety, ethics, and intellectual property concerns of both scientists and the public. We took the following steps to address each of these issues:
Safety: Our project gives detailed attention to the prevention of releasing genetically modified bacteria into the environment via encapsulation and the development of several killswitch proposals. The device also includes an activated carbon filter to both collect mercury and prevent release of the bacteria. During an outreach event at 3M we also discussed this filtration element of our device with one of their filtration experts to further inform our safety measures.
Ethics: We have been committed to establishing an open and productive dialogue between UMN iGEM and the public. Our surveying at the State Fair of public opinion on safety and implementation concerns of our device helped to inform our design. We believe there is great ethical importance to involving the community in the design of a device that could potentially be used on their waters. We also developed an interactive game show at the fair to actively engage the public in synthetic biology knowledge. Our dialogue with the public has also included our outreach program at local schools, the Science Museum of Minnesota, and various STEM fairs allowing us to develop a dynamic dialogue with both children and their parents. The program focuses on the understanding of DNA in order to demystify the basic principles behind synthetic biology. It is our hope that a more solid understanding of these principles may help to familiarize children with biotechnological tools and decrease misconceptions about the nature of DNA manipulation. We hope this may help to develop an informed future community of consumers and constituents to facilitate open dialogues between scientists and the public. Finally, we interviewed various experts in bioethics and scientific fields related to our project to help further inform ourselves and give essential background to those unfamiliar with the global issue of mercury contamination.
Intellectual Property: We sought to create an integrative and marketable project by developing a business plan along with marketing analysis for our device. We also educated ourselves about the patenting process via on campus seminars. Finally, we applied for a patent to protect the intellectual"

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC Construction_-_-_TEXT.html," et al., 2006 ). However, one has to consider that the reoxidation by oxygen is very low and the diffusion through the PEM is not negligible, so the oxidation of this substance can affect the performance of the MFC when operated for long periods of time ( Rabaey et al., 2005 ). Alternatively, oxygen can be used as a very effective electron acceptor in combination with an open-air electrode. For an effective oxygen reduction, however, high-cost platinum catalysts are necessary. For this reason, this option is rarely used ( Sell et al., 1989 ).
Requirements:
good reduction performance
good reoxidation
high long term stability
Compartment separation
Although almost all microbial fuel cells use proton exchange membranes as the separation element between anode and cathode compartment, it is possible to use more simple constructions like salt or agarose bridges. These basic separation systems, however, do not reach the power output of membrane based systems because of their high internal resistance. Cation exchange membranes offer defined properties and ensure a better current output because of their high selectivity for the passage of positive charged ions. However, in this context it has to be considered that the PEM could be permeable to chemicals and oxygen, which might influence the long term performance of the fuel cell ( Logan et al.,2006 ).
Requirements:
high selectivity for positive ions
impermeability for chemicals and oxygen
MFC Evolution
The Film Canister Cell
Our first model was constructed out of film canisters and was designed to gain a better understanding of the general concept of galvanic cells and microbial fuel cells. It was used with different chemicals, yeast and the E. coli KRX strain. It also allowed to gather experience with the equipment used for measurement. The anode and cathode chambers are film canisters. Both are connected by a segment of a 15 mL centrifugation tube with a total length of two centimeters. The individual parts are held together by hot-melt glue. The centrifugation tube is filled with 3 % agarose, which acts as a salt bridge to allow protons to pass from anode to cathode chamber. In both chambers, pieces of carbon tissue (see Figure 4) act as the electrode.
Figure 4: Carbon tissue material. It shows a more flexible characteristic and seems noticeably more tearproof in comparison to carbon cloth.
Figure 5: Carbon cloth material. It shows a higher conductivity, but can be easily ruptured and therefore is difficult to mount inside the fuel cell chambers.
The biggest problem of this design is the salt bridge connecting"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#semiotics_-_-_TEXT.html,",M ""E"" and ""M"" are looked at together, for the processing device will need at least two parts to be. They are designed to be the shape of two four-node network motifs drawn in Uri Alon's book Systems Biology. In our project, our team members noticed the similar structures between motifs, and utilised this similarity to design our rewirable circuits. Notice that the Kenaz shape in the recombinase is at the center of the two motifs, it means that it's the recombinase that catalyze for the transition from one motif to another.
Output Device, I ""I"" is drawn to be the output device, we draw it to be a shape of bottle that contain the bacterium. Different colors of fluorescence will show different state of the processing device.
We didn't use the shape of Gebo, letter G, in this pattern. Instead we substituted it with C, Kenaz, which is more fit in shape, and fits in better with our project specifically.
4. Discussions
Of course, this method is quite clumsy and flawed if you look at it that way. But it's fun, isn't it? Besides, I happened to notice that the Campus Magazine of Art and Literature of MIT is called Runes.[14] Oh, how curious.
We also made a careful comparison to make sure the result is not a strain interpretation or far-fetched, that no other four letters could better describe iGEM as these four could. So, although we cannot prove it's right, we can't prove it wrong, either.
But what if iGEM changes its name to International Synthetic Biology Competition? Then its initials would be iSB, with Isa, Sowilo, Berkana, and I wonder what that would be. If so, many iGEM-unique features and flavors would be lost. Other combinations may yield other meanings, but we do think that the name iGEM is the best name for this endeavor we've all been taking on, for the moment we count it as a word, we are assigning meaning to it.
Have fun!

The Project Design of iGEM
The design of the project varied, if you have a good idea, we could achieve it by using synthetic biology and construct it into corresponding artificial biosystem. As different project’s categories used before involved basic studies, industry, environment, health, food, art, new application, new protocol, software etc. For instance, some of the team invented microbial fluorescent pen, some of them make a disease detector, which make synthetic biology shining.
This year, SCUT team concentrates on greenhouse effect and energy crisis. By using the concept of cellular compartmentalization, and scaffolding protein as our tools, we try to break the conventional thought in industry which uses the whole cell as the unit of production. Further more, it breaks the limitation of the individual cell level, utilize different organelle corresponding to different physicochemical property directly, achieve the transformation of the pathway in the organelle level. The plan of team SCUT is divided into three stages to achieve the utilization of different organelles. This year, our project will accomplish the first stage, which will focus on mitochondrion providing energy and achieve the pathway of carbon fixation and production of alcohol which corresponding our goals of emission reduction.

The repulsive odorant 2-nonanone is detected by the AWB olfactory neu-rons.

Skinner Box
Skinner Box is a laboratory apparatus used to study animal behavior invented by Burrhus Frederic Skinner(1904—1990), and it uncloses the secret of the operant behavior. Skinner’s study deeply influenced American education at that time. He divided the behaviors into two types: respondent behavior which induced by some known stimulus like Pavlov's dog, and another is operant behavior caused by a subject itself like Skinner's pigeon. In our life, most behaviors or reflects are operant behaviors and operant reflects, so it’s very important to study the mechanism of Skinner box. The structure forming the shell of it is a chamber large enough to easily accommodate the animal being used as a subject. (Commonly used model animals include rodents—usually lab rats—pigeons, and primates). An operant conditioning chamber permits experimenters to study behavior conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal.[7][8] There are several manipulandums in the box, which can automatically detect the occurrence of a behavioral response or action. Typical operands for primates and rats are response levers; if the subject presses the lever, the opposite end moves and closes a switch that is monitored by a computer or other programmed device. When the lever is pressed, food, water, or some other type of reinforcement (a consequence that will strengthen an organism's future behavior whenever that behavior is preceded by a specific antecedent stimulus.) might be dispensed. In some instances, the floor of the chamber may be electrified. The rats learn to press the lever through several training periods because of the awards or the punishments. [9] The researchers can also control the probability between the lever and the switch, for example, the food will not be given to the rats until the rats press the lever for about 30-40 times. In this experiment, scientists find that although the food will be given after the rats press the lever so many times, the rats will still press the lever ceaselessly"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," most physical traumas. The plastics expert has estimated that such a container would last in an urban environment for at least 20 years, and most likely more than that. To illustrate the durability of the plastics, he notified us of several devices from the 1980s made of the same plastic, which still stand strong today.
One of the biggest concerns would be the release of GMOs into nature. While the GMOs used are not pathogenetic, they would be able to share the plasmids containing antibiotic resistance selectors to other bacteria, that might be pathogenic. Antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria complicates the treatment of an infected individual and could, in tragic cases, be the difference between life and death. However small the risk of this scenario might be, it should be addressed properly. Furthermore, antibiotic resistant E. Coli strains could outmatch some of their fellow E. Coli strains through natural selection. This could negatively affect the balance of nature, that we are aiming to restore with the development of the PowerLeaf.
To avoid these risks, several kill switch mechanisms should be implemented into the final device. This could be performed by implementation of a kill switch activated by exposure to light in the energy converting unit. This would of course mean, that the energy converting unit’s container would need to block all sunlight. A task that could easily be carried out by adding Carbon Black to the required areas of the container. The energy storing unit, which requires light to function, could then have a kill switch which makes it dependent on the presence of the energy converting unit. This could be accomplished by having harmless molecules, not naturally found in nature but required for the survival of the energy converting unit, circulating in the system. A similar effect could be accomplished by making the bacteria in the energy converting and storing units codependent on each other for their survival. The implementation of such kill switch mechanisms would tremendously improve the biosafety of the device by opposing hazards related to any kind of physical breakage.

Part 2  Feasibility & Practicality
Although our project is just a small step forward on the way to specific protein degradation, if one day we find proteins that can induce cell carcinogenesis then we can use this technique to weed out these carcinogenic proteins in the human body, which will contribute a lot in the history of Medicine. However, we had no idea about the feasibility and practicality of the application of PR PREDATOR in actual disease, especially cancer. And to what extent could the new development of cancer treatment be promoted?
Based on the above questions, we contacted Professor Qiang Ma and Professor Yunshan Ning in School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University by emails on the exchange and consultation.
Part 3  Further Arrangements
Through the interviews, we had learned that the degradation of target protein is still a cutting-edge field in scientific research and clinical application. The environment of human cells is so complex we can’t exactly say which protein is absolute good or bad for humans. And the degree of degradation may affect the internal environment as well. Talking about the details in experiment, we still had some issues to consider, including cross-reaction, the affinity of single-domain antibodies and so on. Only when we solved these problems could we took further step in application and industrialization of our project. We planned to communicate with group of Professor Nie once a month to obtain a mature scheme with proposal. Since Trim was a new field, we would pay more attention to delivery in chemistry.

Elan Vital Korea has organized an information seminar on synthetic biology during the Korea Youth Expo.  For the seminar, we have invited Mr. Damon Tighe as our lecturer, who conducted the lecture in the English language, which was simultaneously translated into the Korean language.  We have invited college students and professors as well as high school students visiting the expo. We also held an introduction session on iGEM.  The entire session was video recorded, and offered to various institutions.
4. On-Booth Discussions and Talks on Synthetic Biology
We explained to the visitors of our booth what is the synthetic biology, and what benefits and risks are inherent in the new field full of great potential and possibility.  We began our discussions with visitors of our booth by asking them to express their opinions on the synthetic biology.  This way, we were able to customize the level of information we share based on their answers and feedbacks. In the process of the discussions, we showed them various displays, including various pictures, videos, information brochures and the glow fish on display in our booth to explain the synthetic biology.

Introduction
In our project, we want to stop the movement of C.crescentus to image a clear photo.  So we need to know whether we have stopped those excited boys.  One problem about this is, how to define and measure the parameter of  the C.crescentus' motion?
Analysis
Here we make the hypothesis below.
the solution is uniform, which means the composition of every part in the solution is the same
the number of the bacteria would not change in short time.
the motion of the C.crescentus is random and they can be regarded as free gas.
And we suppose  the distance one bacterium moved in time $t$ is $l$.  Then the diffusion coefficient D can be defined as
$$D=l^2/(2t)$$
As you can guess, we are going to use $D$ to describe the motion of C.crescentus in stead of velocity. The reason is that the object of our study is a large crowd of bacteria, and it is more suitable to use diffusion coefficient as the parameter of the system.
In fact, $D$ describe the diffusion rate of bacteria. It's easy to predict that after we give the signal ""stop"", $D$ would decline because the C.crescentus cannot get the help from the rotation of their flagellum and the holdfast would block their movement.
But, how can we measure the value of the diffusion coefficient?
Getting the help from Einstein
In early years of last century, Einstein focused on the motion of free gas, and got the famous Einstein Relation:      $$Ave(x^2)=2Dt$$      where $x$ is the distance one bacterium moved in time $t$, and $Ave(x^2)$ is the average value of x square. The relation shows that $Ave(x^2)$ is in direct proportion to the time $t$.
With this theory, we can develop a method to measure the value of $D$. Firstly we use micro camera to record the motion of bacteria. And then we focus on several bacteria's movement locus to count $"

Sharing
A. Participation in Creative Challenger Program
     Creative Challenger Program (CCP) is a Korea University program that is dedicated to promote creativity in undergraduates by letting them form groups and engage in self-designed projects, while providing them with a suitable environment. It is sponsored by Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL), and they carefully observe, judge teams and their projects, while providing support. Topics for projects include natural sciences, liberal arts/society, culture/art/sports, economics/management, and engineering/information technology. Despite the wide range of topics, teams are encouraged to associate, making this program a center for idea sharing. Korea U Seoul has participated in CCP since 2010, and through this program, we have been able to spread information about iGEM and Synthetic Biology. In January and September of every year, all the teams and each teams' advisors gather together and have a question and answer session. Doing so, we could share our topics and advance it further. Job-Ara team which participates in CCP has asked us if we could provide an orientation about our project and a lab tour for their students (for primary, middle, highschool students) job search program. We are reviewing the offer currently. What we have now to look forward to is the January final presentation and poster presentation. Korea U Seoul team will continue to perform research for better results even after iGEM is over.
B. Informing iGEM to Students
     On August 13, our team member Haerim introduced iGEM to the students who participated in the Korea University Science camp for middle school young scientists. She prepared presentation and explained what synthetic biology is and what we do in iGEM competition. The students showed curiosity and gave lots of questions. They were surprised to know that there is an international jamboree in which people all around the world get together, having a festival to share their academic interests.
C. Presentation Contest
     During February, Sanghoon, Haerim and Jinsik(one of the 2011 iGEM Korea U Seoulteam members) participated in a presentation competition held by Seoul National University. We made a presentation on synthetic biology, reasoning why we have to invest in this field and reporting the current state of Korea. We mentioned iGEM competition showing that there are increasing interests in synthetic biology area. We made a good result and advanced to the finals.

Summary
Sharing and learning from each other is one of the most important features of the iGEM competition, in that any lack of experience could be well ameliorated by studying the projects and the way of presenting them of other and/or previous teams.
We here present you with a collection and praise of historic iGEM projects. Though these projects selected may not comprehensively include all the meritorious projects of each aspect, we managed to introduce you some representative projects from different perspectives. And we hope this collection might help iGEMers and other synthetic biologists with their projects and presentations.
5 Meritorious Projects: Modeling
The first amazing modeling project for you is from Peking 2010 team. As they were endeavoring in the development of a sensing circuit for heavy metals, the linear range should be broad enough to include a change of several magnitudes. Taking an informative Biological Network Reverse Engineering approach to guide the circuit design, they were finally able to enhance the function to a next level.
Peking 2010
Then it comes to the modeling work of British Columbia of 2011. They have presented an example for an extension of traditional modeling. The protein structure alignment and the docking of the small molecule gave them information on what residues were responsible for the synthesis of terpene and thus for the synthase’s modification.

E. coli odor itself is not that pleasant as well. We use RED to knockout the insole production gene tnaA (tryptophanase) to reduce the odor itself. Insole in shoes is not a wonderful home for microorganisms to grow. We use vitreoscilla hemoglobin (existing part K1321200) to enhance the grow ability of two E. coli strains and get the quantitative measurement result of the Biobrick.
VHb Enhancement
Overview
Goal: To enhance the ability to live in tough environment for engineered E. coli strains.
Achievement: Observational measurement and quantitative measurement finished. Result shows that in restricted environment (liquid culture volume related), VHb can accelerate the growth and improve protein production in early stage when oxygen supply is efficient.
Part: BBa_K1919500
Introduction
Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) was first studied in the 1960s and recognized as a hemoglobin in 1986. It was the first bacterial hemoglobin discovered. It transfers oxygen to its host under oxygen limitation. Yeast two-hybrid studies showing direct interactions of VHb with the terminal respiratory oxidases cytochrome bo and cytochrome d and VHb enhancement of oxygen uptake and ubiquinol oxidase activities of respiratory membranes all support this role. In conclusion, it enhances the ability for E. coli to utilize oxygen to grow. [1]
Now it has been used for the bioproduct synthesis in many species.
In iGEM14_Imperial project, VHb is used in Gluconacetobacter xylinus strain to promote the production of cellulose. SCU-China 2016 are expected to express this gene in E. coli to promote the engineered bacteria growth ability in relatively bad condition (Shoes).

ISSUES
Capitalist governments are often reticent to invest in public infrastructure due to current economic theory.
However, John Maynard Keynes1 would argue that this is an excellent way to create economic growth.
Socialist governments would also require significant lobbying in order to convince the right people that investment is important.
Good Manufacturing Practice Reform must not come at the expense of patient safety. Improving access to insulin is about saving lives, and making a substandard biologic product could be lethal
Medical advertising industry is enormous and employs a lot of individuals. In addition, this would require pharmaceutical companies to pass on the cost savings to the consumer, which has been proven in the banking sector to be unreliable.
Low-income nations struggle to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies valued at more than their national Gross Domestic Product. Burden of responsibility is on the United States and Europe to introduce cost efficiencies into the market.
7. Gene Therapy
BACKGROUND
Generally, when we think of pharmaceutical solutions, its generally to elevate symptoms. Very rarely do we come up with an effective cure. In the case of diabetes, we could be able to edit the genome to hopefully cure it once and for all. Recently, there have been developments in the field towards this end[7]
ISSUES
The true solution to Diabetes is a cure, rather than endless treatment.
Extremely costly.
Long and tiresome research to continue on from what progress has already been made.
Clinical trial expenses will also be required to trial a potential gene therapy.
8. Gut Bacteria Insulin Secretion
BACKGROUND
Utilising a naturally occurring human gut bacteria to secrete insulin into the gut following meals.[8] While investigating this as a potential solution, we were unable to determine a reliable method for regulating insulin production
ISSUES
Difficult to match rate of secretion to the requirements of the body.
Difficult to engineer two-way signaling from gut to blood and back to gut again.
Risk that bacteria may become pathogenic through mutation rates.
Releasing GMOs into the environment may cause unforeseen adverse reactions.
Risk of transferring to non-diabetic individuals. This could result in a number of reactions when insulin levels are normal in the blood that would need to be carefully examined prior to release into the community.
9. Animal Insulin
BACKGROUND
Prior to the production of Human insulin, pig insulin was often used to treat diabetes.[10] Returning to older animal insulins to supply developing nations with cheap insulin is an option, but unambitious. The production process involves running animal blood through a form of dial"

Urediniospores infect usually during rainy seasons, since germination requires a 24 to 48 hour continuous presence of free water (rain or heavy dew). Infection occurs over a wide range of temperature: from 15°C to 28°C with an optimum of 22°C, and only occurs through stomata on the underside of the leaf, so it does not form the pustules typical of many rusts. The infected leaves drop prematurely, which reduces photosynthetic capacity and weakens the plant (as seen in the following pictures), altogether reducing next season’s berry yield (as much as 10-fold) (Arneson, 2000).
Figure 3. The infected leaves drop prematurely, leaving long expanses of twig devoid of leaves (Taken from http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/Basidiomycetes/Pages/CoffeeRust.aspx )
Other pests:
The rust is not the only plague. Talking with coffee growers, they told us that there are new plagues that attack the coffee plants and even the resistant strains are attacked. A major problem is the ""Pink disease"". This fungus ""Costicium salmonicolor""belongs to the class Basidiomycetes and according to the coffee growers is a disease that have been affecting the production in most parts of the country.

3.Kill Switch
When we use engineered bacteria to treat IBD, we need to do biocontainment work to avoid the release of engineered bacteria into the environment. Therefore, in our project, we designed a cold shock kill switch based on the toxin-antitoxin system mazEF, so we can kill our engineered E. coli when it escape from human body. We inserted the reporter gene amilCP into the pColdI plasmid to characterize the performance of the cold shock promoter PcspA (Figure 9A). Then we inserted maz-F into the pColdI plasmid to build our kill switch (Figure 9B).
A, the construction of PcspA-amilCP plasmid. B, the construction of PcspA-mazF plasmid.
We transformed the PcspA-amilCP plasmid into DH5α and cultured overnight at 37℃. The overnight culture was diluted to OD = 0.2 and allowed to grow for 2 h at 37℃. It was then divided into different concentrations of IPTG at 16℃ and 37℃ for 6 h (Figure 10). It can be seen from the figure 11A that the reporter gene is efficiently expressed at low temperature, which indicates that the effective expression of the toxin gene mazF and the closed expression of the anti-toxin gene mazE at low temperature can kill our engineered bacteria in time. Although the cold shock promoter PcspA has a certain leakage at body temperature, the toxin is neutralized by the anti-toxin expressed at body temperature, so the effect is not significant. However, it is best to add a lacO site in the future to suppress leakage.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," strongest: J23101, J23106 and J23117 for 1-3 respectively. The absorbance results suggest that J23106 reflects about 25 times greater absorbance J23101 when paired with B0032. Similarly, J23117 is approximately 35 times greater in absorbance compared to J23101. After comparing to promoters, Test Devices 4-6 keep the J346100 RBS constant to compare the promoters. The listed from weakest to strongest include: J23101, J23106 and J23117 for 4-6 respectively. The absorbance graph demonstrates J23101 low level of fluorescence (with one colony demonstrating slightly higher fluorescence than expected) compared to both 5 and 6. While J23106 demonstrates 40 times the strength of J23101, J23117 indicates a slightly stronger promoter with approximately 42 times the strength of J23101.
Further review of the mean fluorescence over time that most of the test devices demonstrate sufficient fluorescence between three to four hours. Following that time span, the florescence begins to decrease. For devices with the J23106 promoter, fluorescence begins to decrease past the two hour mark.
In comparing the relative strengths of the promoters in combination with the RBS, the difference between the fluorescence measurements may be attributed to the strength of the RBS thus affecting the level of fluorescence (where J346100 may be stronger than the B0032). With data from other teams participating in the Interlab study, the UMaryland team hopes that the collection of all fluorescence data will better help with the standardization of fluorescence to account for varying promoter and RBS strengths.
Collaboration
College of William and Mary
Background
While attending the Mid-Atlantic iGEM meetup, we got the chance to speak with the William and Mary team about their efforts to control gene expression speed. We thought that the idea to use a non-endogenous protease/protein degradation tag system in order to establish reliable control over the rate at which genes are expressed was a really interesting idea. We ended up discussing how our teams could provide assistance to one another and came to the agreement to collaborate on several fronts.
Testing by UMaryland
Our team took on the task of testing several constructs sent to us by William and Mary. In total, they sent us six plasmids termed A through F. Plasmids A-E consisted of the fluorescent protein gene mScarlet under the control of a tetracycline induced promoter. The mScarlet gene on each plasmid was tagged with a different protein degradation sequence of varying strength. Plasmid"

Conclusion
When we cut pMK-RQ with EcoRI and NheI, both pMK-RQ back bone and kinA fragment are about 2k bp. To get the purified kinA fragment, we need to run the gel for a longer time to seperate the two bands. The other way is to introduce the third enzyme which can cut the backbone into 2 pieces and keep kinA's integrability.

Modern biology uses computational simulations of models for validation as well as to predict key experiments and suitable designs for specific applications. Despite of the fact that the experience with and the mere amount of algorithms and code dedicated to biological systems is growing exponentially these days, big data evaluation such as sequence analysis and multidimensional problems such as protein folding still consume vast amounts of computational resources. Therefore main aspects of biological science are only accessible to research institutions that provide these resources in form of supercomputers or computer clusters. In order to open computational biology up to all future iGEM teams in a manner that is not dependant of institutional affiliations, we decided to develop a platform from a set of applications that build upon the BOINC framework for distributed computing ( Details on Software ). Thereby we provide access to computing power for future (community lab) iGEM teams and at the same time create an opening for laymen to jump in and empower science!
BOINC and iGEM - Foundations of a rewarding relationship
The BOINC framework distributes computational tasks to volunteers who provide computational resources in form of calculation time spent by the CPU of their idling personal computers. Volunteers download and install a client software that receives work packages from a central server unit and runs calculations once the computer is not in use. Alternatively users may dedicate a certain percentage of their computing power to destributed computing projects that they like to support. After the successful execution of the computation the result is uploaded to our server.
One of the best known distributed computing projects is SETI@home , a project in which volunteers contribute computing power to the search for extra-terrestrial intellegance. In our case the need for computing power arose from the calculations needed to evaluate the linker model that provides rigid linkers for the circularization of proteins. In both cases the contributors are rewarded with points that reflect the computing time already spent and the dedication towards certain projects. In order to take motivation to the next level we implemented a platform that allows to feed information to the BOINC screensaver (figure 1). Thereby we enable iGEM teams from all over the world to reach an interested and motivated audience with information about their projects, Human Practices activities and iGEM and Synthetic Biology in general. In return users of iGEM@home will be rewarded with informations and insights into one of the most vital communities in science that catch their attention in the very moment they get back to their computers.
Outreach
The need to build a vivid community is key to run a successful distributed computing project. As the project depends on the voluntary support of people it is important to get people enthused about"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Supporting Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," and use of society. Although iGEM is an open source competition that does not in itself focus on business creation, it begs to question what the possibilities could be if it did. Entrepreneurship uses the market to find a problem and solve it. By using business methods as a scaling method, biotechnology can provide solutions for a larger variety of problems and to a greater number of people. In sum, biotech entrepreneurship is a mechanism for spreading good ideas and making useful products available to those that need them.
Furthermore, understanding enabling factors in biotech entrepreneurship can help bring awareness to biotech and promote entrepreneurship for iGEM participants and scientists everywhere. Therefore, the aim of this research is to establish the most significant enabling factors in relation to biotech and synthetic biology (SynBio). From there, future steps can be made to promote entrepreneurship in the scientific realm.
The analysis will begin with a presentation of the hypothesis, research model and objectives. The next sections provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the research. The concluding sections involve a list of suggestions and next-steps on how the data can be used for entrepreneurship.
Research Question, Research Objective and Research Design
Our theory holds that if certain enabling factors exist for biotech business creation and success, then biotech businesses will be founded. If this is true, then further research is needed to understand the enabling factors in biotech entrepreneurship in order to further promote its success. We assume that the factors that facilitate business creation and biotech innovation also extend to the realm of biotech entrepreneurship.
Research Objective 1: Establishing a theoretically grounded framework to understand the enabling factors that facilitate entrepreneurship in biotechnology.
Research Objective 2: Substantiate the theoretical framework and investigate the motives, barriers and decision criteria that leads to business creation in biotechnology and SynBio.
Research Objective 3: Establish the most important factors that lead to or prevent business creation in biotechnology and synthetic biology within the context of iGEM.
Research Model
To answer the objectives, this research draws on a combined multi-method empirical study, linking a qualitative and quantitative approach to understand entrepreneurship in biotechnology and SynBio. By combining qualitative and quantitative data, the research benefits from the advantages of both approaches. Qualitative data can capture the causal process of a certain phenomenon and substantiate the hypothesis derived from literature in order to answer research questions behind the enabling factors in biotechnology entrepreneurship [1] . On the other hand, quantitative data allows testing on a large scale as a greater spectrum of observations can be tested. This strategic combination will create a better understanding of significant factors in biotech entrepreneurship.

They directed us to National Cheng Kung university who actually treats the waste for them. The university uses chemicals and burning to aggregate NPs. Through literature research, we discovered that burning NPs is the most prevalent way for removal, however it is not 100% effective at removing all types of nanomaterials (Marr et. al. 2013). (Interviewed by Katherine H, Audrey T. and Christine C.)
Public Opinion
Survey Results
We created a survey that helped us identify public knowledge and misconceptions about synthetic biology and NP usage. Over 240 people completed the survey. (Survey created by Abby H., Christine C. and Emily C.)
Here are some results from our survey:
General Questions
The majority of people think that gene modification is acceptable if the goal is to save or improve quality of life; however, it is not acceptable for non-medical related reasons, such as changing hair or eye color. In addition, most people do not have a preference between chemical or biological drug synthesis. These results suggest that people are accepting of genetic engineering when it is related to health and medicine.
Environmentally, people are extremely concerned with the wastewater that enters the ocean and the river. This gives weight to our project, because the quality of water is an important concern for the general public.
Two examples of general questions from our survey. (Left) 87% (201 out of 243 total responses) think that genes should be modified if the goal is to save or improve quality of life. (Right) 96.7% of the people surveyed care about the quality of wastewater (236 out of 244 total responses).Figure: Christine C.
Project-Specific Questions
The majority of people have heard of NPs and know that NPs are used in consumer products; however, they do not know why NPs are used.
Most people believe that the government and NP manufacturers should share responsibility for the regulation of NP usage and disposal.
Two examples of project-specific questions from our survey. (Left) A majority of the people we asked (58.6%) do not know why NPs are used in consumer products (143 out of 244 total responses). (Right) People believe that NP manufacturers and the government (including WWTPs) are most responsible for the regulation of NP usage and disposal. Figure: Christine C.

The result shows that the pT181 antisense is not harmful to the E.coli, which provides convenience for test for fluorescence as we do not need to normalize the OD600.
Fig.2 Characterization of pT181 attenuator in DH5-α E.coli cells. The figures show the fluorescence for cells with or without pT181 antisense. (a) Fluorescence monitored over time for cell lines incorporating the pT181 system with pT181 antisense. It shows that the GFP can be expressed in the pT181-attenuator, and the expression level increases gradually. (b) Fluorescence monitored over time for cell lines incorporating the pT181 system without pT181 antisense. It matches the curve of how GFP’s expression increases without being repressed, which establishes foundation for measure the repression effect of pT181-attenuator. (c) The combination of (a) and (b). We could see the sharp difference in the fluorescence between the two curves. This proves our pT181 could repress the expression of GFP as expected, which means our part C is able to produces repression effect as anticipated. This shows that the controller in our Three-Node Feedback Loop is constructed successfully.

Comparasion
We achieved several improvements compared with Kyoto pT181 BBa_K1126003( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1126003 ).
We are utilizing a dual control repressor, where both transcription and translation from the target gene is repressed, rather than only repressing on the transcriptional level, to regulate in a fast and robust way.
In order to know how the characteristics change, we constructed a plasmid with both dual control pT181 antisense, dual control pT181 sense target and a GFP, as well as a plasmid with a dual control pT181 sense target and a GFP. We also construct a plasmid, in which the GFP is under the control of the pT181 antisense and pT181 sense target used by Kyoto.

Wir haben das GL2 gefragt, ob sie uns bei unser Projekt mit Sequenzierungen unterstützen können. Danach hat jede Gruppe neue Ergebnisse und Fortschritte vorgetragen. Gruppe 1 hat Probleme mit ihren „Schwimmversuchen“. Wir haben daraufhin entschieden andere Konditionen zu testen, wie zum Beispiel das Animpfen mit verschiedenen Volumen der Zellkulturen und niedrigeren Nähstoffen im Medium.

In fact, before our arrival, we thought to work together on a project of Human Practice, addressing lectures related to iGEM and synthetic biology to high school students in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum, as a continuation and expansion of our HP project Sowing Tomorrow Synthetic Biologists . We provided event planning and contacted with the person in charge of museum, ZJU designed and printed the post and tried to contact with teachers of several high schools in Hangzhou. However, due to summer holidays, it was difficult to call together high school students. At last, we had to give up this collaboration. However, we still motivated members of ZJU iGEM to continue propagating Synthetic Biology to high school students in Hangzhou. In fact, they did a good job after we came back to Beijing!

Society
For a bright future in the field of synthetic biology, we team Chalmers-Gothenburg, consider it to be  of great importance to inform the society about the benefits of synthetic biology as well as having an open debate regarding the ethics. In a democratic society, the laws are legislated by the politicians representing the citizens. These laws control the development within the field of synthetic biology, and for people to be able to make informed political decisions, knowledge is key. As a team, we were interested in the public opinion regarding synthetic biology and genetic modification and thereby decided to conduct a survey about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in cooperation with team Czech Republic. After finishing the survey, we also took the opportunity to inform the people about GMO and synthetic biology. To further reach out to the general public, we used the media, such as the swedish radio, magazines and social media.
Survey
In today’s society there is still controversy and some taboo regarding synthetic biology and specifically the, to the public more well-known, term GMO. Opposition is something synthetic biologists of today and of the future, many of those present at the Giant Jamboree, will continue to face. A lot of work lies ahead in order to receive more acceptence outside the scientific community.
A general feeling our team has had is that a lot of people dislike GMOs but that acceptance is slowly increasing. As for the reasons why the general public dislikes GMOs, they can be thoroughly discussed for a long time but one thing that quickly comes to mind is lack of knowledge. To get an idea where scientists stands on GMOs versus the general public, we devised a survey which was handed to both academics at Chalmers and which we asked people about in the streets of Gothenburg. In addition, we sent our survey to team Czech Republic. They also asked the public and academics at their university to answer the survey and we’ve then looked at the results to observe differences and similarities between the public in Sweden and in the Czech Republic. The results were compared in regards to education and gender as well.

Who are team CLSB?
Team CLSB UK is an iGEM team from the United Kingdom on the High School track. They have 20 team members. Would you like to search for another team, search for a part or exit?
Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Repeat
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Back
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.
Privacy
You can find out how we use data provided to the app in our privacy policy . We think it’s truly a gripping read.

The above picture illustrates the mechanism of the cell-lysis
As the device comes with no promotor, a variety of promoters could be installed to control cell-lysis.
It should be pointed out that antiholin has its own constitutive promoter to prevent formation of holin multimers from basal expression. It is of importance as when the device is turned off, relatively higher expression of antiholin is needed and necessary for better stability of the device.
below is another gene we found it possible to achieve the cell-lysis
Gene E from Bacteriophage phiX174
The figure shows the location of gene E in the phiX174 genome (YOUNG, MICROBIOLOGIcAL REVIEWS, Sept. 1992,Vol. 56, No. 3)
Gene E is the killing gene in the bacteriophage phiX174. Expression of gene E lead to lysis of the cell.
Lysis works without  elaborating a lytic enzyme, lysozyme
Small, phase-dark spherical bulges or blebs were developed in host cells
These blebs are able to grow as large as the summed volumes of the residual rod-shaped portions of the cell.
Spherical bodies become freed and emptied to become broken ghosts
They become less refractile and leaving visible membranous debris
Some blebs burst and other phage are released
Small lesions which are also called transmembrane tunnels start to appear
Lesions cause destruction of inner and outer membrane
Small holes at specific and distinct location in the cell formed
Sudden collapse of membrane integrity can be caused
The membrane potential and osmotic gradient across envelop collapsed
Changes in our plans
As a team we decided to make changes to our original goal of creating a bio-safety net to be implemented into an oil degrading bacteria, due to difficulties we encountered and the time constraints on our project.
Difficulties
Oil is a mixture of chemicals composed mainly of hydrocarbons such as alkanes, carboxylic acids and various other aromatic compounds. As a direct result of this crude oil as a whole component cannot be relied upon to induce any promoter, since the promoters available to us may only be induced by certain chemical compounds (not a mixture) and because it is very difficult to target a specific component in crude oil. After assessing the feasibility of using a true oil degrading mechanism, we have concluded that it would be far too difficult to implement such a system into an E. Coli within the time period available to us.

NPN-Assay
The funtionality of the outer membrane porin OprF ( BBa_K1172507 ) in E.coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF was investigated with a NPN-Uptake-Assay ( Cheng et al., 2005 ).
1-N-Phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) changes fluorescence activity between aqueous and hydrophobic milieus. There is only minor fluorescence in aqueous solution, but the transport in the hydrophobic periplasmatic space causes an increased fluorescence. So NPN fluorescence is a good indicator for membrane permeability. Expression of the outer membrane porines OprF effect an increasing membrane permeability.( Loh et al., 1984 )
Figure 2: Results of the NPN-Uptake-Assay . Comparison between Escherichia coli KRX wildtype and Escherichia coli KRX with BBa_K1172507 , BBa_K1172502 and Escherichia coli KRX with genome integrated oprF gene ( E.coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF ).
Figure 2 shows the results of the NPN-Uptake-Assay. Higher fluorescence emission and higher membrane permeability could be observed with increasing promotor strength for oprF. The genome integrated oprF shows mid-level fluorescence emission and membrane permeability. Highest fluorescence levels could be measured with the oprF gene on a high-copy pSB1C3 plasmid under control of the T7 promotor.
Genome integrated oprF showed almost the same membrane permeability as the constitutive expressed oprF with BBa_K1172507 . There even seems to be a marginal higher expression of the genome integrated oprF in contrast to the plasmid coded oprF although the same constitutive promotor ( BBa_J23104 ) is used. This could be explained by physiological condition of the cell. Constitutive expression of the high-copy oprF causes cell stress. Protein expression could be automatically downregulated by the cells. The single-copy genome integrated oprF showed a reduced expression level, therefor cell stress is also smaller. As a consequence E. coli cells showed a more effective expression of the outer membrane porin OprF adjusted on physiological cell condition.

Given that all basic researches aim at application and benefiting for human beings, we supposed that visiting the biotechnology companies to investigate the prospect of our project is a great idea. We went to the BGI, Qingdao Youdu Biotechnology Co.LTD and Qingdao Bright Moon Seaweed Group Co.LTD to integrate our project with social reality and communicate with technical staff in these companies.
In this way, we learned about the current social needs and improved our project accordingly. At the same time, we established a long-term relationship with them. On the one hand, they can provide us an effective way of converting foundational research to actual application, on the other hand, we will inform them of the latest results in the lab, by which we can promote each other and make progress together.Fially, we form a research
report about our experience.
2.2.1 BGI
Firstly, we visited BGI research institute. BGI is the world's largest genomics research institute that applies scientific research results in the fields of medical health, agricultural breeding and resource conservation. It is committed to promoting the transformation of genetic science and technology, so as to bring benefits to human. We introduced our project to BGI researchers and visited the company's laboratory and breeding area.
The researchers in the gene editing laboratory evaluated our project and proposed new application directions for our project, suggesting that we can apply the genetic circuit to the anabolic design of engineered bacteria and combine it with some industries such as fermentation engineering. At the same time, they told us that their lab was also trying to apply gene-editing techniques to the genetic breeding of Marine economic fish, which may also provide us with some ideas. We are very grateful to BIG for their valuable advice and they also encouraged us to combine our project with their labs. We will keep in touch with BGI in the future.
Fig.12 BGI introduced their latest production to us.
Fig.13 BGI gave us some advice on our project and it really enlightened us.
2.2.2 Marine Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences
Inspired by BGI researchers, we arrived at the Marine animal molecular developmental biology and evolution laboratory of the institute of oceanology, Chinese academy of sciences. The main research direction of the laboratory is the development of gene resources and germplasm improvement of mariculture fish, which provides breeding materials and new breeding methods for the breeding of improved species of blue agricultural mariculture animals. Under the guidance of the researchers, we visited the laboratory and learned about the history of the laboratory as well as the results of the innovative research on Marine fish germplasm"

Methods
To study cell lysis, the absorbance of fresh blood cells was measured without NRP products in comparison to fresh blood spiked with tyrocidine. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded between 300-800 nm using three different devices; in cuvettes, by nanodrop, and on a DS-11 + Spectrophotometer (DeNovix). The concentration of NRP was varied between samples to determine cytotoxicity of tyrocidine and sensitivity of red blood cells. A detailed description of the experiments can be found under  Lab NoteBook .
Results
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of red blood cells suspended in the absence or presence of antibiotic (Figure 1) proves toxicity of tyrocidine towards blood cells. For our test the antibiotic used was Tyrothricin, which is composed of 5 different tyrocidine varieties and gramacidin produced by Brevibacillus parabrevis. The drop of the green curve around 600 nm indicates that red blood cells absorbs less at this wavelength. When the curve reaches 0,  it is an indication of cell lysis.

The Role of Synthetic Biology in Energy Transition
To broaden our horizon and understanding of the possibilities of synthetic biology, we joined a multi-stakeholder dialogue that was organized to discuss the role of synthetic biology in energy transition, by the Athena institute and the Rathenau institute. There is a general belief that something needs to change about the current Dutch energy supply, and during this dialogue we brainstormed about how synthetic biology could be of help achieving this. In a guided way, we generated ideas about applications of synthetic biology for energy supply, starting from future society-scenario’s created the day before. The nice thing about this approach was that we learned about"

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," indicator that indeed biofilm formation was inhibited and the E. coli were able to spread faster. Compared to our other tested constructs we got the most reliable results for yhjH. However the positive effect on motility was not present when we used M9 minimal medium swimming agar. Here, yhjH-transformed cells usually did not show a strong tendency for swimming. This result suggests that the motility-effects of YhjH are somehow nutrient-dependent and therefore depend on the used media.
fliC
Fig. 7: The fliC gene encodes for flagellin, which represents the single subunits of the flagellar filament. The used E. coli strains (DH10B, BL21, XL1 Blue and DH5α) are typical laboratory strains with degenerated flagella and thus reduced motility (A).  We assume that the overexpression of fliC might lead to the incorporation of further flagellin subunits and hence to longer flagella compared to earlier (B).  The electron microscope image (C) features the flagella of the strain MG1655, which still possesses unimpaired, long flagella. Our aim is to restore the phenotype of  the laboratory strains flagella and to receive a length comparable to that of MG1655.

Flagellin, the product of the fliC gene is the structural protein that builds up the filament of the bacterial flagellum (Fig. 7). By overexpressing fliC we hope to construct longer flagella which might have a positive impact on swimming speed (Furuo et al. 1997). At the same time we were aware that overlong flagella might cause adverse effects due to an obstructive architecture.
The fliC gene was amplified from DH10B E. coli genomic DNA and contained four forbidden restriction sites. We had to mutate all these sites via overlap PCR. A description for this method can be found here .
Results
Our overlap PCR for the mutation of three PstI and one SpeI sites worked efficiently and fast. The resulting PCR product was not cut by any BioBrick standard 10 enzymes.
In order to avoid too strong levels of expression we included 1kb of the upstream region for most of the assays to allow a certain level of regulation in the cells. Like yhjH-transformants these strains showed increased motility in almost all of our assays (Fig. 6"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html,". When the toxin-producing bacteria perish, the subpopulation survives. As the survivors are genetically identical to the rest of the population, they are able to initiate a new growth phase and subsequently new toxin production.
The high toxin expression is needed to induce significant damage to the Varroa population. It is known that longer-term, low-dose exposure of a pesticide to the target organism can cause resistance 1 . Ideally, the toxin is only expressed when the target organism is present. To further optimize toxin expression, two measures to regulate expression were explored. BeeT was designed to sense the presence of Varroa destructor through the use of two riboswitches: one senses guanine, the other senses vitamin B12. Both are normally not present in beehives, but indicate the presence of the mite as guanine is a major component of mite faeces and B12 is present in the haemolymph of the bees. When a mite attaches itself to a bee to feed on the haemolymph, BeeT will be able to sense it.
Lastly, we aimed to combine the riboswitch and part of the light kill switch . A hybrid promoter was designed that ensures continuous toxin production after transient sensing of the mite, but shuts off production when BeeT escapes from the hive and is exposed to light.
Varroa Mite Detection
Design of a Mite Sensing Device Based on Riboswitches
To prevent toxin expression when the mite is not present, we have created a mite sensing device that can regulate toxin expression using riboswitches. Substances that indicate the presence of the mite are guanine, since 95% of the mite faeces consist of guanine 1 and vitamin B12, since this vitamin is present in the haemolymph of insects.

Guanine and vitamin B12 sensitive riboswitches were used to design the system. Riboswitches are mRNA domains that can regulate gene expression depending on if it is bound to a ligand. E. coli possesses a vitamin B12 riboswitch that regulates the expression of the btuB genes 2 . It also possesses B12 receptors on its outer membrane, allowing vitamin B12 uptake 3 . The vitamin B12 btuB riboswitch will be used to design a system that will start gene expression in the presence of vitamin B12. For the guanine rib"

Figure 5: Ligation control of has2 and pSMF2.1. The approach with ligase shows the three typical bands of restricted plasmid (6510 bp), has2 insert (1693 bp) and ligation product pSMF2.1-has2 (8210 bp). Without ligase there is no ligation product. Additionally the religation of the MluⅠ and SacⅠ digested pSMF2.1 plasmid has obviously been very inefficient as the restricted plasmid is still detectable at 6510 bp.
Lane 1: pSMF2.1 + has2 (with ligase)
Lane 2: pSMF2.1 + has2 (without ligase)
Lane 3: pSMF2.1 (without ligase)
After transformation of competent E. coli cells with the resulting pSMF2.1-has2 construct and selection on ampicillin agar plates, plasmid DNA of transformants was isolated and presence of has2 insert DNA was checked by control digestion. Figure 6 shows the result for one representative E. coli transformant.
Figure 6: Control digestion with SacⅠ and MluⅠof plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli cells that were transformed with pSMF2.1-has2 construct. Both pSMF2.1 plasmid DNA at 6510 bp and has2 insert DNA at 1693 bp are evident and indicate a successful ligation and transformation with the pSMF2.1-has2 construct.
Lane 1: pSMF2.1 + has2
Obviously the pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid was successfully absorbed by the E. coli transformant as both pSMF2.1 plasmid DNA at 6510 bp and has2 insert DNA at 1693 bp are visible after digestion with SacⅠ und MluⅠ. The isolated plasmid DNA was used in a following step for transformation of B. megaterium.
5. Cloning of the UDP-glcDH gene into pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid
In the same way the UDP-glucose-6-dehdyrogenase (UDP-glcDH) gene was cloned into the pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid. However, instead of an outsourced gene synthesis like in the case of has2, the UDP-glcDH gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of B. megaterium."

Our aims go beyond building the most efficient  photosynthetic biolamp, into trying to develop more robust and  simple designs based on bioluminescent vascular plants. These kind  of biolamps would be less energy-efficient, due to the lower  surface-volume quotient and amount of structural carbon, but would  be much easier to transport, manage, upkeep and commercialize.  Vascular plants are robust organisms with a wider tolerance to  changes in environmental conditions and independent of a broth  vessel and complex tube systems (as they have their own biological  structures for this function - xylems and phloems).
In first place, we would test of luminescence of S.  elongatus WT with psbA-luxAB as grown broth biolamp, to assess the  magnitude of the problem of pigment shading of luminescence.
The next step would be the transformation of  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii's chloroplast with the lux cassette under  ligth regulation .
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii:
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  is haploid unicellular green algae. It is about 10 micrometers long  and 3 wide and has two flagella. Much of its volume is occupied by  its only chloroplast which has 80 copies of its genome.  Chlamydomonas can grow by autotrophic or heterotrophic ways using  organic carbon and chemical energy sources.
This alga is widely spread  around the world and is one of mostly used laboratory organism. It  is used as model in studies of cellular movement, environmental  stimuli responses and photosynthetic and cellular recognition  studies.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"1-part (BBa_K2407107) from a Gal1-Vika plasmid we had used in our former lab work with specially designed primers for this procedure. After PCR, the Gal1 has the cutting sites for SalⅠand BsaⅠon both ends, and CYC1 has that for BsaⅠand BamhⅠon both ends. Meanwhile, the HO (BBa_K2407109) gene was obtained by gene synthesis, flanked by specific hangtags for BsaⅠin order to be cohesive with Gal1 (upstream) and CYC1 (downstream). Thus, we have built our composite part (GHC).
After the ligation ofGHC (BBa_K2407100) and PRS416 Plasmid (GHC-416), we transformed the E. coli for the augment of our new plasmid——GHC-416. We examined the transformation result by PCR method to amplify the HO gene in the E. coli which we randomly selected in the plate.

The result of mating type switching(MTS)
We transformed the chassis yeasts for the new device——GHC-416, the new yeasts we selected in the Sc-Ura plate is named as SynⅩ-dUra-416.
In this section, we only got to test the Gal System due to time limit. And we figured that the result for Gal System is adequately enough to represent the feasibility of our designed strategy for MTS.
The whole test process can be divided into three steps.
1) Step one
Activate the Gal1 promoter. After that, the expression of HO gene in the SynⅩ-dUra-416 can be initiated.
2)   Step two

Growth Curve
As the measurements are carried out in six batches, the growth of mutants of the same batch are similar but differed a little among batches. This implies that GFP expression does not have any significant effect on the bacteris's growth.
1AT denotes A of base pair 1 is changed to T, the same is applied for other notations of RBS mutants.
GFP Readings
The GFP fluorescence readings of mutants shows interesting results. Although the growth curve is similar among mutants, fluorescence intensities varied among the mutants. In summary, it was found that substitution mutations occurring to the AGGAG sequence within BBa_R0034, AAAGAGGAGAAA, showed a decreased GFP expression while others showed increased GFP output. Especially for mutations to base pair 7, GFP expression is near total-depression.
After normalising the GFP fluorescence readings with the OD600 at T=8, the ratio of the normalised fluorescence of the mutants to wild type RBS is computed and plotted as shown.
We also spotted the mutants on an LB agar plate to have a qualitative view of the GFP brightness. The culture is diluted to OD600 = 0.4 then 3uL of the culture is spotted on to the agar. Brightness of these spots parallels the results in the above graph. For example, 7GA, 8AG and 9GA is the brightest among the mutations on their respective base pairs while 12AC and 11AC are the darkest.
Lactate Metabolism
Preliminary work in the Tan lab indicated that over-expressing the permease and dehydrogenase genes from Pseudomonas has the potential to improve electrical current output See Here . Hence, we sought to engineer these enzymes to improve them further. In particular, we randomly mutagenize the genes to generate missense mutations.

The resulting distribution had, as the observed one, a nonzero maximum, and a mean between 60° and 70°. However, the standard deviation was 47°, 11° higher than the observed one of 36°.
Angular Velocity during Directed Movement
Different to the angular velocity during tumbling, the angular velocity during directed movement phases can be drawn from a tuned distribution to fully reproduce the experimental data (see [1] ): mean of 23° and standard deviation of also 23°. We assumed that the angular speed during one time step is normally distributed with zero mean and a standard deviation of σ. Thus, as one directed movement period consists of N=<run length>/Δt integration steps, the change in angle after one directed movement period has zero mean and a standard deviation of
σrun=σ Δt N½ = σ<run length>½Δt½.
The literature values of change in angle are however given as absolute values. This corresponds to calculating χ-distribution of the angular change, which has in this case the mean value of μχ=(2/π)½σrun and a standard deviation of σχ=σrun. Since (2/π)½≈0.8 and thus the resulting mean and standard deviations are similar to each other as experimentally observed, we have chosen a standard deviation of
σ=(π/2)23°<run length>-½Δt-½for our model. The resulting distribution of the angular change during directed movement periods resembles closely to the experimentally available values (see simulation results ).
Simulation Results
For our simulations, we have chosen a timestep Δt=0.03s, which is around five times smaller than the smallest time constants in the cell motility model, as well as over ten times smaller than the time constant with which the CheYp concentration changes in the molecular model (for details, see optimal experimental design ).
Evaluation of the Model
To evaluate the movement model, we performed several long time simulations under constant conditions (bias set to its wild-type steady state value of around 0.85) and determined its characteristics which might be compared to the known properties of the motility of E. coli cells as given in [1] and described above.

This diagram shows the answer rate to what the public thinks, concerning if GMOs should be used in research about biological fuels where the answers variated from ""Agree completely"" to ""Mainly do not agree"" on the x-axis and number of people on the y-axis.
As previously said, the results from this survey showed us that the public has poor knowledge of GMO:s. This means that we should communicate better to the public about GMO, their potential and how the scientific community use GMO. The reason we chose to ask the public and try to have the survey as random as possible, is due to the fact that we want to create a realistic representation of the public.   In conclusion, we found that the public of Linköping sees research about diseases as their top priority. People asked in the survey agreed more to the use of GMO:s in research about diseases, secondly pharmaceutical/medicine production and lastly industrial production.
We believe, and hope, that our composite part, BBa_K2671420, fulfils these wishes by being co-expressed with proteins related to neurodegenerative diseases. To fulfil the wishes of the public we chose to express the substrates Amyloid-ß1-42, Tau-0N4R and α-synuclein [1, 2, 3].

The following quotes are answers that were put under the section other in the survey. They have been translated freely from Swedish.
- I know very little about this!
- Good luck!!
- Good Luck! But remember that this [Synthetic Biology] is very a complex field, and  that there are some big ethical issues along the way!
- Generally, I'm very doubtful when it comes to manipulation of ""genetic material"", but I should learn more about this!
- I choose production of pharmaceuticals as my priority field because we need to help sick people. And second priority - Science, because we need to find resources to be able to find cures.
- I hope someone could find a cure for dementia.

Lactococcal membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial peptides. Hereby the bacteriocins induce metabolic changes by forming an open pore where nutrients diffuse out of the cell and therefore also morphological changes, which might result in the death of the bacteria or inhibition of its virulence factors. The bacteriocins are found to play a fundamental role in controlling pathogenic and non-wanted flora as well as establish beneficial bacterial populations and they thus serve as an alternative and/or supplement of traditional antibiotics used today, thereby facing the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
Gene localization and regulation
The bacteriocins are located in operons clusters. These clusters contain genes encoding the bacteriocin, corresponding immunity and furthermore genes that encodes peptides responsible for post translational modification Zacharof, M. P"

BIOFILM ENGINEERING
What are biofilms?
Biofilms are communities of microbes where the cells are in an aggregate on a surface, bound together by extra-membrane material made of a mixture of specialized carbohydrates and extra-membrane proteins. The special environment in the biofilm allows cells to survive harsher environments.
What is the “biofilm response”?
Bacteria cells can exist in multiple physiological states, which are caused by environmental factors. Common ones include heat shock, nutrient (carbohydrate or amino acid) starvation, metal micronutrient starvation, etc.
Gene expression in each of these physiological states is mediated by the changing the sigma factor involved in transcript synthesis. Each sigma factor has its own consensus sequence; the sigma factor on the RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to promoter regions. When a sigma factor is active, its effect is to shift which fractions of the genome are preferably expressed, because of the different promoter recognition consensus sequences. The sigma factor that is involved in the stationary phase (I.E. no motility, no reproduction) of E. coli strains is the σS factor. It directs the expression of genes necessary to induce biofilm and aggregation behavior are a subset of those genes whose promoters are recognized by the σSfactor.
Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.

Panel Discussion
As a continuation of the webinars, our team decided to include the public opinion on how they feel about different ethical issues and questions surrounding biology. We wanted to organize a discussion that could engage not only students of biology and members of iGEM teams but also researchers and the general public. This would not be an easy task for a professional, let alone us, who never organized an event before. Fortunately, iGEM Stockholm was willing to share the responsibilities so we managed to organize a lively and interesting discussion in Stockholm - with three speakers who are the experts in the field of synthetic biology, legal matters, and ethical issues. The audience engagement during the discussion wasamazing and even exceeded our expectations. This created an interesting platform for us to learn more about how other people from different social and political background perceived biotechnology and its advancements.
Nordic Meetup
The iGEM Nordic Meetup (NIC) originated in Uppsala in 2015 as an opportunity to meet other teams from Northern Europe, get some feedback on your projects and to set ground for future collaborations for the teams. It became a tradition that the next NIC is hosted by a team that wins the best presentation contest during the meetup. This year, teams have met in Copenhagen at an event hosted by iGEM UCopenhagen. During the first day we bonded over games and activities provided by the team. The second day was spent with lectures helping us with various issues that we might run into during iGEM competition such as communication with media or ethical issues. Each team also presented their project and gained feedback from iGEM judges to adress possible critical issues they might experience. Lively discussions continued until late night hours with a BBQ dinner prepared. Best presentation award this year went to the newest team in the Nordic iGEM world: iGEM Lund. The voting by other iGEM teams' representatives was almost unanimous and in agreement with the judges' opinions. It was clear that iGEM Lund has almost never ending enthusiasm about their project and unique spirit and attitude among the teams! But even though we did not win the prize our team still got a shoutout from the judges for having a reasonable and interesting project. We also got a great and interesting feedback and suggestions from other teams that helped us a lot while progressing in the project. Thanks to NIC we got the chance to meet other teams that our close to us and it gave us a great base for the other collaborations we had during the competition. Teams represented at NIC:"
