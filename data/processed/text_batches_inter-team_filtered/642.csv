ZJU-China,2018,Team:ZJU-China#Matrix_-_-_TEXT.html," biofilm. Since there’re three orthogonal systems — SpyTag/SpyCatcher, SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher and SdyTag/SdyCatcher , we synthesized a string of three enzymes rather than one single Enzyme. The method is illustrated in Enzyme Scaffold .
As it was mentioned in the beginning, the curli fiber system serves as a mediator between enzymes and the electrodes. We have to pay attention to its efficiency. So, another thing we do is to insert histidine-tags into CsgA (the major subunit of the curli fiber) so that curli fibers can be specifically associated to NiNTA-AuNPs, and then to the electrodes. [2] With the help of NiNTA-AuNPs, electrons released by enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions are able to be delivered to the electrode much more quickly.
Results
We contacted Professor Botyanszki and obtained CsgA deficient strains and CsgA enhanced strains from ShanghaiTech University. We used nucleic acid gel electrophoresis to verify the reliability of the strain (Fig.2).

Results of agarose gel electrophoresis.CsgA is about 530bp.Bands are visible between 500bp and 750bp.The deficiency of band of knock-out strain is as expected. Lane 1: WT csgA; Lane 2-3: csgA knock out (PHL628-△csgA); Lane4: recombinant of csgA.
Then we transformed the modified Pet-26 into strains to express CsgA with SpyTag and Histag. Eventually, we have successfully expressed modified CsgA!

To further correlate curli production to activity, we used Quantitative Congo Red (CR) Binding Assays. The results showed that the strains overexpressing CsgA could absorb more Congo red and deposit on the bottom of EP tubes, thus reducing the absorbance of supernatant significantly (Fig.4).

Overview
When developing our Assemblase system, we strived to follow an engineering design procedure. As design is the first step of the ‘Design-Build-Test’ engineering paradigm, we felt it was important to consider all aspects of the Assemblase system to minimise the occurrence of downstream problems during the building and testing phases. Thus, we started our design process by researching and defining the need for our scaffold tool in the market, which then allowed us to develop a list of requirements to which our system should adhere. Following this, we went through design iterations, learning from modelling data and experimental results to ultimately arrive upon our finalised Assemblase scaffold design.
Defining a Need
In industry and research there has been a growing interest in the construction of novel metabolic pathways for the production of cheap and renewable products, as an alternative to synthetic chemistry1. However, as these biocatalytic pathways become more complex their productivity is diminished due to undesirable side reactions and low reaction rates.
One way that this can be addressed is through the development of scaffolds that co-localise enzymes from a multi-step pathway. Spatially organising enzymes to generate high local concentrations of substrate enhances metabolic flux and reduces the diversion of pathway intermediates into competing pathways2. This ultimately can lead to an increase in product titre, which has significant implications for complex novel metabolic pathways.
This approach mimics enzyme clustering that has frequently been observed in nature3. However, previous attempts to replicate this natural enzyme organisation have fallen short, with no commercially-viable modular tool available to facilitate enzyme clustering for the production of valuable metabolites. As such, the UNSW iGEM team decided to reflect on these past attempts and compile a list of requirements that would enable us to develop a versatile, commercially viable tool that could be used in laboratories and industry worldwide.
Functional Requirements
Having decided to develop an enzyme scaffold for use in biocatalytic systems, the team worked to compile a list of functional requirements (FRs) that our system would have to meet:
Given our research, it was evident that the"

NrtA: Supernatant of BG-11 submerged NrtA-engineered E.coli liquid culture.
The nitrate and nitrite concentration of NrtA and competent cell has slightly but not significant difference. The results imply that NrtA protein could capture nitrate and nitrite while the engineered NrtA-expressing E.coli cannot. The engineered E.coli with NrtA gene can express NrtA protein, while NrtA protein might be in the cytosol, so nitrate and nitrite concentration in the medium cannot be decreased. To make NrtA protein become a secreted protein, we are trying to construct signal peptide sequence into it, so that NrtA protein can be released to the medium.

Suicide Mechanism  Functional Test
Before we construct our suicide mechanism with NrtA, we want to make sure that our suicide mechanism, endolysin and holin, can be induced by lactose efficiently. Therefore, we tested our suicide mechanism by adding different concentrations of lactose in order to find out the minimum effective concentration. Furthermore, to induce E.coli suicide at the time we want, we also want to know the changing degree of the OD value of bacteria at different time points after the lactose is added.
We measured the OD600 value of the sample, and then aliquot liquid culture into several cuvettes. Next, we added a different amount of 0.5 mM lactose into cuvettes to form different concentrations of lactose, and measured the OD600 value per hour.
As the figure shows, the suicide mechanism is induced immediately when lactose is added into the samples. Besides, we can see that the lactose concentration and the degree of decline of OD value are positively correlated.
We also collaborate with team TAS Taipei. They helped"

PHB-production experiments
Calculations on M9 minimal media were done for the PHB production experiments. M9 salts were mixed with supplementation chemicals for the inoculation of PHB-producing bacteria. Stock solutions of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid were made for the VFA mixture. We required 5g/L of VFA within our final solution. The ratio from literature was a 1:2:1 ratio for propionic, acetic, and butyric acid. The final amount of the 5g/L stock solution we made from 99% acids was 2.86 mL of acetic stock solution, 2.07mL of butyric stock, and 2.01mL of propionic stock.
We prepared 12 overnight cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed A beta-oxidation for 24-hour growth. The bacteria in these tubes were added to M9 media with different chemical supplements.Detailed protocols for this inoculation can be found on our Experiments page.
After the flasks were inoculated with respective chemicals, they underwent 16-24 hours of inoculation following the 24-hour overnight growth of the cells. The next day, chemical extraction of the contents of flasks took place. The protocol followed was from the experiments performed by the secretion team when they were testing out past i"

5-24 to 5-29 Summary
During this week it was mainly my goal to make good competent cells.  I went through the process twice. The first time, I got 12 aliquots of 40uL because I miss read the final OD measurement, which made the cells concentrated. The second time, I got 40 aliquots of 40 uL and the final OD measurement within the 0.08-0.12 range.
To test the transformation efficiency, I used pBAD18 ligation product to transform for both series of competent cells (5-26 and 5-27). However, after poor growth results on the plates with the 5-27 culture, I questioned if the ligation product was correct to use.  To test for the transformation efficiency I was supposed to use an intact plasmid, such as miniprep product. So I re-did the efficiency test with 5-27 cells (5-26 cells were used) and used the pBAD34 miniprep product. The 10^-2 dilution plate to have 463 colonies, with the efficiency to be 2.74 x10^7 CFUs/ug
Also made point mutation primers for pBAD18 for the PstI second cut site in bla operon. I also made primers for the bile-induction promoter found in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM to use in its neotype strain, which is currently being sent to Prof. Jim Steele.

Risks in the Future
The system designed could be applied to many fungi. The fungicides used in our project are biological and specifically kill the fungi, and no other eukaryotic cells.
However, a malicious person could replace these fungicides by others which are more dangerous. Indeed our problem is that there is no regulation of the production of fungicides.
How to reduce these Future risks?
We have thought about several ways to minimize risks:
- we can build an auxotrophic strain of B. subtilis. The auxotrophy will be for proline, which is readily present in the plant's sap.
- we can build a non-sporulating strain ofB. subtilis. Sporulation is a bacterial mechanism used to survive through winter. Thus, our bacterial system sould not stay in the tree after the first year cycle.
- we can build a toxin/antitoxin system to avoid gene transfer between our optimized bacterium and any other wild-type bacteria.

How SMITe our integrated Human Practices iTECH model has shaped SMITe and it's future as a clinical application
SMITe has been molded and refined by interactions between all aspects of our human practices work from the very beginning of our entry into the competition. A schematic for how the exchange of ideas has influenced our project is as follows:
Original research presented to our chosen panel of supervisors
Feedback received which focused on modifying our choice of combat proteins due to possible host immune system interactions.
Presentation of basic ideas to the Bio-hacking community of Stockholm at their annual conference- Evolving
Initial consideration of 'real life' issues: how to effectively communicate the principles of the project to the wider non-scientific community, as well as practical questions on what stage of biofilm formation to target for optimal usefulness.
Revised project plan presented at NiC- Community
Further refinement regarding best candidate combat proteins for our project and modifications to methods, based on feedback from other Nordic teams at the Mini-Jamboree. Movement away from targeting quorum sensing mechanisms.
Discussion and advice received following contact with Professor Adekile Adekunle
Guidance towards incorporation of nature’s antimicrobials, ultimately giving rise to research into defensin 1.
Inclusion and further research into defensin 1  lead to deeper consideration of world issues- Health
The increasingly-apparent need for an antimicrobial or antibiotic action incorporated into SMITe was realised; the spotlight naturally then fell on to problems posed by antibiotic resistance
Contact and discussion with clinical microbiologist further highlighted clinical consequences of antibiotic resistance- Health
Development of teaching programs related to this area - Teaching & Community

PowerLeaf - A Bacterial Solar Battery
ENERGY MADE BEAUTIFUL
Abstract
With the PowerLeaf, iGEM SDU is introducing a novel solution for long-term storage of solar energy, thus becoming an alternative to solar cells, without using environmentally harmful resources. We aim to accomplish this through the creation of a device visually shaped to resemble a plant leaf, thereby providing a nature-in-city ambience. The team invested heavily in public engagement and collaborations to investigate how the device hypothetically could be implemented into an urban environment. From a technical perspective, the bacterial solar battery is composed of an energy storing unit and an energy converting unit. The energy storing unit is defined by a genetically engineered Escherichia coli, that fixates carbon dioxide into the chemically stable polymer cellulose, while the energy converting unit uses genetically engineered Escherichia coli to consume the stored cellulose. Electrons retrieved from this process, are transferred to an anode by optimised nanowires, thereby creating an electrical current. Last but not least, the energy storing unit has a light-dependent system, which activates dormancy during nighttime to reduce energy lost by metabolism.
A green project, a green wiki, and a great performance in the iGEM Goes Green initiative! Green just got greener.

About Our Green Wiki
Our project is all about ensuring a greener and more sustainable future for ourselves and the coming generations. This of course meant, that our wiki had to to follow this purpose as well. CO2 Neutral Website sponsored our wiki with a CO2 offset equal to the amount of CO2 produced by having the wiki running until October 31 2018. This does not mean the wiki is CO2 neutral in itself, but that the offset, equal to its pollution, is compensated. Compensating an offset could for example be global initiatives like replacing stoves in Africa with energy efficient stoves and building new, renewable energy sources. Also companies will be instructed in reducing their CO2 offset.

Bezüglich des Themas „Human Practise“ haben wir uns auf einen auf einen Umfrage im Rahmen der synthetischen Biologie in der Göttinger Innenstadt geeinigt. Darauf aufbauen soll eine Podiumsdiskussion in der die Umfrageergebnisse vorstellt und diskutiert werden sollen. Gruppe eins konnte den schnellsten Stamm bestimmen, jedoch nur nach drei Tagen Inkubationszeit. Unterschiede zwischen den verschiedenen Promoterstärken konnte nicht nachgewiesen werden. Es konnte jedoch für das Tar Insert eine Bewegung in Richtung Trypton für die verschiedenen Promotoren gesehen werden.  Gruppe zwei hat 5 verschiedene Gene isoliert und kloniert diese in die BioBrick Vektoren. Gruppe drei hat den ersten Durchgang für die Mutation Bibliothek beendet, jedoch war der Ertrag der Kolonien sehr gering und eine Wiederholung des Durchganges ist geplant.
04. Juli 2012,Es werde Licht!
Wir haben endlich ein Lichtmikroskop in unserem Labor! Nun können wir sehen, ob die Stämme überhaupt laufen.  Gruppe 1 untersucht derweil die gerichtete Bewegung in anderen Stämmen und versucht jetzt herauszufinden welcher Promoter am besten geeignet ist.   Gruppe 2 startet mit der Selektion anderer Proteine, deren Überexpression die „schwimm“ Eigenschaften der Stämme verbessern"

The government of the United States of America is the federal government of the republic of fifty states that constitute the United States, as well as one capital district, and several other territories. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the President, and the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.

ADOPE
The aim of ADOPE is to develop a complete method for gene doping detection. The design of this method was an iterative process, with constant evolutions based on data obtained from wetlab, drylab and interaction with stakeholders. The final method consists of four main steps: sample preparation , prescreening , targeted library preparation and DNA sequencing and analysis .
Figure 1. The flow diagram of our detection method ADOPE. With the four steps sample preparation, prescreening, library preparation and sequencing.
1. Sample Preparation
The target of our detection method is the specific gene doping DNA, which is extracted from blood samples. Based on the advice and expertise of Aïcha Ait Soussan and Dr. Ellen van der Schoot of the Dutch blood bank"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Modelling#Gold Recovery_-_-_TEXT.html," workflow for the isolation of gold from printed circuit boards using delftibactin and compare its potential financial impact to a state of the art method
for gold recovery, which also utilizes the same leaching agent (aqua regia).
Suggested Workflow
Figure 1: Comparison of the two processes for recovery of gold from electronic trash. In both cases aqua regia is used in order to dissolve the metals and then in the one case delftibactin can be immediately applied, while in the other one several chemical steps have to be followed.
General overview
Our proposed method is compared to a state of the art publication, which builds upon several patents [2]. This method was chosen, because it starts with exactly the same steps as our proposed workflow, namely dissolution in aqua regia and neutralization with NaOH and also aims at gold recovery, thus making the comparison possible. On the other hand, in order to selectively extract gold from the aqua regia solutions many more chemical reactions, extraction using dibutyl carbitol from now on abbreviated as DBC, chromatography and reduction of the gold ions are necessary. This is contrasted to our method, in which delftibactin binds selectively to gold ions and then also reduces them with no need for previous dispose other metal ions potentially contaminating the final product.
The two compared processes are summarized in Fig.1
So as to benchmark the efficiency of gold recycling using recombinantly produced delfibactin to chemical methods, the costs of the latter had to be estimated..
Those are calculated based on stoichiometric equations which we derived from the chemical process description published by Byoung et al.

Protocols.io & ProtoCat
     Our relationship with protocols.io has grown into a very rewarding partnership over the course of this last year. In the 2016 season we took the first steps to build a relationship with the company, having several meetings with their head of outreach, and out of those meetings came the idea for a project that we have been developing since the summer. This iGEM season we have created a conversion tool that easily imports protocols between protocols.io and ProtoCat. This tool takes the output of the protocols.io API, and generates a ProtoCat protocol with the same content. This makes the gap between the two services just a bit smaller, as the major overhead of leveraging the benefits of both services was in the re-upload process.
      Our organizations share the goal of improving protocol reproducibility, and the creation of this tool breaks through the biggest technical barrier that our common goal faces. Easy transfer of protocol across repositories will make it even easier for scientists to share their protocol and improve their experiments. This relationship not only helps ProtoCat and Michigan Software grow, providing a valuable opportunity for our team members to interact with industry professionals, but also removes the possibility of tensions arising in the future between our two organizations. In fact, when we send protocols.io the news that the conversion tool was up and running, their response was ""This is cool!"" and were happy to see people making use of their APIs.

1-1 光の三原色の利用
私たちは光の三原色(赤、緑、青)を利用することを考えました。色の素となるタンパク質には、蛍光タンパク質を使用しました。赤色はRFP、緑色はGFP、青色はCFPです。これらの蛍光タンパク質は紫外線を照射すると蛍光色を発し、レポーター遺伝子として遺伝子工学の分野ではすでに広く普及しています。これを用いて赤・緑・青の3色を大腸菌に作らせ、それぞれの色をつかさどるタンパク質の発現量を調節することにより、様々な比で赤・緑・青を混ぜ合わせ無数の色を作らせることができるのです。
これを実現するために図のような遺伝子を新たにデザインしました。
このマルチ遺伝子カセットで、RFP(赤)、CFP(緑)、CFP(青)をコードする遺伝子は縦列関係にあり、それぞれの遺伝子は異なった活性を持つ異なったプロモーターによって制御されています。無数の色を作るするためには、これらの蛍光タンパク質を異なった比率で作り出されなければなりません。これは異なった活性を持つプロモーターを利用することによって達成できます。

NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," drugs enter mainly from the artery to surround the tumor, and block the blood vessel supplying nutrients for cancer cells, commonly known as ""starve cancer cells"".
Chemotherapy treatment costs 5-6k RMB (around 890$) each time, and interventional treatment charges the same. Medicare reimbursement for cancer patients covers about 50% of the expense, including repayment for about 90% of drugs costs, but this does not include imported drugs or molecular targeted drugs.
Mr. Zheng also had a good knowledge of gene therapy and other new therapies. From the perspective of patient and his family, gene therapy in Japan is currently more advanced and developed, including a relatively well-known therapy called AK therapy. The patient told us that, molecular targeted therapy treatment can cost hundreds of thousands RMB per years. Molecular targeted drug costs as high as 20 thousands RMB (30,000$) per month. Added with fees of chemotherapy and infusion of nutritional supplement, the monthly treatment will be costing at least 30 thousand (4,500$) RMB. Therefore, Mr. Zheng cannot afford the treating charges, although he believes that treatment consisting of chemotherapy controling the disease and targeted drugs is ideal.
At present, the unaffordable price of molecular targeted drugs still block the way towards actual clinical use.
Ms. Meng (30-year-old)      Gastric cancer sufferer
Several months ago, Ms. Meng felt stomach pain very occasionally, but she thought it was just a small stomach problem. Until an examination in May 23rd, 2016, Ms. Meng was told that it was gastric cancer. So far she has been treated for nearly half a year.
Now Ms. Meng mainly takes the treatment of chemotherapy combined with medicine taken orally. Her treatment period is 3 days chemical injection every 24 days and her temporary treatment cost is about 20k RMB (3,000$) as she has just started chemotherapy. Ms. Meng quitted her own work, and her husband frequently ask for time off work to take care of her. Currently the treatment cost has became a massive burden for her family. At present, the main side effects of chemotherapy on Ms. Meng is nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite etc..
Since Ms. Meng hasn’t been treated for a long time, she did not know much about the updating treatment method specifically. As for the molecular targeted therapy, she has only heard of it. Ms. Meng decided to follow the doctor's suggestions. If the doctor considers her suitable for molecular targeted therapy, Ms. Meng will be really willing to try the new drug.

Team HKJS_S
Date: 29 September 2018
As discussed with Prof. Davis Bookhart, the head of HKUST department of environmental sustainability, for our integrated human practices, a mechanism to reuse or store the CO2 produced by cellular respiration is required to prevent creating the problem of increasing greenhouse gas in our system.
Team HKJS_S worked to convert carbon dioxide to methane using a modified nitrogenase. By learning more about how this nitrogenase works, we have came to an idea that we can convert the CO2 produced by cellular respiration of Shewanella into methane that can be used as nutrients for Shewanella under our Alkane metabolism pathway. With this implemented, CO2 from respiration can be fed back into the system for more electricity generation and therefore increase the production yield.
Apart from the implementation of system, we have also discussed about some of the issues each other have been experiencing during the summer. While the JS_S team successfully clone their constructs using standard assembly and Gibson Assembly, our team have found difficulties in cloning the long sequences we have ordered from IDT into the desired plasmid. With multiple failures in our attempts, we have decided to clone the separate parts using standard assembly and link OmpA to the laccase sequence by adding overhangs to the plasmid using PCR and then perform Gibson Assembly. However, our first attempt of Gibson Assembly had also been unsuccessful and therefore we bring out this issue for further discussion during our meet up.
The JS_S team had helped us to troubleshoot our process on plasmid amplification with overhangs and Gibson Assembly. They suggested us to put the overhang on OmpA instead and linearized the plasmid before any PCR process for higher amplification efficiency and had suggested us on using BL21 E. coli expression strain rather than DH5 alpha strain for greater efficiency in protein production. With the time limit and consideration of our team dynamics, our members with experience in protein extraction had agreed to help the JS_S team with protein extraction using SDS-PAGE. To spare our workload, the JS_S team had also agreed to help us"

After the discussion, we knew how to adjust our project properly and realized that people really need Aflatoxout. Since liver illness has been popular in Taiwan for decades, we believe if we could minimize the animal consumption of aflatoxin, we could really make a difference in Taiwan and China, where people also suffered from liver illness.
Poultry Association Republic of China
Poultry Association Republic of China is a Taiwanese NPO that unites the chicken farmers throughout Taiwan. We met with the secretary-general of the organization, Dr. Jian-Pei Wang. During the conversation, we found several interesting facts.
In the chicken farming industry, chicken feed contributes 60-70% of their cost. Therefore the Feed Conversion Rate (FCR) is essential in the chicken feeding business. (1.5Feed Conversion Rate=3kg of chicken feed/2kg of chicken weight). Though chickens have high resistance to aflatoxin, they would still vomit or decrease in appetite after consuming aflatoxin. Therefore, if the FCR increases from 1.5 to 1.6, the cost of every kilogram of chicken feed would increase 10 US cents. It can make a huge difference for chicken farmers. Thus, high quality chicken feed has always been chicken farmers’ top concern. Taiwan has several animal feed companies such as Charoen Pokphand Enterprise (iGEM CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan also met with them). The majority of their feed are imported from overseas, so the logistics easily makes the feed likely to grow aflatoxin. When chicken farmers find brands of feed with low FCR, they usually directly change to another brand, because they do not want to spend time waiting for the test results.
At the end of the conversation, Dr. Jian-Pei Wang encouraged us to keep developing Aflatoxout. He said if it work out well in chicken, then the chicken farming industries would definitely welcome our product Aflatoxout!
King of Black Swine
King of Black Swine is one of the biggest pig farming company in Taiwan. We met with the CEO of the company, Mr. Wen-Tung Wang.
During the conversation, Mr. Wang shared his experience and expertise with us. “Aflatoxin has huge influences on white pigs, and it made the white pigs hard to reproduce if it consume certain amount of aflatoxin,” he said.
Nowadays, the feed additives for aflatoxin are usually not effective because pigs lose its appetite"

The main work
1. Setup the Web;
2. Fullfill all need in front end;
3. Implement file upload and download function;
4. Turn TMMU’s Matlab software into C to handle input;
5. Implement the parameter passing and result display.
Fig.1.The file tree.
The web app
This web app, Protein Calculator, needs three inputs:
1. Experiment parameters
2. Cnism value
3. Time
The first one is fulfilling our standard file and uploading the experiment parameters, and then TMMU_China’s algorithm can plot a result curve to simulate the growing situation.
Then, users type the specific cnism value and demand time, they can get a specific function curve at this point.
The whole workflow is the combination of 3 modeling:
1. Gene expression model;
2. Colony growth model;
3. Protein diffuse model;
The details of their modeling are in TMMU_China wiki . You can also browse this web app in their modeling part as a symbol of our cooperation.
Fig.2.Modeling Visualization web interface.
Future
Cooperation is always the main topic of iGEM. The interface and logrolling can really make a difference in our work progress and the friendship between different teams.
We hope this friendship can live from iGEM2016 to a far future, and hope the web app stemming from this friendship can really help researchers to achieve their purpose easily.
Development of Data-Processing Tool for UESTC-China
Background
This team’s goal was to degrade plastic and produce isobutanol. As a result of the ever increasing serious issues on plastic pollution, greenhouse effect and energy shortage, UESTC-China came up with an idea to try solving these three problems. That was to use genetically modified bacteria to achieve their goal. With their work going on, there was a stumbling block related to data processing simulation.
Fig.3. The experiment of UESTC-China.
Needs
In the course of experiment, there was a stage where team members should complete the drawing of the enzyme activity curve, through which to compare the work effect of each plasmid vector, so as to select the best one. A sea of data made it difficult to finish the data processing by manual method. Owing to the lack of programming ability, they had to use procedural means to solve the problem which took up lots of their time and energy.
So they sought for our support of programming expertise. We carried forward the spirit of collaboration to solve their problems relying"

We might do that eventually. For now, we can keep track of progress here.
6/4: Last night I finally proved uniqueness for the steady-state equations for TALOR systems. The good news: that's done. The bad news: TALORs cannot build bistable systems without some other component. The model used also applies to TFOs.
6/19: A 1991 paper reported successful use of TFOs with regions designed to dimerize. The two TFOs form a much more stable triplex after dimerization, exactly as needed for bistable circuit design. The downside is that it requires DNA oligos, and I have no idea how those come about in vivo.

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", all the control cells had died, meaning all surviving cells in the infection wells, had been successfully infected.
Conclusion:
The original intention for this experiment was to create a stable line of C8D30 astrocytes that express deactivated cas9 (with the necessary accessories) under the pTIMP1 promoter. Then this stable line would be infected, using AAV2 with the pSynt plasmid.
The infection, described in this text, was successful in C8D30 astrocytes and HEK293, however, the recuperation period is lengthy. Due to time constraints, we were unable to use the infected cells in our experiments. Instead, we preformed the experiments using co-transfection into our target cells.

We used the plasmid of pHAGE-pre-miR-21 to quantify miR-21 expression and calculate the copy numbers of miR-21 by using the formula listed below.
     copies/ul= (6.02×1023)×(plasmids concentrations ng/ul×10-9)/(DNA length×660)
The standard curve of miR-21-sponge-6s and miR-21-sponge-2s were made by EXCEL, respectively (Fig 16 and 17). We find that when miR-21 copies changed the slope of the standard curve of miR-21-sponge-2s was greater than miR-21-sponge-6s which indicated miR-21-sponge-2s is more sensitive than miR-21-sponge6s. However, the correlation coefficient (R2 value) of miR-21-sponge-6s was 0.9993 and R2 value of miR-21-sponge-6s was 0.8995. The R2 value of miR-21-sponge-6s is better than miR-21-sponge-2s.

Fig 17. The standard curve of miR-21-sponge-6s and miR-21-sponge-2s.
Conclusions and perspectives
The results reported here demonstrate that miRNA sponge may be a monitor to detect the expression of miRNA in cells. And we also suggested the slope of the standard curve of miR-21-sponge-2s is better than miR-21-sponge-6s, suggesting the more sensitive of miR-21-sponge-2s as a monitor. Our results for the first time to evaluate the possibility of miRNA sponge for detecting miRNA and provide a new method for diagnosis miRNA in the future. However, there are still lots of issues relative to this new method that we need to consider. Firstly, we should evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this technique by compare with other method including real-time PCR. Next, whether miRNA sponge contained two binding sites is the best monitor"

How did you determine the final dataset that you are reporting?
The resulting fluorescence data from the plate reader was processed using the Imperial 2014 iGEM Team InterLab Study design: https://2014.igem.org/Team:Imperial/InterLab_Study . Background absorbance and fluorescence     were subtracted from all samples assayed as a blanking control. The resulting absorbance values were then used to divide their respective resulting     fluorescent values to generate a fluorescence per OD unit value (FL/OD). The average FL/OD of the negative control culture with empty vector (R0040) was     subtracted from the FL/OD of the devices to remove background cell fluorescence, resulting in a FL/OD600 value. These values were then divided by the     conversion factor determined from the standard curve generated from a sodium fluorescein control assay to derived a final unit value as the equivalent     ng/mL fluorescein per OD600 unit.
Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) standards were generated using serial dilution of a 0.01 mg/mL FITC stock in 1x Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline     (1xDPBS, pH 7.4) diluted in MilliQ 18omega ultrapure water. 500, 375, 250, 125, 50 25, 10, 5, and 0ng/mL standards were generated from the stock using     serial dilutions. 200uL samples of each stock were loaded into a 96-well plate and assayed for fluorescence. Raw fluorescence data was blanked using the     background fluorescence of pure 1x DPBS, divided by the concentration of the standard to generate a FL per ng/mL unit, then averaged to generated a     conversion factor for fluorescence of samples on the plate reader to equivalent ng/mL of fluorescein.

Citizen Science: A Guide to Starting a Do it Yourself (DIY) Synthetic Biology Laboratory
5 Essential Ingredients
Since the late 1970s, engineers and computer programmers have pioneered citizen science.  From rudimentary garage and basement based operations, innovators: Jobs, Noise, and Horowitz  “hacked” computer networking technology into more applicable, socially relevant forms. These original  DIY scientists took technology developed by more established organizations like the US government  and CERN and made it more productive and useful than anyone could have imagined.  Today a similar DIY movement is taking shape in the biological sciences. The emerging field of  Synthetic Biology has inspired a growing contingent of professional and amateur scientists to create  neighborhood laboratories in hopes of making meaningful contributions in this exciting area. Synthetic  Biology is designing new, or redesigning existing, life forms using a combination of synthetic and  natural molecules.1 Due to the rapidly declining cost of genetic sequencing and genome synthesis, the  field has exploded over the past decade. Just like garage hacking of computer technology decades  earlier, synthetic biology has the same potential for immeasurable social and economic progress.  Engineering a ubiquitous life form, like bacteria to cure cancer or manufacture ethanol has its  own self-evident miraculous quality that anyone would find compelling. In addition to a life changing  idea, there are four other essential ingredients for a successful DIY Synthetic Biology laboratory:  people, workspace and equipment, funding, and regulatory compliance.
The Idea
Within the broad field of synthetic biology there are innumerable ideas worthy of further  investigation. Initially, most DIY synthetic biology labs have focused on developing genetically  engineered biological machines to perform socially beneficial functions. Some organisms, including  certain species of bacteria, are ready made for this type of modification because of their ability to  readily uptake plasmids (small bits of genetic information) from the environment & recombine it into  their natural DNA structure through cell division. This unique property allows synthetic biologists to  code plasmids for the production of certain desirable proteins and easily incorporate them into the  organism's existing structure. Once incorporated, these plasmids convert the host organism into a  functioning bio-machine with the ability to produce the target protein. These target proteins can then be  mass produced, combined"

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," describe the XOR logic of our system.
As we see, these modules are successive. After the logic module, we added a production module, which is responsible for the production of our outputs (GFP and an Homoserine Lactone that depends on the type of cell modeled). As one of our output is a messenger molecule, it has an influence on the quorum sensing module, which detects those molecules. Therefore, we have a feedback loop. This feedback loop comes from our choice to put only two different strains in our grid.
Decomposition of our system in different modules and submodules. The inputs are AHL and PAI2 and our output is AHL and GFP going out from the Production module.

Week 3: Plasmid design started, Modeling started
Wednesday, June 11th
We started plasmid design :
First draft of plasmids. The sensor plasmid is the same in every cell. Different logic + repressors plasmids are present in cells p and q. The logic + repressors plasmid from cells p is producing the quorum sensing molecule p, and another version is present in cells q which produces QSq. Colonies of p and q cells will be arranged in an alternate way on the millifluidic chip. Here as an example we use the lux system for p cells and the rhl system for q cells.
ΦC31 and Bxb1 are integrases. LuxR an RhlR are quorum sensing repressors. A riboswitch construct is placed around quorum sensing constructs to prevent leakiness of lux and rhl promoters. Type p colonies produce AHL by expressing the enzyme LuxI. Type q colonies produce Rhl by expressing the enzyme RhlI. In fact, we don't know yet which quorum sensing systems we will use. We will have to perform cross-talk experimetns in order to choose the ones that are the most orthogonal.
We tried to print our first agar millifluidic chip : we printed it too small, and the printer had resolution problems.
We wrote all reactions and found parameters from the literature for our model.

Our Project
Yeastilization, this year's DTU Biobuilders project, focuses on creating a combined solution of the worlds future excessive consumption of crops for non-feed purposes and increasing waste generation. By using a non-conventional yeast, Yarrowia liplytica, as chassis, we provide a new avenue for production of biotech products. Y. lipolytica has a broader substrate range than the traditional workhorse of the biotech industry, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which allows for the use of industrial biproducts instead of primarily produced glucose as substrate for fermentation.
Using organic waste from industry instead of glucose from the agricultural industry to produce insulin (or other Biotech products) could potentially open up massive areas of arable land for food production. With a rising population, increase of food production is absolutely essential and every bit counts.
Methods
Substrate screening
To confirm the the superior waste utilisation potential of Y. lipolytica over S. cerevisiae, we aim to analyse growth of both chassis on pure substrates and various waste streams from indsutry. We also aim to provide an insight into these waste sources and investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the substrates.
Molecular toolbox
In order to allow for heterologous protein production in Y. lipolytica, we aim to develop molecular tools for Y. lipolytica. We aim to develop a standardized genetic toolbox, including a BioBrick plasmid and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. The molecular toolbox will bring new opportunities such as an introduction of single proteins and entirely new pathways into this non-conventional chassis. The toolbox aims to standardise synthetic biology in Y. lipolytica and facilitate a broad use of the chassis for waste utilisation and other applications.
Products
As a proof of concept, we aim to demonstrate the expression of a heterologous protein in Y. lipolytica by producing a codon-optimized version of Renilla reinformis green fluorescent protein (hrGFP"

10. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a 50ml falcon tube. The pellet was kept for testing. Both were kept on ice.
11. Using FPLC, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+ column.
12. The protein was eluted using an increasing concentration of imidazole. The two buffers used were Buffer A: 50mM Tris, 200mM NaCl, 20mM imidazole and     Buffer B: 50mM Tris, 200mM NaCl, 1M Imidazole. (Note: If purifying a membrane protein 0.02% DDM was added to these buffers.)
13. The fractions corresponding to any peaks were retained and concentrated using an appropriate filter size. A small amount of each fraction could be ran     on an SDS gel at this stage.
14. Using FPLC, the sample was then loaded onto a SEC column and any fractions corresponding to a peak were ran on an SDS gel to check for the presence of     the desired protein.
15. Fractions containing the desired protein were collated, to which 20% glycerol was added.
16. The samples were then flash frozen and stored at -80oC.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Biologie Synthetique_-_-_TEXT.html,"-on capable de contrôler le vivant ? Sommes-nous en mesure de maîtriser la propagation des systèmes que l’on construit ?   Alors qu’ils sont une majorité à penser que les chercheurs sont capables de maîtriser le vivant, on reste sceptique face au contrôle de sa propagation.
Can we control the living?
Pensez-vous que l'on soit en mesure de maîtriser la propagation des systèmes que l'on construit ?
Face à ces questionnements, la question qui se pose alors est de savoir comment la société va se positionner et comment respecter les règles d'éthique. Du fait de la maîtrise du vivant, l'opinion publique est confrontée à une maîtrise par le monde de la recherche tout en ayant l'impression d'être dépossédée des résultats de la recherche. Comment la société va-t-elle pouvoir exprimer ses souhaits sur ces questions ?
Au vu de l’importance des enjeux, la réflexion doit être pluraliste et collective, il s’agit de savoir qui va contrôler et comment ? Faut-il de nouvelles régulations, alors que celles existantes pour les OGM sont déjà loin d’être parfaites et encore moins acceptées ? Peut-on aspirer à une gouvernance mondiale ? A cette question, 46 % des étudiants pensent qu’une telle gouvernance est envisageable, alors que 31 % sont d’avis contraire.
Dans le contexte de la biologie synthétique, pensez-vous qu'une gouvernance mondiale soit envisageable ?
Ce sondage attire l’attention des politiques, chercheurs et des juristes, en leur rappelant que l’argument de l’innovation et de l’objectif thérapeutique est trop souvent utilisé à tord par les partisans d’un monde où tout se protège et se dépose. Un débat collectif doit avoir lieu pour décider ensemble comment maximiser les applications favorables de ces technologies tout en minimisant les risques de dérives.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html,"otransporter is transcribed and translated. Due to the bacterial signal peptide the protein is secreted into the bacterial periplasm (the space between the two bacterial membranes of gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli). When present in the bacteria periplasm the autotransporter diffused to the outer membrane and inserts into the membrane. After the integration into the outer membrane the protein cargo is transportet through the beta-barrel of the autotransporter and is pre sented on the bacterial surface. We are sure that this BioBrick will be a valuable contribution to the Parts Registry as it allows future teams to display small protein domains on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli.
Results: Testing the bacterial autotransporter system
For the testing of our autotransporter constructs we transformed all three autotransporter constructs together with a secreted NanoLuc luciferase, which served as a control, into E. coli JK321 [10] . Transformed cells were grown in LB-medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (pSB1C3-vector) at 30°C and 180 RPM. In the morning a stationary over night culture was used to inoculate 50 mL fresh medium with 1 mL of culture. The cultures were grown to OD550 = 0.5 and then the induction of the protein production was started using aTc: ""non"" = non-induced; ""low"" = 25 ng/mL aTc; ""high"" = 200 ng/mL. After induction the cultures were grown for further 5 h at the same concitions and cells were afterwards stored at 4°C until they were used for analysis or bioprinting.
After the cell harvest the optical density (OD550) was determined again as it is known that a high expression of EspP makes the outer membrane of E. coli permeable and this drastically affects cellular viability. For the scAvidin-autotransporter and the secreted BAP-NanoLuc autotransporter at high inducer concentration show clearly reduced viability as they did not show any growth after induction at OD550 = 0.5 (see Fig. A). In order to analyze the functionality of the whole design and these new BioBricks we subjected each of the twelve cultures to three different treatments and determined subsequently the amount of NanoLuc luciferase using the manufacturers substrate kit (Thanks to our sponsor Promega ;). At first the total NanoLuc luciferase content was determined in samples that were just washed once with PBS and contained the whole bacterial cell (see Fig."

Mediators
For testing the genetic engineered system in the Microbial Fuel Cell , we used Escherichia coli KRX with gldA and Lac promotor (<bbpart>BBa_K1172204</bbpart>) in contrast to Escherichia coli KRX wild type. Certainly NADH-assays determined Escherichia coli KRX with gldA and T7 promotor (<bbpart>BBa_K1172203</bbpart>) as the best endogenous mediator producing strain. Unfortunately we could not use this strain due to cultivation problems.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"eningen UR
This year’s project of Wageningen UR consisted in a device for the diagnosis of tropical diseases, which featured sensitive perishable material in the form of engineered cells.
As TU Delft also aimed to manufacture a device intended for the broad audience, we were aware that one of the biggest challenges to both of our projects was the shelf-life or storability of the biological material. To circumvent the previous issue, our team dedicated a part of our project to research the applicability of tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) in order to enable the stabilization of all fragile material with just a simple drying step.
Consequently, TU Delft shipped three of his developed plasmids encoding for the production of the TDPs that conferred the most protection (CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094 and SAHS 33020) to Wageningen, so that they could test it with their cells.
Figure 2: Bacteria desiccation tolerance with TDPs. Number of colonies remaining after desiccation and rehydration for the empty vector,  TU Delft’s BioBricks for the production of CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094 and SAHS 33020 in BL21(DE3). Experiments performed by iGEM Wageningen UR.
As depicted in Figure 1, the survival of the bacteria upon drying overnight and resuspending is greatly enhanced for all the samples featuring the BioBricks with respect to that of the empty vector. In addition, Wageningen resuspended the samples with both Milli-Q water and PBS buffer, achieving additional results that indicated that the survival of the cells producing CAHS 94205 was improved in PBS while that of the cells with SAHS 33020 was instead worsened.
In return, TU Delft iGEM tested an additional preservation method researched by iGEM Wageningen UR, consisting of drying cells in combination with kaolin clay. In the experiments, TU Delft dried BL21(DE3) along with different amounts of kaolin in a laminar flow cabinet overnight
Bacteria desiccation tolerance experiments with Kaolin. Kaolin tube forwarded by iGEM Wageningen UR and resulting plates dried and resuspended with Kaolin.
After plating the resuspended kaolin and colonies and incubating overnight, the results were unfortunately inconclusive:  the plates were either overgrown or had no colonies at all. Furthermore, after performing Wageningen's  protocol, TU Delft shared a list of suggestions for its improvement"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," Boosted Trees - Training
As our machine learning algorithm of choice we used extreme gradient boosted trees implemented in python by the XGBoost library [] . Gradient boosted trees are commonly used for supervised learning problems, where training data is used (with multiple features, in our case the physico-chemical properties) \(x_i\) to predict a target variable \(y_i\) (in our case binary - binder or non-binder). Gradient boosted trees are based on decision tree ensembles consisting of a set of classification and regression trees (CART).
Major advantages of gradient boosted trees when compared to other popular machine learning algorithms such as neural networks or support vector machines is their training speed. Where neural networks often times train days or even weeks, gradient boosted trees are trained in a matter of minutes or sometimes even seconds. However, when dealing with image or speech data, deep learning using neural networks is likely to result in a better performance due to their intrinsically hierarchical approach to the modeling of large datasets where subunits like a single pixel are hard put into the larger context.
Luckily, we aren't dealing with extremely large datasets or imaging data. Therefore, tree-based algorithms are a natural and modern choice. The problem of MHC class I binding has so far rarely been approached by tree-based algorithms. Most implementations feature neural networks, support vector machines or bayesian based methods.
To evaluate our performance we used 5-fold cross validations on the most common alleles and evaluated the resulting ROCAUC value.   Gradient boosted trees are used for supervised learning problems, where one uses training data (with multiple features) \(xi\) to predict a target variable \(yi\). With well chosen \(yi\) we can express tasks such as regression, classification, and ranking. The task of training the model amounts to finding the best parameters \(\theta\) that best fit the training data \(xi\) and labels \(yi\). To train a model an objective function measuring how well the model fits the training data has to be defined. Objective functions for machine learning algorithms commonly incorporate two terms: training loss and regularization.  We define the objective function as follows: $$\text{obj}(\theta) = L(\theta) + \omega(\theta)\\$$ where \(L\) is the training loss function, and \(\Omega\) is the regularization term.

This time, we decided to plot both the minimum iron (II) ion concentration (2.6e+6) and the maximum on the same graph (61.8e+6) so the difference is more clear. The blue line represents the lower bound, red represents the upper bound. This is the result:
FURt=1, dt=10, t_max=144+3600 (6 days)
<img src=""
"" class=""left"" width=""100%"">
There is no distinguishable difference and the blue line is not even visible. We checked that this was not just an error by pausing the code midway through the run (MatLab plots everything it has covered so far). As you can see, the red line is effectively in the process of covering up the blue line. This is because MatLab plots whatever is chronologically first in the code. It then plots whatever is next and importantly it appears on top of any previous plots. For us, the blue line is the lower bound, red is the upper. MatLab first plots the blue, then the red, so the red appears to cover up the blue.

Because of the diversity of roles played by oxidative stress in biological systems, its optimization is a logical choice for anyone interested in increasing yields in agriculture.  Finally, it is not sufficient to simply rely upon plants’ evolutionary response mechanisms to oxidative stress as reproductive efficiency does not necessarily correlate directly to growth or crop production.  Thus there is a niche yet to be filled in optimizing this parameter.

Overview
   - Assembled and sequence verified Venus cassette plasmid and pp2551 cassette plasmid
    - Assembled the multigene sensing assembly
    - Tested another version of the sensing assembly and demonstrated that it works
Production Circuit
Our team did not have an assay to get quantitative measurements concerning the production of L-DOPA in our production assembly. However, by itself, L-DOPA will oxidize to melanin. As a result, to get qualitative results concerning our production assembly, we grew up our production cells in LB media containing 5 mM tyrosine and 0 mM tyrosine and then observed if a color change occurred. The diagram above shows such a color change. Our production assembly did observe a similar color change, but the change in color was not very pronounced.
Sensing Circuit
We tested a sensing construct that was similar to our sensing construct in design but built with different methods and parts. Instead of Venus fluorescence protein, this sensing circuit expressed e2-crimson, and was inserted into a pMMB67EH vector, while in our sensing construct, the Venus gene was inserted into a pET28 vector. Both constructs were transformed into Top 10 E. Coli strain and used in the fluorescence detection assay. We found that the fluorescence intensity in the cell increased as the amount of L-DOPA in the media increased for the lab construct. However, we found that our sensing construct, in the presence of L-DOPA, showed increased expression of fluorescence when certain amounts of L-DOPA were present in the media. You can see a slight increase in fluorescence from no L-DOPA to 100 uM of L-DOPA. However, the data shows that a lower level of fluorescence was detected when 1 mM of L-DOPA was present, which is different than the predicted outcome. These data suggest that different combination of vector plasmid and E. coli strain might have a different effect on the inducibility of sensing construct. Therefore, further study is needed to find out the best combination of vector and E.coli strain for this sensing construct.

In total, there are 341 votes that mean an average of 7.1 votes per person with the maximum of vote of 17 and the minimum of 0. In conclusion, people thing that synthetic biology have a lot of application field but think that synthetic biology can solve fewer problems than it could in the future.
Then, we have asked some questions about GMO their uses. The problem in France is that GMO have become a kind of swear word because of communication on this subject. Most of people are against them as you can see on the following graph.
Making the street interviews, we realized that people don’t even know what is it exactly, and for them GMO are just plant and “something chemical made in laboratory”. However more and more people realized than the used of GMO depends on the situation that means the modification made, the use, etc. To see how far people are against GMO we have asked a series of three questions. The answers are presented in the following graph.
With these questions we can see that people don’t really know if it’s dangerous are not to eat GMO but almost every is agree to say that foods which come from farming using pesticides is. We can also conclude that people prefer eat GMO than pesticides. Some of then tell us that: “None of the both is healthy to eat. We currently don’t know the toxicity of GMO contrary to the pesticides that doesn’t means that side effects of GMO don’t exist”. And we can also see some person which can prefer don’t eat anything saying that: “With some efforts and time, we can make 100% natural!”.  To finish, we show some example of applications asking if people know this application and if they are agree with this use.
After discover some examples of applications most of people are agree with their use as you can the on the three previous graph. Most of then tell us that they were surprise by this examples because they didn’t know but they think that we should be very careful with the human health and the protection of the environment.  One answer that really shocks us is: “I’m dreaming of a day where we have found biological pesticides, harmless for Human life and targeting better pest.”  That shows the lack of scientific knowledge on synthetic biology of general public and why is it so important to popularize it and communicate about sciences!

γ-HCH Biodegradation and F2A Cleaving Achieved
Growth of E.coli strain MC1061 transformed LinA+F2A+LinB and LinA gene in LB medium with inducer and 5Mm γ-HCH  respectively, as the substrate was monitored in batch culture. The result was screened by GC analysis(Fig.4). Growth resulted in disappearance of the substrate and simultaneous formation of biomass and γ-PCCH et al. But available columns were limited, hence the intermediate product couldn’t be detected. Through SDS-PAGE analysis, F2A peptide could cleave LinA and LinB(Fig.5). LinB would degrade the intermediate product of γ-HCH and according to theory, the γ-HCH could be degraded to desired low toxic compounds.
Fig.4. E.coli strain MC1061 carried LinA and LinA+F2A+LinB gene incubated in LB medium with γ-HCH(5mM) at 30℃. The concentration of γ-HCH was measured by GC. The bacteria carried gene LinA+F2A+LinB degraded γ-HCH(5mM) but the intermediate product couldn't be detected. Blank control(empty vector) have been added, the concentration of γ-HCH merely remained unchanged.

Public Engagement
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.- Helen Keller
Public Engagement
One of our main focuses for this years project was to increase our public outreach significantly compared to the previous years regarding our social media performance as well as the organisation and attendance of events on a local level, all over germany and also europe, and getting in touch with scientists and politicians.
Ract! Festival
In order to induce interest in iGEM and differentiated interchange about synthetic biology among students, we gathered at the local Ract! festival, which is hosted in Tübingen every year with about 30,000 visitors. Since it is a mostly political festival for students it was a great opportunity for us to inform and enlighten the visitors and change the general perception about synthetic biology and genetic engineering.
We addressed people of all ages. To introduce kids to biology and raise their interest we build a parcour that abstractedly symbolised the shuttle mechanism of the botulinum toxin into neurons. It turned out to be a huge attraction.  To reach out to adults we passed out flyers for our upcoming public debate and postcards of previous iGEM projects. Additionally, we were happy to answer questions and offer new insights. We were pleasantly surprised how many people sympathised with our believes and the potential of synthetic biology. Nonetheless, we had some negative encounters with opponents of genetic engineering. We hope that we at least encouraged them to reevaluate their opinion. All in all it was a great success.
Public Debate
Following to the Ract! festival we organised a public debate that took place in our university. This event was organised in collaboration with Streitkultur e.V., the debating club of our university. It was a public debate about gene editing on embryos which is a highly controversial topic in today’s society. We had two mixed teams, each with one iGEM member and one member of Streitkultur e.V. that represented the advocates and opponents of gene editing.  After an introductional plea of both sides the audience had the opportunity to ask questions and take part in the debate. They were very inquisitive and we had a lively debate in a friendly and respectful atmosphere.  It was a great opportunity for our team members to improve soft skills concerning confrontations with opposing opinions and how to handle them.  The debate served the purpose of making the subject of gene editing accessible to other students, clarify open questions and create an active exchange of opinions. "

Survey Limitations
It should be noted that the survey was self-selected and was distributed through the Facebook profiles of this years team and through a synthetic biology email list. Although we realize that these results are potentially skewed, we wanted to get feedback from those in industry, by the emailing list, as well as the general Northwestern community, through Facebook.
Presentation at GeneMods
As mentioned before, one issue that we needed to address was the lack of knowledge and awareness about the contamination in Lake Michigan. Our team was able to coordinate with GeneMods, a synthetic biology group of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs at Northwestern University. In our presentation to peers and experts alike, we explained the chromium dump in Lake Michigan and the negative effects of such contamination. We then introduced MetaSense and the possibility for it to empower citizens to test their water supply for contaminants. This experience was more than just educating others; we were able to also get expert opinions on our sensor and educate the synthetic biology community at Northwestern about the cell-free area of the discipline.

Heat shock transformed pC13AI (lox site), pA13AJ (lox site), pC13AK (mRFP coding sequence), and pK13AL (mRFP coding sequence) from Kit Plates 3 and 5 into chemically competent E. coli.  Heat shock transformed today's earlier ligations: pAK13D + pC13M, and pC13P + pC13E and plated all transformations in accordance with the selection marker on the plasmid.
We reran a PCR for pC13K and the band was as expected on the gel! pC13M was ligated to pC13D, and pC13E was ligated to pC13P. The resulting constructs were used to transform E. Coli cultures. The following transformations were also done: PT7 + GFP, PtrpC + GFP, PT7 + BAR, PtrpC + BAR. A colony PCR was run for pC13AH.

All 18 (yes, 18!) of the pC13AH colonies that had been screened by colony PCR yesterday were miniprepped.  We digested the miniprepped colonies of pC13AH clones (T7 promoter with crtY in pSB1C3) with NotI to see if the restriction cocktail method of cloning worked.  On the gel that was subsequently run, bands were expected at ~2.1 for pSB1C3 and ~1.2 for crtY+pT7.  The restriction cocktail method worked! The bands appeared at the correct lengths on the gel for pC13AH.  There was not enough miniprepped DNA for pC13AH to send for sequencing, so the colonies were cultured again for another miniprep.  None of the ligations into pAK13D (pSB1AK8 + PT7) worked -- pC13Z (GFP), pC13M (crtB), and pCp13X (bar) all failed => try cloning only using restriction cocktail method, instead of attempting PCR with VF2 & VR.  Digested pC13Z, pC13M, pCp13X, pC13K (crtI) with XbaI and PstI in addition to ApaLI and SacI for later ligation with pAK13. pAK13D"

During this week I put a lot of focus into writing code to update our database. Eventually, we will be able to re-use some of this code in an automated process that keeps our network up to date with the Kegg database.

This week I worked through the Django tutorials and learned how to make databases using Django and SQLite. I began creating models for the categories of databases that we would need. We went through many of the KEGG files to determine the way that we are going to organize our databases.
