Throughout our entire project, we have thought about commercialization of some aspects of it. Consequently, we decided to file a patent for the newly developed coacervate-based detection method for the detection of specific RNA sequences ( CINDY Seq ), described on our measurement page . In the process of writing this patent application, it became clear that this method could have a whole range of applications besides RNA detection, and we have identified multiple options on how we could commercialize the method for these applications. Furthermore, we have already received interest from multiple companies to further think about commercialization of the results of our research.
Value proposition
Antibiotic resistance among pathogens causing life threatening infections is rapidly increasing. Ineffective antibiotic treatments are in the worst case detrimental."
Peking,2014,Team:Peking#firsttry#Project#Killing Improvement_-_-_TEXT.html," of the entire internal repeating domain. We chose to work with INPNC because it has been reported to be an excellent surface display system used in E. coli in recent years [2,3]. INPNC can be be expressed on the cell surface at a high level, without affecting the cell membrane structure and cell proliferation, which is really crucial in our case. Also, the size and structure of MVN are both proper for the INP display system [2].
The plasmid containing INPNC coding sequence that we used came from the iGEM distribution 2014 (BBa_K523013).
Figure 1. Schema of the surface display system using INP and INPNC. INP N-domain, which is relatively hydrophobic, anchors INP in the out membrane. INP C-domain is hydrophilic and exposed to the medium, which can be used to link the passenger protein on its C-terminus. The internal repeating domains serve as the template for ice nucleation, and are not necessary for protein display. Depicted are the (a) full-length INP with no truncation and (b) INP with truncation of the internal repeating domains.
MVN is a lectin isolated from the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806. It is an 108 aa protein that consists of 2 domains. According to a carbohydrate microarray carried out previously, MVN binds to carbohydrate and the highest signals are observed with structures that contain &#945(1 &#8594 2) linked mannose residues [1]. A binding partner of MVN was identified in the lipopolysaccharide fraction of M. aeruginosa PCC7806 and it possibly represents the O-antigen of a LPS. MVN has been previously expressed in E. coli and its binding effect to cyanobacteria cells is highly species-specific [1]. The availability and specificity are the reasons why we chose MVN in our project.
We optimized the gene sequence of MVN at first and de novo synthesized this gene from commercial company (Genscript, Nanjing, China).
Figure 2. Solution structure of MVN. MVN consists of 2 domains, domain A and domain B, which are colored yellow and blue respectively. Domain A is formed by residues 38-93 while domain B is formed by residues 1-37 and 94-108. The mannan binding site is only found in domain A. This figure is taken from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2Y1S).

NITROGEN-REGULATED PROMOTER
This construction contains two parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter and
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (yellow) protein. We chose as the promoter sequence the one of the glnA gene.      There is long evidence that this promoter is regulated by nitrogen concentration [1]. Moreover, the promoter is not the canonical one (sigma70) but an alternative one (sigma54) [2,3].
When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain the yellow fluorescent protein a condition should to be met. That condition is related to nitrogen-starvation. The less nitrogen there is, the more expression you get!
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: in gram-negative bacteria, transcriptional activation in response to some external stimuli (absence of nitrogen, high UV-dosis, for example) often involves the alternative sigma factor, sigma54. This factor, also called RpoN or sigma N, was originally identified as the sigma factor for nitrogen-controlled genes. sigma54 works in conjunction with members of the"

Overview Ethics Integrated Events Media
M E D I A
As mentioned previously, our goal was to actively engage the scientific community and the general public to assure that our project is safe, responsible and good for the world. This was among other things made possible through various mass media tools such as social media platforms, the press and a podcast to engage with the audience and receive feedback.  This page will therefore serve as a detailed overview of the work effectuated in the different communicative areas:
Social Media
Our communicative approach on social media was to engage as many as possible - both individuals from the scientific community and individuals from the general public that are curious about science. The tone on all our social media platforms was down-to-earth and casual. Due to the genre and format of social media nowadays, the communication of our scientific project was also kept very fundamental in order to keep the users interested.
Facebook
A large amount of the general public uses Facebook. Therefore, the focus on this social media platform was to diversify our target group as much as possible, so that we could get individuals from different background to show interest in our project. Therefore, this platform was utilised in collaboration with the events to target individuals that could be potentially interested in our project.
Instagram
A large amount of the younger generation uses Instagram as their primary social media platforms. The focus on this social media platform was primarily to provide a more visually pleasing insight to our project and team to this target group and thereby get them interested in iGEM and synthetic biology in general. Also, it was a great way to keep up with the other iGEM teams around the world. Instagram allowed us an insight into what the younger generation mainly reacted and interacted with, and what got them interested.
Twitter
A large part of the scientific community uses Twitter. Therefore, this social media platform was used as a mean of communicating with the scientific community around the world by sharing our critical reflections, personal team pictures and live event-updates.
See our latest social media posts here:

Instagram
Press
In continuation with our social media activities, we contacted the press to communicate our project to a wider range of the general public and the scientific community.
From crucial funding to an inspiring article. A late Wednesday in September. a few hours before our meeting we were contacted by a journalist whose interest our funding application had"

Mentoring Local High School Team
United Christian College (Kowloon East) in Hong Kong is the first high school in Hong Kong to participate in iGEM.            Since its establishment, HKU Team has been mentoring this new team which we believe will be the role model for future high school iGEM teams in Hong Kong.            We provided this team of budding synthetic biologists administrative guidance through regular joint-team meetings,            helped them with their ideas developing stage and offered them technical support in later stages of their project.            It was our pleasure to share our 7 years of iGEM experience with the UCCKE team.
We were impressed by the fascinating new ideas from UCCKE team in the brainstorm session held in March at HKU.            Our team members gave UCCKE team some advices on iGEM and commented on their project designs.             Another meeting was held in August, in which we focused on troubleshooting and laboratory collaboration.
We have delivered a sharing session at their school as well to provide another perspective in synthetic biology to more high school students.
Global Collaborations
In emphasizing the ‘I’ in the iGEM, we have been very active in seeking collaborations between local institutes as well as international ones.              We approached teams from several universities worldwide to seek possible inter-institute collaborations, these includes Dundee University, Imperial College London, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) and National University of Singapore.
At the end of the day, we helped NUS to distribute over 100 questionnaires on the issue of cancer treatment at HKU.              This act helps NUS to collect data oversea and obtain an alternative perspective.

Using those parameters, we constructed a graph to show each one of them. The first comparing the values from our data, the second is from the the literature data
However, to do a proper comparison, we’ve set up a relative measure, we decided to call λ. Is a very simple proposal:
$$\lambda N \mid M = \frac{ ( \frac{\alpha M}{\gamma M}) ^2 } { ( \frac{\alpha N}{\gamma N}) ^2}$$
Where N is the native system, the system of the HSL and Receptor, and M is the system of the promoter. Alfa is the alfa that represents the promoter interaction, and gamma is the basal of expression. With that in mind, we found the following values Lambda:
Lux:Las - 4,74
Lux:Rpa - 2,21
Las:Rpa - 0,52
Rpa:Lux - 0,34
The most interesting part of this comparison is see, that even with Lux:Las and Lux:Rpa where the expression is essential the same, as show by the simulations, Las has twice more of cross-talk then Rpa with Lux!

IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#blog_-_-_TEXT.html,". Quorum­sensing  signaling molecules  can be detected from  cell free  supernatants, extracts of   food samples, and spent culture supernatants of bacteria isolated from food products (Ammor   and others 2008).The use of bacterial biosensors has made the detection and quantification of   different  types  of  these  signals  like AHLs  easier,  economical,  and  faster. An AHL  biosensors   contain  a  functional  LuxR  family  protein  cloned  with  a  cognate  target  promoter  (usually  the   promoter of the cognate luxI synthase), which up regulates the expression of a reporter gene   encoding for a phenotypic response only in the presence of exogenous AHLs, as they do not   produce the signaling molecules but only possess their cognate receptors. Affirmative  action  using  quorum  sensing  inhibitors  can  be  taken  in  food  preservation  also.   Quorum­sensing  inhibitors  are  typically  analogues  of  the  AHLs,  or  compounds  that  degrade   AHLs. A promising group of quorum­sensing inhibitors is the halogenated furanones produced  by the Australian red alga, Delisea pulchra (Givskov and others 1996). The initial  cytotoxicity   and  chemically  unstable  nature  of  these  inhibitors  has  prompted  the  screening  of  nontoxic   quorum­sensing inhibitors from natural sources. Plants used in traditional medicine are one of   the most promising areas in the  search for new biologically active  compounds. In a  study by   Vattem  and  others  (2007),  dietary  phytochemicals  from  plants  known  to  have  several  health   benefits  and  antimicrobial  activity,  exhibited  quorum­sensing  inhibitory  activity  at  sub  lethal   concentrations. Vanilla,  a  widely  used  spice  and  flavor,  can  inhibit  bacterial  quorum  sensing.   Quorum­sensing  inhibitors  may  prevent  colonization  of  food  surfaces,  toxin  formation,  and   proliferation of food­related bacteria.

Our Team
Our team consists of five enthusiastic undergraduate students, who manifest genuine interest in the sphere of Synthetic Biology. We became familiar with IGEM competition in summer 2012 and asked our faculty to organize special Synthetic Biology course in order to learn more about this exciting sphere of biology. Fortunately, our professors also became interested in this competition and were glad to organize two wonderful courses of Synthetic Biology. These courses gave us a great background in many different topics, but the most interesting topic for us was the application of aptamers in diagnosis, treatment and research. Then, in April 2013 we asked Dr. Damira, our mentor, who has been working with aptamers in our University research center, to join her team in lab.

The results show that, when we didn’t add IPTG, the bacteria expressed more GFP. After we added IPTG, the bacteria expressed more RFP, so the fimS switch can work. Here is the link to their wiki
NKU_China also did some experiments for us. As for our project, two significant changes will happen when geneguard takes effect. One is the delaying in bacterial growth, the other one is transformation in bacterial morphology. The two experiments we designed above certified geneguard’s function through delaying in bacterial growth. We also wanted to demonstrate it through transformation in bacterial morphology. However, we lacked appropriate equipment for observation. Thus, we seek help from our partner NKU_China.
We designed the morphology experiment according to our pervious work.
The results are as followed:
Figure 3. Cellular morphology. Groups with none inducer, 0.2% arabinose, or 0.2% arabinose and IPTG co-induction were set respectively. Bacterial morphology was observed at 1.5, 3 and 6 hrs.
As Figure 2 shows, bacterial shape in control group didn’t have evident change in 1.5h, 3h, 6h, all in rhabditiform. Arabinose induction group appeared bacilliform in 1.5h. In 3h observation, part of bacterial turned into roundness. In 6h observation, most of bacteria became rounded. The arabinose and IPTG co-induction group appeared bacilliform, in 3h observation, part of bacterial turned into roundness. In 6h observation, most of bacteria were bacilliform.
E. coli in control group didn’t express induced heterologous protein. Thus, they appeared bacilliform. While in arabinose induction group, part of bacteria became rounded in 3h and most of them turned into roundness in 6h. we can consider that toxin cbtA led to the transformation in bacterial morphology.
Part of bacteria in Arabinose and IPTG co-induction group turned rounded in 3h observation. That’s because the toxin addicted time was too short that only part"

Nimaya De Silva
Hello! My name is Nimaya De Silva, and I go to Winston Churchill High School. I am 17 years old and this is my second year of iGEM. I joined iGEM to gain more experience in the lab, and to venture more into the world of biology. But I have also found myself working on human practices as well and have been thoroughly enjoying it!  Besides iGEM, I love to read anything and everything to do with dystopia and Harry Potter! I also take piano lessons, and love to recreate pop songs on the piano!
Candace Chan
Hello! My name is Candace Chan and I attend Winston Churchill High School. I joined iGEM because I thought it would be a good way to meet like-minded people from different schools. Particularly I enjoy the human practices aspect of iGEM as it is important to me that our work as a team has an impact on the local community. After high school, I plan on going to university most likely pursuing the science field as I have enjoyed these subjects throughout high school. In my limited spare time I enjoy listening and playing music. I have played piano for 10 years as music is a significant passion of mine.
Autumn Schmidt
Hello! My name is Autumn Schmidt, and I am a grade 10 student attending the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. This is my first year of iGEM, and I joined because I was interested in learning more about biochemistry and synthetic biology. What I enjoy most about the program are the lab experiments that we do frequently, and seeing all the interesting projects that have been created years before. In my spare time, I enjoy sports, playing the piano, and art.

<partinfo>BBa_I52002</partinfo> DNA was excised from <partinfo>pSB4C5</partinfo> by EcoRI-PstI (Roche) digestion and isolated by gel run and gel extraction as described above.
Digested <partinfo>BBa_K300982</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_I52002</partinfo> were ligated and transformed into competent DB3.1 E. coli strain (<partinfo>BBa_V1005</partinfo>), selected with Chloramphenicol at 34 ug/ml.
Positive transformants were screened by restriction mapping with EcoRI-HindIII (Roche) and sequencing with VF2 (<partinfo>BBa_G00100</partinfo>) and VR (<partinfo>BBa_G00101</partinfo>) standard primers. The yielded plasmid was <partinfo>BBa_K300000</partinfo>.
All the DNA manipulations were performed according to manufacturer's protocols.
Integration protocol:
Transform the <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> helper plasmid in the host strain (MC1061 or MG1655) and select transformants on Amp (50 ug/ml) plates under permissive conditions (30°C) overnight.
Inoculate a single colony in selective LB and let the culture grow at 30°C, 220 rpm. When the culture reaches the OD600 of 0.4-0.6 prepare chemically competent cells.
Transform the integrative vector with the desired insert in the BBa_J72008-containing strain and select co-transformants on Cm (34 ug/ml) plates under permissive conditions (30°C) overnight. At this temperature <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> can be replicated and so the pir protein product can be expressed in the cells. The pir product enables the propagation of the integrative vector by replicating the R6K origin.
Inoculate a single colony in 5 ml of LB + Cm at 12.5 ug/ml and incubate the culture at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight. At this temperature the <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> helper cannot be replicated and the Phi80 integrase is expressed by the remaining copies of the helper. The bacteria that are able to grow in this selective medium should be correct integrants because"

Mathematical Model
Model equations
The Flip-Flop circuit in Figure 1 can be modeled by the following equations:
Symbol definition is listed in Table 1.
A common motif in repressor proteins is the presence of a dimeric nucleotide-binding site with dimeric structure. In accordance to this general structure the cooperativity coefficients (
) were assumed equal to 2. The maximum velocity of repressor synthesis (
) accounts for the strength of the unregulated promoter and RBS. The value of the affinity constant for the binding of repressor to the promoter strictly depends on the sequence of operator site (OS block).
Adimensional equations
The equations (1.1) and (1.2) can be written dimensionless:
Where:
Up
Equibrium conditions
In the absence of stimuli, the adimensional concentrations of LacI (
) and TetR (
) at equilibrium are related by the equations:
To obtain these relations the UVc-dependent term in equation (1.4) was ignored (
). This is justified by the high binding constant of LexA for its operator, and the consequent negligible contribution to the LacI synthesis. Equations (1.6) and (1.7) can have one or three solutions that represent the equilibrium conditions of the circuit. The solutions, i.e. the equilibrium conditions, can be graphically identified as the intersections between
and
nullclines (see Figure 2). The case of multiple equilibrium conditions (bistability case) is shown in Figure 2 panel b. TetR-ON and LacI-ON are stable equilibria separated by the unstable one (saddle point). Due to the bistability the circuit can operate as a binary memory.   The existence of a bistability condition depends on the value of
and
parameters. If
decrease (see Figure 2 panel a) a saddle-node bifurcation can occur, TetR-ON equilibrium vanishes and remain only the stable equilibrium LacI-ON.  The contrary occurs when
is decreased (Figure 2 panel c). Thus bistability is guaranteed only for a limited range of
and
values.

Bifurcation analysis
Assuming that LacI-ON exists the corresponding equilibrium value of
is higher than 1 (see Figure 2), then it can be assumed that

ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#fetataglance_-_-_TEXT.html," nature of ischemic conditions, the final solution should include the restoration of every negative outcome due to ischemia.
Our Approach
Our project design aims on two distinct situations. The more we delve into the entire condition, the more we reach a definite cure for ischemia. For this reason, we intend to use our vessel cells as a way to to get in action in time to heal or prevent the consequences of ischemia. To do this, we have to sense hypoxic conditions, prevent or remove clot formation and oxidative stress factors.
Regarding the need of an efficient, cost effective and rapid treatment option, we have divided our approach into modules: Detection devices and activist proteins. We want to detect hypoxia in two levels; a promoter device in gene level and a protein domain allowing protein level regulation. We also aim to sense the oxidant factors in media to empower sensor devices. Afterwards, these devices will produce our activist proteins which are clot dissolving agents, antioxidant enzymes and proteins. We are hoping to propose a novel approach which reacts in early periods, intervene powerfully and prevent recurrence of such an attack effectively.
Future Aspects
Gene therapy and tissue engineering are two different, but promising fields which relate to our project. We have discussed the advantages and possible side effects, ethical or social issues of these fields  to determine which of these would benefit best.
Additionally, we have designed an applicative version of our project design, its possible clinical use from a clinician’s perspective and a patient’s view.
Last, but not the least, we aim to feature a computer modelling data to predict potential effects of our treatment and if it can be used as a preventive medication. We envision that our system will detect hypoxia before reaching the mortal levels and interfere to prevent more serious conditions without raising awareness on the patient who receivs this treatment.
Achievements
•We successfully propose a promising, novel approach and system design to treat ischemia, a common and lethal public health issue.
•???
Policy & Practices
Apart from our project design, we also want to intensify our approach on ischemic conditions and diseases by working on human practices and social issues. This year, we preferred to conduct an inclusive perspective and activity to address every aspect and all the stakeholders related with this issue. Therefore, we separated our P&P design into four columns; all of them show a respective process and interactive strategy.
First, we need to analyze how big the problem is and how common these ischemic diseases are among people, especially in the iGEM community. The name of this module is “Identification”; with the intention of “identifying”"

In this dynamic of promoting science in our territory, we organised with them the Science Discovery Day in the “Parc des Coquibus” in Evry. We proposed interesting experiments to initiate children to Science and scientific communication for adults. We also introduced the iGEM competition and our project. A concert closed the day allowing us to enjoy this open event and to get close to people thanks to Biology. It was an exchange between Students and people interested in Biology that led to very interesting conversation and maybe a future vocation in synthetic biology."",,We proposed interesting experiments to initiate children to Science and scientific communication for adults.,,,

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

7/8/2015: Day 25
We have a presentation at the department presentations tomorrow. I’m pretty nervous because this is our first presentation at Wellesley as a team. While we had some practice talking at NEGEM, I was nervous because in the audience will be friends and professors that I know well. We revamped our entire presentation layout and aesthetic, and we even included some videos of our multitaction prototype.
7/9/2015: Day 26
Presentation at department talks: We had our presentation today! Sam, Vivien, and I were pretty nervous, but we finished successfully. Our fellow classmates gave us some good feedback, and we are happy that it got positive responses at this talk.

We went to the Museum of Science! I became an emotional mess at the Pixar Exhibit. Orit recommended that we take a lab outing to the newly opened Pixar exhibit for some inspiration. The exhibit itself was phenomenal. I did not realize how much work and iterations that went into creating these films.
7/13/2015: Day 28
Casey sent us some really cool artwork. We started adding and using their artwork into our prototype. It was really cool seeing our project looking more space-y.
7/15/2015: Day 30
Today we did a lot of math. We had a difficult time with figuring out the math for the flasks tilting towards the Mars environment. After a few hours and a lot of tinkering with equations, we finally got our flasks to empty towards the center! Hallelujah! Later in the afternoon, the MIT app inventor team came by and looked at what was going on in the lab.
7/16/2015: Day 31
Today, I got to listen to a lot of my friends’ presentations from the other departments. My roommate actually presented today on her physics research. It was super cool to see what others have done. We also went to Larry’s machine shop today. It was really cool to get laser cutting trained. We learned how to laser cut, and it was a lot of fun!
7/17/2015: Day 32

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Labwork#Week1#Week2_-_-_TEXT.html,"The supernatant was removed and the remaining droplets of solution removed without disrupting the transparent pellet the plasmids had formed. Once the plasmid pellet was dried of all the solution, it was resuspended in 50 microlitres of water. The tubes were then lightly centrifuged (for a few seconds) to make sure all of the water, along with the DNA, had congregated at the bottom of the tubes.
Conclusion
We are now ready to carry out DNA electrophoresis on the 10 samples, which will happen tomorrow.
Lab session: 9th July
Experiment Recap
10 colonies of transformed E.coli cells - 2 containing GFP, 8 containing RFP
Up to this point, we have successfully isolated and cultured single colonies of E.coli cells. With these micro-organisms, we were able to induce competence and had the opportunity to transform them with the following BioBricks:
BBa_J04450 with plasmid pSB1AK3
BBa_I13522 with plasmid pSB1AK3
BBa_J04450 with plasmid pSB1AT3
So far, we are convinced that 2 colonies of our cultured E.coli cells have become transformed by BioBrick BBa_I13522 (with plasmid pSB1AK3) which encodes GFP and that 10 colonies of our cultured E.coli cells have been transformed by BioBrick BBa_J04450 (with plasmid pSB1AT3), which leads to the production of RFP. This can be seen visually in the tubes; see image in the previous experiment under the heading ' Observations '.
However visual representations may not always available and in these scenarios, it is difficult to tell whether the E.coli have become transformed by the given BioBrick unless DNA analysis is conducted. Even though the cells have survived the negative selection process (i.e. antibiotic exposure), it doesn't mean that they all possess the BioBrick - they could have received that resistance through other means.
Aim of Today's Experiment
The gel displaying the three marker bands - the cyan, dark blue and yellow marker bands
We need to get ourselves familiarised with conducting DNA gel electrophoresis. We shall be doing this by preparing and then inserting the plasmid DNA (extracted from the 10 colonies of cells) into the gel. At this stage, the plasmids will be inserted as uncut objects because no restriction enzymes have been added yet (the analysis of cut plasmids comes at a later"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Densitometer_-_-_TEXT.html," Digispark pretends to be a keyboard, that types the results extremely quickly into the computer it’s plugged into. The interpreter software can intercept this, along with other keyboard events for changing the settings to provide useful output.
As processing is shifted onto the device it’s plugged into, data analysis is much easier as readings can be automatically logged and exported to spreadsheets. With Judd-UK’s feedback, readings can be marked with ‘recording numbers’, making it easy to do batch measurements. Also based off their feedback, we added a button to export only the ‘recorded’ data to csv. See the collaborations page for more details.
Showing Judd-UK our fluorometer and densitometer.
This framework makes the device easier to modify as a few lines can be changed on the webpage rather than reconfiguring the Arduino board or rewiring the circuit with different components. This in turn also reduces the risk of irreversibly damaging the hardware through bugs in the code. Website programming is much more forgiving than Arduino programming, allowing people with less experience to modify the software. It is also much easier to debug as computers can spit out error messages to the screen.
Moving the complicated processing to the device it is plugged into also means you can use cheaper components in the fluorometer, further reducing the cost. It allows smaller and fewer components to be used, making the device more portable and easier to build.
The interpreter is designed to be used continuously. While the fluorometer is logging data, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to change the options.
Instructions
Our digisparks came with pins free - if yours do too, solder the pins to the board first so you can more easily swap components out if it doesn’t work.
To snap them simply use 2 sets of needle-nose pliers at the point you want them to break and twist.
If you don’t already have a soldering iron check your electrical engineering, physics department or local hackspaces. Most of the time they’ll give you instructions, but if not or you just want more guidance there’s lots of advice online on how to get started soldering. We were lucky enough to be trained by our physics teacher, but sparkfun’s guide looks pretty good too! Don’t hold us responsible for your safety - if in doubt ask someone who knows what they’re doing.
Our one warning is about the light sensors (TSL235R) - the pins are easy to break and they are fairly expensive so be careful with them!

Cultures for miniprep
When possible, 2 non-fluorescent colonies were picked from each plate (fluorescence in the P1/P3 derived plasmids indicates P1/P3 vector religation).
The 2 E2 P90+49 cultures failed to grow. Note that Kan selection was used, as that's carried on P90, although the transformation plates were Amp.
RE digests of minipreps 07/26
We digested
P46 with NheI
P90+49 and P90+48 with XbaI and SpeI
When these parts are combined, we will have a plasmid with the CDF origin (CDF+Amp and CDF+Cm in the base vector)
P3+17 and P1+17 with EcoRI and XbaI
We can add the high and low constitutive promoters to give us the complete Tet system (without GFP) in a p15A vector
P39+51, P38+51, P38+17 with XbaI and PstI
We can put these parts into P1 and P3 to give us the complete Tet and Lac systems in a p15A vector

OLS_Canmore,2016,Team:OLS Canmore#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the jamboree (October 13th) we discovered why were having so many issues transforming, cloning, and miniprepping.  Although we sent orders to the synthesis company and they confirmed that they were to be sent in the backbone pUC57, they were accidentally sent in a pet vector.  The problems in the lab were because we were using Ampicillin to screen for colonies containing the plasmid, rather than Kanamycin.  This seems to be a random error, and while it is unfortunate, we were still able to complete the biobrick parts.
We are very happy to have collaborated with the Lethbridge high school team this year. Our collaboration was very constructive for both teams.
Biotreks
This year our team was asked to participate in the publishing of the first ever edition of Biotreks.  Biotreks is a peer-reviewed startup journal created specifically to showcase high school synthetic biology projects. We chose to write two papers that focused on different aspects of our project and overall iGEM experience: one research paper and one perspectives paper. Both of our papers also required us to make videos to give short summaries of their contents.
Groups taking part in the Biotreks publication include:
Rock Ridge High School
Tuscarora High School
Brockton High School
Renaissance High School
Broad Run High School
Our research paper included background on the problem we are aiming to fix, the methods we used to construct and test our project, the results and what we learned from them, and what he  hope to do with our project in the future.
Abstract for ""Expression of Keratinase Genes in the Bacillus Genera for in Escherichia coli JM109 and DH5alpha for use in the Poultry and Wastewater Management Industries""
An estimated 8.5 billion tons of poultry feathers are produced from farms globally every year, in addition to the tons of human hair that is extracted from wastewater treatment facilities worldwide. Keratinase is a serine protease that primarily attacks the disulfide bonds in keratin waste—such as feathers and hair.  The expression of bacterial keratinase provides an opportunity to manage this degradation-resistant keratin waste. This study aims to provide a foundation for future management of hair and feather waste by reducing the negative effects that the current treatment methods have on the environment, and by producing a useful amino acid protein product of high quality such as animal feed and fertilizers. This is done through a semi-quantitative analysis of keratinase A (kerA) and keratinase"

CHU Tsz Long Nelson
I am entering my second year of biochemistry at HKU and i have a special interest in bio-gerontology. I join the igem2009 because i want to understand more about synthetic biology and to get some practical research experience. In my spare time i enjoy table tennis, archery and chess games. I hope to pursue my PhD program in the US after i graduate.
In this competition, I am responsible for biobrick construction and speed control. I learnt a lot of useful skills and hand-on experience of practical research. Though there were many failures, i managed to provide some possible explanations for the failures and discuss it with other teamates. I found myself addicted to scientific research after this competition. I hope I can be a successful scientist and contribute a lot to mankind in the future.
FU Zhong Zheng Brooks
Brooks Fu Zhongzheng is a second year undergraduate student studying at the University of Hong Kong. Aspiring to be a successful researcher, he decided to choose biochemistry and physics as majors to train himself in reasoning skills and the ability of gleaning useful information from books as heavy as two bags of potatoes. He personally thinks knowledge of physics is indispensable for him to make sense of the abstruseness and intricacy of life.  It is quite challenging to deal with these two majors that require different thinking patterns and learning methods, but his brain manages to develop an ability of quickly switching between 'biology mode' and 'physics mode'. He really enjoys himself when learning and attains satisfactory academic results. In the spare time, he usually plays the piano to get relaxed. He is a big fan of Bach and Prokofiev.
It occurs to him that 'all textbooks no experiments will make Brooks a dull boy'. Only will an opportunity of self-motivated scientific 'DIY' enable him to internalize what he learn from the textbook. When first introduced to the iG"

UiOslo_Norway,2018,Team:UiOslo Norway#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," able to synthesize our sequences.
Lytic enzymes
In order for the dCas9/ split β-lactamase to detect a specific DNA sequence, the C. albicans DNA needs to be free in solution. During our literature search we found that the cell wall of C. albicans consists approximately of 80-90 % carbohydrate, with the three most prominent groups being β-glucan, chitin, and mannan. β-glucan and chitin are the components that form the rigidly and strength to the cell wall. β-glucans make up 47-60 % of the weight of the cell wall, and thus form the main structural component. In C. albicans the β-glucans are linked by either β-1,3 or β-1,6 bonds [2]. In addition, some bacteria may also produce beta-lactamase, making a selective lysis important. We therefore decided to use a β-1,3-glucanase and a mannanase to selectively lyse the yeast cell wall, and not that of bacteria.. Neither the glucanase nor the mannanase we needed were in the iGEM Parts Registry, so we decided to make these as new BioBricks.
The glucanase was synthesized by Twist Bioscience, and the sequence was codon optimized for Escherichia coli using their suggested optimization tool.
Twist graciously offered to sponsor the synthesis of the glucanase. Unfortunately, the mannanase could not be synthesized, so we continued using only the glucanase.

Education and Public Engagement
Through volunteering opportunities, organizing training sessions and social media, we were able to share our work with a variety of audiences. We were able to discuss application of synthetic biology in treatment of Parkinson disease. Here are some of our accomplishments.  Please scroll through several images which we took during these events:
Science Mill
In the summer of 2016, our team volunteered at the Science Mill, a science museum in Johnson City, TX, where we helped out with the exhibits at the museum, one of which involved synthetic biology and the use of green fluorescence protein in the eggs of zebrafish.
Building with Biology Events
In September of 2016, our team volunteered at the Building with Biology Events held by the Thinkery, a children’s museum in Austin, TX, where we interacted and spoke with young children about the prevalence of synthetic biology in food, scientific reasoning and skills used in research, and implications of synthetic biology research in the real world.
Training
During the school year of 2016 - 17, experienced members of our team taught fellow high schoolers introductory biotechnology and synthetic biology wet lab and dry lab techniques. This was meant as a means of introducing individuals our age to the world of research, specifically biological research, and to provide them with an experience they may not have had otherwise.
Power for Parkinson's
In the summer of 2017, our team volunteered with the organization Power for Parkinson’s, a nonprofit based in Austin, TX that provides free, local fitness classes for Parkinson’s patients in the community. We assisted at a number of fitness classes and interacted with many of the attendees. A blurb containing the implications of our project, and synthetic biology as a whole, on Parkinson’s was also sent out via a Power for Parkinson’s newsletter.
Social Media
We also used a number of social media platforms, specifically our Instagram (@lasaigem) and our Twitter (@lasa_igem) accounts to raise awareness for Parkinson’s and to direct individuals, specifically individuals our age, on how they can help at the local level. Our posts also included information on the growing relevance of synthetic biology in the treatment of diseases such as Parkinson’s.

Lethbridge_HS,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," students’ awareness for the application and significance of some of the concepts they learned in school and made them more interested to become involved with iGEM in the future.
City Council Presentation
In order to accumulate funds and some media coverage, as a team we resolved to present our blood coagulation project to city council members. Our goal was to ask for $1000 in order to aid the funding of our prototype construction. Although the money was not granted, we gained an invaluable experience at presenting in city hall to twelve councillors and the mayor. Having the opportunity to answer questions and hear the council members perspectives was truly an enlightening experience. The councillors expressed their interest and belief in our project, as well as perceived the value in iGEM even though they denied our request. Our visit to city hall certainly was still beneficial, as media such as the Lethbridge Herald and Shaw interviewed a team member, and we got a chance to spread the word of our funding page and project idea. Overall, it was a rewarding experience.
Dictionary
In order to ensure that all team members were familiar with the basis of our blood clotting project at the beginning of the iGEM season, we designed this dictionary including basic terms relevant to our project. Every team member submitted a few terms related to our project, along with their definition, in order to create this dictionary. In addition to helping our team members mitigate their uncertainties in some aspects of the project, we hope that this dictionary will also allow the community to understand our project and its significance in a more in depth manner."

This single button will be as much work as the rest of the Biobricker put together, though. The task is to create a copy of each individual Biobrick in world, inform each one where it belongs in the completed device, and link them all together. This will involve a lot of communication back and forth between the user interface object and the biobrick objects out in the world.
The Biobricker is in a very primitive state right now, with letters standing in for where all the pretty icons will be in the final version. So instead here's a screenshot of the Main Menu, with the link to the Biobricker visible.
The UI fits in at the top left corner of the screen. The red letters are buttons, that cause the UI to be redrawn with a new menu for whichever module you've chosen. I hope this gives you an idea of how the UI fits into the overall simulator.

Continuation of last day's work
Today, I edited the high school presentation proposition again and sent it out to Mrs. Ellechuk. I filled in the lab notebook and filled out the daily updates on the wiki.
I finished typing out the acknowledgement for each mentor/advisor of iGEM Calgary. I also helped to write references for Sonja. Then I finished off with mailing out more newsletters. We also had a very productive team meeting today.
On Monday I have to follow up with the companies which I have been contacting for the past few days. I will also call our hotel in Boston to change a few rooms around.

Continuing along the path
Construction of the path is almost complete and finals plans were mapped out but are subject to change to make room for future virtual demonstrations. In order to complete each station I've decided that a Hawaiian Bobtail Squid will be added to each that will tell visitors about what they see. It will preferably be very interactive (ie. move around and talk to you rather than give a notecard) so as to be fun and educational for the junior high and high school audience we are targeting. The squid that was already in the synthetic kingdom was slightly modified in order to match the physical characteristics of the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid.

Enter ""Chitosan"" into the search mask yields promising results.  We see great potential in the search mask. Just a short search yielded results as good as a long Google search. Also lovely, the possibility to have an overview of the total project of other teams, their parts and their final position. This is a realy good tool to get an overview of old projects without the need of reading their Wiki.  Unfortunately, a small sample on teams related to chitosan showed many empty fields. Using the feature ""Project"" and designing custom parts is a  little bit buggy . The select'n'drop feature is an awesome idea for sequence design, but the resulting sequence was shown at the top of the window, It is also a bit confusing that some parts have quite good informations in the information box right, but other ones have none or they are not dislayed. In addition it is noch really clear how one can select special parts. This is just a small test of your tool. We see tremendous potential in the searchable database for  related projects and we want to encourage the next-year's iGEM TU Darmstadt team to use your database as a possible start of their research.
Optogenetic seminar in Düsseldorf
On September 1st 2017 we were invited by the team of Cologne-Düsseldorf to participate in a seminar about optogenetics. Since we were looking for regulatory systems for our chitin deacetylases, we gladly followed this invitation. We saw a great opportunity in the use of optogenetics and wanted to learn more about the laboratory routine in this field. The seminar started with an introduction to the currently available optogenetic switches by Patrick Fischbach. The iGEM Team from Cologne-D üsseldorf presented their project and shared their experience on common mistakes in optogenetic laboratories. Each team was given the opportuni-ty to present their project to the audience and to throw light on the optogenetic aspects of their project. We presented our project and our plans to establish an orthogonal regulatory system for our chi-tindeacetylases. Optogenetic switches represent interesting tools for this purpose. In the aftermath of the presentations Cologne-Düsseldorf gave a guided tour through their optogenetic laboratories, illustrating general handling of optogenetic tools. Cologne-Düsseldorf further provided con-struction plans for a light-box, used to store and specifically induce optogenetic systems. Our future team can easily rebuild it and will be able to work with optogenetic circuits. We"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," formation on the outside of the catheter we would immobilize bacteria in a gel that would coat the outer surface. One option would be to form the gel into fibres that could be wrapped around the catheter and fixed in place with medical adhesive. The advantage to this is that the fibres would have a large surface area to volume ratio, ensuring greater diffusion of our DNase and DspB out of the gel and improving the anti-biofilm effect. A similar approach has been taken with previous catheter designs that are currently on the market, with coatings that contain silver nanoparticles, antibiotics etcetera.
An alternative would be to encase our bacteria in a thin sol-gel film; keeping our bacteria confined to the catheter surface but still allowing them to maintain their activity from within the gel. The properties of the gel could be adjusted so that it would be hydrophilic, aiding the insertion of the catheter and improving the comfort for the patient while in place. Our kill-switch design would be particularly useful here as it could be used to kill and bacteria that escaped the gel matrix. Engineering the kill-switch would take too long when compared to the timescale of our project so is not something we have attempted; however there is published literature that has shown it to work.
Manufacturing
Currently catheters are very cheap to produce, and thus as part of our project we decided to look into how we could introduce the beads into the pipe during the manufacturing process. We spoke to a mechanical engineer, Steve Dinsdale, and he helped us with a design for a machine that could do this. The machine would use the technique of extrusion to make the tube and then a second cooled inflow tube would introduce the beads. This would hopefully keep the bacteria cool enough so they are not killed, while the polymer at a high enough temperature to remain thermoplastic and form the tube.
Manufacturing idea from mechanical engineer Steven Dinsdale
Potential problems:
If this design were used for catheter production the bacteria could potentially not survive the sterilisation process at the end of the manufacturing.
Steps further down in the manufacturing process could harm our bacteria.
The bacteria may not survive in storage due to the length of time stored, temperature, etc

In mosquitoes there is no problem with the presence of viruses in the blood or issues with treatment availabilities. However, there is currently not a great need for a new field test for viral diseases in blood fed mosquitoes. It only becomes a necessity after a disease is transmitted from animals to humans.

Week 5
MONDAY, JUNE 20
The week began with a strong focus on human practices as the team fleshed out 3 ideas. The first, iNAC, the iGEM North American Conference, was sparked by the observation that many more European than North American teams medal, and of those that medal, the proportion of golds is substantially higher for Europe. The concept is a “Going for Gold” event to facilitate better understanding of iGEM requirements, lab practices, and the constitution of a winning project. This event would take place in summer 2017, co-hosted in Chicago by Purdue and several other Midwest teams (in theory, anyway). In conjunction with iNAC, the team is hoping to host iNIC (iGEM Northern Indiana Conference) to discuss the possibility of coordinating iNAC. If this event is pursued, it would be a day-long conference at the end of July.
The third idea is in regards to the Great North American Skype Series (G-NASS), a “Skype roulette” to foster inter-team communication. There would be a goal of 20 teams participating in a couple of 30-minute calls. More to come soon.

Although we cannot make sure whether AOX enzyme was displayed on the cell surface of E. coli or not in this moment. In addition, it is noted that according to the manufacture’s instruction, the substrate (ethanol), bacteria (E. coli) or LO-expressed E. coli has a basal level of fluorescence intensity. To count the measures clearly, you should subtract the background intensity.
Figure 4: AOX enzyme activity assay. The various concentrations of ethanol were reacted with E. coli displaying AOX enzymes. The assay was performed using Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The readout was presented in arbitrary unit to show the enhanced AOX activity caused by alcohol concentration in a dose-dependent manner.
 
 
Taken together, we cloned the AOX genes, tested our expression system and performed protein analysis followed by the enzyme activity assay. Now, we’re ready to examine the chemical properties of AOX enzyme in an electrochemical experiments and apply it to the analyzer.
*If you want to learn more, please go to our modeling page.
Glucose oxidase (GOX) and alcohol oxidase (AOX) are oxidoreductase enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of glucose and alcohol, respectively. When applied to an electrochemical analyzer, the electrode covered with a given enzyme will generate current signal, which intensity is corresponding to the concentration of substrates. Before this application, the enzyme’s reduction potential need to be determined and set up a program to convert the current intensity to a digital number revealing the real concentration of a sample measured. For example, in the blood glucose meter, the reduction potential of GOX is -97 ± 3 mV ( Anal Chem. 2014 ) and set on the analyzer to facilitate the redox reaction between GOX enzyme and the substrate, glucose. Unfortunately, the reduction potential of AOX is not well studied. Therefore, we have to determine the reduction potential of AOX prior to applying on the blood alcohol meter we want to create.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cyclic voltammetry is a potentiodynamic electrochemical measurement, in which the working electrode potential is ramped linearly versus time. The ramping potential move forward to the maximum and backward to the minimum, the cycle continues until the end of the experiment. In a CV experiment, electrochemical properties of a chemical molecule in the solution can be studied.
To analyze the electrochemical properties of AOX, a cyclic voltammetry experiment was performed to determine the reduction potential of AOX. 50"

1.Improvement in detecting method in DmpR response intensity.
(1) We realized the quantitative measurement in DmpR response intensity using Renilla Luciferase. Compared to GFP team Peking-2013 used, we can detect DmpR response intensity more accurately.
Figure 1. DmpR circuit. (A) Peking-2013 (B) Jilin-2017
(2) Renilla Luciferase enabled us to conduct the measurement in vivo, which provided an easier and faster method in detecting.
2.Improvement in response intensity toward certain phenolics.
Team Jilin_China in 2017 did several mutagenesis in sensor domain of DmpR. To compare the difference between Peking-2013 DmpR and our mutated DmpR downstreaming of the same constitutive promoter, we chose phenol, 2-CP, 4-CP, 2,4-DCP and pyrocatechol as the inducer. Expression level of Renilla Luciferase downstream of dmp operon (P0 promoter) was used to indicate the response intensity towards different phenolics. Comparisons were based on ratio of different DmpR response and mock's toward phenol, 2-CP, 4-CP, 2,4-DCP and pyrocatechol respectively.
Figure 2. The device we constructed to do comparison between peking-2013 dmpR and our mutated DmpR
It turned out that both DmpR can response to phenol, 2-CP, pyrocatechol. However, compared to Peking-DmpR, our DmR showed better response to phenol and pyrocatechol.

One-step Site-directed Mutagenesis
We inserted target sequence into plasmid to construct our alkali induced promoter P-atp2. However, there is an EcoRI site exists in its sequence. So we must change it for standardizing it. Our protocol is rather simple. We just use PCR to perform it, one-step site-directed mutagenesis. In our whole experimental processes, we used it many times to the EcoRI site mutation."

SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"KmBis the Michaelis Constant of substrate B when [A] is saturated.
In KS Reaction, both two substrates (Proplonyl-CoA and (2S)Methylmalonyl-CoA) are anchored on ACP domains. And what's more, ACP domains anchoring substrates belong to the same DEBS 1. We can easily draw a conclusion that the concentration of substrate A equals to substrate B’s, that is, [A]=[B]. Therefore, this kinetic model can be simplified. The simplified equation is:
After perfection, the final equation is:
[A0]is the concentration of DEBS 1.
[F] is the concentration of product in enzyme catalyzed reactions in last step.
[D] is the concentration of product in KS domain catalyzed reactions.
3.  KR Part
The reaction mechanism of KR Reaction is Ping-pong bi-bi + T-C bi-bi. It is a little more complex so that the related kinetic equation can’t be written out. Therefore, we simplify the reaction mechanism directly.
Because NADPH and NADP+ is dynamic-balanced in vivo of E.coli and their concentrations are constant, we needn’t consider the amount of NADPH participating in the reactions and the output of NADP+ in the analysis simplifying reaction mechanism. And the graph of mechanism is written as:
However, the amount of NADPH does have a certain influence on KR domain catalyzed reactions, so we should regard NADPH as a kind of inhibitor of KR domain, that is, KR domains will lose efficacy after they provide protons and NADPHs don’t compensate immediately. Then description is similar to enzyme inhibitor’s. Therefore, the final simplified equation is:
[A0]is the concentration of DEBS 1.
[H] is the concentration of NADPH and KR domain.
KIis the dissociation constant of NADPH and KR domain.
[J] is the concentration of product in enzyme catalyzed reactions in last step.
[Q] is the concentration of product in KS domain catalyzed reactions.
4. DH Part
The reaction mechanism of DH Part is single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions. The kinetic equation is :

Introduction
Synthetic Biology is the engineering of Biology [1] . It attempts to make the construction of novel biological entities easier by introducing engineering concepts such as standardization, decoupling and abstraction [2] . Standardization refers to the introduction of shared units ( [3] , [5] ) and DNA standards [4] . Decoupling means splitting up complex problems into simpler ones and can be best realized by introducing an abstraction hierarchy, ranging from ""Parts"" [2] (DNA, genes and proteins) and ""devices"" (a number of parts combined to process inputs to a functional output [6] ) to ""modules"" (a set of interconnected devices that performs complex tasks [7] ). Parts,  devices and eventually modules would ideally be made freely available from a central registry. The Registry of Standard Biological Parts ( http://www.partsregistry.org/ ) is an early implementation of such a collection of parts. Many parts in the registry are constructed from teams participating at iGEM( [8] , [9] ), the world's premiere student competition in synthetic biology & biotechnology.
A further lesson learned from engineering is that the only efficient way to construct systems of high complexity (such as computers or airplanes) is simulating these systems on the computer prior to construction [7] . The construction of systems behaving predictably is indeed possible in biology, as two impressive publications demonstrate: Basu et al. |[10] show that programmed patterns can be formed by bacteria with transcriptional repressors of different strength at hand. Very recently, Ellis et al. |[11] built scalable  timers in yeast from a library of promoters of different strength. For systems to behave predictably, it"

Then it will stimulate some neurons and ultimately achieve the purpose of nematode movement control.
However, during the evaluation, we found that some of their biobricks are so new that we nearly couldn't find them in our database which covered the data in the iGEM official website. The result showed that those biobricks were never synthesized before.
Beyond that, we also found the regulator BBa_K1634003 is almost 80% similar to BBa_K309026 which is made by a team from Canada. This result might be used to compare the function of their biobricks with the other team; and explored more useful information from the alike one. ”
2.2.2 Feedback
Through this cooperation, we help them find advantages and disadvantages of their software.
Advantage:
They have focused their software on scoring the parts but ignored there is another strong function of their software, which is helping users to search for a similar or relative parts more efficiently, thus helps a lot for comparing and improving their parts. SJTU-Software starts pay more attention on this function and improve it.
Disadvantage:
During the evaluation, they found that our biobricks are so new that they couldn't find them in our database which covered the data in the iGEM official website. The result showed that those biobricks were never synthesized before. Then they couldn’t score our parts. Since most of the parts submitted by iGEM teams are new, we suggest them expanding their data source to cover more parts which can make it a more functional scoring system.

3.1 Introduction
In order to know people' attitudes to iGEM ,Synthetic biology and Biology safety, we made this survey. From the result we have received, we get many useful information.
There are altogether 317 person filled in our questionnaire. Most of them(95.9%) come from all over China such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, etc. Some of them(4.1%) come from other countries such as Congo-Brazzaville, Australia and so on.

Wet-Lab-Project Safety
In addition to the general lab safety, we talked to the safety advisor on our campus, Dr. Willi Siller, with whom we double checked the feasibility of the project concerning its safety. One of his first questions was, which biosafety-level our donor- and chassis-organisms were ranked in. For the chassis-organism, this question was easy to answer, as we only used different strains of E. coli K12 and hence they all are ranked S1. As far as the donor organisms are concerned, the list is longer. However, all of them are categorized as S1, except for D. acidovorans, which is ranked S2 in Germany if used as a chassis-organism.
This classification is due to the fact that D. acidovorans is capable of causing inflammatory diseases such as endocarditis. Still, we can well justify the work with D. acidovorans on the strength of two aspects: Firstly, we never use D. acidovorans as chassis-organism and secondly, upon research, we spotted that the pathogenicity of D. acidovorans is based on proteins belonging to the Omp-family. The genes, that encode for those proteins are on a different locus than our genes of interest – the Del-cluster.
Consecutively, we can conclude that the work with either of the organisms we use for our project carries any risks for neither the experimentalist, nor for non-participants, if good laboratory practice is adhered to. As far as the peptides is concerned, we can state confidently that none of the peptides that we synthesize in our project are toxic or in any way hazardous. Tyrocidine is harmful to human blood and reproductive cells, but will never be used as entire peptide (i.e. only several amino acids) and was, besides that, publically available as antibiotic.
Within our project, we however intend to share knowledge with the broad scientific community and introduce a new and efficient way of in vivo production of short peptides via NRPSs. The framework of NRPS of course allows production of various peptides, and hence it is imaginable that this system is accidently or intendedly used for the synthesis of perilous products. There is however a straight-forward justification for either of the aforementioned dangers: Firstly, to avert unintended production"

Of course, each group also measures the fluorescence of a positive (pure riboflavin in water) and a negative (chalk dust in water) control.
While the other groups wait for their turn, their supervisors explain the background of this experiment: The electrons in some molecules change into energy states when irradiated with electromagnetic waves. When returning to the normal state, the electrons dissipate excess energy, also in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This process is called fluorescence. Vanilla pudding contains the molecule riboflavin (vitamin B2). When riboflavin is irradiated with blue light, the molecule fluoresces green. The intensity of the green light is visually recorded by our device. Special software processes the data and the measured value is displayed on the cellphone connected to the device via Bluetooth. We will discuss the results of the experiment next class.
Lesson 7 - Teaching Module Wrap-Up
By Nina 16:32, June 05 2014 (CDT)
Today Nina and Arne discussed last class's experiment. Arne explained to the students the meaning behind the values measured, and how the students can use the value to determine the concentration of riboflavin in their vanilla pudding samples.
Subsequently, Nina explained the students how we are going to manipulate regular E. coli cells, using synthetic biology methods, to carry out the desired functions. The students also learned, what role promoters play in gene regulation, and how our iGEM team wants to regulate the expression of the genes artificially inserted into the E. coli cells.
Now we have individually discussed all aspects of our project. Therefore, Nina summarized all the topic together with the students, and outlined the link between all these different topics and our iGEM project idea. In doing so, we almost arrived at the end of our teaching module ""Synthetic Biology"". Next class, we will visit the biology-chemistry course of Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium for the last time, and do some career-exploration in synthetic biology and related fields.

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
Patronage and Acknowledgement
We thank Prof. Herrmann for supporting us and his ""Schirmherrschaft"" over our project. This does not only make us feel like we are really representing the Technical University Munich but also equips us with the hope that we did not only start an iGEM team at the TUM, but also that younger students will proceed our work and also participate at te next iGEM competition. Thank you very much for the appreciation of our work and effort!
We would also really like to thank all people working in Prof. Simmel's group, E14 in the chemistry/physics department/ZNN. A lot of our work would not have been possible without your help and support. Thanks for providing us your technical equipement and for offering us working space, virtual space and a coffee machine. We also thank the whole Simmel group for nice conversations in between measurements, patience, help and for just accepting us in their group!
We also like to thank Prof. Simmel himself for his personal effort, there are not many professors around who pay the registration fee from their private money without knowing if they will ever get it back... (don't worry, he got it back in the end). And of course for the initiation to start an iGEM team at the TU Munich and finally adding some of the TUM's glamour to iGEM "
