Bio-remediation: Carbon fixation
Overview
CO2 levels are rising and will likely have significant effects on the biosphere. Many propose that the proper action to take is to eliminate and eventually sequester large amounts of CO2 in order to abate or attempt to reverse the effects.
Comments
Fixation via photosynthesis
Fixation via carbonic anhydrase, base for limestone synthesis
?
During our brainstorming session, we discussed bio-remediation for carbon fixation, but also respect to oil spills. Any ideas? MandM 16:22, 7 June 2009 (UTC)
Preemptive Part Optimization
Much time in (synthetic) biology is spent optimizing devices after importing parts from a model organism into a different model. A focused effort could eliminate these problems. This project would likely involve"
UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Project#Protein Cages_-_-_TEXT.html," it allows 12 subunits to come together, in order to create a cage that has tetrahedral symmetry(2).
Figure 1: Structure of a designed protein cage.  Geometric models illustrate the design principle of fusing two distinct, naturally oligomerizing proteins together in a specific geometry.  Twelve subunits combine to form a cage with tetrahedral symmetry.  Figure is adapted from Lai, Y.-T., Cascio, D. & Yeates, T. O. Structure of a 16-nm Cage Designed by Using Protein Oligomers. Science (80-. ). 336, 1129–1129 (2012).
The goal of our project is to modify this protein cage such that disassembly can be induced by thrombin protease.  Proteases are enzymes that cleave at specific amino acid sequences; therefore, if our cage contained the sequence shown here, it can be disassembled by thrombin-induced cleavage.  This would have potential applications such as controlled release of loaded drugs/imaging molecules from inside the cage.  So why did we pick thrombin to work with?  Thrombin was specifically chosen due to it being relatively well-studied, and because of its role in the coagulation cascade5, which contributes to heart disease and stroke the first and fifth leading causes of death in the United States, respectively(7).
Methodology and Preliminary Results
Design of Protein Cage Mutants Using previous crystallographic data, we visualized the protein cage using pymol (Figure 2).  We then identified potential insertion sites based on two criteria: 1. The insertion had to be sterically accessible to protease binding 2.  The insertion had to theoretically have minimal effects on initial protein cage assembly. 13 Protein Cage Mutants were designed and listed on a table in our notebook. Link to Notebook .  We successfully cloned our top protein cage mutant (Mutant 10), based on the above criteria.
Figure 2: Protein Cage Visualization.  The 12-subunit protein cage (left) is highlighted with each 3-subunit apex highlighted.  A single apex (right) with the potential insertion sites highlighted in red.  The protein cage was visualized using pymol. PDB ID: 3VDX.
Purification of Protein Cage
Since the protein cage was cloned to contain a C-terminal 6-histidine tag, affinity purification was used to isolate the native cage and the mutant protein cage.  The purification of the native protein cage was done using SDS-PAGE (Figure 3).

We have KcsA* simulation and D-Ala simulation
KcsA simulation
1. preparation
We got the PDB files (ID:5VKH) from the ncbi ,the files included the structure of the single subunit and also the complete protein make up of 4 subunits.
We used molecular dynamic simulation to imitate the protein in computer.The software we used is Gromacs 5.1.1
A new forcefield called GROMOSNWU is generated by adding and modifying the original GROMOS53A6 which cannot simulate a membrane.We added the parameters of lipid(dppc) from here http://wcm.ucalgary.ca/tieleman/downloads .
2. build KcsA and KcsA*
Because the coordinate of KcsA is from the X-ray [1]diffraction of the actual protein ,we use the transmembrane domain to run the simulation as the controlled experiment.
And we change the Gly77 into D-Ala77 to build the KcsA*.
3. put the protein into membrane
First ,we orientate the symmetry axis of protein parallel to Z-axis.
Then we merge the file with another file which has a membrane from here.The membrane settles in the XY plane and makes up of 64 dppc.
4. shrink the membrane
We can see that the distance between 2 dppc is too far,which in practice must be very close to become a membrane.We need to shrink the membrane to avoid the water get in to the split of dppc-dppc and dppc-protein.

8th August
The team discussed about the work on zeocin,pA-f1-Zec biobrick, which will indeed be an improvement of BBa_J176124 because:
i) it gives most of the functionality of BBa_J176124 but is compatible with standard assembly
ii) it allows people to simply insert a PROMOTER-ORF fragment upstream of a pA to give an expression cassette for the ORF of interest, and a ZEC to select stable transfectants.

Both, the trans-activator(taR12y) and the cis-repressor (crR12y) together with superfolder green fluorecent protein (sfGFP), are under control of pLux. Upon induction with LuxR/3OC6-HSL, both are transcribed simultaneously and the taR12y (key symbol) opens up the crR12y sequence (lock) in front of the sfGFP mRNA. This enables translation and sfGFP production (left-hand side). Low transcription (leakiness) gives only small concentrations of mRNA, as a result 'lock' (cis-repressor) and 'key' (trans-activator) structures do not encounter each other and the translation is not enabled (right-hand side).
The first set of experiments was conducted with cells transformed with two different pPaB plasmids. These plasmids contained either the pBR322 origin (pMB1) or the p15A origin, yielding  a stable two-plasmid system with about 15-20 copies per plasmid and cell (medium-copy).  Furthermore the published riboregulator sequence includes two forbidden restriction sites (EcoRI and XbaI), since the sites removal   could affect the folding or functionality of the part, the original sequences were used as a control.  After characterizing the original part the restriction sites were removed by two different approaches: a) multiple site-directed mutagenesis, b) blunting and ligation (Klenow and T4 DNA polymerase). The new Biobrick compatible riboregulator was tested to confirm that no severe loss-of-function occurred due to the site-removal. In a third step, the construct was transferred into the pSB1C3 backbone (pMB1 origin, high copy number of 100-300) to be in line with the BioBrick Standard . Below, you can find the corresponding graphs in figure 2 and figure3, respectively. Future characterization of these constructs should allow us to explore the leakiness dependence on plasmid amount and if the tight expression is robust for different copy numbers.
We have characterized promoters response of the three quorum-sensing systems. These are pLux, pLas, and pRhl . We first measured the transfer functions with a non-regulated RBS in front of sfGFP, i. e. the amount of fluorescence in dependence of the inducer concentration present and compared the response with the corresponding riboregulated constructs with and without the forbidden restriction sites. All experiments were carried out in "

This result demonstrates that people in China still hold a superficial and inadequate perception in the cognition of the malignant degree and the death rate of cancer.
The attitude towards cancer treatment and new therapies
● Of the 780 respondents, curative efficacy and side effects were their top priority concern if selecting cancer treatment.
● Under the influence of ""Wei Zexi incident"" (a malpractice due to deceptive advertising of immune therapy), 40.86% of the respondents worried about the curative effect and side effect of immune therapy as a new therapy for cancer, and 31.04% said they are afraid to be cheated and take advantage of by criminals when try a new therapy. 24.75% said they would believe the latest research achievements, while only 3.34% expressed entrust or even rejection of immune therapy.
● With a brief introduction of the background of molecular targeted drugs (e.g. Iressa), 64.87% of respondents were open to molecular targeting drugs and consider it acceptable, while 18.27% respondents were worried about the high expense, which they may be unable to afford. It should be noted that there are still 16.92% of the objects consider the immunotherapy as immature and are unwilling to take any risk.

Interview with doctor
To better understand the current situation of cancer treatment and further shape our project direction, we interviewed a doctor from Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School (also known as ‘Drum-tower Hospital’) for a broad view of therapeutic concern from professional perspective. There are many teams focusing on technical problems on the interaction between targeting drugs and their models, but the acceptance and trust issues from patients are less discussed. In our project, attitudes of patients is correspondingly valued, so we interviewed doctors from Drum-tower Hospital (Its oncology department is the National Key Clinical Specialist) for their opinions on patients’ acceptance and our project. The suggestion would not only be used for the further improvement of our project, but also provide a general concept of the safety issue that must be dealt with when synthetic biology encounters clinical medicine. Their professional experience and advices are valuable if we want to apply synthetic biology to a broader clinical field in the near future.

The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the"

IISER Pune made a really comprehensive presentation, which left the entire audience in   awe,  and  in  a  way  left  the  other  teams  with  no  choice  but  to  further  improvise  their   presentations. All the IISER Pune team members participated and contributed to their extensive   presentation, which had a significant amount of their project modelling data as well (computer   simulation based work). They had also covered good ground with regard to their wet lab work,   and had it divided into three sub­parts, each handling a particular aspect of the wet­lab work.   While  IISER  Pune  wishes  to  compete  in  the  Health  and  Medicine  track  of  iGEM,  IIT  Delhi   wishes to compete in the environment track. IIT Delhi also made a very descriptive presentation   of  their  idea,  which  was  appreciated  by  the  audience.  After  each  of  the  team  presentations   (which  typically  lasted  about  an  hour),  there  were  question­answer  sessions  held,  where  the   clarity and idea of each of the teams’ projects were scrutinized. Very  useful  suggestions  and  points  were  raised  for  each  of  the  teams  post  their   presentations,  and  all  the  discussions  (both  formal  and  informal)  were  very  productive  and   propitious  for  the  teams"

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," overall plant production. In Vázquez’s professional opinion, there is should not be any problem in the application of  high-tech tools given that the current devices used are being successfully implemented.
To learn more about greenhouses in the United States, we collaborated with the iGEM team at Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana. Several American greenhouse owners responded to a questionnaire sent to them regarding their respective greenhouses and current problems they are facing.
GREENHOUSES EVALUATION SUMMARY
What follows are the conclusions reached based on the information gathered from interviews:
There is general acceptance for any progress made to increase food accessibility, food production, nutritional values, and organoleptic properties of crops.
The SynBio device developed should have the capacity to detect stresses prematurely in order to reduce losses and increase production.
There is high interest for a device that controls all climate variables to optimize plant production. Moreover, the ability to manipulate the plant’s environment would allow plant growth in places known to be naturally unfeasible.
One of the major differences between American and European greenhouse owners are that American greenhouse owners are much more open-minded.
RESTAURANTS ANALYSIS
Food science arose as an applied science dedicated to the study and improvement of food from the engineering, biology and technology point of view. A more sustainable agriculture adapted to consumers necessities and desires is possible controlling plant control, both in a genetic and environmental approach.
Four Michelin star awarded restaurants, El Riff , Canalla Bistro , El Poblet and Sents,  were interviewed in order to obtain their opinion about GMOs and automated growing systems.
Different conclusions were extracted from the interviews:
An interest of self-designed food from the beginning of the plant growth.
High-quality off-season products
Proximity and accessible fruits and vegetables.
GENERAL PUBLIC ANALYSIS
Social acceptance must be considered in order to develop a suitable project. A survey was developed with the objective of gaining a societal perspective on agriculture and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). The survey also served as an evaluation as to how the project can make an impact on society.
This survey was reviewed and studied by ‘Data UPV’, a student run group at the Polytechnic University of Valencia which specializes in data analysis. The following points can be extracted from the survey results :
Seasonal and local fruits and vegetables are preferred (55,5%) over imported and off-season products. (44,5%)
Household horticulture is an enticing idea (96,5%) but time (64,3%) and space (44,6%) constraints are both two obstacles for its development.

Alex, Catrin, Emily, Andy – Continued work on the stop-motion project.
StJohn & Ruxi – Formed project proposals for the laboratory experiments.
2nd July
The team had a meeting with Philipp Boeing, primarily about Human Practice and which direction should be taken in terms of gaining awareness and also funding for the project. Ruxi and StJohn then continued working on experimental protocol preparation while the rest of the team visited the Science Museum to look at their Alzheimer's exhibit for inspiration on both project development and artistic direction that our human practices should take.
3rd July
The Majority of the group continued to work on the proposals as some of the components were found to be difficult to obtain or not feasible. Tom began the YSB poster design, Robin continued on the modelling proposal.
4th July
The entire group attended safety training demonstrated by Brian O’Sullivan. A meeting was also held with experts in the field concerning microglia, Jenny Reagen amongst others.
Tom continued on poster design with Catrin looking at previous posters for inspiration. Andy met with Bethan Wolfenden to talk about debating, the rest of the group.
5th July
Tom & Catrin – Worked on the poster and finished it, as well as the presentation
Alex, Andy and Weiling – Focussed on human practises, pafrticularly essay writing and documentary planning.
KC, Ruxi and StJohn – Continued work on proposals and sent completed documents to Darren.
8th July
Meeting with Darren leads to more work on proposals, particularly procurement and logistics of items required for laboratory work. The group also spent a lot of time discussing titles for the project, with ‘Plaque Buster’ and ‘Memory Guardian’ being the more popular names in an alternate voting system.
9th July
Following the meeting with Darren yesterday, the group met and rectified the experiments system to make it clearer and more achievable to obtain bronze, silver and gold medals, reducing the number of new parts required from 12 to 3 essential ones, for example.
10th July
The group sent the new proposal to Dr. Darren Nesbeth, and are to wait for a response before continuing with specific inventory/experiment write ups. Instead, the group allocated roles for this should the proposal be accepted, and then went to the gallery of surgery to investigate cranial injections, and the implications and feasibility of this form of surgery.

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"To further address ethics we have also included an ethics video in our series of synthetic biology videos for young people at school/in sixth form. To do this we undertook some research and discovered that Synthetic biologists have already taken a proactive attitude by collaborating with social scientists and engaging with the public from the outset to help further the publics understanding and help diminish controversy. For example, the four Research Councils in the UK (BBSRC, EPSRC, ESRC and AHRC) have created and jointly funded seven research networks that include researchers interested in the ‘ethical, legal and social implications' (ELSI) of synthetic biology. These networks encourage regular meetings of synthetic biologists and ELSI researchers, informing both sides about technological and ELSI progress. Moreover, public engagement meetings that should ensure the correct interpretation of the biotechnological achievements, and future public acceptance, are strongly encouraged. The European Commission initiated the SYNBIOSAFE consortium ( http://www.synbiosafe.eu/ ) focusing on the discussion of biosafety and ethical concerns, and facilitating a socially acceptable development in all related fields.  As part of our outreach activities we will also be doing a synthetic biology presentation in a sixth form class at the beginning of September. During this presentation we will be undertaking an exercise in order to make the pupils understand the importance of considering ethics in the world of science and it will hopefully give us more of an idea of what the public think about synthetic biology and what ethical concerns they have around the subject area.  We are currently working on a survey based purely on the ethics of synthetic biology and will be posting the comments and feedback we received as we get it so be on the look out!
Ethics Assessment Form
Click to download our proposed Ethics Assessment Form This form is designed to encourage the contemplation and assessment of all ethical issues involved within your iGEM project. The form is split into five sections addressing various aspects of ethical implications a synthetic biology project could have. The concept of this is similar to a risk assessment form and adopts a pseudo-quantitative analytical approach. The main assessment component is in tabular form, below are instructions for completing these tables with each column explained.
Identify - State here the ethical hazards in question and the target audience that it could potentially affect and elaborate in as much detail as possible what implications they could result in
Control - State here the controls e.g. elimination, substitution, engineering controls and personal protective equipment which will be used to minimise the risks from the ethical hazards. Continue on a separate sheet if necessary.

A low-cost DIY methane sensor for Team Braunschweig
Our colleagues from Braunschweig are cultivating microorganisms that grow on methane (CH4) which is supplied via the gas phase. To monitor the methane uptake by their E. co(w)li, they would like to measure the methane concentration in the gas phase. With the standard analytical methods in the lab, this is very difficult, but when they told us about their problem, we knew that we might be able to help them. We assembled an Arduino-based methane sensor and wrote a program to record the data.
The componentes for the methane sensor include:
Arduino Nano V3 clone
SainSmart MQ-4 Gas Sensor
A Breadboard and some wires
To set up the electronics for a measurement, the sensor and the Arduino have to be connected according to the following scheme:
Connecting the MQ-4 module to the Arduino
Only three wires are required to connect the MQ-4 module to the Arduino Nano.
We sent all the components to Braunschweig and they assembled the Arduino and sensor module in an incubation chamber:
MQ-4 sensor in the gas phase
For anaerobic cultivation, a wireless connection might be better.
Online data on a laptop
The Arduino is connected to a laptop running our Serial Client software to plot and collect online data.
The software used to monitor the online methane concentration data is the Serial Client that was also developed by our team.

Uppsala,2015,Team:Uppsala#Results enz_-_-_TEXT.html," turquoise colour after being loaded. Also, the colour was not washed away during the IMAC procedure. There is a risk that the polyhistidine-tag, that was fused to the proteins, had folded into the protein and was not exposed on the protein surface. The tag needs to be on the surface of the protein to enable interaction with the nickel-enriched gel. This could have been checked by denaturing the protein samples prior to the IMAC, which would ensure that the his-tag was fully unfolded. This would however require renaturation of the protein to be able to measure enzyme activity.
ABTS assay on ModLac and CueO
ABTS is a commonly used substrate when evaluating reaction kinetics of specific enzymes. Due to its reduction potential, it acts as an effective electron donor. Since we are working with laccases, which are multi copper oxidases, which oxidize substrates, ABTS is a suitable substrate. ABTS will donate electron to reduce molecular oxygen. The oxidized ABTS has a different absorption spectrum and the reaction can thus be observed in a spectrophotometer.
The enzyme assays of the lysates with ABTS showed a significant difference in enzyme activity between CueO and the mutant CueO, also known as ModLac (Figure 11). In an article by Kataoka’s research group, the investigated CueO mutant showed to have a higher enzyme activity than the wild type (Kataoka K et al. 2012). This is confirmed by our results. The ModLac is designed so that the active site is the same as the double mutant that Kataoka and his research team investigated, but with some modifications at the C- and N-terminus. These modifications were made so that the enzyme would be exported from the cell and so that it could be easily purified. Restriction sites were added around these features so that it could be easily manipulated by our team and other iGEM teams that would like to use it for different purposes. These modifications could have affected the enzymatic activity by indirectly interfering with the active site. We tried to prevent this by adding a flexible linker sequence between the sequence coding for the laccase and the HlyA-export tag so that it would fold correctly. The conclusion that can be made after observing the results is that the designed ModLac have a better enzymatic activity than the wild type Laccase CueO ( BBa_K863006 ). We have therefore improved the function of an already existing biobrick and supplemented further characterization of wild type CueO ( BBa_K863006 ) when it is compared with ModLac"

The team came together during a course in mammalian cell biology in June, and that was when the idea of iGEM popped into our heads. Even though we started the iGEM project late June, we have managed to design a fully standardized cloning system called Plug'n Play with DNA. We thought that time should be spent on making cool iGEM projects, instead of struggling with unwanted restriction sites and cumbersome assembly systems. This led us to standardize USER fusion by designing the Plug'n'Play with DNA assembly system.
Our Plug 'n' Play with DNA kit consist of:
49 ready-to-use BioBricks.
21 backup plasmids.
A quick 'n' easy guide on how to customize the standard
To ensure that the BioBricks and devices have been assembled correctly we have tested the functionality of them in Aspergillus nidulans and in mammalian cells. We have characterized the two fungal promoters, PalcA and DMKP-P6,  and demonstrated function of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in mammalian cells.  The characterization of the fungal promoters was successfully performed with an X-gal analysis, where the expression of ß-galactosidase results in blue colonies. Furthermore, quantitative ß-galactosidase and Bradford assays were performed in order to measure protein production and ß-galactosidase activity. Both promoters proved to be of medium strength. For demonstration of the Plug' Play with DNA system in mammalian cell lines, U-2 OS was transfected with plasmids containing genes encoding fluorescent proteins. The transfected cells capability to express the fluorescent proteins was investigated with confocal microscopy, which resulted in amazing pictures of fluorescent peroxisomes and coloured U-2 SO cells.

Overview
As a team we realize the importance of education when it comes to shaping and sharing the future of synthetic biology. Therefore, we incorporated education and public outreach throughout our project to mutually learn and open up the discussion about developments that have the potential to inherently change our society. Our project, ADOPE , encompasses more than the design of a detection method for gene doping and stimulates people to actively be aware of the opportunities as well as the threats of synthetic biology as applied to gene technology and beyond. In the table below we give a brief overview of what we have done, how we did it and the achievements.

The Microbeagle
A biological system designed to detect the presence of pathogens in water samples
Micro-Beagle is a novel reporter system for E-coli that, as an iGEM first, has been designed to dynamically detect arbitrary target solids (including other cells) through a mechanism activated by cell surface binding.
Micro-Beagle was initially developed to address the need for a low cost, energy efficient and robust tool to be used to assess the effectiveness of current water purification systems. As the Micro-Beagle is intended to operate at a low cost it is ideal for use in low-income areas where the testing of water purification techniques cannot be maintained at an acceptable frequency.
Micro-Beagle is designed to also be a modular system, utilising Ice Nucleation Protein to express and position target-binding peptides on the cell surface. Target binding induces membrane stress that activates the Cpx signalling pathway, and Micro-Beagle thus utilises a promoter from this pathway (pCpxR) to initiate expression of a reporter protein, such as GFP.
As a proof of concept, we have used silica beads as a model diagnostic target (a pathogen surrogate) and the silica-binding “Si4” sequence as the target-binding peptide.
We foresee Micro-Beagle being adapted for both the detection of waterborne pathogens and a variety of other diagnostic applications, and we envision future multisensor Micro-Beagles in which diverse pathogens can be simultaneously and quantit"

Alternative method
We tried ligating constructs, which did not have overlapping overhangs eg. Initiator-AB-BC, CA-AB and BC-CA-Terminator. This were obtained by ligating in series at 16 degrees celsius overnight. The lower temperature is suggested to increase the possibility of ligation. However the lower temperature also decrease the activity of T7 ligase. Thus we added a small amount of 40 mM ATP to the sample at each ligation step hoping to create a silk construct. Unfortunately we ran out of time due to expired streptavidin beads. The experiment are thus left for further trial.
Missing amplification of ThuricinS with silk overhangs
We noticed that using the standard primers from iGEM, VF2 and VR , our pPCR on plasmids containing the bacteriocin/silk-overhangs, the following digestion leaded to two bands that only differed by 1 bp from each other. We therefore decided to amplify our bacteriocin with silk-overhangs. However, after changing primers we experienced that the pPCR gave unexplainable results which included a lot of smear. Various pPCR programs were tested but we never ended up with a product that could be purified and used in the ICA method. We also tried to digest the pSB1C3 plasmid and the ThuricinS/silk-overhang pPCR product to perform a ligation into the pSB1C3 directly. This result was verified by gel electrophoresis. However, it was not possible to digest the plasmid containing the ThuricinS with silk overhangs and a purification could not be performed. Ligation between the ThuricinS and a silk monomer were therefore not achieved. For future testing it would be interesting to digest with restrictions enzymes for longer periods, or design new primers for the pPCR, necessary for ICA method.

Week Two
The S,R,Rz genes were provided already transformed.  We spent most of week two working on two separate projects: 1. Testing lysis with Optical Density measurements and 2. Construction of a precise and accurate measurement apparatus.
Multiple versions of the testing apparatus were made throughout the summer.  Initial designs included legos, skewers, pipette tips, and copper electrodes.  As the summer progressed, our apparatus became more complex.  We quickly made the transition from standard voltmeter to a Data Acquisition Card coupled with LabView Computer Software.  We quickly ditched the multi-stranded copper wires for Gold plated and Gold electrodes.  In addition, we moved to an alternating current to prevent the ions from settling on the electrodes and affecting current.
Week Three
Continued apparatus work in cooperation with Professor Jerry Daniels in Engineering and Daniel Ludwig, Biomedical Engineering '09.
We made serial dilutions of salt water to standardize the apparatus.  With this information we could determine the concentration of ions needed to cause a resistance change.
We continued to perform Optical Density tests to determine how long it should take for lysis to occur.
Week Four
PCR Primers ordered for PVJ4 in order to commence Biobricking procedures.  Primers, however, did not work.  Second and third sets were ordered.
Continued apparatus work.  Professor Tayhas Palmore gave us access to her lab to made PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) molds.  The PDMS mold allowed us to secure the placement of our electrodes.  Electrodes will remain in a fixed position approximately 1 cm apart.
Week Five
Continued work with the apparatus.  An amplifier was added.
Multiple tests with our PVJ4 plasmid were conducted, each one having a different concentration of engineered bacteria.  Solutions were concentrated up to 6X.
We also experimented with LB Lennox, Luria, M9 Minimal Media, Distilled/Sterile Water, as well as Milli-Q water.  Cells were pelleted and resuspended in one of the aforementioned liquids.  Cells grew the best in LB Lennox due to the greater concentration of ions and bacteria cell nutrients.  (LB Lennox - 5g NaCl/Liter  LB Luria - .5g NaCl/Liter)  We had to take into consideration osmotic gradients especially with non-ionic Milli-Q Water.

This resulted in complete expression plasmids of 2337 bp for apidaecin, 2442 bp for defensin 1, and 2388 bp for abaecin. Afterward, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cultures were transformed by heat shock for following antibiotic selection of clones. Next step consisted of plasmid extraction and electrophoresis of the undigested plasmids, linearized plasmids with one enzyme, and double digested plasmids. Agarose gels allowed the confirmation of the correct plasmid constructions.

Protein production
IPTG induction and extraction
Following the construction of each BioBrick, it was necessary to induce protein production. Since the T7 promoter regulates transcription of the construct, isopropyl β-D-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is used as an inducer for T7 RNA polymerase production. The concentration of IPTG used was 0.5 mM. After induction, the cultures were incubated for six hours at 37 °C and 225 rpm. After that, protein extraction by lysis solution was made in order to obtain the soluble peptides. For insoluble peptides, the sample was treated with lysis solution + 6 M urea.

Introduction
Disease and symptoms
Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an uncommon and possibly life-threatening inherited condition. If left undiagnosed, continued ingestion of fructose and other fructose-containing sugars (like sucrose) lead to hepatic and renal failure and growth retardation ( Ali et al, 1998 ), manifesting itself in symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain and hypoglycemia even after the uptake of smallest amounts of sugars ( Yasawy et al, 2009 ). The patient will eventually begin to avoid all kinds of sweet food including most of fruit and vegetables. A particular problem is posed by the nowadays common usage of sucrose and fructose in all kinds of industrial food, therefore it becomes hard to avoid the consumption of small amounts of fructose.
Molecular mechanism
HFI is caused by the catalytic deficiency of Aldolase B, a specialized enzyme of the fructose metabolism catalyzing the cleavage of fructose-1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerine aldehyde. If malfunctioning, fructose-1-phosphate accumulates in liver and renal cells and inhibits various enzymes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogen metabolism, leading to hypoglycemia and other symptoms mentioned above.
The project
Our project is based on the idea to give HFI patients their quality of life back by giving them the opportunity to eat fructose-containing food again. We genetically modified the probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii to metabolize fructose and sucrose instead of glucose by knocking out enzymes involved in glucose metabolism and increasing the uptake and metabolism of sucrose and fructose. The aim was to create a probiotic therapeutic, which  effectively removes these metabolites concurrent with digestion and thereby alleviates the symptoms of HFI patients. Therefore, our Lactobacillus johnsonii is an approach to help people suffering from HFI by giving them our probiotic to multiply their former limited options of healthy and delicious food."

Progress of experiments:
In the splicing process of genomic fragments, we encountered a serious problem, which was the                         spliced                         plasmids                         showed irregular base mutation or fragment loss. We thus consulted Prof. Gu for possible causes                         and                         solutions.
Prof. Gu shared with us his previous experimental experience, where he constructed the human                         mitochondrial genome                         into E. coli vector and transferred it into E. coli, and similar random mutations and fragment                         loss                         also occurred.                         He speculated that the reason might be the content of A and T bases in the mitochondrial genome                         is                         too                         high (about                         85%), leading to the failure of balance of four nucleotides and the death of cells. Based on                         this                         experience, we                         adjusted the experimental protocol and used a low-copy vector to lay the foundation for the                         splicing of                         the genome                         that finally succeeded. The interaction with Prof. Gu allows us to have new solutions to the                         experimental problems                         we encountered.
Genome delivery and functional verification in the future work:
Prof. Gu expressed his willingness to help us with the following genome delivery and to assist                         us                         in                         functional                         verification and long-term functional extensions based on minimal genomes. The interaction and                         cooperation with                         Prof. Gu have laid a vitally crucial foundation for us to continue to improve our entire                         project.
Integrated HP with Dr. Jiang and his group
This year our project is to design and synthesize a minimal S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome.                         As                         a                         basic study,                         we                         believe that it is very important to seek advice from professionals. Therefore, we have                         conducted                         detailed and                         extensive exchanges with Prof. Jiang Huifeng and his research group from Tianjin Institute of                         Industrial                         Biotechnology. We have obtained the full advice and support from Dr. Jiang and his research                         group                         for                         our project                         research, design and experimental development.
Dr. Jiang Huifeng, Deputy Director of the Key Laboratory of Systematic Microbial Engineering,                         Chinese                         Academy of                         Sciences and a researcher in Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of                         Sciences. Dr. Jiang                         focuses on the identification and design of novel biological parts. By combining omics                         technology                         and                         synthetic                         biology, he has developed new platforms to dig new genes for producing plant natural compounds                         and to                         design novel                         enzymes for one-carbon utilization.

Human CRISPR/Cas system against HIV
with gRNA delivered by
A-B toxin-based shuttle
SUSTC-Shenzhen, iGEM 2014
Introduction
In this project, we intended to establish a synthetic biology-based effective HIV-curing system with less side effects. The key goal is to integrate CRISPR/Cas system into human blood system to protect CD4+ cells against viral infection. The gRNA is designed to target the relative conserved regions in HIV viral genome and inactivate its biological activity. Since viral vectors seem to be of limited use in gene therapy strategies (e.g., potential pathogenicity), there is in dire need of a simple, efficient system for cell-specific delivery of nucleic acids. By using non-viral DNA delivery system such as A-B-toxin-GAL4 fusion protein, we can deliver plasmids encoding gRNA into the CD4+ cells and readily attack multiple HIV genome sites simultaneously with the most up-to-date knowledge of HIV epidemic.

Achievements
Nobody can do science on their own, so collaborating is a necessity. We had a lot of contact with the other Dutch iGEM teams, via e-mail and at the different meet-ups we attended. Our biggest collaboration is with the team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, with whom we had a lot of contact in the past months. Furthermore we attended three international meet-ups, in Delft, Wageningen and Leuven, where we had a lot of good conversations about science, iGEM and life.
Collaborate
University of Nebraska-Lincoln
After the UNL iGEM sent around there iGEM survey, The Amsterdam team and the UNL iGEM team got into contact about combining their knowledge and explore the possibilities of a combined future application of their projects.  In this collaboration, the UNL iGEM team and the Amsterdam iGEM team joined forces to come up with a way to reduce methane emissions. Methane emissions have a huge impact on climate change. iGEM team UNL and iGEM team Amsterdam explored the possibilities of feeding fumarate to cattle, in order to reduce methane emissions. We can conclude that fumarate seems a promising molecule for this application. However, since the literature about the possible effect of fumarate is not consistent, the physiology of cattle opposes some challenges and the maximum fumarate yields in certain organisms under our specific conditions are not yet defined.  Actual empirical research must show if this promising route can lead to lower methane emissions and a more sustainable world!

Reducing methane emissions using thin air
iGEM UNL x iGEM Amsterdam
Introduction
In this collaboration, we combine the knowledge on genetic engineering to produce fumarate (team iGEM Amsterdam) and the knowledge on the possible impact of fumarate on cattle physiology (team iGEM UNL). Together, we explore the possibilities of using microorganisms to produce fumarate in cattle intestine, to reduce methane emissions by cattle. We explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies"

Activity 2: Periodic Table of Synthetic Biology
People: Although our textbook was designed for individuals with a technical background who were interested in furthering their knowledge, our team also understood that many individuals who are interested in synthetic biology are hindered by fear of the vast amounts of information. Rather than immersing themselves in the depths of technical information, they were looking for an easier way of approaching that information.
Design and Dialogue: After talking to several students at our school’s synthetic biology club, our team came up with the idea for a handout that succinctly summarized relevant ideas in synthetic biology. Our initial idea was a synthetic biology dictionary that could define relevant terms. However, our internal team discussion left us feeling that it would be important to define the relationship between the term and associate it with a core principle of synthetic biology. To correctly convey this information, it would take more than just one or two lines of material. Instead, we decided to pivot to an illustrated encyclopedia that would cover relevant topics in about a page or so. This would spark interest and encourage individuals to dive deeper.
After talking to one of our sponsors, SGI-DNA, they expressed interest in helping us disseminate the information. However, they felt that an illustrated encyclopedia may not be the best option for all the people we were trying to reach; instead, they encouraged us to focus on a way to condense the information that would make it easier to retain. We incorporated this feedback by designing a mini-periodic table that focused on four “blocks”: relevant concepts in synthetic biology and circuits, famous scientists, relevant techniques, and important diseases that synthetic biology may be able to address.
Talking to students during the first week of school helped us realize that a very effective way to disseminate the information was also needed. We decided that supplementing our encyclopedia and condensed periodic table handout with an app may result in greater interest.
Reflection : This was a very interesting idea, and as a team, we were not completely sure about how individuals would react. Part of the challenge was determining the key principles of synthetic biology, and it goes without saying that our work does not encompass all the amazing aspects of synthetic biology. One of the particular areas of interest was our target demographic: although we had originally designed it for high school students and undergraduates, talking to SGI-DNA make us realize that it"

Prof. Huang Wei (HongKong University)
I have played a little with your web tool a little. It is pretty smooth. I guess that you don’t want to show all your findings in this website, such as predicted better terminators, and their hierarchy etc. It would be nice if you could link it to your wiki (or something) to explain your model, and the meaning of the results for three algorithms.
Please feel free to ask if you have more to discuss. I will try to find if any student is around to test your website.
Dr.Ying-Ja Chen (  Synthetic Biology Center, MIT   )
It is exciting to see your webtool online. Good job! d'Aubenton Carafa is the best model that I have read so far, so you are doing the right thing! I have tested the webtool briefly.
I have tried a few terminators using the TTEC run and it works!
There seems to be some problem with the web interface. It often gives this error:
Bad Request (Invalid Hostname)
And the address bar shows this:  http://50.115.135.169/
However, I haven't figured out how to upload SBOL sequences. Maybe you can clarify on that.
2012 iGEM team: Shenzhen
Hi, I am K2, the instructor of Team Shenzhen. As I am a researcher in C.Dog project, I have tested some well measured terminators in C.Dog, via TTEC. As the algorithm of TTEC is being advanced, the simulation results seem to be much more reliable now.   Furthermore, as part of our iGEM project YAO#1.0, younsters in our team have annoted several terminators in yeast mitochondiral genome. Then we caculate the termination efficency and 2nd structure via TTEC, and we wish the data can be vertified by our on-going experiments"

Two teams from southeast, one from northeast and our from north (Amazon). We all had a perception we couldn’t miss the opportunity here! People from Brazil-SP team repeated this year what was a pilot last year, the ""Jamboré"", a ""brazificated"" Jamboree. We got together and we were in iGEM’s Jamboree mood hight there in São Paulo. For us was more than 2 thousand miles to go there, but we did it and enjoyed it!
The whole buzz took place in August 1st 2014, Brazilian teams participating in IGEM competition decided to hold a meeting to introduce their projects, discuss new ideas and strategies, assist in the development of projects and clarify general doubts regarding competition.
The meeting was so constructive! All projects were very interesting, it was very nice to see that all teams have the same day-by-day difficulties in lab, and in other to overcome these barriers, we exchanged tips and protocols. Another really cool part was hearing from different teams brilliant opinions on each project and see that each team had a little to add on other projects, making the small failures easier to be resolved. Anyway the meeting was super relaxing and constructive just like IGEM way of being! And to finish with a flourish, we played many games, accompanied by beer and fries. :)
There are some records from this great meeting! Check it here

CPU_CHINA,2017,Team:CPU CHINA#gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," patients fail to receive a proper treatment in RA’s preliminary stage which not only afflicts the patients, but also brings a heavy financial burden to their families.
In China, the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is 0.2% -0.4%, so with a population of 1.3 billion, China's rheumatoid arthritis patients are expected to be around 5 million. If they cannot be given effective treatment, their mobility will be limited due to joint pain, and will eventually lead to disability. Statistically, disability rate in patients with two years of rheumatoid arthritis is up to 50% while those with three years can be 70%.
Field Studies
To further understand a patient's conditions and the clinical status of treatment, we decided to go to Nanjing Gulou Hospital and Nanjing First Hospital to perform a questionnaire survey in the department of rheumatology immunology after beforehand investigation and contact. First is our preparation:
Respondents: patients with rheumatoid arthritis at inpatient and outpatient in rheumatology department
Sample Size: 80 people
Procedure:
1. The production of questionnaire (Avoid sensitive issues and patients’ personal information, and respect patients for their personal privacy).
2. Assign teammates with different tasks.
3. Determine the procedure and the time.
With our planned scheduled, we went to the hospital for a two-day survey (Figure 1). We ensured the authenticity of the answers to our questionnaires. For patients with reduced mobility, our members completed the questionnaire according to their oral narration (Figure 2). We tried to gain more insights in the treatment they expected to receive, as well as the treatment they received in real life, which enabled us to feel more about the pain and suffering this disease could bring.
Figure 1. Conducting a questionnaire in the Nanjing First Hospital
Figure 2. Our teamer was talking with the patient carefully
Questionnaire analysis
The following conclusions can be drawn by analyzing the data collected from the questionnaire statistically (Figure 3-5 are part of the questionnaire data) together with some supporting materials:
Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease most commonly seen in women aged 40-60 years old, so it is a typical middle-aged and old-aged disease, which seriously affects patients' life quality. Most patients choose drug treatments to alleviate the pain, but in actual clinical practice all currently available drugs fail to show any very significant therapeutic effect, which is why patients crave for new treatment methods. They also hope that the new method can have less side effects and lower recurrence rate, thereby reducing their pain. In addition"

Furthermore induction of these heterologous genes leads to growth inhibition and plasmid instability. Supplementation with tRNAhAaGA,AGGby cotransfection with the dnaY gene, which supplies this minor tRNA, resulted in high-level production with greatly improved cell viability and plasmid stability."" - High-level expression of recombinant genes in Eschericlriu coli is dependent on the availability of the dnaY gene product
Johan: Interesting way of increasing expression by adding a gene for a rare tRNA
""Within Escherichia coil and other species, a clear codon bias exists among the 61 amino acid codons found within the population of mRNA molecules, and the level of cognate tRNA appears directly proportional to the frequency of codon usage. Given this situation, one would predict translational problems with an abundant mRNA species containing an excess of rare low tRNA codons. Such a situation might arise after the initiation of transcription of a cloned heterologous gene in the E. coli host. Recent studies suggest clusters of AGG/AGA, CUA, AUA, CGA or CCC codons can reduce both the quantity and quality of the synthesized protein. In addition, it is likely that an excess of any of these codons, even without clusters, could create translational problems."" - Effects of rare codon clusters on high-level expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli
Johan: Example of article about codon bias, although if e.g. we’re gonna do DNA synthesis at GENEART (50% off) it is done automatically (what about their “The minimum charge for each DNA synthesis projects is $159” ???)

Child's public class:
We held a child's public welfare class for children from primary schools. Brother Monkey introduced biology and knowledge of plants, animals, microorganisms, viruses and so on to the children via pictures and videos.
We introduced the structure and principle of DNA, and we worked together to make an model of it. We watched onion slices demonstration video.
We replaced of iodine with red ink. First we dropped a few drops of water on the slides, and taught the children to remove small pieces of onion from the inside of the onion skin. Some of them torn off the epidermises, and some got the curl of the epidermis so that they can not be flattened on the slide. However, they never discouraged and always started again if they failed and finally succeeded. After that, we dropped a piece of red ink at one end of the slide, tilted the slide, and used the paper to absorb water at the other end to ink the onion epidermis completely. After many attempts, the children all succeeded in making an onion-slicing specimen.
Teach-in:
1 IN ANHUI UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY
In view of the lack of knowledge of synthetic biology among many students, we held an intramural teach-in at the University Student Activity Center on September 18th.
 
Before the teach-in, we put up posters on campus. It attracted many students to come to inquire. We introduced iGEM to the students and it aroused the strong interest of them and the venue was packed that day.
The content is divided into three parts. First of all, we introduced the iGEM competition to the students who attended the lecture. And then we introduced the competition history of team AHUT_China and the teacher team. Finally, we focused on introducing our team and the project this year, including team work, cooperation, project background, project introduction and experimental process. We used a lot of experimental pictures to let the students have a more intuitive understanding of our experimental process, and to add a little bit of fun to the relatively boring principle. After the lecture, the team members answered questions for the students. They replied to the question of how to participate in our competition and what knowledge and skills they need to master.

Type III secretion system (T3SS) - exports proteins, translocates polypeptides through both the inner and outer membranes.
Samonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SP-1) - tool for export proteins of interest, can be applied to the recombinant production of spider silk proteins, which form fibrils if allowed to accumulate inside of confined volume of the cell.
They've used the whole gene DNA synthesis to construct DNA sequences that matches exactly the wild type amino acid sequence for the known fragments of silk monomers.
The synthetic genes were designed for 3 silk genes, from the spider named Araneus diadenatas.
ADF-1: expressed in the minor ampullate gland, using during construction. High tensile strength, but inelastic.
ADF-2: expressed in the cylindrical gland, used for egg sacks, sequence similar to human elastins.
ADF-3: expressed in the major ampullate gland, forms extremely tough and elastic draglines which anchors the web.
Each of the genes is expressed and exported using the Salmonella SP-1 T3SS.

Harvard_BioDesign,2015,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"ours in patients would be analysed once the microbial anti-cancer agent has had sufficient opportunity to act. Such timelines are critical for recruiting test subjects since individuals would understandably be unwilling to wait for an effect from an experimental therapy and might prefer to seek immediate surgical treatment instead. Through these conversations, we realized that we must begin planning assays well in advance of human trials if we are to ensure such a product is ever to come to market.
Special scrutiny of a microbial cancer therapeutic
To determine the unique scrutiny which our microbial cancer therapeutic might be subjected to and address specific concerns with synthetic biology, we spoke to Dr. Stephen Sonis,  a member of the Scientific Advisory Board at ActoGenix. This company is developing genetically engineered bacteria to treat diseases in the gastrointestinal tract and thus Dr. Sonis is particularly knowledgeable on this topic. We mentioned that Dr. Kronish from the Office of Human Research Services suggested that our microbial therapeutic could be difficult to get through regulatory processes because of inherent differences in its design compared to small molecule therapies. Dr. Sonis reported three major safety concerns that ActoGenix faced with development of their own microbial therapies that we have begun using to inform our design.
Firstly, ActoGenix considers public health implications of release of replicating microbial therapeutics into the broader environment. One could envision uncontrolled replication of such an organism causing release of drugs or other cytotoxic agents into waterways. Hence, he suggested that we should devise some method of controlling our bacteria such that it remains viable only in therapeutic environments. Together, we pondered methods for organism containment including active kill switches and engineered auxotrophy. We recognize that such a containment mechanism will be necessary in order to deploy this project as a cancer therapy and must be integrated once we combine BactoGrip adhesive components with cancer-fighting components.
Secondly, Dr. Sonis urged us to consider how whether a microbial therapeutic could have deleterious effects on cancer patients. Before our system could be approved for clinical trials, we would necessarily have to show that our system doesn’t make cancer patients sicker. There are complications which could arise given how a microbial therapeutics might disrupt the balance of the normal human microbiota through competition for resources in the gut. These concerns tie into what we learned about the drug development process from Dr. Kronish and Dr. Ritz. However, studying the balance various species in the overall gut microbiome could necessitate asking different research questions about microflora not typically tested in the development of traditional small molecule cancer therapeutics. Thus, we must devise tests and assays which are relevant to the specific therapeutic mechanism of B"

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," in its circular path of motion, the syringe pump will move different amounts with the same change in theta of the servo arm. This problem was overcome by developing an algorithm to ensure a constant flow rate is always achieved with Neptune given the specific values of the active servo and syringe, involving two lookup tables and linear extrapolation.
Modular Baseboard Implementation | Zach Lasiuk
The challenge of Neptune’s baseboard is to utilize a desktop CNC mill to achieve the functionality of a full machine shop. More specifically, Neptune’s baseboard must retain system expandability to arbitrary dimensions and maintain ease of use by providing places to auto-align components. This is done using an emerging standard in microfluidic hardware, the MEC board, developed by the GroverLab at University of California, Riverside. By creating these modular MEC squares that can be milled out one at a time and connected together. Neptune’s board can use a multitude of materials and even a combination of materials, currently tested with HDPE plastic, ABS plastic, and wood.
Created Parametric 3D Parts | Zach Lasiuk & Priya Kapadia
To ensure Neptune meets the requirements of any microfluidic experiment with different requirements for flow-rate and max volume to be dispensed, Neptune has completely parametric 3D parts. These parts hold and align the servo and syringe combination and enable the fluid motion of both. From 100mL to 10uL, Neptune’s 3D printed hardware will adjust in shape to accommodate different size syringes and servos to meet synthetic biologist’s experimental needs. While Neptune has tested servos and syringes on file to choose from by default, should a biologist need more volume to dispense or more precision in flow-rates they can input their own servo or syringe to obtain the exact response they desire. The final result is completely parametric 3D parts that adapt to a specific servo or syringe’s dimensions, enabling a massive amount of freedom for synthetic biologists in using Neptune.
Developed System Firmware | Zach Lasiuk
Reliability and repeatability of experiments are essential for Neptune to deliver results. The firmware developed for the Arduino Mega ensures these standards are met and maintained. Currently implemented, this firmware has the capability to work with both digital and analog servos, up to 13 servo shields stacked on top of the Arduino Mega (enabling the control of over 200 servos at once), control valves with instant motion, and control dispensers with variable flow-rates. In addition to working seamlessly with Neptune’s control page, there is another option to use"

Since we did not work with plasmids or golden gate assembly it was not possible for us to assemble this plasmids in such a short amount of time without the help of our collaboration partners. This plasmids proved to work pretty well with our mutations, thus contributing essentially to our whole project. Therefore, we thank our fellow iGEM partners!
The plate contains several yeast colonies. A colony was randomly picked and analyzed through a microscope. No visible contamination was observable.
The ladder can be on column #1. The 2 PCR products (found in columns 2, 3) show a strong band situated at around 2000 bp. Using the software Geneious®, we digitally constructed the dPEX7 knock out cassette, determining that its length should be around 2100 bp.
Once we finished this collaboration, our team realized its importance and the positive effect it had on our partner iGEM team's project. Keeping in contact with our friends in Cologne/Düsseldorf,      we learned that the knockout we accomplished was a key transformation in their project. Getting rid of PEX5 and PEX7 genes would get rid of the own cellular protein import system of the peroxisomes.      This important step would then allow our partners to integrate their own protein translocation system and therefore control the synthetic pathway that happens in the intercellular compartments.      Through our experience and knowledge, we helped them overcome this obstacle which, as they explained, wouldn't have been possible by themselves.

The conference took place in the university’s very own palace, which is now a conference centre in Düsseldorf’s city centre. Lucky for us, Düsseldorf is just about 1.5 hours by train, so we did not have to get up too early in the morning.
After a short breakfast Professor Matias Zurbriggen gave all the attending guests a short introduction to synthetic biology and how it mimics some of the same principles as an engineering design process, while still having some differences.
Dr. Marc-Denis Weitze talked about the challenges of communicating between the science community and the general population. He explained how their academy investigates the public’s perception of an upcoming controversial topic like artificial photosynthesis and tries to initiate a dialogue between scientists and the public.
Professor Röbbe Wünschiers held a guest lecture about his field of work and the future of biotechnology which in his opinion lies in in silico simulations.

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," information on the prevalence of the disease, the number of patients who seek treatment and factors that are thought to be involved in the spread of the disease.
Above: Hospital in Choluteca region.
The local doctor was very aware of the disease and provided us with information with regard to ways in which the disease could be prevented. He also highlighted issues such as the lack of education as a factor which has led to the spread of the disease in previous years. Another issue which was emphasised and which we have seen previously through interaction with Dr Alvaro Acosta and Dr Cristian Valladeres was that there is poor patient compliance with the current treatment. This series of twenty painful intramuscular injections deters patients from seeking treatment and the parasite is then allowed to spread.
Above: Yensi speaks to the Ernesto Caceres (Fyffes Medical doctor) about the prevalence of the disease.
Having informed the doctor of our aim to produce a vaccine against leishmaniasis, he was quite interested. He emphasized that the vaccine would need to be cost-effective, we therefore decided to concentrate on developing a vaccine that could be orally administered. Our strain as previously mentioned has the hylA gene integrated in it, the LLO protein is highly immunogenic and has been previously described as being capable of being an adjuvant (Sun R et Liu Y. 2013). This therefore improves the ability of our vaccine to elicit an immune-response and avoid the issue of tolerance which has been associated with some oral vaccines.
An oral vaccine is desirable from a clinical point of view as it does not require a skilled professional to administer the vaccine. This will reduce the economic cost of employing the vaccine on a large scale. The doctor also emphasised that distribution of the vaccine would be an important consideration, he spoke about the instability of certain medical products in the Honduran summer when temperatures can reach as high as forty degrees celsius. Following this recommendation, we investigated the possibility of freeze-drying our vaccine. Once freeze-dried, the requirement for a cold chain is mitigated and the stability at these higher temperatures is increased. Dr Alvaro Acosta also emphasised the need for the vaccine to be stable at high temperatures and the desirability for low cost distribution.
The doctor also highlighted that current therapies are inadequate due to poor patient compliance. Many patients were reported to stop visiting the hospital for the pentavalent antimony IM injections in the middle of the treatment because of the pain associated with the injection. One way in which they are trying to tackle this problem is through patient education, however this has only shown limited efficacy"

July
Week 1
Learning to code with cobrapy and understanding what flux balance analysis (FBA) exactly is. Found out how to modify the exchange reactions of the entire medium.
Week 2
Working on improving our understanding of FBA and cobrapy. Also going through the literature to see what Escherichia coli might do in the sugar water. Gitlab was set up.
Week 3
Continuing to improve our understanding of FBA and cobrapy. Realization that the objective function can be changed to something else. The main question to answer is:“Will the chassis survive in the sugar water?”.
Week 4
Thinking on the effect of sugar water on the bacteria. The model says the E. coli can survive on sucrose as a carbon source just fine.

In the genetic circuit of Dual-feedback oscillator, the three promoters are the same hybrid promoter composed of an activation site and a repression site. They can be activated by the araC protein in the presence of arabinose and repressed by the LacI protein in the absence of IPTG. The mechanism of dual-feedback makes oscillatory behaviour stable and adjustable.
There are four states of promoter: original promoter without inducer, bound with araC dimers (
), bound with lacI tetramers (
), bound with araC and lacI tetramers together.

We assume that araC dimers and lacI tetramers combine with promoter separately without interference. So it means that

Microbeads in cosmetics seem to be a great application for our product due to the need for a biodegradable alternative to traditional plastic microbeads. The biodegradability of PHA microbeads would mean that microbeads do not damage aquatic ecosystems. Our conversations with experts in the field of bioplastics have alerted us to the fact that many nations have banned all plastic microbeads regardless of their biodegradability; the policies enacted by these nations as they relate to PHA microbeads are an important future area of study.
Week 5: May 29 - June 2
CRISPR and dCas9 protocols were obtained from the Childs Lab at the University of Calgary. These were then sent to the UBC iGEM team as per their request. The remaining Canadian iGEM teams were contacted to follow up on possible collaborations and the newsletter. All the Canadian teams got back to us and expressed their interest in establishing the newsletter.
On May 30th, our team began researching the different applications for our project, as the wastewater treatment plant field trip made us rethink the direction of our project. The applications we chose to look further into were:
Wastewater treatment
Small-scale wastewater treatment in developing countries
Landfill leachate treatment
Outer space missions
A few team members were chosen to look into specific aspects of each application so as to gain a holistic understanding of the feasibility of each application and thus choose the application which was the best fit for our project. The aspects of each application which our team researched are listed as questions below:
Is there a significant demand for a solution to this problem?
What are the costs associated with implementing our process to solve this problem?
Do we have any resources or industry contacts in this field? Whom should we contact for an expert opinion if we choose this issue?
What is the environmental/social/political/economic impact of our engineered bacteria as a solution to this problem?
Is synthetic biology the best solution to solving this problem?
We made a table comparing the above aspects of the different applications. This table is shown below:

Orthopaedic Surgeon at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim
Conclusion for Integrated HP
A new area of application is related to diabetic foot ulcers. Biofilm is assumed to be responsible for chronic wound infections and open wounds that won't heal sufficiently on its own.
See more in Conclusion of Marthe Lund Kroknes
Key insight
Chronic infections require a surgery redo as there is no safe and effective method to remove biofilm. Repeating the surgery increases the risk of more infections, and can in the worst case scenario lead to amputations.
Besides foreign implants, there is also a need for an effective biofilm treatment for diabetic foot ulcers.
In modeling we should only include parameters that can be measured, like pH, O2-levels, concentration of inducer.
Cystic Fibrosis is the first known biofilm-associated medical condition.
Finding a method for prevention of biofilm is an urgent and important issue. There is a lot of research on different materials that limit biofilm growth, especially since bacteria in biofilm quickly develops resistance against antibiotics.
A treatment should be compatible to pseudomonas and not be to invasive in terms of changing the microflora composition.
Summary of interview
We met with Eivind Witsø, an orthopaedic surgeon at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim for information about biofilm-related problems in orthopaedic procedures. Eivind has extensive experience with biofilm in his career and provided us with a lot of interesting and useful information.
In his experience, many infections arise during implantation of foreign parts into the body, such as hip surgery. These chronic infections require a surgery redo as there isn’t an effective and safe way of removing biofilm. A secondary surgery involves an even greater risk of infection, and patients often find themselves having to go through multiple surgeries, or in worst case live without hip joints or undergo amputation. Antibiotic treatments are ineffective and there is a great need for an alternative bio"

BostonU_HW,2017,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,", this poll validated our choice of nine synthetic biology protocols to move onto microfluidic devices housed in the MARS archive.
Phenomyx
During the course of the Fall semester the team also had to opportunity to tour Phenomyx, a microfluidics startup located at LabCentral in Boston. The tour was led by Salil Desai, their founder and Chief Technology Officer, who took us through their fabrication and testing space. During the course of the tour we were able to learn from his industry experience in microfluidic devices.
While discussing our fluid functionality checklist we were able to discuss our quantitative and qualitative metrics in some detail. A key point of the discussion was the importance of utilizing general metrics, instead of protocol or design specific metrics, when grading a chip. This way we can ensure that our system can be applied to chips at large without being specific to individual designs. This advice has been integral as we ensured that our finalized protocol used metric we were able to apply to any device design. The possibility of integrating our checklist into a software system was also pitched as a possible progression of MARS. Although we were unable to meet this goal for 2017, it provides an exciting direction for future iGEM teams to build on our project.
Black Hole Lab
Over the summer we were in contact with Black Hole Lab who manufacture plug and play microfluidics for researchers. As we were in the beginning stages of fabrication, we had many questions for them regarding manufacturing processes and what standards they recommended in order to ensure quality control. Although they were unable to provide us with “industry standards” to utilize, Black Hole Lab advised us to build our checklist around our fabrication method. Many of the suggestions they made such as:
Checking the milled dimensions of primitives and channels
Testing the maximum pressure chips can withstand
Checking if the chip leaks or the seal breaks
were integrated into our preliminary checklists. In fact, testing for a channel’s maximum pressure and checking for seal leaks became two of the key quantitative and qualitative pillars in our final Fluid Functionality Checklist. To see how these were integrated into our Fluid Functionality Checklist, please click here:

Cleaning Up the Virtual Lab
Most of the work done in the virtual lab today was tidying up some scripts and making minor adjustments and improvements. I was able to complete the third construction zone and now I have returned to my DNA replication animation and I am now working on:
Determining the positions the separate places the pieces have to be situated as well as making sure each piece knows where the others are even if the location of the pieces, especially the DNA strands are moved to a different area.
Setting the positions of gyrase, helicase and primase to their respective places. Presently, the primase can detect a piece of the DNA strand and set its position to it and then rezzes an RNA primer and then obtains its next position.
I took some snapshots around the lab today for the presentation on Friday and I made a rough outline for the PowerPoint slides I will be working on tonight and sometime tomorrow for the presentation. I have decided to make some short video clips as well in order to better demonstrate what can be done in the lab as it is explained on Friday.
The incubator has been added to the movement of the insert tube during restriction digest and the phosphatase treatment station no longer moves on its own. It acts like restriction digest so avatars must chose what the tube needs to be sent to within the lab. I also changed sequencing script and made a list of the note cards that still need to be added to the station’s inventory in order for all items that can be dropped into the sequencing station have a product that may be given in return.

He corroborated what Dr Lousie Bezuidenhout had told us about the importance of data management. We discussed the different ideas around regulation, such as the GMO vs ‘fast-evolution?’ debate. We also talked about our cell free report, for which Piers gave us his expert opinion on the current direction that regulation may be moving in; for example product based regulation over process based evolution. The cell free report can be viewed below:
From the meeting with Dr. Millett, we came away thinking about some of the key questions that we would have to ask ourselves about our project. Could we ever say that our device is ‘safe’? Or is it just safe enough, considering our current knowledge?. This impacted our final design by making us conscious of the potential barriers we could face in this new area of synthetic biology. For example, our device is within a contained cassette based on advice that a closed system would make it safer to use and easier to dispose. Piers also introduced us to the concept of platform technologies and how this could be applied to our project. Having a platform provided a good way of fast tracking future developments because the platform will already have met regulatory approval, therefore allowing the device to be more rapidly adapted for other diseases.

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#wetlab#chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," can function as the terminal reductases for a number of different metal substrates [1,4].
CymA
CymA, a c-type tetraheme cytochrome protein located in the CM, belongs to the NapC/NrfH family of quinol dehydrogenases principal in bacterial anaerobic respiration [4]. CymA is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by a single transmembrane domain with the rest of the protein extending into the periplasmic space; four heme groups are covalently bound to the periplasmic portion of the CymA protein. CymA has been shown to be essential to the reduction of Fe(III), DMSO, fumarate, nitrate, manganese and nitrite in Shewanella species through its shuttling of electrons from the cytoplasm to a number of different PECs [4,5]. Whereas NrfH proteins form strong bonds with their redox partners, CymA appears to bond only transiently to its partners in the periplasm. This is consistent with its ability to interact with many different PECs, offering   Shewanella sp. respiration flexibility and versatility [4].
MtrA
Reverse electron flow experiments have shown that direct electron transfer occurs between CymA and MtrA, a periplasmic decaheme c-type cytochrome, during in vitro Fe(III) oxide reduction [4]. Recently, the structure of MtrA has been elucidated through the use of small angle x-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation; due to its elongated and 104 Å rod-like shape, MtrA has been postulated to function as an electron shuttle between CymA and OMCs MtrC or OmcA [2,3]. Cross-linking by formaldehyde treatment has shown that MtrA is physically associated with MtrB [7].
MtrB
While the structure of MtrB has not been determined, based on sequence analysis, MtrB has been posited to be an OM b-barrel, porin-like protein consisting of 28 transmembrane b-strands [1,4,7]. Experiments done with mtrB deletion mutants have shown that MtrB is required for MtrA localization to the outer membrane. Additionally, in a mtrA deletion strain, mtrB expression is detected in cell lysates but MtrB is not, indicating the necessity of MtrA in assembly of OM MtrB complexes [7"

Official Team Profile
Choosing apt and reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem that productive wet labs routinely face. Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories, including the amount of time spent on each step, the use of specific brands of reagent, or conditions under which an experiment was performed. As such, current online protocols are often vague and inefficient, and diminish the reproducibility of experiments.
Learn more about the issues with current protocols
To improve protocol efficiency and reproducibility, we developed a free online catalog of laboratory protocols: Protocat. With a built-in rating, favoriting, and commenting system, Protocat condenses the vast array of laboratory protocols into one easy-to-browse location, increasing protocol reproducibility for labs across the globe.

Purifying CBD-tagged proteins on cellulose
Material
Microcrystalline Cellulose (eg Avicell)
Wash buffer: Amonium Sulfate 1 M
Expression culture of the protein
Lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris, pH = 8 + 300 mM NaCl + 10% glycerol
Method
Wash the Cellulose five time in water. The equilibrate it in wash buffer.
Pellet the culture and resuspend it in 1 mL of lysis buffer. Then sonicate it, on ice, five times at moderate power. Centrifugate the lysate at 14.000 g for 10 min.
Pack the cellulose (10x10 mm) in small chromatography columns (we used syringes barrels).
Gently pour the lysate supernatant on the column. Once the liquid starts to flow out regularly measure the OD280 of the different fractions.
Continue by pouring wash buffer until the OD280 stabilizes around zero.
Change washing buffer to water. After a short moment the OD280 should rise, collect the hight OD 280 fractions. They should contain the protein.
If the previous step was not efficient, continue elution with 6M Urea.
Analyse collected fractions on an SDS PAGE.
Optionally proteins may be concentrated using ultrafiltration.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," and part 3 (P3). This was achieved using primers IG0030 and IG0023 . The sequence should be around 1800 bp, which is in line with the picture.
Figure 3: PCR amplification of the whole plasmid (7.7 kb). Primers IG0055 and IG0056 were used. The Gibson assembly mix was used in different dilutions and in duplo. The dilutions 1:10 have bands of the right size.
Figure 4: Colony PCR of colony 1.Primers IG0007 and IG0004 (1.5 kb) were used. Colony 1 seemed to contain plasmids with an insert of the right size.
Figure 5: The alignment of the sequencing results.This image shows the alignment of the sequencing results of plasmids from colony 1 with the original insert design in SnapGene. The blue rectangles indicate deletion sites.
The construct was successfully assembled, however two deletions were present. These deletions that are present in the coding sequence of the Cas13a gene caused a frameshift, resulting in a corrupted transcription of the gene. For further experiments, the Cas13a was purified from a plasmid received from the authors of Gootenberg et al. 2017 . This protein is structurally similar to our envisioned BioBrick, except that our BioBrick is codon optimized for bacterial expression instead of mammalian expression and that the CRISPR array lays downstream the Cas13a coding sequence. Please see the details of our construct on the Cas13a design page .
The CRISPR array with the interchangeable spacer was made a composite and basic part ( BBa_K2306013 and BBa_K2306015 ). This array can serve as the template for future Cas13a BioBricks. Thanks to the two BsaI restriction sites at each end of the spacer, any guide can be easily be made by restriction ligation of a new spacer. See Figure 6 for a schematic overview of BBa_K2306013 .

Applications
Plastic waste is one of the most significant causes of environmental pollution. Traditional petroleum-based plastics can take up to 1,000 years to degrade, whereas alternative bioplastics take much less and have a set of eco-friendly advantadges. The aim of our project is to produce Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA), a biodegradable polymer that mimics the physical properties of traditional plastic, by engineering Pseudomonas putida.
PLA bioproduction presents several benefits compared to chemical synthesis, as it uses simple carbon sources and is quite inexpensive. Besides, Pseudomonas putida is a safe organism reported to be efficient for polymerization steps. Thus, in the context of PLA Bioproduction, it is more suited than other possible chassis. By edition of its metabolic pathways, we aimed to improve PLA biosynthesis yields in a sustainable manner and determine, via in silico analyses, further methods to optimize and scale up the system.
During our project, we contributed to the iGEM community by describing the genes we used for PLA production (Pct: BBa_K2042000 ; PhaC: BBa_K2042001 , BBa_K2042002 ; LDH: BBa_K2042008 , others described in Parts ), by improving some already reported parts (iGEM Yale 2013: BBa_K1211001 , BBa_K1211002 ), and by reporting the usability of new Pseudomonas putida vector promoters ( BBa_K2042004 , BBa_K2042006 ).
