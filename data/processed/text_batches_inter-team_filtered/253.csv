If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure"

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile#Results#Gibson_-_-_TEXT.html," our rate of true positives.
To test this hypothesis, we designed a Gibson Assembly which involved a small part of mRFP1 and a large backbone. Our design included a strategy to quickly identify those colonies which where true positives from false positives (i.e. RFP expression).
We used pSB4K5-J04450 and selected a fragment of mRFP1 which would measure 100bp plus the 40bp overhangs. Because this fragment is in the middle of the mRFP1, successful assembly would regenerate a complete mRFP1 gene making the colony visibly red.
We positioned the small mRFP1 fragment in such a way that if by any chance there was recircularization of the backbone, the resulting sequence would provide a helpful in-frame TAA stop codon to finish translation and evidence a false positive (i.e. no RFP expression).
The experiment was done for 6 different concentrations of T5 exonuclease, in squareroot of 10 magnitude changes of the original T5 concentration. The concentrations were: 0X, 1/10X, 1/sqrt(10)X, 1X, sqrt(10)X and 10X T5 exonuclease.
Methods for the preparation of the experiment can be found in the protocols section.
Total count of colonies
We obtained different numbers of positive colonies with the different concentrations of T5 exonuclease in the Master Mix. As shown in the graph above, there is a clear maximum at 1x concentration of T5 exonuclease in the Master Mix.
Efficiency of reaction
When calculating the efficiency of the reaction (in terms of true positive rate) we also see an increase of true positive rate towards the reaction with 1X concentration of T5 exonuclease in the Master Mix.
Conclusion
According to the results we obtained in this experiment we conclude that according to our DNA concentration conditions (0.00125 pmoles/uL) and ratio of insert to backbone (5:1), the Gibson Assembly reaction is already optimized for small parts of 140bp. Therefore, for assembling small parts we recommend to use 5:1 ratio of insert to backbone and Gibson Assembly reaction conditions as described in the Methods section. In addition, we think the methodology used in these experiments could help test additional conditions to standardize Gibson Assembly protocols in a time-efficient manner.

Harvard,2009,Team:Harvard#Daily_-_-_TEXT.html," GFP fluorphore is irreversible. The GFP system is also disfavorable because GFP requires a high amount of excitation energy, and has high background, thus obscuring the signal (Cissell et al, 2009).  Luciferase species choice.  There are several options for which luciferase we can use, including firefly luciferase, Renilla luciferase, and Gaussia luciferase.  Firefly luciferase is from the firefly (beetle), Photinus pyralis, and is 61 kD. It uses luciferin in the presence of oxygen, ATP, and Mg2+ to produce bioluminescence in the range of 550-570 nm (greenish yellow) (http://www.promega.com/paguide/chap8.htm#title2).  When Luker et al examined the kinetics of cell lysates they found an increase in fluorescence with a t1/2 of less than one minute. They found it necessary to use cell lysates to examine kinetics of the interaction of the two halves because the presence of the cell membrane was preventing the rapamycin (the chemical they were using to induce association of the fused proteins) (Luker et al, 2004). Thus I assume that given that light will instantly permeate the cells, that we will see kinetics similar to those in the lysates. This paper does not mention dissociation kinetics.  Renilla luciferase is a 36 kD protein from the sea pansy (Renilla reniformis), which uses coelenterazine and oxygen to produce blue light, 480 nm (Promega).  The issue with use of Renilla luciferase in animals is that the blue light does not penetrate tissues well, and that the coelenterazine is transported by the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, which according to Luker et al, as well as others, can cause problems with delivery (Luker et el, 2004).  Gaussia luciferase is derived from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps. This 19.9 kDa protein catalyzes a reaction involving oxygen and coelenterazine to produce bioluminescence at a peak of 470 nm. At 185 amino acds this is the smallest of the luciferases (Verhegen et al, 2002).     Luciferase fragment choice. Firefly luciferase.

Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Parts#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," The literature claims that the DegP promoter is upregulated in the case of protein misfolding, graph shown . Since MalE and MalE31 have been tested using other experiments described in this page, it is reasonable to conclude that K230009 is not very responsive to protein folding stress, that is , the DNA might not be consistent.
Experiment 5: Characterization of the ibpAB-fsxA fusion promoter's response to properly folding and misfolding proteins
Purpose/ Protocol
The purpose of this assay is to characterize the ibpAB fusion promoter (ibpAB-FxSA) with a protein that is known to fold correctly (MalEΔSS) and with a protein that are known to misfold (MalE31ΔSS) while remaining in the cytoplasm.  The promoter was coupled with green fluorescent protein so when activated, the reporter would be produced. A construct received from Jean-Michel Betton's lab containing MalEΔSS and MalE31ΔSS downstream from a maltose-induced promoter were transformed into Top10 competent cells containing the plasmid with the ibpAB-fsxA GFP reporter plasmid (ibpAB-I13504). Overnight cultures were made from these transformations in 5 mL of LB Lennox Broth and left to grow for sixteen hours. Induction was done with multiple concentrations of maltose to produce different quantities of protein and the cells were shaken at 30°C. Four hours after induction, GFP fluorescence was measured and can be seen below.
Results
Figure 4: This graph shows the GFP fluorescence produced when MalEΔSS and MalE31ΔSS downstream of maltose-inducible promoters were transformed into Top10 competent cells containing the ibpAB-fsxA promoter coupled with a GFP reporter.
Discussion and Conclusions
The graph trend lines show a sharp decrease from the opening GFP output before rising again to level off. The induction using varying concentrations of maltose to produce known misfolding protein shows that the properly folding maltose binding protein (MalEΔSS) causes more fluorescence output than the misfolding maltose binding protein (MalE31ΔSS). This is in contradiction with the literature data. However, the last data value at maltose concentration of 0.5% maltose added to the solution is what creates this. In the future, more characterization assays should be run with inductions using more variants of maltose concentrations. These would allow for further verification and confirmation of either literature data or our data. There have been very few studies using this fusion promoter so"

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#test#human practices#emoji report_-_-_TEXT.html,"000,000” highlight this. Overall, this emoji indicates that there is so much debate and discussion regarding the medical benefits and risks of phage therapy in this representative phage video.
👍 Thumbs Up
This emoji is defined as a thumbs-up gesture, which indicates approval.3 In the context of this video, it suggests people approve of phage therapy and they view it as a positive step forward. Comments such as, “this is the nanotech we were looking for” and, “modified phage could fix the genetic errors that have developed over time”. This highlights that many people are open to receiving phage therapy, as they see it as a revolutionary treatment that could solve many of the world’s genetic diseases and help treat millions of people. This emoji is the clearest signal of approval and praise towards phage therapy out of all the emojis that were tagged to the comments.
😳 Flushed Face
This emoji is defined as a flushed face due to blushing or embarrassment.4 However, in the context of phage therapy, it suggests worry. This is evidenced through comments that were tagged with this emoji, such as, “Is there a chance the phage can evolve into an unstoppable super virus” and, “What about the possibility that bacteriophage hides in our nervous system & then evolving itself to attack human cells”. This reflects that there are serious worries and concerns towards phage therapy. This can suggest that the general publics need more information about the safety of phage therapy in relation to how it counteracts with other cells.
☹️ Frowning Face
This emoji is defined as a frowning face with an unhappy mouth.5 In the context of phage therapy, this indicates an emotion of unhappiness towards phage therapy, also linked with feelings of distrust. This is highlighted in comments such as, “I’m a little hesitant about injecting bacteriophages. Viruses are very good at mutating” and, “It’s [phage] always evolving to kill bacteria. Why wouldn’t it evolve to kill our cells”. Similar to the worry emotions in “flushed face”, “frowning face” shares similar characteristics. This reflects that there is still serious caution towards phage therapy by some people, especially when considering the risks of mutation.
👀 Eyes
This emoji is defined as a pair of eyes, indicating curiosity.6 In this context, it suggests suspicion towards phage therapy. This is reflected in comments such as, “What if they evolve and attack our cells” and, “I suspect this is how super-phage take over our body.” This highlights"

     A surface topic can have various root topics that give rise to it, and a root topic could give lead to various surface topics. Or just one topic lead to another.
     On the plus side, it doesn't need math or programming skills to understand; but on the down side, not having mathematical elements to help shape it up, the form might be a little bit crude. And what's more, it's not a software where you enter your question and it gives you the answer, the thinking is still your own work to do, it just provides a direction for friendly reference if you are finding yourself at a loss. We don't believe any tool can substitute thinking originality, but we still want to make this process a little bit easier, so more ethical issues could be accessed by more teams, and our understanding towards synthetic biology will expand more quickly. That's why we have produced this framework; it aims at helping later iGEMers to more easily find an anchor when needing to address ethical concerns of their project, hopefully.
2. Adding the 4th D, The Dimension of Stages, or Time
Inspired by our project design, the rewirable circuits, we thought deeper on the three modules that compose of our information processing system. Actually, we found that it has an underlying philosophy that has much broader applications other than in electrical and biological circuit designs.
     Any ethical concern, in synthetic biology or not, is fundamentally information, because it can be converted to words, which unfortunately lay the ground for human ideology. Facing a synthetic biology project of concern is like being exposed to some input signals. Thinking about its various implications, origins, solutions, is processing this information. When we get our answer, that's the output. It can be the end of the process if that's what we're looking for, or it can continue to act like an input signal for other processes, in cases where our answer becomes someone else's inspiration.
     Similarly, synthetic biology is about creating things. Creating things is a kind of work, and like any kind of work, it is an interaction between the entire working entity (including the one working and the one being worked on) and its environment, corporeal or spiritual. Interaction involves the processing of information, so it can be divided as different stages. And it can also be divided into the three stages, input, processing, and output. Because these stages exclude each other in one round, such division is able to include the whole process from birth to death.

""Our projects concern with the ability for bacterial cells to differentiate out of homogeneous conditions into populations with the division of labor. We aim at devices conferring host cells with the ability to form cooperating groups spontaneously and to take consecutive steps sequentially even when the genetic background and environmental inputs are identical. To break the mirror in such homogeneous condition, we need two devices respectively responsible for temporal and spatial differentiation. The implementation and application of such devices will lead to bioengineering where complex programs consisted of sequential steps (structure oriented programs) and cooperating agencies (forked instances of a single class, object and event oriented) can be embedded in a single genome. Although this ""differentiation"" process resemble the development of multicellular organism, we tend to use a more bioengineering style analogy: assembly line.

""Almost half of the world's population is infected with bacteria Helicobacter pylori, which colonize gastric mucosa, causing gastritis and ulcers and is recognized as a type I carcinogen by WHO. An effective vaccine against H. pylori is not available, although it would be a durable solution, particularly in a formulation affordable to the third world population. H. pylori evades the immune surveillance by modifying several of its components including flagellin to avoid detection by several Toll-like receptors. The goal of our project was to prepare a modular designer vaccine, using the principles of synthetic immunology. An effective vaccine has to trigger activation of adaptive immunity, which is directed against microbial proteins or polysaccharides as well as of innate immunity, which is usually achieved by the addition of adjuvants of whole microbes. We prepared a set of “immunobricks” with defined functions in activation of the immune system and can be combined to achieve a desired response. In the first approach we have modified H. pylori flagellin to be able to activate TLR5, making it »visible« to the immune system. To this chimeric flagellin we attached either complete protein or a designed a multiepitope of several virulence factors of H. pylori.

Human Practices (Gold & Integrated)
Aims and Rationale
Sensynova was a project founded in Human Practices. Each branch of our project is rooted in a barrier to biosensor implementation identified by in-depth conversations with stakeholders. We identified not only technical issues, but also societal issues, as these are equally important in ensuring successful implementation of biosensor projects. The aims of our human practices were to: 1) - Determine how current biosensor developers design, produce and implement biosensor projects 2) - Use these talks to determine the common barriers to biosensor development and implementation 3) - Create novel solutions to identified problems, producing frameworks and guidelines to aid future researchers To achieve these aims, we emailed, skyped and attended conferences to speak to stakeholders in biosensor development, from the early research stage to the end-user.
Introduction
Synthetic Biology biosensors have a number of advantages over traditional methods. They are cost-effective (After the research stages, production of the biosensor relies only on the maintenance of a population of cells expressing an engineered system), can produce a variety of sophisticated behaviours, such as signal amplification and logic gates, and often have no reliance on additional equipment and therefore are ideal for onsite diagnosis. Each year a plethora of useful biosensors are developed, both by iGEM researchers and in the broader synthetic biology community. We now have access to biosensors for applications ranging from water contamination to fruit ripeness. In fact, we had originally decided on the development of a biosensor for herbicides as our iGEM project. However, our research for this"

Knowledge Dissemination
RiboWest Conference
This year our team showcased our project at the 2018 RiboWest Conference held at the University of Lethbridge in June. The conference brought researchers from across Canada and northwestern USA to discuss and disseminate research around the topic of RNA. During the poster sessions, we received initial feedback from members of the science community outside of iGEM including professors, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students. We were given suggestions on how to improve our project as well as some potential problems that we may encounter. The poster sessions also gave us an early opportunity to hone our presentation skills.
North American iGEM Meet-Up
This year, we attended an official iGEM meet-up hosted at the University of Calgary in July. At this meet-up, we gave a brief presentation of our project to gain feedback from other iGEM teams. We were also able to hear about other iGEM projects from teams across Canada and parts of the USA. This was a great opportunity to connect with other iGEM teams!
aGEM Competition
Our team attended the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machine (aGEM) competition hosted by the MindFuel and GeekStarter programs. We competed against other iGEM teams from Alberta, including the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary. The competition provided critical feedback from experienced iGEM judges, as well as an opportunity to practice our presentation. We received a $2000 travel award from this competition.
Chinook Symposium
For the second year, we were a part of the 12th annual Chinook Symposium that is hosted by the University of Lethbridge’s Chemistry and Biochemistry Department in September. This Symposium showcases local research at the undergraduate and graduate levels. We presented a poster of our project to increase awareness of iGEM and our project throughout the University of Lethbridge. We received positive feedback from undergraduate, graduate, and faculty members about our project and provided yet another oppotunity to practice our poster presentation.

Diagram 2 presents the main algorithm, which shows how BioGuide application     works. In BioGuide the major components are device and Biobrick graphs.     While the device graph represents input-output (promoter-regulator)     compatibility combination of iGEM devices, the Biobrick graph represents     combinations of atomic parts assembled in a device or system. The flowchart     shows how these graphs are created and embedded into the program, which     displays both of the graphs to the user when launched. Application presents     few interactive options to the user when started, which were shown on     the flowchart under the horizontal, bolded line. As shown on the diagram     2, there are four interactive tasks BioGuide can do, where the device     and Biobricks graphs are utilized. Upon clicking a node on a devices     or Biobricks graph, that node changes in size and color and the various     functions shown on the flowchart can be performed then after.
Modeling
Graphical Modeling for Bio-Guide
Introduction
Graphical Modeling Theory has been applied to construct four different     graphs where relations of atomic parts, devices and systems and the     functional combinations that can build new constructs are presented     for the iGEMs parts registry database. Three graphs are composed of     iGEM devices and one graph is based on Biobricks. Each graph comprises     a set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges. In the set of nodes each     node represents a device, while in the set of edges each edge represents     the input-output combination of the nodes. These graphs are directed     graphs as the edges are created according to input-output combination.     All compatibilities between a regulator and a promoter of an edge is     created, where the source of this edge is the device with the corresponding     regulator and target of the edge is the device with the promoter in     concern.
Fig. 1: A node representing a device
Fig. 2: Arrow representing an edge between two nodes
The atomic structures used in our graphical model have been represented     in Figures 1 and 2. A node is represented with a solid circle where     the label, the part/device ID according to iGEM standards, of the device     is marked on the foreground. The blue arrows between nodes connect the     related devices, representing the input-output connectivity. End style     of the arrow helps us to determine the direction of the node, like in     Figure 2 where the node labeled BBa_S03520 is the source and BBa_JO9250     is the target.

Today we continued the lab work on our PCR primers. We again attempted to use two pairs of our primers; the ones to amplify the sleB and cwlJ genes from the B. subtilis genome. We prepared the solutions needed, and followed the PCR protocol. We rehydrated our primers, and diluted them accordingly. The TMs were lowered, following yesterday's failed attempt to 50 and 45 degrees. We prepared four lots of solutions, two with genomic DNA and two without (our controls), containing 2 and 3ul of primer. They were loaded into the PCR machine, which ran for around 2 hours 23 minutes.
When we ran the products on a gel.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html,", hunt their prey by spreading as what scientists call a biofilm aka ""bacterial slime"".
Biofilms can form virtually anywhere. Not only are they responsible for dental plaque, the muck on the inside of fish tanks and the slime on recently fresh fruit, they are also involved in up to 80% of all the microbial infections that we acquire.
They are responsible for causing urinary tract infections (UTIs), the most common infection acquired at hospital. Streptococcus pneumonia make biofilms and cause pneumonia. Biofilm infections lead to chronic wounds. Most permanent indwelling medical devices, such as joint prosthetics and heart valves, will have a biofilm community growing on them. Biofilms are behind a whole host of medical, industrial and environmental problems that are very costly and technically challenging to remedy.
In nature, the majority of bacteria are not free-living; instead they are found associated in these biofilms, ingenius living environments made by the microorganisms to aid their growth - and their assault on other living things.
Such an environment serves as a shelter from which the bacteria can launch their attack, whether it be on the urinary tract, the lungs of a cystic fibrosis patient or the various plants and pipelines for aquaculture. And such an environment also serves as a hide-out: there is currently no commercial antibiotic that specifically targets bacterial biofilms.
It's time to start a war on bacterial biofilms and, with the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains, a completely novel approach is essential.
This is where synthetic biology and the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition join the story. Synthetic biology is about harnessing the tools that evolution has already developed for us. All we need to add is a little imagination!
THE ENGINEER'S RATIONALISATION OF LIFE
""This isn't a fantasy look at the future. We are doing the future""
Craig Venter
Synthetic biology takes the processes designed by nature and categorises them into standardised systems, allowing bacteria to be designed, built and tested, like how you would build a car.
It's about combining the skills of an engineer and engineering principles with molecular biologists and systems biology thinking. The nature of synthetic biology is interdisciplinary, drawing on a number of scientific fields to provide engineering solutions to some of our biggest problems.
It's about appreciating the complexity of living systems and then sorting them into useable parts, parts that can be built back up into new and exciting tools - tools that will rid of pollution, enhance food production, produce energy, do the housework and, in our iGEM project, destroy biofilms,"

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Detect_-_-_TEXT.html," drug susceptibility testing (DST). Results take weeks to obtain and not all laboratories have the capacity to perform DST of first-line or of second-line drugs.
MTB/RIF is a new rapid molecular test that can diagnose TB and rifampicin-resistant TB within hours. Molecular tests, such as GeneXpert, unlike culture-based methods, are fast, accurate and can detect drug-resistant strains. But the high costs and need for laboratories make access an issue for developing countries.
The new method, published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology, uses a microcalorimeter to detect heat produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes TB, on a growth medium. The study showed that detection takes 4–5 days but more sensitive microcalorimeters could detect tuberculosis in 24 hours.
System Design
   By taking advantage of the state of the art CRISPR/Cas research and combining it with phage diagnostics, we designed a sensor that is able to screen for a specific target gene. Our producer strain carries a helper plasmid that codes for the phage capsid proteins of M13 as well as our phagemid plasmid with our sensor system. Our sensor system consists out of three parts: the Cas9 gene under a constitutive promoter, the anti-KAN gRNA also under a constitutive promoter and the reporter element LacZ under the control of the pRecA promoter. As the helper plasmid doesn’t have a packaging sequence, only our sensor system phagemid is packed into the M13 capsids. As M13 is a lysogenic phage, the phagemid particles are exported into the media where they can be easily isolated and are ready to use to sense if an other strain contains our target sequence.
   As the phagemid is derived from M13, it infects only F+ (conjugated) cells. In our case, we conjugated our cells so that they can be easily infected.
Within the target strain, the Cas9 protein, as well as the gRNA get expressed. The gRNA then attaches to the Cas9 protein and guides the Cas9 to the target sequence (kanamycin resistance gene). Once bound to the sequence, the Cas9 protein generates a target specific double strand break. This double strand break leads to the cleavage of LexA. LexA is a protein bound to the pREC promoter that inhibits the expression of genes under the control of the pREC promoter. With the cleavage of LexA, the expression of our reporter LacZ is started, which leads in the presence of X"
SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-i_-_-_TEXT.html,"xygenase which cleaves beta-carotene to two molecules of retinal. Beta-carotene biosynthesis will be supplied by a part made by the 2009 Cambrigde team . We will also do further characterization of the Cambridge part in new strains of E. coli and with different analytical methods.
Prospects
On top of creating a microfluidic flow generator, we hope to simultaneously create a system that can mix fluids in microtubes. It is often a problem when working in nano-scale spaces that if you let two liquids flow into them, they will not mix. The turbulence created by the bacteria's flagella will make both liquids move around randomly in the tube, thus causing them to mix.
The plan is that these three subprojects will result in at least one BioBrick each:
•    A constitutively active operon encoding the master regulator of flagella synthesis.
•    A photosensor, reacting to blue light, coupled to the chemotaxis pathway.
•    A generator for the enzyme that cleaves beta-carotene to retinal.

""Creating a better world requires team work, partnership and collaboration, as we need an entire army of companies to work together to build a better world within the most few decades. This means corporations must embrace the benefits of cooperating with one another""
As the statement suggest, iGEM allows every team to join hands with other teams to benefit each other. Apparently our team had united with the following teams:
Aachen is a research university of technology located in Germany. Our team had collaborated with them through a formal meetup with one of their team members and also by filling their ""TUBEFRONT"" survey which is based on Safety Organisation.
Uppsala university is the research university in Uppsala, Sweden. We collaborated with this team by filling their Google forms, for their university.
Bettencourt team claimed us to fill their ""FOOD SURVEY"" form required for their survey which led to their collaboration with us.

Dr. Michael Ernst
Director of the Agricultural Department
University of Hohenheim
To figure out potential agricultural applications for PACE and PREDCEL we talked to Dr. Ernst from the University of Hohenheim. He indicated that the ability of evolving proteins with specific, novel properties
RN35
, would undoubtably be of high interest for the agricultural industry. However, he expressed his concerns when it comes to acceptance utilizing gene technology for agricultural production by customers, organizations for customer protection as well as policy makers. Dr. Ernst made us aware of the fact, that a lack of acceptance of gene technology in agriculture in Europe is in fact a very fundamental problem present since several decades. In parts, this problem is, as Dr. Ernst says, due to a lack of information required for the stakeholders in the community to fairly weight potential benefits and risks . Dr. Ernst thus recommended an open communication of research in genetic engineering as well as close collaboration with Ethics Boards and organizations for customer protection.  The PACE and PREDCEL approaches developed by our team during this iGEM summer allows evolving and tuning protein-protein interactions. Thereby, proteins can be created, that highly specifically bind to and affect harmful species and reprieve related harmless species. Hereby, biodiversity can be maintained and is even supported compared to conventional approaches. On top, we got the chance to discuss our carbon-silicon approach with Dr. Ernst. He was fascinated by our ideas and claimed, that applications of carbon-silicons have a high demand for usage as fungicides or insecticides by farmers and in the horticultural business.
Dr. Lorenz Adlung
PhD in Systems Biology
Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel
Dr. Lorenz Adlung is an expert in the field of Systems Biology, as he is working on mathematical models of biological systems. He strongly encouraged us to extend our directed evolution approach in silico and to combine our work in the wet lab with the knowledge we gain from our software GAIA . The work in the laboratory greatly benefits from the digital revolution that we are experiencing in the 21th century. In his future vision, an intense interaction between living and modeled systems heralds a new revolution in biological science.  As a former iGEM participant, he is aiming to bring cutting-edge science to the general public. Therefore, he joins open forums and panel discussions on a regular basis and explains scientific discoveries on several platforms in social media. His immense outreach inspired our"
Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though TRE-EBFP2N + CMV-EBFP2C leads to poor fold change, the transfer curve is significantly steeper when the dimerization process is reversible. This means better switch-like properties. With the presence of intein, the effect is weaker but still visible.
Normalize transfer curves to the range of 0 to 1, we can find that the shapes are different. Lines representing split proteins are later to rise and steeper.
If we normalize the initial EBFP2 level to 1, split EBFP2 with intein displays better properties than the other two settings. From fig. we can clearly see that it has the highest multiple among the three, even significantly higher than that of the intact EBFP2. The result shows that split proteins, with high binding affinity, can defeat original undivided proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.
How well do circuits perform as evaluated by channel capacity?
I Seven circuits are evaluated in our experiment. Calculated channel capacities are displayed in fig.
Come on, this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.
More information is transmitted when both parts of the split protein are inducible.
When both promotors are TREs, both split parts are inducible, and channel capacity is relatively higher than that of channels with un-inducible CMVs. In the absence of intein, the two peptides find it hard to dimerize, giving rise to low channel capacity.
Upon addition of intein sequence, the binding process becomes irreversible since the two halves assemble into one intact protein through splicing. As a consequence, channel capacity greatly increases. Double-inducible group with two TRE promotors still win the competition speaking of channel capacity.
Comparing three inducible groups leads to the conclusion, that splitting leads to decrease in channel capacity, but adding intein sequence to peptides rescue the effect, elevating the channel capacity to even higher level.
What can the result teach us?
Inspirations for Synthetic Biology Engineering:
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-p"

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#LightToColor_-_-_TEXT.html," And for precise quantitative data, we chose fluorescent proteins (GFP, BFP, mRFP) as our actuators to mix the colors. What’s more, to avoid the influence of leakage of the fluorescent proteins and get more colors, we also constructed 3 plasmids which only contained 2 output fluorescent protein genes (GFP & mRFP, BFP & mRFP, GFP & BFP), and transformed into the E.coli with pJFR1, pJFR2, pJFR3.
We also tried to induce the expression of fluorescent proteins using the input light which was mixed by lights from different wavelengths. We used mixed light to induce the system because the light from the projectors was mixed light of red-, green-, and blue-light, which we would use in our final hardware. (More information, see HARDWARE ).
.
Figure 6. The process of overlapping the fluorescent pictures, filtering the colors and get the results.
We chose lights of 13 wavelengths from 395 nm to 660 nm, to test our system and produce colors. We firstly use light to illuminate our bacteria for hours on the plate, and then use fluorescence camera to excite the red, green and blue fluorescence and capture the photos. Then using imageJ and Photoshop, we can overlap the three pictures, filter the colors and get our results of mixing colors(Figure 6).
Figure 7. The color spectrum built from fluorescent color mixing.
Figure 8.The rose we created by using the colors we mixed.
The figure7 demonstrated the results of our fluorescent color mixing. Using color picker to pick out the mixed colors from our pictures, we built a even wider spectrum with more colors, with which we created a colorful rose as shown in the figure 8. This result further proved that our system worked and our concept that we can use convenient method—light control—to achieve the mixing and changing the colors of the bacteria was valid.
Figure 9. The color spectrum built from fluorescent color mixing.
To semi-quantitatively analyze the fluorescent plate results, we extracted the RGB value of the pictures and got curves showing the relationship between the R value, G value and B value and the wavelengths of the light. From the figure 9 we could see the trend and the peaks of the curves, that the B value reached the top at the wavelength of 490nm, the G value at 565nm, and the R value at 620nm. The R, G, B value could roughly show the expression of red, green and blue fluorescent proteins and their fluorescence intensity, greatly fitted with the literature"

It looks like the gel in the barrel
It will travel down into the beaker, then disintegrate
At higher alcohol concentrations, the ""thread"" does appear to coagulate and bunch up near the tip (as the literature says it would)
I think that the dope is too dilute.
But also, the fact that it's gelling in the barrel is disconcerting."

Newly industrialising countries with widespread emerging healthcare systems like China would also benefit from our tool. Lung cancer, in large part down to high rates of smoking, caused 529,153 deaths in China in 2011. [45] In conjunction with anti-smoking policies governments could introduce, our screening test could be very effective.
Dr Desai cited the epidemiological evidence that strongly suggests the smoking rate increases in these countries will increase the prevalence of NSCLC.
Both China and India have fairly large isolated rural populations, [46] so again the portability of our test has benefits, and the low cost of our system is also obviously attractive to governments. These countries already have various treatment options and the capability to roll out administrative networks for processing screening results. The problem again lies with the fact that cancers like NSCLC are detected too late, which is why screening is so essential.
False positives
High false positive rates and unnecessary further testing are major downsides to current screening methods. It can be debilitating to be given a diagnosis of cancer and it can have a major psychological impact. It is paramount that when the diagnosis is given, its is accurate - so false positive rates need to be minimized.
Some of the common physiological impacts of a cancer diagnosis include anxiety, emotional upheaval, and depression. Between 20 and 50% of patients with a solid tumor are reported to have linked depression. [47]
Misdiagnosing cancer also has negative economic impacts. It costs the NHS money to carry out all the scans, tests and procedures needed to treat someone diagnosed as positive. The average cost of the unnecessary tests for a false positive in a prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian screening trial was over $1000 per patient. [48]
MiRNA levels have the potential to produce false positives - even when several are quantified and the results combined. As such, it is unlikely that our tool would ever give a conclusive diagnosis of cancer. However, depending on the cutoff value chosen it could definitely rule out cancer in individuals. In others, the results could also strongly indicate the patient has a disease, but further testing would be needed to make the final diagnosis, stage a tumor, and inform therapeutic decisions.

Slovenia,2012,Team:Slovenia#TheSwitchDesignedTALregulators_-_-_TEXT.html," expected to observe a difference in repression due to potential clustering of KRAB-binding proteins, but no significant variation between constructs was noticeable. Our conclusion is that the position of the effector (regulator) domain on either the N- or C-terminus or both does not influence the binding and repression ability of the designed TAL repressors. All further experiments were performed with TAL:KRAB fusions.
Figure 4. Schematic representation of repression experiments. (A) In the absence of a TAL repressor, the reporter gene is constitutively expressed. (B) When a TAL repressor is expressed, it binds to its respective DNA-binding site upstream of the CMV promoter and represses transcription of the reporter gene through KRAB domain-mediated transcriptional silencing.
Figure 5. TAL repressors potently inhibit expression of reporter genes. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with TAL repressors under the control of a CMV promoter (50 ng), and with a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (Figure 3C) containing 10 DNA-binding sites for the designated TAL repressor upstream the CMV promoter (10 ng). Along with the tested constructs we transfected cells with 5 ng of Renilla luciferase under the HSV-TK promoter as transfection control. Luciferase activity was measured 3 days post-transfection. All experiments were executed in 3 biological replicates and repeated more than 3 times with similar results.
Results show that the previously non-functional NicTAL10:KRAB fusion (NicTAL DNA-binding domain constructed by the iGEM2010 team Slovenia) acquired functionality by the N-terminal addition of a subdomain to the TAL DNA-binding domain (Figure 5). An excellent repression ability of NicTAL12:KRAB (the improved version by the 2012 team) was observed. The NicTAL12 repressor was further characterized by testing the effect of a different number of binding sites upstream of the PCMV promoter on the inhibition of reporter expression. Results presented in Figure 6 show that the maximal effect of the bound TAL regulator plateaus at 7 or more copies of binding sites per operator.

V Discussion
Why we detect RFP intensity but not OD600 directly in simplified model used in experiment
    When we look at the model, we will find most part of the model uses hypothesis that is commonly used, like Volterra-Lotka equation or Michaelis-Menten equation, and they can be confirmed experimentally. However,some parts of it are not, like the hypothesis that the decreasing effect of chloramphenicol on population growth rate is proportional to the amount of chloramphenicol inside that character. This is not confirmed by our experiment yet. Therefore, it is still not reasonable now to detect OD600 directly in simplified model used in experiment design. What's more, using RFP intensity to detect LacI and thus killing effect is confirmed by our experiment---Killing Test and so we detect RFP intensity to indicate killing effect.

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," meetup】
Collaboration is always about exchanging ideas and we believe that collective thinking can do a lot of good for iGEM projects. NEU_China_A have participated in a virtual meet-up with AHUT_China, SDU-CHINA, and NWU-China. In the virtual meetup, our four iGEM teams mainly exchanged the progress of each of team’s project, especially the problems encountered in the experiment, the progress of the modeling work, the interpretation of the requirements of the awards, etc.
Jilin_China
Jilin_China used sfGFP_optimism as reporter protein in their gene circuit this year. The existing sfGFP in the iGEM registry Kit has a BbsI restriction site and lacks ease of application. Therefore, this year Jilin_China optimized the sequence of sfGFP, and the optimized sfGFP no longer contains BbsI restriction sites, so sfGFP_optimism can be conveniently applied to GoldenGate assembly. To verify the necessity for sfGFP optimization, NEU_China_A sent experimental materials:superfolder GFP (BBa_I746916)  in the Distribution Kit to them. NEU_China_A utilized blue pigment protein（amilCP）as reporter protein after detecting NO signal this year. In return, Jilin_China very kindly sent Nitrate reporter: PyeaR-GFP composite (BBa_K381001) and Test Device 4 for interlab (BBa_J364007) to our team. After constructing the plasmid, we verified by experiments that the blue protein can be expressed normally after exposure to NO.
JNFLS
This year our project requires the use of the intestinal probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, as the chassis organism, but this strain is not a common strain in the laboratory. Knowing that JNFLS has relevant strain information, we turned to the JNFLS iGEM team for help. Fortunately, they sent it very generously to us with scribing plates and glycerol cryotubes of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 so that we can use it in the future.
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
At 5th CCiC, we learned that SJTU-BioX-Shanghai intends to develop new methods for diagnosing colorectal cancer, which is closely related to our project. Our two teams conducted in-depth exchanges on our respective projects. Coincidentally, they also use NO as a signal molecule. In order to compare the efficiency of different"

The meta table contains basic information of a brick. Initially it is folded, but you can expand it by clicking its header:
By clicking ""Documantation"", you can view the full description of a brick:
At the top right corner of the page, you will find a circular graph, which illustrates the structure of the brick. Each arc represents a special sequence part, arranged based on its position relative to the brick. You can learn more information by moving your mouse onto them:
For those sequences that are also bricks (called subparts), clicking on them will direct you their detail pages.
If a brick contains subparts, they will be displayed at the bottom of the page as well:
Forum
Forum is another essential constituent part of Biohub 2.0. It establishes a platform where users can share and discuss their experience. ""Experience"" is the core concept of Forum. An experience is an article belongs to a specific brick, stating experiment phenomenon and/or providing improvement advices. To post an experience, just click the button on the detail page:
Experiences use Markdown for typography, so you can use few easy-to-remember tags to format your article:
After submitting, your experience will then be displayed on the brick's detail page.
You may vote for an experience if you find it great enough:
Or if you disagree with the author, you may leave a comment:
The idea of sharing experiences are actually inspired by iGEM's offical website, which also has a similar submodule. Few articles have already existed on the website, which we think is a kind of valuable resources. Thus Forum will grab down and display those experiences while fetching data from iGEM, and make a refresh per 10 days to keep them up-to-date.
Apart from experience sharing, Forum also allows you to interact with the bricks:
There are three kinds of actions related to bricks:
Rate
You can grade a brick (0 ~ 5 points) according to your own using experience.
Watch
If you watch a brick, you will receive notifications when other users post experiences. Events related to the brick will also appear on your timeline.
Star
Star is in a sense a kind of mark. If you meet an interesting brick but have no time to skim through its document, you can just star it for later viewing.

Osaka,2009,Team:Osaka#SIGNAL_-_-_TEXT.html," diffusion of AHL through the soft agar medium. Therefore, we shall go back to the roots of natural quorum-sensing systems by introducing a positive feedback loop, in which weak detection of AHL will lead to transcription of genes that either enable production of even more AHL, leading to an escalating increase in AHL concentration, or more AHL receptors, leading to higher AHL sensitivity.
Quenching
There is also a possibility that the signals received may be too strong and render the system useless for producing color gradation. For example if the signal diffuses too efficiently the receiving cells may all uniformly change into the secondary color instead of showing a gradual change in color at the edges near the senders.
Therefore, we may consider implementing a signal-quenching system, perhaps using the aiiA system which involves the AHL-degrading aiiA enzyme. The aiiA gene can be made to express in limited quantity, such that the amount of intracellular AHL will be reduced but not completely erased. This causes only the receivers closer to senders, which receive a higher amount of AHL by diffusion, to be activated while the receivers further away receive too little AHL to pass the quenching threshold and are thus kept inactivated.
Extensive quantitative characterization of parts will be required to determine which of these future work ideas should be pursued and to what degree. As we have unfortunately ran out of time this year, these ideas will have to wait till the next iGEM Competition.

It is worth mentioning that two leader of their team are people suffering from hearing disability. The application, named Deaf Life, can help with real time communication for hearing-impaired people and thus improve living quality of them. It was said on their website that, Deaf Life is not only a way for more people to pay attention to the hearing-impaired group, but also to attract more hearing impaired people to express their own ""voice"", to display their own talent and highlights. It also allows them to live better in our society, to the world, when communication with other groups is no longer an obstacle.” ( See more ).

Interdiscipline Studies are Cool and Fun!
Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.
In addition, we discussed the crucial issue of multidisciplinary researches with our audiance in our lecture. We have integrated the theme into our project perfectly. We incorporated ideas of information theory into biological research. Mathematical modeling plays an important role in our program as well. We are not only adcocators of intersections between different subjects, but also active practipants in action.
We are a special team. Of the 13 members, 11 are from the Department of Automation, the rest two from School of Life Sciences. This background enables us to think differntly and to concentrate on subjects traditional biologists do not concern about. Early in our project, one of our members tried to model the dynamics of the cell with electrical circuit simulation tools, which are handy and provided interesting outcomes.
Interdiscipline studies are cool and fun! We tell the world, not only by showing the possibily to listeners, but also by exploring the possibilities ourselves. Come and join us.
Eliminate Chinese’s prejudice about biotechnology
After hearing the community's concern about biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 200 booklets to expand publicity.
Background
In China, because of the UN human issue that scientists used 60 children to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even"

Playing with Cas9 and Co.
Our team focuses on two major aspects that should be improved for the maturation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Size and Efficiency. Project Truncation addresses size matters while Project Evaluation and Evolution address problems related to efficiency.

Project Evolution
Project Truncation
The catalytically inactive version of Cas9, dCas9, has also been exploited for its ability as a DNA homing device.  Depending on the proteins bound to dCas9, regions targeted by the dCas9 can be epigenetically altered, thereby, providing means of epigenetic regulation to the desired locus.
One of the major impediments to CRISPR therapeutics is the huge size of the Cas9 proteins which places it’s gene length close to the limits of the AAV virus vector which is ~5kb. Current Cas9 homologs are ~3-4kb in size. In the case of the dCas9, which is heavily dependent upon its fusion partner, carries an additional load of it fusion protein. Hence, it is important to shrink dCas9 in order to have more flexibility on the size of epigenetic regulators fused.
In year 2013, Team Freiburg attempted to truncate the dCas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes, SP-dCas9. However, no clear methodology wes used by the team to determine truncation regions as the crystal structures of Cas9 was unavailable at that time, only to be published on 2014. This year, with available crystal structures and domain architecture of the dCas9 clearly outlined, we decided to improve on the truncation rationally.
Truncations made by Team Freiburg 2013 on SpCas91
As the function of dCas9 is only in binding, we truncated several domains of Cas9 that are not essential for binding or not having interactions with the gRNA or DNA. Studies on SP-Cas9 truncations have been done on the REC domain, with only the ∆ REC2 mutant retained the ability for DNA cleavage. We started with deleting the REC2 domain to see if we could have similar results with our GFP reporter assay.

MYTH #1: Fuel Cell Vehicles Burn Hydrogen
Jacob: Doesn’t it work the same way as normal fuel, using hydrogen gas in the combustion chamber?
Fuel cells don’t burn hydrogen; they use an electrochemical process to convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity and water [1,2]. They have no moving parts and no open flames[1,2].
Fig 1. Diagram of a proton conducting fuel cell.
MYTH #2: Fuel Cell Vehicles Are Expensive
Michelle: I just assume they must be because it's such a new technology compared to petrol cars, all new things tend to be more expensive.
This used to be true, however, as technology evolves so fast, advances in fuel cell manufacturing have lead to immense decreases in cost [6]. By the end of 2017, it is shown that fuel cells will cost $30-$50 per kW hour of output, in comparison to car battery packs which will cost consumers $140-175 per kW hour by 2017 [5,6,8].
MYTH #3: Hydrogen Is Too Expensive Compared to Gasoline
Claire: Well, considering that hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe I would just assume that it would be significantly cheaper.
Research has shown that it costs US $0.10/km using gasoline with one of the most fuel-efficient cars on the market (2015 Toyota Prius), whereas it costs US $0.13/km using green hydrogen (from electrolysis from a wind turbine) [8]. Further research has been conducted that indicates that hydrogen sourced from natural gas will cost half this much [8]. So, although green hydrogen is more expensive than petrol, the difference is only US $0.03. Petrol, as a non-renewable resource, will likely increase in cost compared to hydrogen, which is more likely to remain constant, if not decrease [8].
MYTH #4: Hydrogen Storage Tanks Are Dangerous
Nathan: As hydrogen is highly explosive, I feel like it'd probably be dangerous.
This isn't false. Hydrogen is explosive. Pressurised fuel tanks,however"

NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html,"How We Are Going to Use PBAN?
Fig.3-4-1  Overview of our project.
In our project, we will biologically synthesize PBAN with the E.coli. We store the PBAN inside a trapping device (check this out at our Device page) . In the device, there will be appropriate lighting and nutrient sources that will attract insects.
Once an insect is attracted into our device and ingests the nutrient sources we provide, it will also inevitably come in contact with our PBAN. As the PBAN works and activates the pheromone synthesis of the attracted insect, more of this species of insect’s counterparts will be attracted and later captured.
Owing to the first feature mentioned above, PBAN is species-specific, which means that it doesn't matter if other kinds of insects fly into our device and eat the PBAN. This is because the insects we don't want to catch will not be stimulated by PBAN to produce pheromone. Therefore, the PBAN is only for what we want to catch, and we are sure that our method won't affect other kinds of insects.

The principle of Personhood tries to state what defines a person. Some believe a person to be someone who is able to have a reflective view over one’s past, future and present. But this definition is far too narrow, excluding babies and people suffering from dementia. Other definitions are based on a contra factual understanding: a person is someone, who under normal circumstances can be expected to reflect over one’s past, future and present.

We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE diagnostic and treatment pathway (in the case of NSCLC). [11]
The distribution of test values in the target population should be known and a suitable cut-off level defined and agreed.
There should be evidence from high quality randomized controlled trials that the screening programme is effective in reducing mortality or morbidity or evidence from high quality trials that the test accurately measures risk when helping a patient make an “informed choice”
Hennessey et al.’s cohort was not large enough for this to be conclusively known. [3] Further validation with a larger data set is required. The same is true for the links between miRNAs and disease more widely. However, preliminary results are promising. Our test would also need to undergo clinical trials - to test the efficacy of the toehold switches in measuring miRNA levels.
There should be evidence that the complete screening programme (test, diagnostic procedures, treatment/ intervention) is clinically, socially and ethically acceptable to health professionals and the public
To be clinically acceptable our test would need to to undergo large scale clinical trials. This would validate our research showing that it would be specific and cost effective. Socially and ethically, there should be no issues, for the same reasons as above.
The benefit gained should outweigh any harms from screening such as overdiagnosis, overtreatment, false positives, false reassurance, uncertain findings and complications.
The NLST showed 20% reduction in mortality with high risk screening for NSCLC using LDCT. Screening is therefore recommended in the US to high risk population groups. However, our test could prevent unnecessary further testing in many - and overdiagnosis could be reduced by examining the miRNA signature of the tumor. Furthermore, as mentioned in silver human practices , our test would not be offered as a conclusive diagnosis - only to rule out cancer in some and refer the others for further testing. There would also be psychological benefit using our test compared to existing methods in that a possible cancer could be ruled out far more quickly.
The screening programme should be economically balanced in relation to expenditure on medical care with regard to evidence from cost benefit and/or cost effectiveness analyses
We have created a cost effectiveness model - that works out who we should screen for the sensor to be cost effective and result in the cost per QALY being within NICE’s guidelines.
Clinical management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening"

Perspectives
We envision that a future Wiki Wizard contains the following improvements:
A graphical menu builder that can be used to design the main menu using drag and drop.
Improvements of the collaboration feature that possibly use socketio to keep changes of the fields live.
Replacing the admin feature with inline editing, which would give a better feel of how the page will look.
NOD Nrps Oligo Designer
In order to fully utilise high throughput methods, you must be able to do high throughput design. We developed a prototype oligo designer for NRPS library production and screening in python (NOD).
You can find it and an installation guide here:  GitHub
Usage
NOD is a command line program that takes a fasta file with one or more DNA sequences encoding a NRPS and outputs oligos that can be used to alter the specifity of each module. Also shipped with the tool is a simple UI, that can be run instead.

NOD requires a few extra programs. It uses HMMSEARCH of HMMER to identify the adenylation domains and MUSCLE to identify the stachelhaus code. It is written in python and requires BioPython. To run the UI, wxPython must also be installed.
Development
The code for identification of adenylation domains and stachelhaus is based on antiSMASH, but has been slightly modified in order to not only identify the stachelhaus code, but also keep track on the positions in the unaligned sequence.
After identifying the stachelhaus residues, the stachelhaus code is compared to the stachelhaus code of different specificities. By comparing the degenerate sequence of the new stachelhaus code to the sequence of the native code, the changes are scored based on the amount of oligos required to incorporate all changes followed by the number of required mismatches. More than one oligo may be necessary, if changes are too far apart. The oligos are designed to be 90 nucleotides long with homologous ends of atleast 15 nucleotides in each end.
Perspectives
The developed tool is only a prototype. We suggest to implement the following improvements:
Currently the program randomly selects a codon from a degenerate codon if there are more than one option with the same required mismatches. An improvement to this, could be to score codons according to codon usage.

By this stage term was about to start and members of the team had very little time.  Nevertheless, due to the synthesis dramas described, work had to continue for some time.
Monday 4th October
Today we received extremely bad news.  We had ordered 3 DNA constructs for synthesis by Mr. Gene on 19th August who had said that 98% of sequences of this length would have a turn-around time of 14 business days. We had become increasingly alarmed as time had gone on without the order being completed.  We received our first contact from them at this time, informing us that the company was having problem with one of our constructs - luxAB.  They said they had split the sequence into three parts and had to start from scratch, and that it might be 3 weeks until we got the sequence.  This would take us until just before the Jamboree.
We moped for a bit and then came up with a plan, we asked them to send the completed sequences as soon as possible. We decided we would attempt to fuse them to the Xenorhabdus luminescens luxAB submitted by last year's Edinburgh team.
But there was good news as shown by the image on the right.  We had believed that a number of our colour changes had failed due to sequencing results. But when we assayed our plates we found that some"

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," RFP expression using a spectrophotometer. Even after 8 hours in M9, levels of RFP were still very high. Nevertheless, we observed slightly elevated levels of RFP in the bacterial culture incubated with Aspartate, compared to untreated control (Figure 4). While this indicates that our receptor is responsive to Aspartate, this result will need to be strengthened in future experiments.
Figure 3: Hybrid Tar/CusS receptor induces expression of RFP. (A) Expression of  RFP in bacteria expressing Hybrid receptor and carrying reporter construct. (B) Expression of RFP in bacteria carrying the RFP reporter alone. Scale bars are 10 um.
Figure 4: Emission spectrum of bacteria expressing Hybrid receptor (BBa_K2736109 ) and RFP reporter (BBa_K2736105 ). Red line corresponds to bacteria treated with Aspartate, and blue line corresponds to untreated bacteria. Samples were illuminated at 585 nm. RFP peak emission is at 607 nm.
Conclusion
The expression of RFP in bacteria transformed with hybrid receptor and RFP reporter, but not in bacteria transformed with reporter alone, demonstrates the functionality of our copper-sensitive RFP reporter (submitted part BBa_K2736105 ). Is also shows that its expression is dependent on the presence of the hybrid Tar/CusS receptor. Presumably the expression is due to the presence of Aspartate in LB medium. The slight increase in RFP expression upon addition of Aspartate after incubation in M9 medium (lacking Aspartate) for 8 hours further indicates that our receptor is indeed responsive to Aspartate. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of using alternative ligand binding domains to broaden the range of targets detectable by DeTaXion. Key future experiments include further investigation of the Aspartate responsiveness of the hybrid receptor, and the generation of receptors carrying ligand binding domains engineered to bind pharmaceutical compounds.
Aim 2: Development of a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) readout for the activity of the chemotaxis pathway.
Approach
To detect the activity of the chemotaxis pathway, we designed a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-based sensor, inspired by a previously made chemotaxis BRET-pair (Cui et al. 2014). We fused Renilla luciferase (RLuc) C-terminally to CheZ, and eYFP to CheY N-terminally. The final form of DeTaXion will give a quantifiable B"

According to the adenovirus trafficking model, GenSniper enters the cell from the top. In the nuclear region (r , RN), it can only diffuse. In the cytoplasmic region (RN , r , RC), GenSniper intermittently switches between diffusion and motor-assisted transport. As an approximation, we can assume uniform concentration of endosomal and cytosolic GenSnipers along the vertical direction.
Schematic representation of a model cell for GenSniper trafficking
Transition map of GenSniper trafficking
As for this model, it is of note that the nuclear localization signal has not been incorporated into GenSniper. Thus, the trafficking process is hard to predict. Since naked plasmid can also work even without such signals and protein capsid, the design of GenSniper without such signals seems to be OK. In addition, as for a newly proposed approach, this design is recommended for a well-defined wetlab system and a simplified modeling. As for practical use, the NLS is highly recommended to be added by phage display on E of lambda head.

Stochastic Switch model
Our heads or tails stochastic switch is used in our system to a give a decision to be a metal container and sequester cadmium, or continue to normal vegetative life. This cell fate decision is given based on a number of parameters stochastically. Hin invertase which inverts a promoter is also included in the same region. Its expression is controlled by LacI controlled pspac promoter (inducable by IPTG) on the left site and XlyR controlled xylA promoter (Inducable by Xylose) on the right side. The promoter inside the invertible region is used to express downstream genes either on the left side or rigth side depending on its position.
LacI binds to Pspac promoter and represses its expression whereas XylR binds to xylA promoter and represses the expression from xylA promoter. When induced with IPTG, LacI falls off from the Pspac promoter and when induced with Xylose, XylR falls off from xylA promoter and does not repress it any more. The differences between LacI's and XylR's binding affinities to promoters and to their inducers affect the expression of Hin, hence the direction of the invertible region. When this region is oriented from left to right and Pspac promoter is not repressed by LacI, sigA promoter in the invertible region expresses Rfp. When the region is oriented from right to the left, 'sigA promoter"

This would involve a major modification of the structure of nuclear power plants.
These changes involve too important costs as in France, a modification in one power plant must be also done in the 58 other power plants of the nuclear fleet, for standardization and safety reasons.

We also have to consider that during the conventional operation, pressure in the primary circuit can reach up to 155 bars, and temperature up to 327°C (621°F). As the maximum rate of temperature decrease is estimated at 28°C/hr (82°F/hr)and acceptable temperature for our biofilter is between 20°C to 45 °C, it implies waiting 4 to 5 hours after the opening of the nuclear reactor, before starting the cobalt decontamination.
It could be too long because stopping the reactor costs one million euros a day and the maintenance time has to be as short as possible.

In the primary circuit, cobalt is in form of ions and particles. Cobalt particles may represent the majority of cobalt and the initial bioremediation strain is design to capture ions of cobalt .
At this stage of the project we could not assess the ability of the biofilter to capture cobalt particles. However, the final ""Cobalt Buster"" strain will produce amyloid fibers (curli) that could allow it to fix cobalt particles on its surface.

Where to use ""Cobalt Buster"" ? (Experts advice)
1-
According to the experts, the ""Cobalt Buster"" biofilter could be used in the treatment of other effluents, such as those of dismantling stations or stations of treatments of liquid effluents (STEL).
In these stations the radioactivity is lower, but the problems related to the cobalt still exist, and temperature and pressure are compatible with the survival of our biofilter (atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature).
Moreover, a collaboration subjected to non-disclosure agreement is being discussed with one of our partner to realise pilot testing.
2-
The filter could also be used in a bubbling type system to treat contaminated air during the decommissioning of power plants.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.

D-alanine auxotrophic mutant bacteria were transformed with plasmids containing ALR sequence under the control of three RIOT sensors with weak RBS.  Their overnight culture were spun down and resuspended with M9 minimal media without D-alanine supplement. Then, they were subjected to different treatments: without and with addition of D-alanine supplement (50 μg/ml) and with addition of lactate of 10-4 to 10-2 M. Their OD600 readings were measured for 6 hours. LN of OD600 readings reflects the bacterial growth rate. Mean LN(OD600) was calculated with N=3 and the error bars stand for SEM.

The Vision
The 2016 UNSW iGEM team hopes to introduce customisable outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as a platform technology for the application of future iGEM projects. To achieve this, we investigated the effect of various genetic alterations on the ability of E. coli to overproduce OMVs. In this hypervesiculating strain we then directed fluorescent proteins to the periplasm for uptake within OMVs, or anchored them to the outer membrane for decoration of OMVs. We hope this will serve as proof of concept for the potential for OMVs to be tailored for various functions in future projects.
The Context
Currently, synthetic biologists engineer live bacterial cells to perform new or useful functions. However, these bacteria are limited to use in the laboratory as their release poses severe biosafety risks since they may persist in the environment long after their function is required.
In comparison, OMVs are lipid bubbles, produced by bacteria when a bulge of their outer membrane pinches off and detaches from the cell surface. As the vesicle forms, it can encapsulate some of the proteins directly underlying the outer membrane in the periplasm. Thus, OMVs can potentially be easily customised for various functions by targeting cellular proteins to the periplasm or outer membrane [1]. OMVs are non-living and non-replicating, and therefore following potential release they will eventually degrade with no long-term effect on the natural ecosystem.
Research has been slow to explore the potential uses of OMVs, while their capability to be customised makes them an excellent prospective platform technology for synthetic biology. They could potentially be the medium through which synthetic biology projects can be applied in the real world, overcoming the biosafety problems posed by the classical use of live bacteria.
The Project
Hypervesiculating Strain Library
For our project, we first implemented various genetic alterations in E. coli that we believed would result in overproduction of OMVs. The final stains we thus obtained are shown in the table below:
TolR (periplasmic domain) or g3p (N-terminal domain) were expressed in a T7 promoter-driven vector (pET or pRSF Duet, respectively). These knock-in mutations were selected for our strain library"
BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"ol. The                         antioxidants that are commonly found in cosmetics and health products on the market today are                         vitamin C, vitamin E, tea polyphenols, etc.
The prospect in the field of antioxidants and detection
In recent years, with the improvement of people's living standards and the aging of the                         population, health, anti-oxidant and anti-aging have attracted people's attention more and                         become hotspots. According to statistics, the scale of China's medical and health industry has                         increased from 1.6 trillion yuan in 2009 to 5.6 trillion yuan in 2016. And it is estimated that                         by 2020, the total size of China's medical and health industry will exceed 8 trillion yuan. [5]
Because of the functions of anti-oxidant, anti-aging, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, vascular activation and the capacity of scavenging the excess ROS in the organisms, antioxidants have a                         remarkable prospect in the fields of pharmaceuticals, health products and cosmetics. [6]
Through literature review and data collection, we learned that the current antioxidant testing                         methods on the market are not good enough, which means, there is no standard method for us to                         judge the effects of antioxidants. So we want to establish a convenient and efficient standard                         and detection method for evaluate antioxidants. Additionally, how to accurately evaluate the                         activity of antioxidants is also a hot topic in the field of antioxidants research. [7] Besides, the public resist synthetic antioxidants and inclined to choose natural antioxidants. Check                             here to know what people want for antioxidants detection. [8] The most amazing thing is that countless excellent natural antioxidants are hidden in nature.                         We just need a key of antioxidants detection method to open the huge treasure house of nature.
Here showed the current detecting methods that we collected in the market:
The existing methods of detecting antioxidants:
Human studies and animal models
Fig. 4 Detecting methods based on human/animal cells
In these existing assays for detection of antioxidants, human studies and animal models could                         give us the most truthful and reliable measurement results could. However, these are expensive                         and time-consuming and not available for initial screening antioxidants. [9]

Safety
Most of the following information can also be found on our iGEM Safety Form
Basic Safety
Before beginning work in the lab, we learnt basic lab safety.  This included:
Knowledge of fire exits
Knowledge of first aid kit location/names of qualified first aiders in the building
Always wearing a lab coat inside the lab
Reading and signing the relevant COSHH forms
How to store flammable/toxic chemicals
How to dispose of hazardous, and potentially hazardous, waste materials.
Good microbiological practice, such as sterilisation techniques and correct disposal of biological materials.
Risk Assessments
Alongside the igem safety form, we were also required by the University to complete a GM risk assessment for our labwork. The dry lab team also compiled a risk assessment for their experiments, as they involved electrical devices and liquids in close proximity.  Risk assessments were also required for both Science Centre Events.

The risks are small to negligible – we are working with the K-12 strain on E.coil, which is genetically crippled to the extend that it cannot survive outside the lab environment (and has also lost its capacity to colonise the mammalian gut).  The genes we are inserting into E.coli K12 do not increase its pathogenicity. "

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Notebook#Conrad_-_-_TEXT.html," surface by adhesive plaques.
Mytilus edulis has the ability to bind to a very broad range of materials, ranging from glass, plastics, metals, wood and Teflon to biological materials, such as biological tissues, organisms, and other chemical compounds or molecules. As  a result, the adhesive abilities of mussels have been an inspiration for the production of the synthetic version of this biological glue.
The mussel attached by its byssus threads (Powel, 2009)
How do mussels attach?
Mussels use a rather flexible method to attach to a surface; they spin a set of threads from an internal muscle to the surface, also known as stem. (Waite, 1983) (Waite,1992) The treads are 2 to 4 cm in length and attach to the surface by the use of plaques (diameter 2-3 mm).  Thus, this plaque connects the substrate and the byssal thread. The specific adhesion is determined by the number of threads, which can go up to 30 to 50 threads per mussel. This will lead to a total attachment strength up to 400N.  The plaque is divided into three sections. The first part is a pre-coating adhesive layer, which can attach to the surface. On top of this, the byssal threads are anchored in an open, cellular structure. (Benedict & Waite, 1986) The overall protection layer is formed by a “varnish”, which protects against enzymatic and chemical degradation. (Rzepecki & Waite, 1995)
The foot of the mussel (Haemers, 2003 )
Formation of the plaque and bysall threads
As well as the plaque as the threads are built of proteins, which are produced in the mussel’s foot. In the mussel’s foot there is a very complex organ with different types of glands of muscles. In a special part (the ventral groove), the thread and plaque are formed. (Pujol, 1967) This ventral groove runs over the whole foot and can be sealed off from the environment if required. (Waite, 1992) The foot can be bend in such a direction, that the ventral groove contacts the substrate.
In the sixties it was shown that as well as the thread as the plaque is formed by the interaction of secretions from three different kind of cells located in the foot. (Pujol, 1967) There are three specific regions in the foot where the different cell"

We observed that, as the exposure time was incremented from 1 minutes to 10 minutes (figure 1, graph C-F), the intensity of the peak also amplified indicating an increase in the amount of cleavage product. Also the absence of this peak in pyridine (blank) and the sample without exposure (figure 1, graph A and B), supports the absence of cleavage product. However, due to the unavailability of standard 2-nitroso benzaldehyde, we could not quantify the amount of cleaved product produced on UV exposure. The spectrum of the cleaved product show peaks at 51, 52, 73 and 79 m/z (figure 2) which is almost similar to the data available. [1]
Figure 2: Spectrum of 2-nitroso benzaldehyde for peak at 5.22 minutes.
A rough estimate of the change in concentration was made by measuring the area under the curve for the peak at 5.22 minutes (figure 3).
Figure 3: Increase in area under curve for peak at 5.22 minutes.
Also based on similar measurements, we observed a decrease in area for the peak at 19.02 minutes, indicating the presence and decrease in the concentration of ONBY (figure 4).
Figure 4: Decrease in area under curve for peak at 19.02 minutes.
As a conclusion, we deduced that the amount of cleavage product increases as the exposure time is extended.
Day 2
We intended to use the results of the ONBY photocleavage characterization to irradiate our samples S221X- and Y77X-mutated proteases which were obtained through cultivation of the SDM 2 and SDM 4-modified expression system in E. coli BL21. Furthermore, we planned to perform a skim milk assay with these samples before and after irradiation and then the degradation efficiencies of the proteases were compared by the extent of clearance. With these results we wanted to prove that due to the incorporation of DMNB-serine in the catalytic triade of the protease would lose its proteolytic activity and would only re-gain it after irradiation which would result into photocleavage.

This page shows a list of all the parts that we have made or used in the project. Click on each link to see more details about that part on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . As our project focus on tor2 gene coming from yeast and contains common restriction sites like EcoRI, NotI and SpeI, the stantard Plasmid Backbone and BioBrick prefix/suffix is no longer appropriate. Furthermore, the size of 7800bp makes it pretty too expensive and inconvenient for chemical synthesis and codon optimization to avoid certain restriction sites. To match with the core gene and protein, a series of parts also give up standard prefix/suffix and backbones. We have used at least 3 kinds of plasmids, including blunt-end vectors to Yeast Surface Display Vector. However, based on the splendid standard plasmid backbone pSB1C3, which has a small size and simple MCS for easy-operation, we modified several vectors, which also render functionality and ease-of-use of promoter parts.
1.  Inducible pCIT2 – Mut-TOR2 - Terminator, BBa_K563061: Promoter of CIT2 gene would be binding with transcription factor RTG1/3 at the presence of FAP. Then our reconstructed Mut-TOR2 would be expressed and forms in Mut-TORC1 which is not allergic to FAP. The accumulation of Mut-TORC1 will help the intracellular phosphorylation back to normal state. 2.  pYE- Reporter, BBa_K563040 ~ BBa_K563046: We have successfully construct vectors, which coding bright fluorescent protein and Luciferase and beta-galactosidase in yeast cell. This series of BioBricks provide a convenient method for the measurement and detection of gene expression and terminate the unsuccessful expression of fluorescent protein in yeast cell. 3.  Modified Plasmid Backbone – pSBY11, BBa_K563051: We reconstruct the Yeast Vector pYD through the combination with pSB1A11. According to specific primers, we amplify the yeast elements (CEN4/ARS6, TRP1 orf and terminator region) by PCR, and then insert the fragment into pSB1A11 by single"

    Similar results of other 2 AHL pairs can be obtained by similar analysis.
    However, we do not need to be so frustrated, since we can determine part of two warriors that satisfy our needs of warrior as follows (Fig. 5) and then our model can tell us how to improve this gene circuit based on this circuit. ( Improved gene circuit )
Fig. 5 Gene circuit designed from Orthogonality test results. From experiment results, we know that warrior II just response to C4HSL secreted by warrior I, but not 3OC6HSL secreted by itself, and we cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter pair we put inside warrior I
     What's more, because we use RFP to indicate level of killing effect of warriors inside cell during orthogonality test, we are not sure about if the results will be the same when we use a complete circuit (namely, if this indication is reasonable), so we have Killing test to verify it.
Note: The needs about warrior can be decomposed to four parts:
(1)Warrior I can be killed by warrior II
(2)Warrior I cannot be killed by itself
(3)Warrior II can be killed by warrior I
(4)Warrior II cannot be killed by itself
    We can just satisfy 3 of these needs now, like the circuit mentioned in Fig. 5. In other words, the best design we can achieve now is to construct one warrior that can be only killed by the other . Of course, the circuit in Fig. 5 is not unique for us to achieve 3 of these needs. However, it can already satisfy our needs to verify the credibility of Orthogonality test in killing test and give a better gene circuit. Therefore, during our project, we use it when we mentioned these two needs, not the other circuit.

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Every system needs to be tested, especially one like ours with its numerous components. Throughout our research, we learned about testing and evaluation procedures, which influenced the way we analyzed our final system. We interviewed leading scientists in the fields of synthetic biology and circuitry to best understand how we could evaluate our circuit and present it to the scientific community.
Exploration
Prof. Guillaume Lambert, School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University
April 9, 2018
Part of Professor Lambert’s research focuses on the development and characterization of synthetic biological regulatory elements to guide the creation of biological circuits in cells and other active living systems. Hence, he was able to give us guidance into which experiments would be most valuable to convince someone that our circuit works. He suggested verifying that different frequency oscillations would lead to different amplitudes of output signal by testing each component of the high- and low-pass filter separately and demonstrating that our circuit is tunable.
Prof. Edward Kan, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University
April 10, 2018
Professor Kan’s research focuses on biosensors and electrical systems that interface with physiological systems. Since there are many aspects of our circuit to evaluate, this can make it difficult to identify which component is the most important. Professor Kan emphasized that we should focus on the power and time needed to activate our bio-circuit, incorporating knowledge about the overall delay time. During our refinement, we should focus on minimizing the energy needed to implement the circuit. Lower energy correlates to faster components. Further, we should use a prescribed test to test our circuit, essentially proving that a specified input signal leads to the right output.
Prof. Guillaume Lambert, School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University
July 10, 2018
As our project progressed from the ideation phase to the implementation phase, we discussed our developments with Professor Lambert once more. Overall, he was impressed with the biocircuit we developed. As we moved into the nuts and bolts of our testing phase, he urged us to carefully monitor the growth of our cells because the behavior of the circuit will change when cells reach their stationary growth phase. He recommended that we keep our cell concentration low so that the cells remain in the exponential growth phase. Flow cytometry would be a valuable tool for real-time and rapid measurement of the fluorescence of individual cells.

9.16 CsCl Gradient
I) Purpose
Isolate both small and large mutant T7 phage.
II) Expected Outcome
We most likely will not see bands but the small phage should be found in the high end of the gradient and large phage will be found in the lower end of the gradient.  We will extract the entire gradient and perform spot tests to confirm.
III) Reagants Used
T7 mutant phage
CsCl
phage suspension buffer
IV) Actual Procedure
Create 3 tubes of different concentrations of CsCl solutions to create a gradient.
For the first tube
Add 0.4225 g of CsCl to 3 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.1 g/ml density gradient.
Add 0.8245 g of CsCl to 3 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.2 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.2293 g of CsCl to 3 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.3 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6371 g of CsCl to 3 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.4 g/ml density gradient.
Add 2.0477 g of CsCl to 3 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.5 g/ml density gradient.
Add 2.4611 g of CsCl to 2.5 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.6 g/ml density gradient.
