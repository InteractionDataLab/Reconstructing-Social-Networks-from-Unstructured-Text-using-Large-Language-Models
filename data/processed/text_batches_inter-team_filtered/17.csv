TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Delft. Here, prof. Dr. Arno Smets, introduced us to Stefaan Heirman (see acknowledgements ), a technician at the same research group who helped us in our solar cell experiments. After sterilization , we compared efficiencies of solar cells using a solar simulator with and without our biologically produced microlenses.
Methods
There are different ways to measure the output of solar cells with accuracy and reproducibility. The most used characteristic of solar cells is their efficiency (Power Conversion Efficiency or PCE). It is defined as the energy produced by the solar cells with a set amount of light from an external light source. There is a standardized protocol for this type of measurement, enabling researchers to simulate ‘real-world’ conditions and compare different solar cells in different setups.
In order to achieve these reproducible and accurate ‘real world’ measurements of efficiency, the previously mentioned protocols need to be used, as well as a certain type of equipment. The equipment used to simulate the aforementioned conditions is called a solar simulator, which is basically a big Xenon lamp with well-defined light power output. In order to calibrate the simulator, a ‘standard’ solar cell is used with well-defined properties to measure the exact output of the simulator in each measurement. At last, the tested solar cells must be placed perpendicular to the light with nothing restricting the light path and kept still during the whole testing. Using this set of equipment, we are sure that we conduct all the experiments under the same scientifically accepted conditions so we remove the uncertainty factor from our experimental results.
Results and discussion
The samples prepared for the spectroscopy measurements of our cells are summarized in table 1.

The bacteria were killed using UV sterilization and placed on glass slides to dry overnight. The power conversion efficiency of the uncoated solar cell was measured, as well as the efficiency of the solar cell with an empty glass slide (negative control) and the efficiency of the solar cell with a glass slide coated with bacteria.

ESBS-Strasbourg,2010,Team:ESBS-Strasbourg#Project#Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html," system the adaptor-role is assumed by PIF, which will bind to PhyB following light-induction. Target proteins are fused to PIF and tagged with the DAS-degradation sequence which, through light activation, brings the degradation sequence in proximity to ClpX and guides them to the catalytic core of the protease. Therefore a specific degradation of proteins containing the degradation sequence can be induced by a light signal.
The system can be constitutively expressed in the chassis but it remains inactive until light-induction. However, it is expected to stay active for the background of naturally SsrA-tagged proteins, creating no interference with the natural occurring proteins of E.coli.
The E. Coli stem
The native ClpXP in E.coli would interfere with the measurements of the degradation and the degradation itself, so we decided to work in a ClpX-deficient E. Coli strain.
Prediction of possible problems
One problem could be a too slow protease activity of the ClpXP to clear the tagged protein. Endogenous levels of ClpXP are capable of degrading more than 100,000 copies of a tagged substrate per generation in E. coli [18] .
All in all, we had a precise and feasible project to start working.

Project Summary
Hey everyone! This is our first year competing in IGEM and are very excited to be joining the community. We're a small university of 4000 students hidden away in the wilderness of northern British Columbia. Our project was inspired by the high levels of Copper in our water systems and the Mt. Polly mining disaster that released a large amount of copper and other metals into the environment. Because of these issues we're working on a water remediation project. We're hoping to use copper binding proteins to reduce the amount of copper in water.
This summer 12 students are working in a class like format to accomplish our goals. So far we've transformed a few of our desired parts into e.coli but are still waiting for a couple in the mail. Once all of our parts arrive we can start ligating them together. We're hoping that we can get the copper binding protein to attach to the outside of e. coli, by joining the sequences for the copper binder and a trans membrane anchor. Our team is ambitious, we hope that we can raise enough money to send all twelve of us to IGEM 2016. We're constantly working events and fundraising activities. We're very lucky to be Partnered with the Spirit of the North Health Care foundation who have helped us to reach out to the community and raise additional funds."

iGEM LATAM
Up to this date, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and Chile are some of the countries in Latin America that have participated in iGEM, with innovative projects, which are undoubtedly contributing to the progress of science in the continent. For a geographical and language issue, and for conditions of common participation, we consider important that these countries have a collaboration and articulation that allows, in the short and long-term, to obtain benefits and overcome difficulties for the different Latin American teams, bringing with it a greater participation and growth of synthetic biology in the continent.
For this reason, as a UChile Biotec team in agreement with the teams: TecCEM, AQA_Unesp, Amazonas_Brazil, PASantiago_Chile, Tec-Chihuahua, TecMonterrey_GDA, UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB, USP-Brazil, this 2017 we have proposed and carried out a collaboration called ""iGEM Latinoamérica"", which consists of a permanent dialogue between teams through email, social networks and meetings through video call, to share our experiences and projects, and additionally in the preparation of a magazine, which will materialize in the month of November.
This magazine consists of a selection of the information of all the Latin American teams and projects that will participate in this great meeting and their vision regarding the main difficulties they have had to get to iGEM. The language in which this document will be written will be of low complexity so that it is understood even by those who are not linked to the world of science and will be widely disseminated through our networks. With this we seek to make known among different countries not only how synthetic biology can bring great benefits to society, but also the problems we have had on the way to Giant Jamboree, to present our ideas and projects.
We hope that this collaboration transcends the next years, and in the long term it will become an interdisciplinary network of contacts in Latin America around iGEM and synthetic biology.

At the same time, other possible methods for project development had also been discussed to    get the best possible design in which will be easy for future researchers to use. Characteristics of our project such as    effectiveness, sensitivity, and consistency has been considered throughout the discussion and had been integrated into    the project afterwards.
When we asked Prof. Matthew Bennett on his personal view towards the GM crops, Prof. Bennett pointed out that
“There’re a lot of things that have been genetically modified for a long time ago:  The resistant Monsanto’s round-up corn that are highly resistant to bugs, dependent upon a certain chemical. It has been around for so long where people didn’t think of it as GMOs anymore.”
Although these crops were genetically modified, overtime, people assume that the characteristics of the organism are originated from nature. In communicating and delivering our project to the public, the team therefore has to think about whether this project will change people’s mindset towards GM crops - positively, they could be more cautious towards it, or negatively, they might have an increased negative perception towards GM crops and shun it. In this human practices activity, we strived to promote the former and avoid the latter.
3. InnoCarnival (21/10/2017 – 29/10/2017)
The InnoCarnival is a platform to showcase modern innovation which can benefit humans. During the week, we have met people ranging from young children to the elderlies. After some basic explanation on how the project works, we were able to step further into the possible application of our project. This shows the public that there are no limitations on what a project can do, but it depends on how much researchers and investors are willing to step out of the box and use whatever is available as a stepping stone to build even more advanced products.
4. Synthetic Biology Articles
For the public to believe in synthetic biology and our project, they need to know what synthetic biology is and how it relates to their daily life. Therefore, we have written articles in Chinese and posted onto a local scientific Facebook page to guide readers through the world of synthetic biology. We also tackled misconceptions regarding synthetic biology through the articles, teaching about how we can analyze the safety of those GM food instead of fully trusting the media.

(5th - 11th September)
Sequencing results for OP+QR and MZH+WK were received. Initially the MZH+WK did not look good upon analysis and the OPQR results were yet to be analysed.
3A assembly was used to, again, reattempt the ligation of C+A (for operon 1) and kept in the freezer ready to be transformed in week 7.
ELJ was sequenced confirmed and the sequenced confirmed sample was used in attempt to express this operon as a protein.
Samples of D, TB-cut test and more samples of MZH-WK were sent off for sequencing.

(12th - 18th September)
3A assembly was used to make composite parts ELJ+TB (operon 2 and 3), C+A (for operon 1) and MZHWK+OPQR (operons 4 and 5). The digests were run on a gel. This was transformed into E.coli (both commercial and competent cells) and plated onto LB plates with the corresponding antibiotic to the antibiotic resistance in the backbone.
Promising results were seen when colonies grew on plates for each of the transformations. Transformant colonies from were cultured, the plasmids extracted, digested, checked on a gel and sent to be sequenced. Sequences were analysed and confirmed before being chosen to move forward with.
Sequence confirmed operons were transformed into DH10beta cells for protein expression during the following week.

Differentiation
B. subtilis is able to differentiate into cells with different morphologies and functions (Fig. 3). The most characteristic form is the endospore, which is produced under nutrient starvation. In our project, we exploited the production of endospores. Because they are extremely stable, spores are perfect vehicles for the display of functional fusion proteins on their surface as illustrated by our Sporobead module.
Fig. 3: The vegetative cycle is very similiar to that of E. coli. However, in the event of a stressor such as starvation, the cells enter sporulation, where they first undergo a polar cell division, followed by the formation of the endospore. If the environmental conditions are suitable again, the spore will then germinate and reenter the vegetative cycle.

I am studying medicine on 5th semester at the University of Southern Denmark, and my motivation for joining SDU´s iGEM is numerous. First of all, studying medicine does not prepare the ground for scientific work, which I think is a petty. Second, I think its cool to make friends among different field of study. Third, but presumably most important; I would like to have some fun.

I’m 24 and study Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at 9th semester. Although I've spend a lot of time in the lab doing projects on C. elegans metabolism and analysis of modified nerve terminal proteins, I've never been in touch with genetic engineering or even worked with single-celled organisms.
When I think about all the opportunities in genetic manipulation, I just have to know the techniques. And learning this discipline by hands-on experiences together with a great team – in competition with others ;o) – sounds just pretty nice!

9th semester Biochemistry & Molecular biology, 24, experience with cell culturing, protein purification with focus on phosphoproteins and mass spectrometry. Additionally, experience with purification of DNA from tissue and copy number surveillance.
I always seek new areas of study, because I find the world of life sciences very exciting. When the opportunity came up to do something with bacteria, I was interested right from the start, because I havent really worked in the area of prokaryotes before and I was eager to explore it.

Hey! My name is John. I am studying medicine at 5th semester here at the University of Southern Denmark. I have 3 reasons for joining the iGEM team here. First of all I'm very dedicated to all forms of science.  Second I think it is great to meet other students who have the same passion for science. At last I would also like to have more fun. "

From left to right: R, BR, C, PC. Left before vortexing: only PC stays more in solution. Right: by vortexing, most solutions become evenly distributed except for R.
We purchased enzymes representing our designed CBHI, EGII and BGLI from Megazyme. The purchased enzymes are: cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) from Trichoderma sp., cellulase (endo-I,4-ꞵ-D-glucanase) from A. niger, and ꞵ-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger. We will refer to them as CBH, EG and BGL, respectively. We furthermore purchased a cellulase enzyme blend as a positive control from Sigma-Aldrich (a product of Novozyme).
CBH: 0.05 U/mg
EG: 70 U/mg, 1200 U/mL
BGL: 90 U/mg, 40 U/mL
Cellulase blend: ~1.15 g/mL
Since the assay is suitable for cellulase activity between 6-375 mU, but CBH came in a low concentration, we decided to use a final enzyme concentration of 10 mU for all enzymes to be able to compare their activities.
For these purposes, we diluted all enzymes to 0.05 U/mL concentration, of which we took 20 µl into a final assay volume of 100 µl. For the negative control, 20 µl of buffer was added. The other 80 µl consisted of the cellulose sources suspended in incubation buffer. The assay was further performed according to the protocol . For the image below, the enzymes were incubated with the substrates overnight.
This resulted in the chromogenic pattern as can be seen below. The positive control contains such large amounts of cellulases that it becomes pink in all cases (it is brownish because the blend has a brown color). It appears that the phosphorylated cellulose is best degraded, especially by CBH. The cellulose and ball-milled ReCell can be degraded as well, but need more time.
Row A to D contain R, BR, C and PC, respectively. Lanes 1 to 6 contain BGL, EG, CBH, a mix of 1-3, cellulase blend, negative control, respectively.

Benjamin Devreux :
Benjamin is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. To put it simply, Benjamin will always disagree with you. Why ? Just to bother you, of course. He loves to grumble on everyone and about everything. But in reality when he makes something, he makes it right. For iGEM, he’s ready to make more than 150 petri dishes to make you happy. And thanks to him, we can explain our project to everyone with a simple but efficient video.

Overview

Overview
For the human practices, we have two main goals. One is to improve our own project. Another is to promote us, iGEM and synthetic biology to the public. Our integrated Human Practices will mainly talk about how HP affects the project. And in our Education& Public Engagement , you will find more about how we let people engage synthetic biology.
Integrated HP
At the beginning of the competition, we decided to construct the integrated biobrick database. Because of the specialty of the project, our main users will be iGEMers and synthetic biologists. Then we thought carefully about how to make sure our project would work well and meet the needs of those who conduct synthetic biological experiments. So, we created a complete ‘investigation-improve-test-feedback’ framework with 7 steps and 2 rounds of tests and feedback to improve our project. Then we did our human practices in correspondence to every step of this circle.
Here’s the 7-step circle. You can click the fellow bottons to straightly see any step you want to know or you can read it step by step.
Problems and Idea
First, we encountered the problems when using iGEM Registry to conduct experiments and we came up with the idea of constructing this BioMaster database to solve the problem.
Preliminary Investigation
Then, preliminary investigation is essential which will be our directions for the first construction. We did some surveys and questionnaires for nearly 100 participated iGEMers or professors about the problems they met when doing synthetic biological experiments. Of course, we analyzed what we investigated. What’s more, not only online research but we communicated with different teams face to face for their opinions and their needs for a new biobrick database. Also, we consulted a lawyer for the rights of using other databases in case we violated some regulations.
Questionnaires and Analysis
Before the start of our project, we need to know clearly what problems we are facing and what our users’ needs are. Only in this way will we"

Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

A few more people went on holiday and a few came back. Tom ran the gel for the lux-mOrange halves and nothing came out- he discovered that a few fragments we got out during the hectic Thursday and Friday are not of the right size, which might explain why our things are not working. That includes one part of the Ratiometrica vector backbone (vecB), and one part of the lux-mOrange backbone (vecA1). He re-PCRed these using touch-down PCR, and some of it seems to work now so we should start our Gibson again soon...

Surface antigen density heterogeneity model
Although antigen density heterogeneity has been reported, it has been considered as an obstacle to improve cellular immunotherapy for tumor(1), rather than an opportunity to employ diverse and/or combined treatment. To demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing antigen density heterogeneity, we first established a cell model that is able to stably express different antigen densities on cell surface. We chose surface-expressed EGFP (surEGFP) as representative antigen due to the convenience of detecting, quantifying and observing (Figure 1A) .
After viral infection, K562-surEGFP cells were observed by microscopy. Image shows that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane has strong fluorescence, while the plasma membrane has relative weak signal. It consists with the process that surEGFP is expressed, translocated and matured inside ER lumen with its transmembrane embed in the ER membrane, and later surEGFP is transported and exposed to culture media when fluorescence declines due to oxidation in the extracellular environment. Thus, surEGFP was successfully located to cell membrane (Figure 1B) . We sorted stable cell lines depending on EGFP fluorescence intensities (Figure 1C , S1A) . The FACS gate set in FSC-SSC channel was relatively narrow to ensure we can get a group of cells with homogeneous size, to exclude the possibility that the heterogeneous expression of EGFP was due to different cell surface area (Figure S1B, C) . We confirm the FASC-ed cell clines with different EGFP expression by Western blotting using an anti-EGFP antibody (Figure 1D) . The bands clearly show difference between low-, medium-, high-expression groups (Figure 1D) . We also characterized two HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) cell lines using an anti-GPC3 antibody. We confirmed that SMMC-7721 cells express no GPC3, while Huh-7 cells highly express GPC3 (Figure 1E) . These cell lines are our physiological surface antigen density heterogeneity model.

DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a macromolecule consisting of sugar, phosphate  and four different bases; Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine. These four bases are  found bound to each other in pairs; A-T and G-C. The DNA molecule is shaped like a double  helix, in which two phosphorous sugar backbones are held together by the base pairs, like  steps on a ladder. The sequence of the bases encodes genes, the specific cell and organism’s  characteristics, which can be inherited to the next generation.

One of the biggest reasons we chose Alzheimer’s Disease to work on is its impact on human life. From the start, we knew how important it is to focus on the human aspect of our work as much as the science.
Interviews: Doctors in the Field
More information here.
Having read multiple scientific articles on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we felt like we had a good grip on the current research. But we felt we were missing something. Our goal in part is to detect the disease, which involves working with doctors. So, we went and good feedback from them.
Dr. David Caplan                                                     Dr. Mark W. Albers
We had a long discussion with Dr. David Caplan (MD, PhD, Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School Neurologist, Massachusetts General Hospital) and Dr. Mark W. Albers (MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Assistant in Neurology, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital) on separate occasions. The conclusion we reached after both discussions was that the only methods available to detect Alzheimer’s Disease in patients were based entirely on subjective evaluations, and even if there was a reliable detection method for AD, there is currently no treatment available.
The insight we obtained led us to the decision to address the most prominent limitations in the fight against Alzheimer’s: the inability to properly diagnose and treat the disease.
Alzheimer’s Association Movie Screening: The Genius of Marian
Talking to Dr. Caplan and Dr. Albers about the patient experience was enlightening. But we wanted to experience it as close to first hand as possible. Even though we did not get the chance to interact with Alzheimer’s patients this summer, when we were presented the opportunity to watch a documentary on the life of a patient, we didn’t hesitate to take it.

In order to explain our project and idea in a more interesting and intuitive way, we designed our postcards containing our logo, QR code and brief slogan. We distributed them to those who were interested in our project, and they were also sent to Düsseldorf-Köln to take part in their postcard exchange campaign on behalf on Light Harvester. However, when we continued to carry out our collaboration with other teams, we found postcards far too simple to convey our principle but did better as souvenirs, which motivated us to design our brochures. The brochures, we can see, contained our project description, the theoretical support, our group members, significances of iGEM competition and other important information. In the process, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd, which is an outstanding company in the field of synthetic biology, showed great interest in our project. With the philosophy of serving the country by industries, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd thought it meaningful to carry out comprehensive study on energy crisis and try to find solutions by means of synthetic biology. After seeing our postcards and brochures, and subsequent discussions held between Light Harvester and the company, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd generously decided to give us assistance on material sponsorship. We are very grateful for what Syngen Tech Co., Ltd provided and hope that we can do better in our project and explore more potential of synthetic biology.

FRET ME RUN
As the main principle of our project, FRET is an interesting and useful theory. But it may be a bit obscure for undergraduates, especially those who don’t major in biology. Considering that spreading scientific knowledge to non-scientific people is another aim of iGEM, we came up with an innovation activity called FRET ME, aiming at making the concept of FRET easier to understand.

Investigative Report on Public Awareness of Nickel Pollution and Synthetic Biology
Introduction
Nickel is an essential life element of the human body. Nickel deficiency can cause diabetes, anemia, cirrhosis, uremia, renal failure, abnormalities in liver lipids and phospholipid metabolism. However, nickel is also the most common allergic metal. Nickel ions can penetrate into the skin through pores and sebaceous glands, causing skin irritation and inflammation. Worse， excessive nickel intake is poisonous . Ingestion of 250 mg of soluble nickel per day can cause poisoning. The most common symptoms are dermatitis, respiratory disorders and respiratory cancer. The survey shows that nickel content is positively correlated with the mortality of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and nickel may be one of the causative factors of leukemia. Nickel-containing wastewater can be produced in industries such as mining, metallurgy, machine building, chemicals, instrumentation, petrochemicals, textiles, steel mills, iron foundries, automotive and aircraft manufacturing, printing, ink, ceramics, and glass. But the existing methods of treatment are always unsatisfactory. So we created this project, trying to use our knowledge of synthetic biology to detect and remove nickel from water resources. Based on this, we would like to know the Chinese people's awareness of China's water pollution and heavy metal pollution, as well as their knowledge and acceptance of synthetic biology, in order to fully complete this project. Therefore, we designed a questionnaire, then analyzed the results in this report.

He ensured that enhancing the natural defenses of bees would have a positive response since healthy bees are a lot less susceptible to diseases.
He mentioned the Varroa mite as part of the named “colony collapse disorder”, baptized by this name in the US, and described it to be a phenomenon where bees leave their beehives. Perhaps he announced foulbrood are not a current problem in his state, Varroa is, so he recommends us to expand our horizons to consider our product as a product that can also be applied when there is the presence of Varroa.
“If the bees are strong they can’t get sick, but how will they be strong if there are not enough flowers?” He mentioned urbanization is a problem bees are facing directly, and they are dying because of it. As flowering and bee population lower, he went from collecting a bucket of honey per box to a bucket every 40 boxes.
He said the actual treatments for American foulbrood are formic acid, oxalic acid, thymol (thyme),  among  others  treatments  
that don’t pollute the environment. Previously, fluvalinates were used to treat this diseases, however, they stopped using them since they are carcinogenic and pollute the environment. The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (Spanish: SAGARPA) is the governmental institution responsible of inspecting their hives, it allows under certain requirements the use of antibiotics for treating foulbrood but has to avoid products that pollute the environment and honey. He also shared with us the treatment he uses to fight Varroa which consists in an essential oils mix and stressed it is important not to use the same treatment for a long time since the pathogen can develop a resistance towards it.
We asked him if he could share with us certain regulations or standards that had to be followed to ensure the honey’s quality,  he mentioned the ""Good livestock practices"".Discussing other issues affecting beekeeping in his state, another serious problem in Queretaro is bee theft, as beekeepers visit their bees every 8 or 15 days, they are the target for many people that take advantage of this situation.

Promote public awareness of HCC
While educating people about general synthetic biology is most explicitly expected by the competition, in practice we had to choose HCC as one of the starting topic in our conversation with the people outside the academic community. This topic not only could lead to more public awareness of this disease but also could serve as a wonderful example of how synthetic biology could be of benefit to modern medicine. Therefore, after the three approaches we wrote a booklet in dairy tongue.
We also engaged face to face with some cancer patients. We interacted with the largest cancer patient organizations in southeastern China----Rehabilitation Association of Nanjing CHINA. One of the cancer patients there has much benefitted from novel cancer therapy and got quite a legend to tell. He enlightened us about the specificity of cancer therapy and cheered us by confirming that in such sense our idea is indeed of great significance.

Microfluidics 101
One of the limitations we identified early on in our project was the lack of concise and clear information about microfluidics for researchers in Synthetic Biology. Using the iGEM poll we were able to confirm this suspicion and understand what the synbio community wanted us to design for them.
As a result, the first stage of MARS is increasing the understanding of microfluidics. Under this section we have included a brief introduction to microfluidics as a whole and an explanation of how our continuous flow devices function. A primitive guide has also been included so researchers can identify and understand the function of each element on their chips. This guide can also be used in conjunction with the software tool 3Duf in order to design your own chip, or to adapt and iterate on our designs in the MARS Repository.

Introduction to Microfluidics
What is Microfluidics?
Microfluidics is the manipulation of microliter volumes of liquid in order to perform scientific experiments. This is performed on devices called microfluidic chips that can be made of polycarbonate, glass or silicone.
What is a Microfluidic Chip?
A continuous flow microfluidic chip typically consists of three layers: a flow layer and control layer with a flexible layer of PDMS between them. There are many other types of microfluidics such as digital or paper which operate using different mechanisms, however we will focus on continuous flow chips as this is the type utilized by MARS.
Control Layer
Material: Polycarbonate
The Control layer of a microfluidic is used to actuate the flexible PDMS layer in order to manipulate fluid flow through the flow layer. For example, by actuating a syringe attached to the control layer, a valve can be opened.
PDMS Layer
Material: Polydimethylsiloxane
The PDMS layer of a microfluidic lies between the flow and control layers. This flexible membrane allows for a seal to be created between the two polycarbonate layers. PDMS can be actuated to manipulate fluid flow in valved designs.

Best Information Processing
We tried to recreate the story of “Snow White” using MazF (toxin) and MazE (antitoxin). This is the first example in which both the toxin and the antitoxin are introduced into a single cell in an iGEM competition. We experimentally confirmed that MazF inhibited translation through cleavage of mRNAs and MazE let translation “resuscitate” from this inhibition . Also, we theoretically confirmed the feasibility of a desired behavior by modeling .
Our system has expanded the regulation of protein expression to the mRNA level , while the conventional regulation has mainly targeted ribosome machinery. Furthermore, we succeeded in changing the inhibition efficiency by designing the DNA sequence without changing the protein sequence by our new software . Therefore, we made it possible to design more various systems by combining the mazEF system and a variety of inducible promoters. This improvement will greatly expand the possibilities of signal processing.

1. New cold induible promoter
Here we indicated that the cold inducible promoter is a promoter that depends mainly on temperature.We performed an experiment using BBa_K1949001 .

the RFU of GFP / Turbidity of the samples cultivated at 18°C was higher than those cultivated at 37°C.
In this experiment, each sample was cultivated at 18°C and 37°C, after that their RFU of GFP / Turbidity was measured.
From the results, we found that the RFU of GFP / Turbidity of the samples cultivated at 18°C was higher than those cultivated at 37°C.

XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the market od psicose is predicted. According to our project, another thing we would like to model is to predict the psicose market based on the survey we did in the human practice part. From the results of the survey, we can know that the different questions have different meanings behind the questions.
For different questions, we analyze every question in the questionnaire and we then define different indicators in the questionnaire. Some questions are ignored because they are not available to predict the marker scale. Eventually, after we select the proper questions, we define them as different indicators of the public tastes, which are used to predict the market.
The questions we choose are as follows:
Then for each respondents, the results can be described by a vector as follows $$Result_i=(Qs_{1(i)},Qs_{2(i)},Qs_{3(i)},Qs_{4(i)},Qs_{5(i)},Qs_{6(i)},Qs_{7(i)},Qs_{8(i)})$$ To describe whether the respondent is interested in psicose and tends to buy it, we set a evaluation function to evaluate the degree of intending to buy and taste psicose. Considering question 2,3,8, we think these 3 questions are negative to the purchase of psicose and we process them first before we calculate this three questions. $$Qs_{2(i)}^{'}=\frac{1}{ Qs_{2(i)}}, Qs_{3(i)}^{'}=\frac{1}{ Qs_{3(i)}}, Qs_{6(i)}^{'}=\frac{1}{ Qs_{6(i)}}$$  For the positive questions, which are beneficial for the choice of psicose, we consider the value of them are equal to the question results: $$Qs_{j(i)}^{'}= Qs_{2(i)},j=1,4,5,7,8$$ Then we can get the evaluation function for each respondent as follows: $$EvF(Result_i)=\sum_{j=1}^8 Qs_{j(i)}^{'}$$  The gender and the age range should also take into consideration. For a certain age range, we can get the average $EvF$ of this age group: $$\mu_{EvF} (AgeGroup)=\frac{1}{Result_i (AgeGroup)}\sum EvF[Result_i (AgeGroup)]$$ Where $AgeGroup$ is divided into 8 groups as the results of the survey.

We did activities related to our project, and we use the information we receive to improve our project. Generally, for Human Practices, we spare no effort on education, consultation and charity work. We devote to let more people involved and serve the society.

As a result, we pay attention to every opportunity that we can obtain to contact with people out of the lab.
Pupil & middle school students in rural areas in China
In summer 2016, some of our team members went to remote areas in Gansu and Sichuan Province in China for volunteer works. They taught primary and middle school students who cannot receive scientific and cultural education of good quality due to economic reasons. Considering interesting synthetic biology knowledge can bring happiness and inspiration to them, we briefly introduced what can be achieved by synthetic biology in an imaginative and creative way, including what is bacteria, plasmids and genes, and what we can manipulate on genes to generate something different. As a feedback, they drew pictures about what synthetic biology is in their mind.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.
Streamlined mass action model
We met with Thomas Ouldridge again after the previous model and he showed us how we could combine many steps of the reaction to slim our model down to just 4 parameters and 5 species, as well as giving us some more accurate parameters for our system.
With fewer parameters it was much easier to see the effect that varying each parameter has, and thus draw meaningful conclusions from the relationship between the parameters and GFP output.
Given the knowledge of the system that we had, it was reasonable to incorporate:
the GFP maturation into ktranslation
the opening of the toehold switch into the binding of the miRNA
We used mass action kinetics to model the decay of the RNAs and the opening of the toehold switch, however we modelled transcription and translation such that DNA and the open switches weren’t used up. We assumed the pool of resources was constant, as our construct would not significantly deplete the cell free extract’s resources. [6]
We also made the assumption that our inducible promoter could be modelled as a constitutive one. Given arabinose concentration is constant and the assumption that the time taken to induce the promoter was negligible, no changes to the way transcription was modelled were necessary, other than neglecting resource degradation. This was confirmed experimentally when we characterized part BBa_K808000 .
In this model we included a term for miRNA decay, assuming that it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in the system. This was on the recommendation of Thomas Ouldridge as the degradation of miRNA is not well documented in our cell free system.
As we were not confident in this assumption we tried running the model with different miRNA degradation rates and found that between 5×10-4 and 5×10-3 the amount of GFP produced in the positive case increased by a factor of 3. Outside of this range the difference was small. As our value is within this range the uncertainty introduced by the miRNA degradation rate was high. However, this did not affect the model's usefulness  in understanding the qualitative effect of varying the parameters as the miRNA degradation rate stretches the GFP against time graph horizontally. This changes the time our test takes, but not the final difference in GFP output.
As with our previous model we assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.
Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of"

Here we define a new parameter OxDroGFP2 to reflect the degree of oxidation of                     roGFP2.                     Meanwhile, facilitate subsequent calculations.
$$OxD_{roGFP2}=\frac{[roGFP2_{ox}]}{[roGFP2_{ox}]+[roGFP2_{red}]}$$
According to Hypothesis 3, we can correlate the redox state of roGFP2 with the fluorescence value                     measured by the macroscopic observables easily. To establish this relationship, several molecular                     quantities followed need to be defined. i405red, i405ox, i488red,                     and i488ox are the fluorescence                     intensities contributed by a single roGFP2 molecule at the indicated wavelength and redox state.                     Ntotal is the total number of roGFP2 molecules. Nred is the number of reduced                     roGFP2 molecules. Nox is the number of oxidized roGFP2 molecules. Based on the assumption that the overall fluorescence                     intensity is equal to the sum of the fluorescence intensities from the individual roGFP2 molecules,                     the relationships were given in Table 1.
Table 1. Relationships Between Fluorescence Intensities and Probe Molecules
Condition
Formula
Limiting condition 1:
Ntotal = Nred
I405red = Ntotal · i405red
Complete reduction
Nox = 0
I488red = Ntotal · i488red
Limiting condition 2:
Ntotal = Nox
I405ox = Ntotal · i405ox
Complete oxidation
Nred = 0
I488ox = Ntotal · i488ox
Actual measurement
Ntotal = Nred + Nox
I405 = Nox · i405ox + Nred · i405red
I488 = Nox · i488ox + Nred · i488red
By substituting the resulting equations (right column of Table 3) into OxDroGFP2=Nox/Ntotal,                     the                     relationship between OxDroGFP2 and the macroscopic observables can be deduced.[1]

Overnight Culture Protocol
Agar plates with required antibiotic were taken out of 4oC to warm to room temperature.
Cells or colonies were picked up from the source with a toothpick under sterile conditions.
5 ml of LB medium, supplemented with the required antibiotic, were inoculated with the toothpick.
Tubes were incubated at 37oC in a rotary incubator at 200rpm over night.
Close
×
Gel Extraction Protocol
The desired DNA fragment was excised from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
The gel slice was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube. 700 µl of Buffer QG was added.
The gel slice was incubated in a water bath at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). The tube was vortexed every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel.
After the gel slice had been dissolved completely, the color of the mixture was checked that it was yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture was orange or violet, 10 μl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0 would be added, and mixed. The color of the mixture would turn yellow.
230 µl of isopropanol was added to the sample and mixed.
A QIAquick spin column was placed in a 2 ml collection tube. The sample was applied to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
500 µl of QG buffer was added to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
750 µl of Buffer PE was added to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
The QIAprep spin column was spun for an additional minute to remove residual wash buffer.
The QIAprep spin column was placed in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge and the DNA eluted by adding 30 µl of H2O to the QIAprep spin column and centrifuging for 1 minute.

All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable
Smoking cessation is the most effective primary prevention for NSCLC [6] , as smoking is responsible for 90% of cases. [7] In the UK, the government has implemented numerous policies to reduce rates of smoking. These include heavily taxing tobacco, banning TV advertising and requiring cigarette packets to have “smoking kills” branding.
Rates of smoking are declining [8] , although they are still sufficiently high for lung cancer to remain as prevalent it is. Primary prevention to secondhand smoke has also been implemented as far as impossible - with smoking banned in enclosed workplaces, public buildings and on public transport. [9] However, no further measures can be taken to avoid exposure by going outside.
The other risk factors for cancer are less well known - as there are a myriad of carcinogens in the world we live in - the food standards agency works to minimize carcinogens in food, drugs and cosmetics, [10] while NICE ensures that medical radiation exposure is minimized.
The screening test should be simple, safe, precise and validated
As we are using a cell free system, our test is safe. Our test would comprise a blood test, followed by miRNA purification and fluorescence measurements which are all relatively simple. These steps do not require the expertise of radiologists that are needed for CT scans. However, for our test to be shown to be precise and validated, further characterisation is required with the miRNA biomarkers and validation with a large data set of patients.
There should be evidence that intervention at a pre-symptomatic stage leads to better outcomes
NSCLC is far easier to treat in its earlier stages. The same is true for almost all cancers, as once a cancer has metastasized it can only be treated palliatively. Early stage tumors can be surgically excised and treated adjuvantly with curative intent.
The test should be acceptable to the target population
From a patient’s perspective, our sensor would just be a blood test. As such there should not be any issues with it. We are using a cell free systems which is sterile and abiotic - there are no bacteria involved which could potentially give rise to objections.
There should be a policy on further diagnostic investigation of those with a positive test result.
There should be agreed policies covering which individuals should be offered interventions and what the the appropriate intervention offered is assurance standards
We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE"

Part 0 Construction of High-glutamate-yield B. amyloliquefaciens LL3
In order to get a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 strain for a higher glutamate yield, we edited the genome by constructing promoters in tandem to overexpress glutamate related genes, icd and gltAB, which are responsible for 2-ketoglutarate and glutamate, separately. Due to the difficulties of genome manipulation, we only succeeded in inserting Pc2up ahead of icd and get a high yield strain.
Part 1 Verification of PgltAB Responding with Glutamate and GltC
In Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3, there is a glt operon which is responsible for the intracellular glutamate synthesis. Since we need to use the regulatory role of glutamate and GltC to PgltAB, we need to verify the effect of promoter PgltAB under different glutamate concentrations. So we constructed pHT01-PgltAB-GFP and pHT01-P43-GFP 2 plasmids and transformed them into Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 icd strain. We fermented under different glutamate concentrations and tested the fluorescence intensity(FI) of GFP every 6 hours in M9 medium. For the strain transformed with pHT01-PgltAB-GFP, as the glutamate concentration goes up, the FI of GFP first went up and came down. On the other hand, for the strain transformed with pHT01-P43-GFP, FI is uncorrelated to the glutamate concentration.
Part 2 Verification of the Repression Effect of LacI to Pgrac
To make our circuit work, we need to test the inhibition effect to Pgrac which can respond to LacI protein at different lacI expression levels. So we expected to construct vectors pHT01-LacI-Pdifferent-Pgrac-TetA.
Part 3 Constrction of the Whole PopQC System and Functional Test
Our project is aiming to construct a PopQC system in a single plasmid. So we construct the vector pHT01-LacI-PgltAB-Pgrac-TetA and ferment to"

Delving into the problem of bTB in the UK is not something that we as a team took lightly. bTB is a challenging disease that is hard to treat, easily transmitted and currently illegal to vaccinate against. Put these three factors together with the highly complex social, political and economical situation the UK faces with eradicating TB, it is clear that bTB is a National problem that needs a solution.
Extremely early into our project we began to appreciate this. Therefore we agreed that during our project we wanted to make people more aware of the challenges farmers, vets and local communities face when dealing with bTB.
Establishing relationships with various experts early on was extremely important. Not only have these relationships shaped certain areas of our project but also gave us an unprecedented look into the issue of bTB in the UK. In the beginning these experts allowed us to understand everything to do with bTB in the field and as our project has developed we have been able to integrate their experiences, suggestions and feedback into the science we are doing in the lab.
Our Beyond the Bench became as much of a lesson for us as a team as it did have an impact on our Ribonostics project. Vets, farmers, politicians, the NFU and DEFRA are just to name a few of the people/organisations highly involved with our project.
What challenges does the UK face to eradicate Bovine TB?
This is the question that we as a team decided to ask. Not only does this question have many aspects, we believe it is the question that is best able to have a direct impact on the work we are doing. The timeline below shows a breakdown of how we decided to tackle this highly important question and how what we learnt helped shape our Ribonostic work...

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

Panel Debate at the World Schools Debating Championships
On the 21st of August, 2011, the St Andrews iGEM team collaborated with the Dundee iGEM Team and John Urch of Revealing Research Dundee to organise a synthetic biology panel debate at the World Schools Debating Championships in Dundee. The World Schools Debating Championships (WSDC) is a celebrated debating competition between high school students of various cultures and academic backgrounds, which has been taking place annually since 1988. Previous participants of the competition have included Tony Blair.
The concept of running this debate was to form a platform for discussion between future scientists and future world leaders.  The students at WSDC are some of the brightest and best from their countries all around the world, so we viewed this as a perfect opportunity to inform them about this up-and-coming area of biology and discuss its implications.  This would not only benefit us by receiving an international perspective from young leaders of the future, but would also give them an educated opinion about synthetic biology upon which they could base decisions and future reading in their careers.
Our preliminary idea was to conduct a panel debate which would inform students about synthetic biology and would inspire a healthy discussion concerning the various ethical issues and opinions associated with the subject.  St Andrews and Dundee had a few meetings prior to the event where the programme of the presentation and the division of responsibilities were discussed. It was decided that the Dundee iGEM team would talk about the positive aspects of synthetic biology, while the St Andrews iGEM team would discuss the negative aspects of synthetic biology. After the presentation, both iGEM teams and their advisors would form a panel to address questions raised by audience members, in order to encourage independent thought and internal discussion amongst the audience.
Our Arguments
The Dundee iGEM team began the discussion by introducing the concept of synthetic biology and discussing their iGEM project. They explained the basic principles of iGEM, the concept of a biobrick, and how it affects the activities of the overall cell.  They began their discussion of the benefits of synthetic biology by introducing the role particular biobrick sequences could play in the treatment of"

Undergraduates from Tsinghua University have great enthusiasm for laboratory researches. However, such opportunities are limited.  Taking part in the iGEM competition is a great chance for undergraduates to experience laboratory research.  iGEM Tsinghua-D Team wishes such benefit could be shared by more undergraduates.  Inspired by this idea, iGEM Tsinghua-D Team came up with a new way of conducting human practice.  Freshmen workshop and iGEM Tsinghua-D open house were held to give undergraduates opportunity to experience laboratory research.
 
Freshmen workshop
Four freshmen were accepted as temporary members of our team.  Trainings on basic experimental specifications and lectures on fundamental experimental principle were given during the first couples of weeks.  Then, tasks related to our project were distributed and the freshmen completed their assignment independently.
iGEM Tsinghua-D open house
During the open house, lecture was given to undergraduates from various departments to take a snapshot of synthetic biology.  Members of iGEM Tsinghua-D Team gave a brief introduction of epoch-making events of synthetic biology.  A visit to laboratories where we conduct our project was than arranged for undergraduates.  iGEM Tsinghua-D Team hope undergraduates could  have some knowledge of synthetic biology and experience laboratory research.

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consists of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help of our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most of our time. We learned, grew and bonded together over the (mostly) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people with whom we celebrated when things went right, and who propped us up when things were less than right. We wanted you to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knows, maybe we might end up doing research together in the future!

A more technical and historical explanation of HGT
Fred Griffith discovered Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) in 1928 when he reported the transfer of genetic material from heart-killed virulent Streptococcus pneumoniae to an avirulent form of the bacterium by a process he described as transformation (Bushman, 2002).
Much later, in 1946, other forms of HGT, such as conjugation and transduction were discovered.
In 1980, the terms “horizontal gene transfer” and “lateral gene transfer” appeared (Gogarten et al, 2002; Kooning et al, 2001; Ochman et al, 2000; Syvanen, 1994), to designate all form of gene exchange that occurs between organisms in nature without recourse to reproduction [26].
Transformation is the uptake of free DNA by competent bacteria. Competence is a physiological state, often highly dependent of the environment, which enables bacteria to uptake macromolecules that bind to its surface. It does not require a close contact between bacteria and the free DNA usually comes from long dead ones. In the presence of homologies, there can be recombination and integration of the free DNA into the bacterial genome. This can give the bacteria a new function, or disrupt an already existing one, depending on where the insertion takes place.
Mechanisms of HGT
Conjugation consists in gene transfer by the means of plasmids and conjugative pili.
It requires a close contact between bacteria. It occurs primarily between closely-related strains or species, although it can occur between distantly-related species. The donor needs to possess the capacity to create conjugative pili, a capacity not shared by all bacteria. Conjugation is very wide spread between bacteria and is the most important mechanisms for translocating DNA between bacteria (Espinose-Urgel, 2004; Grohmann et al, 2003). In addition, conjugation is also used by certain phytopatogen such as Agrobacterium to insert DNA into plants cells as part of the infectious process [1]
Schematic drawing of bacterial conjugation
Transduction: gene transfer mediated by a bacteriophage, that is by a virus that is specific to bacteria [2]
HGT plays a key part in bacterial evolution and has enabled bacterial populations to occupy entirely new niches (Burrus and Waldor, 2004). For example, under an intense selection pressure due to wide use of antibiotics, multi resistant plasmid"

Overview
In order for MAGE (Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering) to work at a high efficiency, a strain with inserted recombinase and inhibited or knocked out mismatch repair gene has to be used [1]. In our project, two different recombinases were used: a recombination protein Beta from the E. coli phage Lambda, which was codon optimized for B. subtilis 168, and GP35, a recombinase from the B.subtilis phage SPP1 [2]. The mismatch repair proteins known as MutS and MutL were knocked out by transforming pSB1C3_recombinase plasmid into the B. subtilis W168. Since the MutL protein is dependent on the binding of MutS, the knockout of the mutS disables the function of the MutL protein [3].
Four Bacillus subtilis strains which expressed a recombinase were created by genetically engineering the wild type strain 168:
∆amyE::beta-neoR
∆amyE::GP35-neoR
∆mutS::beta-neoR
∆mutS::GP35-neoR
For proof of concept we decided to make a single protein substitution in the ribosomal S12 protein in B. subtilis results in resistance to the antibiotic streptomycin. The required change is a lysine to arginine substitution at position 56 of the protein. The S12 subunit is coded by the rpsL gene [4]. An oligo that could integrate this change was"
SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Science Studies_-_-_TEXT.html," world: Relations of Ideas and Matters of fact. Relations of ideas are before our experiences (a priori) as opposed to Matters of fact that are a posteriori (after experience). Since our experience is limited, matters of fact will never be certain – because it isn’t a priori. The problem of induction is that we try to generalize from matters of fact to relations of ideas: from uncertain and limited experience to certain a priori ideas.
Our habits make us draw causal inferences: when I have observed several times that when I drop a stone from midair it falls to the ground – then I start to expect it to happen again and again. I say that it must be so – I state something about the future based on my past, instead of basing it on a priori knowledge. But when shown in formal logic, it seems clear that it isn’t a valid judgement:
All Fx observed have also been Gx
a is a F
From (1) and (2) it doesn’t follow with certainty that a is a G. There is, for Hume to see, no way of knowing that it will always happen, since we cannot see the causal connection – we can only observe the constant conjunction of dropping the stone and its falling.
The problem of induction is then that science extrapolates a priori truths from limited observations. There is no clear and logical reason for this to be acceptable as a general law VICKERS, J. 2016. The Problem of Induction. In:ZALTA, E. N. (ed.). Standford Encycplodia of Philosophy: Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Standford University. .
Scientific reproduction
As conclusion we have a clear lack of absolute certainty in the natural sciences. Both because of the Humean problem of induction but mostly due to common errors and lack of understanding of the causal relations between objects. The lack of proof calls for more confirmation. In praxis this is partly solved by reproduction.
Scientific reproduction is a virtue of good science. For a theory to commit to it, it needs to be explained well enough so that another scientist can do the same experiments. The protocols need to be clear and all different results should be taken into consideration.
This is also relevant when discussing the Precautionary Principle. There we see the same problem - there doesn’t seem to be anything in natural science that can be known with absolute certainty and the consequences of a hypothesis can therefore never be fully anticipated. The decisions have to be made on an uncertain foundation, and which decision to take seems to"
Colombia,2014,Team:Colombia#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," the parameters and now the goal is to do  the Sensitivity Analysis.
Moreover, we are going to participate in a science fair in Maloka in early October.  Finally, all the team decided to collaborate with Paris Bettencourt team doing the experiment they proposed to us.
September 10th
Laboratory: We transformed some parts and it seems that the procedure has worked, but when we confirmed with digestions and we obtained really strange bands so we are going to try chimio-competent cells.
Mathematical Models: We did Sensitivity analysis focusing in the parameter than can be changed in the lab. We obtained very interesting results.
On the other hand, we were talking about ideas for the video we are going to put in the Wiki.
September 24th
Laboratory: The Pqrr-mRFP part, which is made with a linearized plasmid, we obtain white colonies. We have primers that works with mRFP and we tried Colony PCR but any colony grew, so there is no insert. It is strange because the pellet is blue and when we do the Mini Prep also is blue, as it should be, but digestions didn’t work. Wiki. We are going to put all we have in these two weeks.
October 1st
Laboratory: Report  of the parts we have. We still have problems with Pqrr part, the only part we need to complete our construct. Interlab: We sent the parts we have and also discuss the fluorometer’s results.
Human Practices: We were planning all the activities for the Maloka event. Also, we have received only a few results from other iGEMers that are participating in the Low Budget Competition. Therefore, we decided to extend the deadline for the results.
Mathematical Models:  We want to do a code in Matlab that works for all the iGem teams’ parameters. The goal is only change a few things in the code for the parameter you want to resolve :) !

In light of the growing energy crisis, much research has been devoted to finding economical means of producing renewable fuels. Traditional methods for obtaining biofuels have relied mainly on the fermentation of agricultural crops. However, there are a number of problems with this approach: the reduction in land available for food production"

Plasmid-isolation of the three positive CBDcex(T7) -plasmids and digestion showed not the correct fragments. Plated some more positive colonies on selection-agar for plasmid-isolation.
The CBDcex(T7)+GFP_His -dish had only nine colonies and a colony-PCR showed that none of them had the right insert.
Team Activity Tests:
Again our skills in measuring laccase activity were in demand today. We had a job incoming from Team Substrate Analytic. Since they need to dissolve their substrates in methanol or acetonitrile, they were curious about laccase activity related to these solvents. And they infected us with their curiosity! So we started measurements using 0.1 U TVEL0 Laccase, 40 µL sodium acetate buffer and different amounts of MeOH or acetonitrile respectively, ad 200 µL H2O. Our tested range went from 2 µL to 18 µL. The results show that MeOH and acetonitril have an impact on the ability of TVEL0 to oxidize ABTS. Using 16 µL MeOH (which means 8% of the amount of the sample contained MeOH) led to a different saturation curve as usual. The saturation couldn't be reached any more (see Fig. 1). Acetonitrile had a noticeable impact when using 5% (14 µL) of it in relation to the sample (see Fig. 2). But in the end both solvents couldn't stop TVEL0 laccase from being active. We are happy to tell Team Substrate Analytics that they can proceed as planned and dissolve the substrates in the tested solvents.
Figure 1: TVEL0 activity measured using 0.1 mM ABTS at 25°C over a time period of 5 minutes in presence of different MeOH concentrations (n=4)

There are two promoter sites on the marO operator, and both of them can be bound by a kind of regulatory protein called MarR, which is coded by MarR and can repress the expression of marO(Fig 2b and Fig 2c)[2]. MarR is a very special and vital transcription factor, which can bound to either of marO's two promoter sites rs1 and rs2(rs means repressor binding site)."

We're hoping to make it easy and intuitive to use. We'd like it to be searchable, colorful, and to contain as many 3D things as possible. A goal of ours is to show information about each element in the 3D space instead of on a GUI and to have all the elements interact with zMol so we can accurately allow users to create covalent bonds. We presented to BU and they liked playing with the sample programs on the zSpace, but our program didn't seem to interest them much.
June 28
The last two weeks we've been under a lot of pressure to get things working in zMol. Orit decided that we should try to submit a poster presentation for UIST, which is a really prestigious conference in Scotland. We tried really hard to get as many features in as possible, but the haptic feedback wasn't working like we thought they should. We'd created a search function, double bonding was getting better and our program didn't crash nearly as much but it wasn't good enough without the haptics. We were a bit disappointed at not getting to submit the paper, but it's okay. With the help from Barton, or ""the zSpace Guy"", we tried to get both of the zSpaces we have compatible with each other and with the latest versions of the zSpace packages. We thought it went well and we had a new version of zMol up and running but we still have loads of problems with it. The haptics still don't work and zSpace's support is... non-existent. It's a bit frustrating that no matter how much work we put in, a lot of the problems fall with zSpace and we can't get any support to make it better. Hopefully zSpace will develop some support or get it together soon.
Here's what the periodic table ultimately looks like.
And here's the final version of zMol (for now)!

Last week was the 4th of July! My brother and neighbor came to visit me so they occupied my week. We started working on our newest project, zTree. The idea behind zTree is to allow tree structured data to be represented in a 3D interactive way. We struggled a lot this week just to get the zSpace packages working in Unity.. and failed. After spending so much time on just that, Orit finally told us to give up on the zSpace aspects of the project for now, and just focus on functionality. We got cards to spawn in"
Harvard_BioDesign,2016,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," not only hazardous to marine life though - plastics have potential consequences for humans too! Rochman et al. (2015)3 studied fish from public markets in Makassar, Indonesia and found that 28% of fish contained plastic particles. One type of plastic, in particular, is a source of significant concern: microplastics.
Narrowing our scope: microplastics and the difficulty of detection
“Microplastics” was a term first coined by Richard C. Thompson of Plymouth University in the 2004 paper “Lost at Sea: Where is All the Plastic?” to refer to pieces of plastic less than 5mm across. Since then, the study of microplastics and their effect on the environment have been pursued by marine scientists. Because microplastics are small, they are easily ingested by marine organisms and have been linked to reproductive and growth issues in marine organisms1. Additionally, they are able to accumulate harmful chemicals such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), an insecticide banned by the U.S. in 19724.
Even with the current state of the art in ocean plastic distribution research, ocean microplastics are uniquely difficult to study. Traditional methods involve crews of ocean scientists dragging fine mesh nets alongside research vessels 1. This process is time, money and labor intensive, requiring specially outfitted vessels and particular expertise. Furthermore, manual plastic sampling makes it increasingly expensive to measure plastic density in remote areas because of the long voyage required to get there. These methods are also low resolution and low-throughput, providing only a few sample locations that are limited to the track of the research cruise. Additionally, traditional sampling methods can fail to detect microplastics because they might be smaller than the mesh net size or difficult to count by eye. Indeed, some microplastics are so small that they can only be viewed under a microscope 1.
These limitations to the current technology for ocean plastic mapping hinder progress towards a complete understanding of how ocean plastic is affecting human and environmental health. With the amount of plastic in the ocean increasing each year, it is urgent that we develop improved plastic detection technologies before it’s too late.
Our solution: Plastiback
Plastiback is our solution to gaps in ocean plastic research technology. Using the power of synthetic biology, we have harnessed the natural ability of a microbe called Ideonella Sakaiensis to degrade PET and engineered it into a PET detection device. First, Plastiback breaks down PET plastic into nontoxic constituent parts. Then, one of the products of the breakdown,"

Aix Marseille
     “No more gun on our streets” is the motto of Aix Marseille team. Acknowledging the problem of accumulation of chewing gum as the second urban pollutant on the streets of Europe. Beyond economical aspects and a rather negative visual impact, the accumulation of gum represents a real danger to the wildlife (such as birds), often choking to death. This issue motivated their team to create a synthetic-biology based solution that can degrade rubber polymers. No need to say this project is very similar to our own, and we were very happy to know that the idea of degrading rubber was driving another team! The basic mechanism behind their solution is indeed very similar to ours: in special, they also wanted to use Lcp enzyme to degrade rubber polymers. For this reason, we have been in contact with Aix Marseille team to share experiences and technical information.

Our team has improved two existing parts in our project. For all parts, please see our Parts Page. The first is the receptor for alpha factor, Ste2 ( BBa_I766204 ), used in our positive feedback component of our circuit. It was submitted to the Parts Registry by UCSF iGEM 2007, yet no sample of it currently exists for other teams to use. We contributed in two ways: (1) by submitting a sequence-verified version of Ste2 ( BBa_I766204 ) to the Registry and (2) by additionally improving the original gene by making it BioBrick compatible by creating a silent mutation to remove an internal PstI cutsite ( BBa_K1829007 ). Both contributions have been noted in the original part experience page. We also improved upon the characterization of the clustering proteins expressed by yeast mating display as developed by UCSF 2011, including mussel foot protein Mgfp-5 ( BBa_K197018 ), E-cadherin ( BBa_K644000 ), and hyphal wall protein1 Hwp1 ( BBa_K644001 ).

Northwestern,2012,Team:Northwestern#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". Our goal is to produce a probiotic that will release phytase into the body, thus increasing the bioavailability of iron. Since many communities that experience a high prevalence of iron deficiency already use fermented dairy products as part of their diet [5] , our strategy is designed to facilitate implementation in the field by incorporating our engineered probiotic into an existing and accepted cultural practice.
Execution
Engineering E. coli to produce phytase:
Many organisms produce different forms of phytase, including E. coli [7] [8] . Although E. coli natively produces phytase, our engineered probiotic concept requires producing the phytase at a higher-than-native level, and selective release of this enzyme into the extracellular environment. Different phytases from different organisms also produce different types of phytases, each of which varies in the rate at which it hydrolyzes phytate as a function of pH.
We sought to clone four different types of phytase from four different organisms: E. coli, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus subtilis, and Citrobacter braakii. Our aim was to create new synthetic biology parts by cloning each into a Biobrick standard backbone, including constructs in which each phytase is expressed from a constitutive promoter.
Method of protein release:
Our strategy is to engineer a probiotic that lyses and releases pre-synthesized phystase only when the probiotic is exposed to the acidic environment of the stomach (pH ~1.35-3.5), since release of iron from phytate in the stomach would enable optimal uptake of this now bioavailable iron. Although E. coli is commonly used for recombinant protein production, its secretion capabilities are finite, and we desire a system in which large quantities of phytase are released quickly before the probiotic and food exit the stomach. Thus, we decided to utilize inducible cell disruption to release pre-synthesized, intracellularly expressed phytase. In order to achieve rapid and conditional disruption via cell death, while ensuring minimal cell disruption prior to the induction of this death program, we decided to utilize bacterial cell lysis induced via intracellular expression of lytic proteins derived from a bacteriophage.
To meet this need, we utilized UC Berkeley’s Lysis Device part (from iGEM 2008), which is very well-characterized on their wiki here [9] . In this inducible lysis system, holin from bacteriophage T4 and lysozyme from bacteriophage T7 are used to produce aut"
Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicsReportPreface_-_-_TEXT.html," and perspectives. The CRI “call for participation” to IGEM has to be understood in that perspective of giving to students critical tools, understood as a wealth in the scientific approach.
Several effects and new questions will rise of that interdisciplinarity, reflexivity and critical perspectives. What are the effects of those institutional and disciplinary causes of the ethical questions? Why and how can we enlighten what is “new” in biological engineering and in the IGEM competition through ethical reflexion? As we will analyze it in the introduction, we will have to consider the ethical reflexion as necessary, once we have admitted the social responsibilities of science and scientists regarding the social effects of their theoretical and material production. Our work will be lead by another imperative of the ethical reflexion, in order to make it concrete and not to give up to that intellectual temptation to go through concepts and methods without actually “doing something” about it. That imperative is making that ethical reflexion “practical” and so, to see who, where and when the decision process is made and how we can operate on it. Beside our aim, a rapid check on the institutional literature about synthetic biology, such as (CRI), make us consider the fact that reflexion is shared between different kinds of actors of that scientific field, especially States, international organizations and national agencies. The ethical questions about synthetic biology are also and mainly about questioning the governance of the field. How, as a first step, will we manage the debate? Then, how will we supply the decision making? In other words, who is going to decide? Who, after putting stakes into light, will deal and manage the tensions linked to that stakes? That tension is inherent to what could be the definition of “scientific ethics” : the coexistence, the “harmony” between a free scientific research, both in theories and practices, and the social responsibilities of those scientific theories and practices. The necessity of the ethical question can now be seen as “viral”, once accepted, it leads us necessarily to the question of the governance, of the decision making, of the action and regulation, from now, each seen as something necessary too.

This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.

Carefully open the QIAamp Mini spin column and add 500 μl Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g; 14,000 rpm) for 3 min.
Place the QIAamp Mini spin column in a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (not provided) and discard the old collection tube with the filtrate. Centrifuge at full speed for 1 min.
This step helps to eliminate the chance of possible Buffer AW2 carryover.
Place the QIAamp Mini spin column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (not provided), and discard the collection tube containing the filtrate. Carefully open the QIAamp Mini spin column and add 60 μl Buffer AE or distilled (MilliQ) water. Incubate at room temperature (15"
Hong_Kong-CUHK,2012,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#SAFETY APPROACH_-_-_TEXT.html," application of cleaving the genome sequence of certain bacteria as selected, which can function as a novel approach to deal with the new safety issue in synthetic biology because by re-designing the segment of sequence for targeting, it can be used to target particular bacterial genome.
With synthetic biology, we can easily apply the system from one organism to another after characterizations. Therefore, by understanding the gene(s) required and the whole mechanism of this biosafety system, it can be engineered into other microorganisms, including the ones lacking native CRISPR system such as Bacillus subtilis. The modification can be done by substituting the promoter, copying the essential machineries from E. coli CRISPR system, and re-designing ‘spacer’ for certain target(s). Theoretically our biobrick can also function in B. subtilis as we choose to express the genes under the Pveg promoter (BBa_K143053), which is a constitutive promoter that works in both E. coli and B. subtilis. Through engineering the E. coli CRISPR/Cas3 system into certain bacteria as well as combining it with different sensors such as light and chemical ones, we may achieve at making a well-regulated system, which can serve as a flexible yet powerful tool for bacteria self-targeting.

Being the first iGEM Team of the University Stuttgart we are proud to say that we fulfilled all the requirements to gain the bronze medal!            We were able to submit our first biobrick to the iGEM registry and showed good lab results by prooving succesful activity of our enzymes.            We fulfilled the human practices criteria by talking to different experts, doing student counseling and by participating at different scientific conferences.            We collaborated with different iGEM Teams such as Tübingen, Cologne-Düsseldorf, Heidelberg and Canmore and we raised awarness of our project in the public.            We are excited for all the iGEM Teams Stuttgart that will step into our shoes and we wish great success with their future projects."

p cola part 2
by Sean
p cola DNA was extracted in several instances yesterday. Today we attempt to collect all of the DNA and precipitate it.
Protocol
Add equal parts plasmid DNA and ethanol 100% in a 1.5 microcentrifuge tube.
If total volume is V, then add V/5 of sodium acetate (initial concentration of NaAc is 3M; we want a final concentration of .3M). Numerical application: Total volume of p cola was 150μl. Hence 150 μl of ethanol 100% was added, as well as 30μl of NaAc 3M. Incubate at -20°C for 30 minutes. (5:20pm - 5:50pm in our case)

Conclusion
In this section we apply the tools made in the molecular toolbox section, for heterologous protein production in Y. lipolytica. This is done by combining two of our own BioBricks, a constitutive transcription factor alpha (TEF1) promoter native to Y. lipolytica ( BBa_K2117000 ) and the hrGFP gene ( BBa_K2117003 ) codon optimized by the algorithm developed by our team. By combining these two parts using A3 assembly and the cloning flow suggested in the molecular tools section, we created the device BBa_K2117005 . By confirming the production of hrGFP, we were able to prove that heterologous protein production is possible when our tool pSB1A8YL. Even though efforts to translate this into proinsulin production failed, the modular nature of pSB1A8YL means that it has potential to become a powerful tool when using Y. lipolytica for research or indsutrial purposes.

●
If the sequencing comes back clean tomorrow we will start 100 ml liquid cultures to perform protein extraction on on Friday
●
We also mini prepped the 10 liquid cultures we had started last night and will use these as biobricks and then the DT one to perform the CBD gibson on if the sequencing looks correct.
Thursday, 10/6
●
The sequencing data came back for the 9 constructs of chromoproteins+CBD+his-tags and for DT-His-tag and all the sequencing looks like we have the correct construct
●
Because of this we started 100 ml liquid cultures of all these CBD constructs and DT, BB, and VP plus his-tags . We will use these liquid cultures to run a protein extraction tomorrow afternoon.
Friday, 10/7
●
Moved the liquid cultures from the 37 °C incubator/shaker to the 25 °C incubator/shaker in the morning and plan to protein extract in the afternoon
●
We nano dropped our mini preps from Wednesday and then used the DT-his-tag mini prep to start a PCR with the CBD primers we had designed and ordered last week
●
We also ran a PCR of the CBD for SP and SO but we already had the CBD for DT ready
●
We then gel extracted DT and did a PCR clean up of the CBDs we saw minimal to no DNA present when nano dropped. We will re do the PCR of DT-his-tag and its gel extraction next week to hopefully Gibson in the CBD to DT, SO, and SP
●
We then ran a lumio green of the 9 CBD chromoprotens and the 1 his-tag chromoprotein to confirm the precesnse of a tag. We used 1.5ml from the large liquid cultures we had started to perform a small scale protein extraction and then the lumio green detection and ran this product on a page gel.
