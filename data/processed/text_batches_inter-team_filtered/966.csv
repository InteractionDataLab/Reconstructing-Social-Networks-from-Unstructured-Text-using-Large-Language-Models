Summary
The specific monitoring of small molecules in biochemical reactions is problem that scientist tried to solve since many years. In this project we developed small molecule sensor (SMS) enabling us to analyze biochemical reactions in real-time using a fluorescent readout. Our implemented JAWS software generates us the best ATP-binding Aptamer which is fused to the Spinach Aptamer. In presence of ATP fluorescence will be emitted. This tool enables the sensing of small molecules like ATP that are part of biochemical reactions.
Major Achievements:
Validation of the JAWS Software
Sensing of ATP concentrations in biochemical reactions
Establishment of a dual-fluorescent read-out system to sense small molecules in real-time
Detailed monitoring of the ATP consumption as well as RNA strand synthesis
Abstract
The specific monitoring of small molecules in biochemical reactions is problem that scientist tried to solve since many years. In this project we developed small molecule sensor (SMS) enabling us to analyze biochemical reactions in real-time using a fluorescent readout. Using this innovative method, we were able to analyze classical in vitro transcriptions in detail by monitoring the ATP consumption as well as RNA strand synthesis simultaneously. Using a Spinach RNA Aptamer fused to an ATP-binding Aptamer RNA we can specifically sense ATP concentrations in real-time. Our implemented JAWS software generates us the best ATP-binding Aptamer. Thus we can even detect small changes in the concentration of ATP during RNA synthesis. To validate the JAWS software as well as to show the general feasibility of our fluorescent tool-box system we analyzed transcription efficiencies of different RNA polymerases, the influence of the buffer as well as the effect of inhibitors like heparin on transcription.  Finally, the combination of the JAWS Software and the fluorescent readout enables the scientific community the possibility to target specifically any small molecule of interest in vivo and in vitro.
Introduction
Small molecules are known to regulate many cellular functions. Hence, the development of innovative techniques to analyze metabolic pathways became an important field in research. Those assays require a variety of tools allowing the user to detect small"

Strawberry DNA Extraction
While a strawberry DNA extraction is a typical classroom experiment for a beginner biology or lower-level science class, the iGEM team improved it to 1) streamline the timing of the experiment, and 2) reduce the mess-level that usually accompanies the filtration step of the experiment. We managed to get a messy 45-minute experiment to a mess-free 10-minute lab (in large classroom settings) using a syringe and cotton-ball. One surprising result was the abundant “purer” DNA yields due to the improved filtering method!
Future Impact: The iGEM-improved version of the strawberry DNA extraction has already reached multiple classrooms and science festivals for beta testing and will continue to do so thanks to DNAZone offering it as a kit for teachers to borrow. Under the guidance of the CMU iGEM team, 197 kids and teens performed this experiment, and 370 more are scheduled to by January 2015 (by us before official association with DNAZone). A Spanish version (translated by a CMU iGEMer) using local fruits in Bolivia is being implemented by a contact working at Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos International orphanage and with this: SynBio Educational Series has gone international!

Heavy Metals' Enrichment
overview
Our HPers have conducteded research in Shanxi Province. They found some factories directly choose to only deal with one main kind of the heavy metals, then abandon others. The convenient treatment obviously can't satisfy the environmental requirements. Hence, we demand a type of bacterium to handle two types of heavy metal ions together.
The genetic circuit based on the Vika-Vox system enables stepwise treatment, owing to a switch from the expression of Cup1 (copper accumulation) to LIMT (cadmium accumulation). We grow our yeasts and measure the concentration of heavy metal ions in the supernatant at equal intervals to test the efficiency of our system"
BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations#Blog1_-_-_TEXT.html," right, we definitely copied those definitions from the internet, but this post hopefully adds value to your internet-definition-reading-experience by providing a more in depth explanation of how all this stuff pertains to synthetic biology.
Essentially, a copyright proclaims a written or recorded piece of work (e.g. a scientific paper describing a researcher’s work) as the exclusive property of whoever wrote it.  In essence, you sign your name on the line next to “Author” and BAM, no one can take credit for or use your work in any way you don’t want them to. But here’s the catch: copyright only applies to expressive (creative), nonfunctional (has no functional purpose) work.  This generates problems when researchers wish to copyright DNA sequences or tools they have discovered as opposed to a scientific article.  Furthermore, the U.S. Copyright Statute does not discuss the products of synthetic biology as copyrightable material, meaning that a district court can only copyright synthetic biology products by comparing them to material mentioned in the statute, such as software. In essence, products of synthetic biology are extremely difficult to copyright because they are not explicitly mentioned in existing copyright legislation.
If copyrighting products of synthetic biology wasn’t difficult enough, protecting copyrighted work presents its own problems. To legally have the power to say “don’t use that” to a person infringing on your work, you must file your copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office as proof of your ownership of that work. Otherwise, if someone was using your copyrighted work, you could not sue for infringement. Fortunately, if you decide your synthetic biology product (in this case a scholarly article would work best) is suitable for copyright, registering your work with the U.S. Copyright Office is quite easy; there’s even a three-step WikiHow.  Clearly, copyright works best for the written products of synthetic biology, but not DNA parts.  For protection of genetic parts, cloning processes and other tools, synthetic biology relies on the second of our two definitions, the patent.
In essence, a patent works in a similar way to a copyright, but patents protect functional innovations rather than expressive written, visual or auditory works and are always licensed by the government. To apply for a utility patent, an innovator must prove that his/her innovation is functional and novel, as well as provide a detailed description of all aspects of the invention, instructions for how to make it, an informal drawing, an oath that they are the original inventor, and processing fees.  Right now, you may be wondering “why is the word ‘novel’ bolded?” to which the answer is"

Kill Switch Part
In the final part, we design a kill switch to control our system’s                                           hazards to the environment. Without galactose induction to the system, TFs will not been expressed and BI-1 will not been                                           induced. So the concentration of Bax is much higher than BI-1,                                           the yeast will die.

We are students of '''KIT'''-''Kyoto Institute of Technology''.
Our University KIT is one of the National Universities located in Matsugasaki Kyoto, Japan. Kyoto is a very famous city of Japan.It had been Japanese capital for over millenium, and its history has built up its unique, traditional culture.    KIT has ties with this traditional culture and industries in Kyoto and has been advancing knowledge in engineering, design, and textile science. By pursuing ‘human-friendly practical science,’ KIT and its two predecessors have been serving our society for over a century.   KIT has Drosophila Genetic Resource Center(DGRC). The DGRC collects Drosophila stocks from laboratories all over the world, maintains them, and provides them to researchers upon request. There are only three Drosophila resorce center in the world !  Drosophila is an essential model organism for life science research as a result of its long-term use in genetic research.  KIT has great achievements in this genetic field.  And, KIT has departments not only of science but also of arts. It is rare in Japanese national universities! So KIT has philosophy that we will develop an academic community, which aspires to the fusion of science and art cultivated from the foundation of KIT.  So it is no doubt that KIT is the best university to participate iGEM projects!    KIT encourages students to participate in internships, experience the realm where design and science converge and take part in projects with our partner universities abroad. KIT also promotes collaboration in business and research with industries. The close rapport maintained with area industries over the past 100 years has allowed us to continue to have our fingers on the pulse of Kyoto design and technology.   Finally, KIT financially supports our team.

Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Project#insertion of motifs into surface-exposed loops_-_-_TEXT.html," is 58-59 amino acids long, has alone a high affinity (Kd= 14,9 nM) for the antibodies and a three-helix bundle structure. In  [Braisted & Wells; 1996]  the authors reduced the secundary structure to an two-helix bundle. This size reduction has lead to an drastic reduction of the affinity for IgG (>10^5 fold) which could be recovered by 13 amino acid exchanges resulting in a 38 amino acid long peptide with an satisfying affinity for IgG (Kd = 185 nM) termed  Z38 . This binding domain was subsequently improved in  [Starovasnik et al.; 1997]  by the insertion of a disulfide bridge connecting the ends of the helices leading to the binding domain  Z34C  which shows an increased affinity for IgG (Kd = 20 nM).
 
Development of the Z34C motif, a miniaturized antibody binding motif
This engineered antibody binding domain of 34 amino acids was then inserted into capsids of different viral vectors amongst others also the AAV. In [Ried et al.; 2002]  the  Z34C  domain was inserted at position 587 into the capsid of the AAV resulting in viral vector that can be targeted to different target cells without genetic engineering. This targeting approach was then improved in  [Gigout et al.; 2005]  by the creation of mosaic vectors that contain only ~25% of recombinant VP-Proteins what resulted in 4 to 5 orders of magnitude more infectiosity compared to all-mutant viruses
Material and Methods:
Transfection of the AAV-293 producer cells was performed for three different loop insertions of Z34C in each three 10 cm petri dishes with 3.4x10^6 cells resulting in a confluence of about 70-80%. For the transfection, either the composite parts pCMV_VP123(453-Z34C), pCMV_VP123(587KO- Z34C) or pCMV_VP123(587Ko- Z34C-Spacer) were cotransfected with pHelper, [AAV2]-left-ITR_pCMV_betaglobin_mVenus_hGH_[AAV2]-right-ITR and RepVP123(587KO).

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," is challenging because of the political status of Congo: setting up and maintaining a functional health system is very difficult. This was also emphasized earlier during our talk with prof. Joseph Ndung'u. MSF negotiates with both the governmental military and rebel groups. They achieved building a hospital that acts as a base camp to prepare for fieldwork. It attracts the local population that now goes to this hospital instead of local government health centers. This hospital employs both foreign specialists and locals, in which the former educate the latter. The goal is to create an independent health system, run by experienced locals, without the interference of MSF. Furthermore, MSF also has to rely on the help of locals for the delivery of medicine and equipment in case their shipments cannot be delivered to the hospital due to dangerous situations caused by the country’s conflicts.
MSF outreach teams are active in screening for malaria in mosquitoes as well as in the population, but also by educating locals about the work they do. The latter is very important to gain the trust of the population and prevent miscommunications. The current rapid malaria diagnostics give a readout in 15 minutes. If positive, the patient will be taken along to the MSF hospital. Introduction of a new diagnostic in countries such as Congo requires trust by the government, as they always need to give permission. Therefore, it is best to do this via established NGOs such as MSF. On the topic of diagnostics for diseases without a cure or treatment, Jeanine mentioned that these are still very important, as they give information about the diseases present in the area, as well as their role in preventing epidemics.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in E. coli and C. difficile.If this repression is successful the system will be used to repress the C. difficile toxin genes.
If toxin suppression in E. coli is successful, we plan to use E.coli DH5 alpha, E.coli Sexpress (A derivative of NEB Express containing the R factor R702) to conjugate E. coli containing asRNA or dCas9 vector into C. difficile SBRC 078 to test toxin suppression in the host organism. Given enough time, we plan to insert asRNA/dCas9 system into C. difficile bacteriophage phiSBRC as an ultimate test of our project efficacy.
Risks that could arise from experiments
In our project we use all the basic microbiology techniques and equipment which may possess risks of causing disease after long exposure or physical injuries. To ensure safety of all lab-based team members, specific training for each technique was given with all safety precautions explained. All team members could use Bunsen burner without burning themselves or others; bench centrifuges were handled properly due to aerosols production; SYBR Safe was handled in the designated area to minimise carcinogenic-related risks; sharp equipment was handled safely to prevent injuries, etc.        Throughout the work in the lab, all team members wore PPE at all times, with extra precautions taken when working in the lab.
The introduction of antibiotic-resistant genes into bacteria can pose a threat to risk groups if released. To minimise the risk and prevent the unwanted release, the safety protocols for handling and disposal of genetically-modified bacteria were followed at all times (e.g. putting waste in appropriate bins, autoclaving, washing hands after leaving the laboratory, etc).       Working in biosafety level 2 anaerobic cabinet can be challenging for someone with not much experience due to relatively hot environment and continuous limitation of movement. To minimise the risk of sudden loss of consciousness or other extreme situations, at least one other person was present during work in the cabinet. This was applied to all our work in the lab - team members worked at least in pairs to ensure maximum safety during experimental procedures. At least one supervisor was present in the lab at all times during lab work.       When working with phage, it is important to follow strict safety regulations as inappropriate handling may cause risk to both the person who carries out experiment as well as other people around him/her. People working with bacteriophage received proper safety training and were introduced to all specific rules.

3D printing is currently revolutionizing many industries such as biotechnology. Very recently, there have been considerations to arrange cells in defined 3D structures by printing. One of the largest obstacles for arranging cells in a 3D structure is that cells need up to one day to connect to each other and form a stable structure. In contrast, precise 3D printing of materials like plastic is possible because the liquid plastic sticks together and quickly hardens after printing. To connect the cells during the printing process like plastic, we are developing genetically modified cells that adhere to each other in the presence of two additional components (Appendix 4). We use a 3D printer to print the cells into the cavities of a culture plate. Since the cells and additional components are brought together while printing, the cells stick together directly after they are printed. Our technology bases on the biotin-streptavidin interaction, which is one of the strongest and fastest known reactions in biochemistry. Using this technology, our USP is, to produce cells in 3D structures at a quality level that is unprecedented with conventional 3D-printing technologies. Owing to this level of quality, the benefit of high information value that prevents further investment into failing drug candidates exceeds the costs of our product as a system for additional cell culture screening. Most of the companies that were interviewed stated that the genetic modification might be a problem for customers. Thus, we aim to introduce the genetic information for the component that mediates the connection only temporarily via messenger RNA, which does not integrate into the genome.
Fig. 2: Our technology provides instantaneous sticking of cells in order to precisely 3D print tissue.
At the moment, the technology is developed by a team of students that participate in the iGEM competition, hosted by the MIT in Boston (Massachusetts, USA). Several basic experiments on the principle of connecting two cells under the printing conditions have been performed successfully. A prototype consisting of a 96-well plate filled with cell culture medium and small printed pieces of plastic to represent the cell structure was created to visualize what our product will look like (Appendix 3). During the next months, the goal is to produce the first genetically modified cells and to show that the technology for assembling the cells works. We consulted the Office for Research and Innovation of the TU Munich to discuss the patentability of our project. A decision is under way to"

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Motivation_-_-_TEXT.html," transport, and pollutant transformation must be considered.  [2]
Our team decided to focus on VOCs for several reasons. VOCs are organic chemicals with a high vapor pressure (0.01kPA) at room temperature (293.15K = 20°C). Their high vapor pressure results from a low boiling point, which causes large numbers of molecules to evaporate from the liquid or sublimate from the solid form of the compound and enter the ambient air, a trait known as volatility. [1,6] Over the past ten years the average toluene concentration in the periphery of Paris was 6.1 µg/m3 with a maximum of 24 µg/m3 in traffic area. [2]
These primary pollutants originate from fuel evaporation, car traffic, industrial processes, heating systems in residential areas, domestic use of solvents and also from vegetation. They have a role in secondary particle and ozone formation [1] [6].
Although air pollution contains only 2% VOCs (see figure) [2], the impact of those pollutants on health and environment is major.
These pollutants are persistent in the environment, they bio-accumulate in living tissues and are able spread over long distances. Although their effect on human health are only partially known, scientists have demonstrated their systemic effects (hepatic, hematologic, immunologic), their toxicity on the reproductive systems, their genetic toxicity. VOCs are known to be carcinogenic.
Therefore, to protect populations and the environment against harmful pollutants, regulations were defined and air quality is supervised according to European directives [1]. At the European level, the 2008/50/CE directive of May 21st 2008, specifies air quality standards in Europe. This text was transposed into French law by decree n°2010-1250 of October 21st 2010 on air quality.  Specific directives are applied to VOCs, such as the European 2004/107/CE directive, dating from December 20th 1994, concerning VOC emission from fuel storage and fuel distribution in gas stations.
Even if pollutant concentrations are getting lower, their final concentrations do not respect the threshold of 5 μg/m3 defined by the law. The objective to reach for the annual mean concentration is 2 μg/m3.
What are the existing methods of air pollution monitoring ?
Pollutant diversity in air and water is so great that no single universal means of detection exists. The methods must be adapted to the pollutants and the environment in which the pollutant is present. Existing monitoring tools are classified into two"

Since we could not find a constitutive promoter BioBrick allow expression in mammalian cell, we amplified CMV promoter from pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech). To characterize this CMV promoter, we used CMV promoter – green fluorescent protein – polyadenylation sequence construct with pEGFP-N1 as positive control and GFP-PolyA in pSB1C3 as negative control. If the result shows that GFP is expressed and scatter around in cell, while negative control shows no GFP signal in cell, we can conclude that CMV is functioning.

[GATCATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTATTAACCGGTCAACGAATGGATCTTGGCGCG].
The MLS was cloned with RFC 25 Freiburg standard prefix and suffix to allow doing fusion protein with MLS, to allow trafficking of reporter into mitochondria.
Reporter
We use BBa_K648013, the GFP in Freiburg standard as a reporter for MLS, since it allow doing fusion protein by using RFC 25  assembly.

The contents of the beaker will be hot after autoclaving, therefore take necessary measures to prevent burns. After autoclaving, allow the media too cool to 55oC
After autoclaving, add 1.6 mL of sterile 1 M MgSO4 in sterile conditions. If it is added before autoclaving, the media will appear cloudy.
The broth can be stored in sterile conditions at room temperature, and should be good for a 3-4 months. Flame the lip of the bottle each time the media is used.
Part 3. Pouring the plates (if you are making agar plates)
While pouring the plates it is crucial to maintain a sterile environment. This should be done in WB303, in sterile conditions provided by a lit bunsen burner. Alternatively, can be done in 403 with an Ethanol burner
Note: While you are waiting for the autoclave, steps 1- 3 can be done in the meantime, in addition to the clean up from Part 1.
Sterilize the workspace with 70% EtOH before depositing your materials.
Obtain a stack/roll of empty plates. The plates should still be in their plastic sleeve/wrapping, as they should be sterile. Don't throw out the wrapping as it can be used to store the plates. It is essential that you minimize any chance of contaminating the plates. Make sure that you open the package at the top, and expose the plates as minimally as possible. Note that this protocol makes approximately 18 plates.
Once you take the plates out, store them on the lab bench and keep them upside down. Label the plates with King's B - your name – iGEM 2015 – date prepared
Make sure that the media has cooled down sufficiently before beginning. However, don't wait too long, as the media will start to settle at around 30C.
Take an empty plate and open it slightly. You do not need to open it all the way to pour the agar. When pouring the agar, pour until 2/3 of the plate has been covered, or approximately half of the plate has been filled when viewed from the side. Pour the agar slowly, to prevent the formation of bubbles. Swirl the plate in a circular motion to distribute the media evenly on the plate.
After pouring, set the plates to cool in stacks of 2 or 3, as this takes up less space. Don't stack the plates"

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," document these issues in the Registry?
how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
How could other teams learn from your experience?
We do not currently have any safety issues to document in the Registry. The BioBricks we have created are not expected to raise any safety issues. However, as mentioned above, if this changes we will take appropriate action.
Oversight
Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?
Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they?  Provide a link to them online if possible.
Biosafety is covered by Part 6 of the university's Health and Safety Policy. Extensive guidance is also available.
The rules are too extensive to be summarised here, but work must be legal and safe. To ensure this, a risk assessment must be carried out for any work.
Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns or changes that were made based on this review.
Yes, it is a legal requirement in the UK to have a Genetic Modification Safety Committee. Because of the amount of genetic modification going on in the university, each school of the university has at least one such committee.
The French lab has previously submitted risk assessments for projects involving cellulases, fluorescent proteins, and many other things; since the form of INP we use is not active, it too is covered. So, much of our work is covered by existing risk assessments.
However, we have submitted a new risk assessment form for our project anyway (since some aspects, such as phage work, are not covered by previous risk assessments).
This risk assessment includes information on:
the host species and strain to be genetically modified (E. coli JM109)
vectors to be used (pSB1C3 and related vectors, possibly also phagemid vectors)
the normal actions of the genes inserted (cellulose degradation, ice crystal formation, etc etc)
transformation procedure (calcium chloride based)
steps involved in the project (PCR, cloning, assembly)
potential harmful properties of organisms, genes, vectors, or systems (none in our case)
the likelihood of the work creating organisms that could survive and flourish in the wild (essentially nil)
the team members' levels of experience
A copy of the submitted form is available here . This was reviewed by the GM Safety Committee and we received their approval on the 18th of August. No attempt was made to activate the phage system before this time; only preliminary PCR work was done.

Ashlee performed a gradient PCR for the overlap containing the dCas9 system. Because it failed at 60 degree C annealing temperature, we want to test a range of annealing temperatures from 56 degrees C to 66 degrees C. In order to do a CBA of this overlap and the HMF system in Plasmid 2, we needed a long (90 bp) reverse primer, which could be causing our PCR issues. She transformed the ligation of Lambda Red Recombinase and the L6-dCas9 plasmid and plated it on Kan plates to grow overnight at 37 degrees C.

Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"FN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) or a RNA-guided engineered nuclease (RGEN) for their ability to target a specific sequence thanks to a specific proteic or nucleic sequence (for TALEN for instance, we speak about TALE code). We finally chose a CRISPR/Cas9 recognition system with an endonuclease deficient Cas9 (dCas9). For more information about CRISPR/Cas9 technology, click here . The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a recent tool for synthetic biology which has many applications, such as targeting specific DNA sequences. Nevertheless, our system allows a new application for the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We chose the dCas9 for three reasons:
simplicity: to target a DNA sequence, we only have to design a specific sgRNA, which takes about a week.
adaptability: the tool would be adaptable to target any sequence in the genome through the sgRNA sequence design.
specificity: the use of orthologous dCas9s allows a specific one by one sgRNA/dCas9 recognition by a specific PAM sequence for each pair (Ma, Hanhui et al. 2015).
Dimerization system
Our project aims at recognizing specific sequences on the genome and then inducing a spatial proximity. So once we chose a system allowing  DNA targeting, we had to choose a system which could dimerize the dCas9/sgRNA, in order to link these two dCas9/sgRNA when they happen to be close enough. We chose the FRB/FKBP12 dimerization system. This system allows a dimerization induced by rapamycin. To avoid any problem of rapamycin toxicity in E. coli, we decided to use an analog of rapamycin called rapalog (gratefully offered by Takara Clontech). We then used a FRB mutated protein sequence (FRB*) that is recognized by rapalog (Bayle and al, 2006).
Fluorescence system
For the visualization tool, we needed a fluorescence system to asses a spatial proximity induced by our system. We chose the tripartite split-GFP, which is divided into three different parts: two parts of twenty amino acids corresponding to the 10th and 11th beta-sheets and a third part corresponding to the other beta-sheets of the GFP. This solution avoids poor folding and/or self-assembly background fluorescence. Indeed, the different subunits do not have affinity for each other but can only assemble and emit fluorescence upon"
StanfordBrownSpelman,2014,Team:StanfordBrownSpelman#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," think it was a good idea to introduce drones as a tool to use for societal functions.  This indicated a window of opportunity for us to educate more and more people, starting with college students (who are potential creators and makers of our society) and reach other communities at large.
Q6: Interestingly, even though half of the respondents responded against the use of UAVs for civilian uses, 70% of the total respondents believed that UAVs could be beneficial to society. This could mean that people do believe in the technology of UAVs and its potential, but are afraid of its use in society. This fear could be due to uncertainty on the control of using UAVs and the fear about people's personal safety and privacy. However, if policies and regulations controlling the uses of UAVs were made transparent to the general public, more people would feel safer and more accepting towards the introduction of UAVs for civilian uses.

The original results of BLAST could not be directly used for database docking. In order to screen out the matching results with sufficient similarity, we developed a screening model based on the logistic regression classifier. We use a manually validated and tagged training set to train the model, and the accuracy of the triple-fold cross-validation of the classifier on the training set is about 98%.
The ROC curve reflects the performance of the classifier. The larger the area under the ROC curve (auc value), the better the classifier performance. We plot the ROC curve for this classifier and the auc(area under the ROC curve) value is up to 0.99 indicates that the classifier performs extremely well.
Fig.1.Roc curve and auc value
We performed a manual sampling test on the classification results of the classifier and found that the classification accuracy is very high.
We tested the effect of our prediction model with an independent validation set. In the E. coli Sigma70 promoter prediction, the sensitivity reached 89.1%, the specificity reached 95.2%, and the accuracy reached 92.2%. The performance in eukaryotes is as follows:

Results
Assembling a construct for recombinant expression of Nuc
The 3A assembly method is used to assemble a pSB1C3-T7-Nuc construct, where the nuclease BioBrick created by the UCL London iGEM team 2012 BBa_K729004 and the T7-promoter created by the Bielefeld Germany iGEM team 2011 BBa_K525998 are cut out from their original constructs and the backbone cut open, using appropriate restriction enzymes.
The ligation products are then first transformed into TOP10 for maximum transformation efficiency. The plasmid are extracted and transformed into BL21(DE3) for expression.
Digestion and Ligation, First to Third Attempt [❌]
Successful digestion of Nuc and backbone (pSB1K3) in the second attempt. Ligation with T7 from first assembly attempt on the other hand failed. The PCR analysis of the ligation showed contamination of bands corresponding to Esp, indicating a simple mistake in probably marking the tubes.
The third attempt showed successful digestion of backbone (pSB1K3). However, unsuccessful digestion of Nuc. Thus, ligation could not be performed. Since no obvious errors could be identified in either the first or the second attempt, the procedure was simply repeated without any changes.

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#talking_-_-_TEXT.html," (LVCSR) from 1977, and the Kyoto University of Japan has continued the work from 1999 to 2003.
In order to use Julius, it is necessary to create a language model and an acoustic model.  Julius adopts the acoustic models and the pronunctiation dictionaries from the HTK software, which is not opensource, but can be used and downloaded for its use and posterior generation of acoustic models.
Acoustic model
An acoustic model is a file which contains an statistical representation of each of the different sounds that form a word (phoneme).  Julius allows voice recognition through continuous dictation or by using a previously introduced grammar.  However, the use of continuous dictation carries a problem.  It requires an acoustic model trained with lots of voice files. As the amount of sound files containing voices and different texts increases, the ratio of good hits of the acoustic model will improve.  This implies several variations: the pronunciation of the person training the model, the dialect used, etc. Nowadays, Julius doesn't count with any model good enough for continuous dictation in English.
Due to the different problems presented by this kind of recognition, we chose the second option.  We designed a grammar using the Voxforce acoustic model based in Markov's Hidden Models. To do this, we need the following file:
-file .dict:a list of all the words that we want our culture to recognize and its corresponding decomposition into phonemes.
Acoustic Analysis
Acoustic models take the acoustic properties of the input signal.  They acquire a group of vectors of certain characteristics that will later be compared with a group of                 patterns that represent symbols of a phonetic alphabet and return the symbols which resembles them the most. This is the basis of the mathematical probabilistic                 process called Hidden Markov Model.  The acoustic analysis is based on the extraction of a vector similar to the input acoustic signal with the purpose of applying the                 theory of pattern recognition.                This vector is a parametric representation of the acoustic signal, containing the most relevant information and storing as compressed as possible.               In order to obtain a good group of vectors, the signal is pre-processed, reducing background noise and correlation.
HMM, Hidden Markov Model
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a simple and effective framework                 for modelling time-varying spectral vector sequences. As a consequence,                 almost all present day large vocabulary continuous speech                 recognition systems are based on HMMs.
The core of all speech recognition systems consists of a set                 of statistical models representing the various sounds of the language to                 be recognised. Since"

Measurement
CCA_San_Diego created a method for measuring the effective nature of PAH degradation by substituting the media’s standard carbon source for PAH compounds, therefore rendering the bacteria without an energy supply unless the pathway of PAH degradation succeeds and efficiently leads to the creation of two substrates: salicylate and phthalate (which supply carbon for the Krebs Cycle in E. coli). By doing this, growth curves can be effectively used to monitor the degradation efficiency and progression over time as bacterial colonies grow.
Figure 1. Time course biotransformation experiments using crude oil samples from Pennsylvania (PA), Saudi Arabia, and Ecuador, measuring absorbance at 600nm of E.coli BL21 recombinant cultures containing the fluorene and phenanthrene catabolic pathways or control vectors. MM=M9 minimal medium.
Results show growth in oil or isolated PAH is equivalent to easy to access carbon source (Glucose).
Carbon is the building block of organic molecules and makes up a large portion of the structures in life forms. Thus to grow and reproduce, a method of breaking down and accessing carbon is necessary. In this context, using a singular carbon source in a growth setup for bacteria allows us to isolate if the bacteria degrade and process complex hydrocarbons to form molecules capable of facilitating life and growth. This measurement technique is very useful in testing bioremediation projects that involve degradation
In our tests, Fluorene or Phenanthrene was used a singular carbon source. Since bacteria need some source of carbon to grow, they must be using the only carbon source present when growing. The growth curves indicate that the bacteria with the pathways inserted are growing at rates comparable with a common carbon source, Glucose. This means the bacteria are degrading the PAHs and consuming the substrate products.
Our methods are innovative, as they utilize normally harmful PAHs as sources of carbon to allow bacteria to undergo cellular respiration. In an ironic twist of fate, we used the growth of one organism to measure another compound’s degradation. Our methods are logical and apply basic processes of science to better the world around us.

A study has shown that MntH facilitates transport of Mn2+ in a time-, temperature-, proton-dependent manner.
To make metallothionein be taken into the BMC, we will fuse SmtA and fMT with PduP1-18 - a protein that is recognized and is taken into pdu BMC (propanediol-utilizing BMC).
We will integrate SmtA, MntH, fMT and Glpf into our metal ion collecting E.coli to collect cadmium and arsenic ions.

Our aim is to construct a vector with transporter under a constitutive promoter, and the metallothionein under a metal-sensitive promoter as shown on the diagram.

The cloned products were cut at EcoRI and SpeI and ligated to PSB1C3 vector which was also cut at EcoRI and SpeI.
 
2-3. Construct PduP1-18 fused to SmtA and fMT
We originally had PduP1-18 fused with GFP, so we carried out inverse PCR to amplify the part without GFP. We then cut the product at EcoRI and SpeI to add them to the vector containing metallothionein which were cut at EcoRI and XbaI.

BBa_K1362101
BBa_K1362101 is the corresponding C-terminal construct to BBa_K1362100. Upon coexpression or mixture of the N- and C-constructs protein splicing takes place and the N- and C-terminal proteins of interest are irreversibly assembled via a newly formed peptide bond.
This mechanism can be applied for a variety of different uses such as the activation of a protein through reconstitution of individually expressed split halves. See our split sfGFP experiment set a foundation that you guys can build on!
Sample Data Page for our favorite Parts.
Circularization Construct. BBa_K1362000
This part represents an easy way to circularize any protein. In a single step you can clone your protein in the split intein circularization construct. Exteins, RFC [i] standard overhangs and BsaI sites have to be added to the coding sequence of the protein to be circularized without start- and stop codons by PCR. By Golden Gate assembly, the mRFP selection marker has to be replaced with the protein insert.      If the distance of the ends of your protein of interest aren't close enough to connect them you will need a linker. BBa_K1362000 , the split intein circularization construct, includes a strong T7 RBS ( BBa_K1362090 ), we sent to the parts registry as well, and the split intein Npu DnaE. The T7 RBS derived from the T7 phage gene 10a (major capsid protein).
The resulting plasmid can be used to express the protein of interest with the obligatory linker and the N- and C-intein.
In an autocatalytic in vivo reaction, the circular protein is formed. To read more about the trans-splicing reaction visit our Intein Background page. If corresponding split inteins are added to both termini of a protein, the trans-splicing reaction results in a circular backbone.
Circular proteins offers many advantages. While conserving the functionality of their linear counterpart, circular proteins can be superior in terms of thermostability, resistance against chemical denaturation and protection from exopeptidases. Moreover, a circular backbone can improve in vivo stability of therapeutical proteins and peptides.

If we have fully developed our sub elements, we should be able to make Bacto-Aid and test its effect on wound healing. The next step would then be to develop methods for how we could scale our production of the sub elements up to the industrial scale.
Perspectives
We realized early on that there are many interesting applications for our chosen sub elements, and as we got to talk with different experts, we saw even more opportunities. On this page we have highlighted some of the most interesting applications, to give you a broader perspective of the true potential of each sub element. We have also included some of the high school students' ideas from the workshops. So take a look and be inspired to how Bacto-Aid’s sub elements can be integrated in your future.

Bacteriocins
The promising MIC results of the bacteriocins gives us the opportunity to use them as a supplement to traditional antibiotics, thus facing the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here is some of the ideas for their future applications.
Combination of traditional antibiotics with bacteriocins ( Top )
The bacteriocins could serve as a supplement to traditional antibiotics, since our purified bacteriocins are capable of inhibiting the growth of Methicillin Resistant S. aureus strains. It could also be hypothesized that a combination of traditional antibiotics with bacteriocins could elicit a synergistic effect towards resistant bacterial strains. This leaves us with the opportunity to shift the balance of resistance. This could prevent the evolution of antimicrobial resistance against traditional antibiotics Dan, Y., et al. (2012).

Today, science alienation is still a big problem that transcends borders. Japan suffers of a similar alienation that poses a barrier towards further advancement of science and technology. In biology, genetic modification epitomizes the magnitude of this problem among people who regard synthetic technologies and sciences as “something strange”, or “something dangerous” in general. Whereas genetically modified foods are sold on the counter, consumers don't pick or choose food with labels. This results from the scarcity or lack of information on genetic modification on the part of the general public. Since a more rapid advancement of the field of life sciences is expected in the near future leading to more complicated technologies, information and communication will also become critical.  Moreover, while we benefit from technology, this is increasingly becoming “a black box”. Unknown technology is not familiar any longer.
Accordingly, to let people in Japan and in the world know about more information of genetic modification, we tried activities below.
Introduction the class of bioart
2011/09/27～2011/09/29
In our college KIT, bioart was firstly introduced as a lecture with practical course called‘Fusion of Science and Art Ⅰ using our project last year, E. coli pen in this year. Undergraduate students who major not only biology but also various fields of science can take the lecture.
Students learned the mechanism that the ink of E. coli pen emits fluorescence and drew paintings on agar plates using E. coli inks. And they gave a presentation on their concept of bioart.
Furthermore, the bioart described in E.coli Pen will be carried by the textbook of the high school student.
We realize synthetic biology spreads out steadily.
This lecture helps various students to know synthetic biology and to feel familiar with genetic engineering. We expect that it will develop into global lecture and disseminate synthetic biology to the world from Japan like iGEM which was a practical course of bioengineering in MIT.
A briefing for high school students
At the open campus in August(2011/08/10)
We introduced iGEM and our activities. To make the lecture simple, we tried to avoid using technical terms.
Besides, we displayed model organisms genetically modified, for example, Drosophila and E.coli. Students could see Dros"

Scandinavian Meet-up
Uppsala University chose this year to host the first annual meeting of the iGEM teams in Scandinavia. The invited teams were, Chalmers University from Gothenburg, University of Copenhagen, our university and the university in Trondheim. We met the first weekend in September both to get to know each other better and to prepare us for Regional Jamboree. The trip was therefore both social and scientific. During the visit, we presented our projects to each other and gave feedback and criticism to help the other teams. Later we also had a visit from Herbert Boyer where we made our presentations for him, he asked us questions and helped us with our presentations.
The team from Uppsala had also planned some workshops so the teams could discuss methods and results to get a better understanding of what other teams had done in the various subjects. The subjects were: How to build your team?, Sponsoring, Keeping track of the lab & Human Practices.
See the pictures in our Photo Gallery! It was a great experience for us, and we have already decided to have next year’s annual meeting in Odense at University of Southern Denmark.

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", the only product formed is carbon dioxide. This demonstrates that our engineered E. coli cells can survive our pathway, because no toxic intermediates build up in excessive amounts. After a 10 day period, 0.2 moles of carbon dioxide are produced, corresponding to 0.2 moles of methane consumed. This value holds true for the Fructose pathway as well as the formate pathway.
After optimizing our pathway, we briefly analyzed the kinetic values of our enzymes to adjust the concentrations of FALDH, FDH, HPS, and PHI in response to the optimized pathway. These changes have no significance to our optimization. Ultimately we recommend that if MDH2 is expressed at 100%, sMMO should be expressed at 29.4%, FALDH should be expressed at 8.5%, FDH should be expressed at 22.6%, HPS should be expressed at 1.5%, and PHI should be expressed at 0.79%. This recommendation will be reflected in future work through the selection of promoters and ribosome binding sites that achieve these enzyme concentration ratios. If these ratios are followed, methanol concentration should reach equilibrium at 0.5 M, which, according to experimentation by Team Braunschweig, is viable.
If the ACT protein is expressed, 0.2 moles of methane (4.48 liters stp) will be digested by 1 liter of cell culture every 10 days. If the ACT protein is not expressed by the cells, there is a 20% reduction in efficiency, causing 0.16 moles of methane (3.6 liters stp) to be digested by 1 liter of cell culture every 10 days.** In terms of proportion of methane sequestered, we should be able to digest all methane bubbled through our solution as long as If methane gas is bubbled through at a concentration of 0.031%.

Risk Assessment Rubric
Based on our interviews, we found that many people would likely have concerns if our system were to be used for one of the applications that we explored, such as using them with zebra mussels or for gene therapies. We decided to design a risk assessment rubric for future iGEM teams and researchers to use if they are considering the use of protein nanocompartments for their project. This rubric was reviewed by Brigitte Cadieux, Jennifer Mihowich, and Melanie Sabourin of the Public Health Agency of Canada and their input was used to revise our initial draft. Check out our rubric here!
Environmental Counter-Measures
Invasive species are very difficult to combat and a debate exists on whether or not it is ethical to wipe out a species once it has established itself in the ecosystem regardless if it is of invasive nature or not. However, preventing them from establishing themselves in the ecosystem is a tactic that is being explored by many government entities. An example of this is boat inspection stations in Alberta for zebra mussels as a primary method of prevention. However, in time, this may not be enough and the development of secondary countermeasures is necessary for future prevention of the spread of invasive species. The introduction of invasive species to Canadian industries alone costs an estimated $30 billion annually , and the introduction of zebra and quagga mussels to Alberta ecosystems is estimated to cost $75 million to the agricultural sector annually [11,12].
Since the introduction of invasive Dresseinia spp. mussels into Canada, the Alberta government has been exploring many secondary preventative measures including the use of potash (potassium chloride) at high and lethal concentrations"
UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," the other set were 100% homologous. This will act as a control, to signify how the expression will differ when inhibition is occurring. It will also serve later to increase the pool of possible expression patterns when we come to the random ligation experiments. These were cloned using traditional type II restriction cloning with BsaI sites.
To construct the sgRNAs, primer dimers were PCR amplified to generate the initial fragments of the sgRNA, it’s promoter, and terminator; also with their complimentary BsaI sites. After digestion with BsaI, the fragments were linearly ligated to produce promoter-sgRNA-terminator ‘bricks’. These were then amplified using a set of ‘universal’ primers designed to be capable of amplifying all of our ‘bricks’, these primers were complementary to a multiple cloning site (MCS) flanking each brick we produced. These sgRNA bricks were then digested with this MCS and ligated into their associated high copy backbone.
Results
For the CRISPRi results check step 6 and the lab-book for more in detail descriptions of the prodution of the gRNA and gel images.
STEP 2: Create Reporter Plasmid
Why
To create a stepwise and logical order of production, a reporter plasmid was constructed firstly, out of only various promoter types, mRFP and terminators, to allow for testing. This was then escalated to include dCas9 for the final experiment.
How
Each individual Promoter-Reporter-Terminator brick contains interchangeable parts. The three parts are linked together with Bsa1 sites so that there is no preference for any part when ligating together. This allows randomness to be added later. This method is used also for the construction of Promoter-gRNA-Terminator bricks so that this could be randomised in the future. The bricks are then flanked by a prefix and suffix, and these are flanked by restriction sites ABCD on either end. Digestion of bricks with A+B, B+C, and C+D allows any brick to be placed in any position within the plasmid but it would be pre-determined. This means that the no one promoter-reporter-terminator brick would be limited to one specific place in the plasmid, which allows another level of randomness in assembly as we would not know which reporter was being placed where, which could also affect expression levels.
The arrangement of the DCBA restriction system means that any brick can be placed in any position in the plasmid which allows expansion of possibilities whilst maintaining randomness of insertion"

Results
All molecular dynamics steps were performed on these enzymes. Every simulation was performed 200 ns except PLE which was only simulated 165 ns in case of bigger size and therefore higher computing needs. For stability analysis, the root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) were measured with the implemented tool in Gromacs [1] . RMSD can give an insight whether the protein is unfolding during simulation or is stable at the system parameters. The average distance between the protein backbone during simulation and a reference structure is calculated for every time step. As reference, the structure after equilibration is used. An increase of RMSD during time means the protein is unfolding. Radius of gyration and SASA usually increase in the same way when the protein unfolds when more of the protein’s surface is accessible for solvent molecules.
The result of the simulation for CALB with dirhamnolipid and a chitosan pentamer preplaced in the active site is shown in movie 1. For visualization purpose, solvent molecules are hidden. On top of that, we measured the distance during simulation between the two substrates and a catalytic important amino acid residue of the proteins. For CALB, Ser 105 was chosen since it is part of the active site by forming an ester bond with the carboxy group of dirhamnolipid. For PLE and FSC, the corresponding Serines were used since they share the same mechanism. These results are described in the following.
RMSD
The root mean square deviation of CALB (Figure 3, A) indicates that the system is well equilibrated after about 30 ns when no change of RMSD occurs anymore. From this point on, RMSD stays constant at around 1.8 nm. For PLE (Figure 3, B), only a slight increase of RMSD is visible during simulation. With a value around 0.25, it is slightly bigger than the RMSD for CALB but still seems to be stable in the setup. For FSC (Figure 3, C), RMSD value is the lowest of all enzymes with values around 0.125 nm over time. These results are supported by radius of gyration and SASA measurements (data not shown) which do not increase for all three enzymes. Overall, it can be assumed that all simulations ran properly, and system setup was in a range where the protein is stable and therefore catalytic activity can be assumed.

Peking,2012,Team:Peking#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," senders"" and those bearing the Luminesensor as ""light receiver"", we successfully demonstrated, for the first time ever, that light communication between cells could be achieved beyond direct physical contact (see video in Results). Through measuring the dynamics of light communication, it was proved that bioluminescence was sufficient to trigger the response of the Luminesensor (data in Results ).
Figure 3. The concept of cell-cell communication through light.
Our Light-Off system could be upgraded into Light-On system through simple design (details in Design ), which enables us to achieve more flexible cell-cell light communication (creative ideas in Future ).
4. Phototaxis
--Controlling Cell Motion by Light
What makes Luminesensor outstanding is not only its ultra-sensitivity, but also the particularly high dynamic range (data on Characterization ). Such switch-like property makes Luminesensor a very reliable and beneficial module in synthetic biology. Similar to the light-controlled animal behavior in neuroscience, by coupling Luminesensor with endogenous systems, it is possible to integrate the light signal with cell motion.
Figure 4. The concept of phototaxis behavior.
""Phototactic"" bacteria can be built by reprogramming the chemotaxis system in E. coli through light with the Luminesensor (Figure 4). By controlling the expression of the CheZ protein with light, the tumbling frequency is coupled to intensity of light signals (details in Design ). On the border of the light and dark fields, motility ability of the cells in a single colony on the two sides is sufficient to result in an uneven colony (see Demonstration ). Light-controlled cellular motion indeed has very promising environmental and medical applications for the future, e.g. the delivery of drugs to target concerns.

The two outliers are papers based on the work of University of Texas’ Austin team in 2004 (Levskaya et al., 2005) and 2006 (Tabor et al., 2009). The first was a “Brief Communication” published in Nature (impact factor of 41.456) in 2005, garnering 405 citations. The second was a research article published in Cell (impact factor of 32.242) in 2009, cited 293 times. Their removal nearly halves the average number of citations for all publications and reduces slightly the average journal impact factor. After removing these outliers, the next highest number of citations is 91 and the next highest journal impact factor is 12.996. It is important to note that on the other end of the distribution are 12 articles that have been cited zero times and 17 articles that were published in journals with no impact factor and that we treat as having an impact factor of zero. There is a wide variance in the quality of these contributions to the literature, and the optimistic figure for average citations is influence heavily by two outliers.
Discussion
The basis for our claim that publication of a paper indicates a superior educational outcome is Ontario’s Degree Level Expectations. Amid the propagation of new degree-granting institution, the Council of Ontario Universities sought to develop benchmarks for Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Doctoral degrees. While many of these 7 metrics are somewhat subjective- for example, in our opinion an argument can be made that iGEM participants exhibit “a critical awareness of current problems and/or new insights, much of which is at, or informed by, the forefront of their academic discipline, field of study, or area of professional practice,” (Council of Ontario University, 2011) which would demonstrate attainment of a Master’s Degree Level Expectation in Depth and Breadth of Knowledge- we will focus on one metric that is much less subjective. This is attainment of a Doctoral Degree Level Expectation in Research and Scholarship:
The ability to conceptualize, design, and implement research for the generation of new knowledge, applications, or understanding at the forefront of the discipline, and to adjust the research design or methodology in the light of unforeseen problems; the ability to make informed judgments on complex issues in specialist fields, sometimes requiring new methods; and the ability to produce original research, or other advanced scholarship, of a quality to satisfy peer review, and to merit publication"

Biosensor team member Julia introduces the IRES subproject
Introduction
A fully functional sensor needs both a way to recognize the small molecule it’s supposed to be sensing (a recognition element) and a detectable signal that reliably results from a positive sensing interaction (an expression platform).
An aptamer is defined by Sun et al as a “nucleic acid with high specificity and affinity for its target”. [1] As such, aptamers can be used to build  highly discriminating recognition elements for their target ligands. However, alone this is not enough -- molecular conformational changes are no easier to detect than the target small molecules themselves.
Inspired by a 2011 paper from a group at Ehime University [2], we sought to connect the recognition functionality of specific aptamers with in vitro expression of a particular reporter gene (for our constructs we used GFP). To do this, we synthesized an “IRES sensor” construct (see picture below). IRES stands for internal ribosome entry site. It does exactly what the name implies: allows transcription and thus translation to happen. The key for our purposes is that IRES has a particular active 3-D confirmation: if the IRES  is folded correctly it facilitates protein translation, if not it doesn’t so no translation will occur.
Ogawa’s work showed that disrupting  a particular region of the IRES (shown here in blue) by binding it with its complement,  anti-IRES (aIRES, shown here in pink), rendered the entire IRES sequence inactive and unable to translate. In the “off” state when the aptamer is unbound, IRES is bound by a-IRES and no"

We investigate 10 Chinese companies who provide ctDNA detection or cancer screening services. The investigation on current ctDNA detection services among 10 Chinese companies gives us a vision on the diversity of detection services and market share in China.
Conclusion:
Each company has its unique method to carry out service. It suggests there is no technology monopoly in this industry. Therefore our product can compete with others in technology aspect as we have our own method to detect lung cancer. The time required to complete the service is between 2~8 days, except for EZlifeBio. It is seen to me that our product have a clear advantage in the length of time required because the detecting process can finish within few hours and the result can be read straight away. Similarly, EZlifeBio also sell detector and kit to customers and customers can run the detecting process. However, our target audiences are different. Their detectors are targeting hospitals or laboratories but our product is targeting the end user, patients, in this industry. The outcome from each service is slightly vary but all of them provide an assistance in cancer diagnosis or cure. It is distinct to our product as we aiming to provide a straightforward result for customer to understand. However, our product shows its limitation in the result compare to other outcomes from those services. It needs to be developed to generate more completed result in order to compete with other services.

Communication with BGI product research department Before we start to design our product, we consulted a staff who works in BGI product research department. She gave us a lot of advice on how to design a product and what should be the main concerns during the development of a product. Her suggestions inspired us to create a simple screening paper for lung cancer detection.

Sravanti and I did not make much headway, but we know that the pressure is on now because our deadline is to have a solid working prototype by Wednesday.
Tuesday: Sravanti and I successfully linked the tree panel and behavior panel! We databound the objects that we were dropping into the tree panel so that there was a response in the behavior panel. It wasn't initially working, and it took us an hour to realize that it was because we had a textbox hardcoded. Life lesson learned: hardcoding is a bad idea sometimes!
Wednesday: I went to BU with Casey to present our current iteration of the Eugenie UI with the sliding bars. They were alright with our new design. The BU team is working on synthetic biology circuits that they are coding in Eugene. Orit wants us to make sure that we can use Eugenie to generate the same results as they are generating with Eugene code for all their circuits. The only problem with this is that they are not going to run the code and get the results until the end of July, since apparently it will take about a week and a half in order to return all the results. So, we're not going to be able to check our program results with theirs until then. We are also at the disadvantage of working with CLOTHO 2 since we cannot have access to CLOTHO3.
We also reiterated our goals for iGem:  1. Give Eugenie the ability to browse the database and clotho for information to populate the objects.  2. Implement the rules of NOT, CONTAINS, and BEFORE 3. Making sure the drag and drop behavior works well  4. Make sure the visualization of results is exportable in the desired format, and perhaps is displayed visually in Pigeon
Thursday: Catherine and Evan have finished creating the sliding panels. They have also successfully created snapping tiles in the tree view. Sravanti and I are working connecting the objects to a database, with moderate success.
Friday: Sravanti and I successfully got the search function to work for Eugenie! For the moment, it is case sensitive, but when you search for ""promoter,"" ""terminator"" etc., the parts will show up! Right now, any new search results will just append to the end, but it's something that we will fix on Monday! Overall, a good day in the lab.

10) Slowly press down on the plunger to expel the liquid. This time, push past the first stop, all the way until the second stop, where you can push no more.
11) With the plunger still pushed all the way, remove the pipet tip from the container, scraping the tip on the wall to help get every last bit of liquid out of the tip.
12) Once clear of the new container, release the plunger, and eject the tip into a biohazardous solid waste bin (will usually just look like a small plastic bin full of used tips on the lab bench). Most pipets have a button near the plunger that will eject the tip.

1) Fill a beaker with 50ml of 1X TAE buffer.
2) Weigh out and add 0.75g of agarose. (to make 1.5% gel)
3) Microwave for 3 minutes, then run the beaker under cold water until the glass has cooled so you can touch it.
4) Add 2uL of Gel Red
5) Pour the beaker’s contents into the gel mold.
6) Add plastic “combs” to the mold to make wells.
7) Push any large bubbles to the side walls if possible using a spare comb or pipet tip.
8) Let the gel cool and solidify.
9) Once the gel is solid, move it into the electrophoresis device. Make sure the ‘top’ end of the gel (with the wells) is on the same side as the negative (black) terminal.
10) Pour 1X TAE buffer to the fill line.
11) Slowly and gently remove the plastic combs from the wells by wiggling and pulling them. Take care not to rip and of the walls separating the wells.
12) Select a ladder to use based on what kind of samples you’re running.
13) Load 10uL of the ladder into the leftmost well on each row you intend to use. Change pipet tips each time to avoid contaminating the ladder stock. When loading the ladder into the gel, insert the pipet tip below the surface of the buffer, and slightly inside the well. This is tricky to do and takes some practice. Take care not to push too far and puncture the bottom of the well with the pipet tip. A good way to check that you’re"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.

This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

The successful transformation of the ligation product indicated very strongly that the ligation was successful and that the desired plasmid had been transformed into both TOP10 and BL21(DE3) cells. The assembly of the tag-fused defensin expression construct, was further proven to be successful with successful expression, IMAC purification and conjugation to spider silk protein. This part ( BBa_K2144007 ) was submitted to the iGEM Part Registry.

Expressing and purifying a construct with added tags
As for the pSB1C3-T7-Def construct, a BL21(DE3) E. coli strain is used for the transformation of the pSB1C3-T7-Def-BamHI-LT plasmid for expression. At OD600 0.6, the cells are induced with 0 mM, 0.5, mM, and 1.0 mM IPTG to initiate expression of tag-fused defensin. The cells in the cultures are then lysed and the defensin purified using Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC). A SDS-PAGE of the eluate is used to determine the presence of the protein of interest.
Purification, First Attempt [❓]
Concentration measurements at 280 nm of the elution fractions indicated presence of protein in the purified sample. However, the SDS-PAGE after IMAC purification did not show any bands at all for the pellet resuspension sample and only very faint bands for the supernatant sample. Probably, the concentrations were too low to be detected - a Western Blot could be used instead but was not performed due to time constraints.
Conjugating expressed defensin with added tags to spider silk protein
The enzyme Sortase A is used to conjugate defensin to spider silk protein. It recognizes the LPETGG recognition motif added on the 3' end of defensin and links it to poly-G sequences on the spider silk protein.

Marc shared with us his basic protocol for making competent cells; the protocol is included also.
⇒ Day One: Start culture of cells (approximately 5 mLs?)
⇒ Day Two: Subculture Culture: Dilute it to 1/40 concentration  = Grow in incubator for 1-1.5 hours Option #2: Dilute it to 1/100 concentration = Grow in incubator for 1.5-2 hours
⇒ Let grow until OD(540)= 0.4 (approximately)
⇒ Don't overgrow cells! Culture medium should be just visibly cloudy (when swirling the container, should be able to see swirls of cells)
⇒ Spin cells down in centrifuge, wash pellet with 0.1 M MgCl2
⇒ Spin cells down again, wash/resuspend pellet in 0.1 M CaCl2
⇒ The final volume should be about 1/5 that of the subculture volume.
Note: need 200 microL per transformation
Detailed Protocol:
⇒ Day 1: Chip off some DH5alpha from the cryostock and put it into fresh media. Place in incubator at 37 degrees (C) overnight.
⇒ Day 2: Media from last night was definitely cloudy. 200 mL of the incubated media was split into 2 100 mL amounts in two separate flasks. 2.5 mL of incubated media/cells were added to each new flask. This was placed back into the incubator for another hour. After only an hour, the media/cells were at the right cloudiness. We didn't bother actually checking their concentration.

IISER-Kolkata,2018,Team:IISER-Kolkata#Problem_-_-_TEXT.html," these aquifers varies from 3 to 443 μg/L while more than 50% samples had arsenic levels above the Mexican national standard of 50μg/L.
Fixating on the Problem
Therefore, team IISER Kolkata chose to work on the problem of “Arsenic contamination of groundwater and resulting health crisis due to poisoning” due to its high relevance and importance especially in the region where our institute is located as well as in other parts of the world. In this problem we could see the exciting challenge of putting our knowledge and skills to use in solving something really pressing for the common people around us while by large, still staying committed to the needs of a global community facing the same issue.
Existing solutions and their shortcomings
Although arsenic contamination is still a pertinent problem, people have been trying to address it in the ways listed below. Also described are the shortcomings of each of the previously existing solutions to counter this issue:
Arsenic Removal Technique
Shortcomings
Description of Technique
Chemical Oxidation
Process is complex and produces difficult to dispose As rich residue.
Oxidise highly toxic and difficult to separate As(III) form to docile and easily separable As(V) form followed by further treatment, filtration or flocculation.
Coagulation and Flocculation
Leads to secondary pollution of the environment due to problems involved in disposal of Arsenic laden sludge whose management is difficult and expensive.
Addition of coagulants like FeCl3 agglutinates colloidal suspension of Arsenic ions in water and further flocculation by adding substances like alum produces an easily separable sludge.
Selective Filtration
Membrane filters need constant pH maintenance and reagent refilling. Also they are slow due to long time needed for conditioning.
Several filtration techniques make use of sieves and membranes that filter out arsenic based on size and/or charge. Diatomaceous Earth matrix is also used as a filter.
Adsorption on Surfaces
Specificity in action of these units is low and have problems with regeneration of the adsorbent material after repeated uses.
Certain material surfaces such as that of Coconut Shell Carbon etc. can be activated to bind and adsorb Arsenic ions due to their chemical affinity.
Apart from the above mentioned drawbacks of each of the existing techniques there are certain shortcomings common to all:
Expensive Kits are not affordable to the majority of suffering households in West Bengal and Bangladesh.
Kits and Technologies are mostly developed in U.S. or abroad and therefore do not suit the specific requirements of India and Bangladesh. Indigenously researched technologies for"

Fig.5 The fluorescence microscopy result of reporter gene, triggered by α factor in MATα yeast supernatant.
Compared with the Non-Induction group, the EGFP intensity inside the yeast gets more and more stronger from the 1h group to 5h group. And, more and more yeast cells in sight finish the process of mating: stretching out mating projection or can say “shmoo,” and then contacting and fusing between mating partners.
But when time goes to 6h, we can see that, basically the EGFP protein particles in sight are all distributed outside the yeast cell. We suppose that those EGFP protein particles are excreted by yeast cells for preparing to enter ascospore period.
Time scale of EGFP expression upon induction of α factor
Similar to the experiment above, we set different culture group and time to measure the time scale of EGFP expression. The sample order is as follow:
Table 1. The set of experiment group
Fig.6 Fig.6a to Fig.6i demonstrate the FCS result of yeast culturing from 9h to 1h.
As can be seen from Fig.5 and Fig.6, we can see clear distribution between the induction group and non-induction group. As for the expression time scale, the supernatant induction group reached the peak at 6h while the MATα yeast induction group maintain at a rather high level starting from 3h.
Fig.7 The average EGFP intensity of each groups.
The above result indicate that the reporter plasmid could function as expected by responding to upstream signal in pheromone pathway, thus could be used to modify yeast to target histamine.

After successfully transformed the plasmid ADH1-HRH4-Ter and pFUS1-EGFP into CEN.PK2-1c ura3::far1 his2::sst2 trp3::ste2 △ura3 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we had already finished the modification process of yeast. Now it’s time to test whether our diagnostic yeast works! Based on our previous design, the modified yeast could respond to different ratio of histamine in environment at corresponding EGFP expression level. At meantime, the protein expression rate is also influence by culturing time after first induction. Due to the modelling, the higher the histamine concentration is, the faster yeast will respond and so is the protein degradation"
Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html, plate but not on the negative control plate suggests the cleavage enzyme did cleave the CBZ protecting group from CBZ-leu. The reduced amount of growth on the plate in comparison to the minimal media agar + leucine plate indicates a low cleaving efficiency for the enzyme. This serves our biocontainment system well because we do not want the enzyme to be too efficient and cleave the CBZ protecting group from leucine prior to charging of the leucyl-tRNA synthetase with protected leucine -- this could result in our organism dying before it has completed its task because of the inability of the mutated leucyl-tRNA synthetase to use leucine.

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.
When both promotors are TREs, both split parts are inducible, and channel capacity is relatively higher than that of channels with un-inducible CMVs. In the absence of intein, the two peptides find it hard to dimerize, giving rise to low channel capacity.
Upon addition of intein sequence, the binding process becomes irreversible since the two halves assemble into one intact protein through splicing. As a consequence, channel capacity greatly increases. Double-inducible group with two TRE promotors still win the competition speaking of channel capacity.
Comparing three inducible groups leads to the conclusion, that splitting leads to decrease in channel capacity, but adding intein sequence to peptides rescue the effect, elevating the channel capacity to even higher level.
What can the result teach us?
Inspirations for Synthetic Biology Engineering
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
Our program quantitatively studies the behavior of such systems. Splitting up changes the circuit’s output-input function, alleviates leakage phenomenon, improving switch-like property, and increases fold change when induced by circuit inputs. Moreover, we use channel capacity from information theory to describe how well can they transmit signals. We find adding intein sequence tremendously beneficial in that it shifts the channel capacity to a higher level, thus ameliorating uncertainty.
When it comes to designing logic gates, our findings can lead the way. Not only can splitting achieve logic gate effect, but also can it improve sensibility to inputs and defend the system against detrimental interferences of noise when intein is added. Future work shall benefit from this fundamental investigation of basic synthetic biology blocks.
Highlighting the biological significance of dimerization
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied"

Michigan,2012,Team:Michigan#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," produce tightly controllable, strong protein expression with relatively low basal expression and a unique mode of activation, requiring only “pulses” of inducer rather than extended exposure. Team Michigan sought to improve on this idea by utilizing two unidirectional recombinases -- FimE and HbiF.
Orientation of IRL/IRR Components of fimS dictate enzyme specificity
The fimS region is composed of two inverted repeats, frequently referred to as inverted repeat left (IRL) and inverted repeat right (IRR). The two flank a region of DNA referred to as the inversion region.  Each of the inverted repeats are composed of three sections of DNA, an external half-site, an inverted repeat, and a internal half-site.  The external half-sites and inverted repeats are stable and identifiers of the IRL and IRR, while the internal half-sites are mobile, switching between the IRL and IRR, dictating recombinase specificity and the orientation of the invertible region. The internal half-sites are inverted along with the inversion region when the region is acted upon by one of the recombinases (Fig 1). (McCuster et al., 2008)
Fig 1. Orientation of fimS inverted repeats.  In the “off “state the IRL contains internal half-site A (orange), while the IRR contains internal half-site B (green).  When inverted to the “on” state the IRL contains internal half-site B (green), while the IRR contains internal half-site A (orange).
(1) McCuster et al., Molecular Microbiology (2008) 67(1), 171–187
FimE
The FimE enzyme was cloned using the Caltech-made part K137007. A well characterized tyrosine recombinase, the enzyme catalyzes the inversion of a 200-300bp DNA region such that a 3’-facing sequence on the template strand of the region becomes a 3’-facing sequence on the coding strand. This functionality occurs in the lack of general cofactors or ATP, as demonstrated by Ham et al., 2006.
FimE is dependent on properly oriented inverted repeats (IRs) flanking a region of interest for the reaction to occur. Furthermore, it may only invert a fim sequence in the “on” orientation to the “off” orientation.
HbiF
HbiF, a tyrosine recombinase bearing high sequence homology to FimE and other fim recombinases, was discovered in 2006 by Xie et al"

The about 50 % higher specific BPA degradation rate in E. coli expressing BisdA | BisdB fusion protein could be explained either by improved folding properties of the fusion protein or by the closer distance of BisdA and BisdB in the fusion protein leeding to a faster electron transfer and therefore a more efficient reaction. In this case, which has to be further analysed by cell-free enzyme assays, a natural cytochrome P450 class I electron transport system was converted into a more effective class V electron transport system, demonstrating the new possibilities of synthetic biology. In addition, this new class V system would work without alanine-rich linker, potentially changing the view on cytochrome P450 depending electron transport chains.
