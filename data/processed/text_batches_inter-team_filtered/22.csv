Our Collaboration with the Broad Run iGem Team
Just prior to the formation of our own Baltimore BioCrew, our team collaborated with the Broad Run iGem from Virginia. Originally, we had worked together to progress their research from the year before; however, because the commute was significantly strenuous for both parties, we mutually decided to set up our own, individual teams.
Before the we started our research on the plastic-degrading Ideonella Sakaiensis, the team collaborated with the Broad Run team by assisting in a multitude of operations.
Since the Broad Run iGem team specialized in yeast cells, vigorous research had to be enacted by all team members to acquire a more refined knowledge-based concerning our research. We assisted the Broad Run team in a multitude of ways in the lab; oftentimes, every member from the Baltimore team would volunteer to work a certain day to focus our efforts on specific wet-lab tasks. By this, our collaboration was cumulative- we would build off of each others knowledge and work together to make a great product!
Thank you, Broad Run, for your dedication and mentorship!"

This figure strongly suggests that R9 peptides work successfully and GFP penetrate cell membrane, because this was taken by a confocal microscopy and seen as cross sections.

We can make FT protein penetrate cell membrane of plants by R9 peptide function!.
4. Activation
The final step is; Activation. We verified whether FT protein made by E.coli work normally in plant cells.
Actually, FT protein is a transcriptional factor and we can check the ability of FT protein by observing the transcription levels of genes up-regulated by FT protein.
The detail function of FT
FT protein increases transcript activities of flowering factors which lead to flower formation in a plant cell.   Let us introduce the function mechanism of FT protein. Actually, FT function is to up-regulate genes relating to bloom flowers. at the stage of flowering of plants, the expressions are incresed in these genes, FUL, SEP3, and so on. These genes work on shoot apex and change the form of shoot apex in order to start flowering. We focused on the amount of FUL and SEP3 because they are the most popular genes among them.
Fig.4-1 FT protein triggers some flowering genes and they induce flower formation. FT protein up-regulates some flowering genes and they induce plants to bloom.
Injecting FT and verifying its function by RT-PCR
To evaluate the function of FT produced by our E.coli, we tried to check the amount of flowering factors' mRNA upregulated by FT. Experimental procedure is as follows.
1. We prepared solutions. One is composed of R9 peptides and GFP, and the other is composed of R9 peptides and FT. GFP protein is used as a control group. 2. We injected these solutions into each leaf by a syringe. 3.After incubation, we tried to perform RT-PCR in order to check up-regulation of flowering factors.
We used leaf cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, insted of"

For the Zif268 reaction, an annealing temperature of 65*C was used, and for the rest, the annealing temperature was 58*C.  For all reactions, the extension time was 15 seconds.
The following primers were used for each reaction (index taken from the Dropbox primer index):

Isothermal Assembly of Pos Con 77, Zif 268, and OZs
Today we checked the PCR products of the ultramer reaction from yesterday.  They did not look good.  We repeated the reaction using a touchdown PCR beginning with an annealing temperature of 70 degrees and decreasing 2 degrees every other cycle until hitting a minimum of 58 degrees, and we brought the total number of cycles to 25.  Extension time was 30 seconds.  This looked great.  The pictures for the two reactions can be seen below:
Our first PCR was extremely streaky, so we decided to redo it.
We did a touchdown PCR, and our product looks better, although it's still streaky.
Before the isothermal assembly, we did a PCR purification and measured the concentrations of the ultramer reaction products:
Concentrations of our PCR product after PCR purification. This was used in our isothermal assembly.
We then performed an isothermal assembly, using the following mix for Pos con 77, OZ052, and OZ123:
0.63 ul of spec backbone at ~157 ng/ul
0.3 ul of ultramer (~50 ng/ul)
0.13 ul of omega subunit/linker
1.44 ul of H2O
7.5 ul of isothermal mix
For Zif268:
0.63 ul of spec backbone
0.19 ul of Zif (~90 ng/ul)
0.13 ul of omega/linker
1.55 of H2O
7.5 ul of isothermal mix
This was left at 50 degrees for an hour, then stored at 4 degrees.

Finances
With our business plan in place, FREDsense Technologies needed a strategic method to obtain funding in the future.  We assess from our market evaluation, the potential of annual revenue of over $2 million from our flagship product, with approximately a $2 million investment over a 3 year term to bring the technology to the Alberta market.  We have developed a funding strategy to provide these needed funds in a realistic time frame, and a strategic framework to ensure our company is profitable in the shortest possible time frame.
Market Evaluation
Our market evaluation has shown the potential for FREDsense Technologies to operate in the highly regulated field of oil and gas related water quality monitoring. We see an enormous potential impact our technology could play in this market. We have assessed that the general toxin sensing market represents a $50 million dollar opportunity. Our full assessment of the market is specific to Alberta’s oil and gas monitoring and does not cover the wide platform of testing that our technology can cover. These additional markets include waste water monitoring, non-regulatory testing for private companies and agricultural monitoring streams, all of which are potential market opportunities for our diverse platform technology.
By 2015, there will be well over 500 sampling sites mandated to be monitored for their water quality in the province of Alberta.  Each one of these monitoring sites are required to take"

iGEM 2014 had their first meeting with Dr. Salis and Dr. Richard. Ashlee, Emily, Clay, and Sam met each other. Emily will help Ashlee continue work on her Honors Thesis with the project ""Engineering a Biodetoxification Pathway for Lignocellulosic Feedstock"" . Ashlee began to show Emily around the lab and instruct her during her first cloning experiences while they continued Ashlee's semester research trying to add a terminator upstream of the HMF pathway where dCas9 would be inserted. The dCas9 system has a transacting RNA sequence which could disrupt upstream genes if it was not turned off correctly.
Clay and Sam began work for Clay's Honors Thesis in Biological Engineering on the ""Codon Optimization"" project. Clay and Sam began preliminary research and worked on constructing a program to optimize GFPs.
Week 2
Monday, May 26 - Sunday, June 1

Ashlee and Emily saw no success with adding the terminator and must move on to a new approach. With the advice of Dr. Salis and graduate student Iman Farasat, they decided to insert the HMF pathway and the dCas9 system into the genome using homologous recombination and the Lambda Red Recombinase system.
Clay and Sam successfully design a program in Excel to optimize genes, continue working on one to be used in MATLAB. Work begins on designing a plan for obtaining useful data to show efficacy of codon optimization, as well as a plan for this cloning in more specific terms.

We verified the PCR of RecA and cleaned it up.  We were out of pIG12, so we did a plasmid prep of that and a digestion of the two.
After we electroporate a plasmid into TT9907, we do see a few plaques.  Perhaps if we perform an electroporation and then assay many colonies, we could find one that has taken up the plasmid AND remains vulnerable to lambda.  We performed an electroporation today; in the next few days we’ll grow up many colonies and run a plaque assay.

BIG news, or at least potentially big news: we believe that plating 9907 adjacent to cholera causes bacteriophage lambda to enter the lytic cycle!
I was researching more to do with the RecA SOS pathway in E.Coli when I stumbled across and abstract that communicated evidence that high concentration of AHLs, homoserine lactones, cause lambda to enter the lytic cycle.  Since AHLs are the molecules used in quorum sensing, and V.cholerae also releases them, I thought it might be possible that plating 9907 next to cholerae would trigger lambda to go lytic.  I streaked a line of TT9907 next to a patch of cholera that I had grown for several days (we’ve noticed that it takes several days to get solid biofilm growth), and then another line away from cholera.  The line perpendicular to and running away from cholera grew, while the"
Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#thermo_-_-_TEXT.html," results were determined with TTHL (laccase from Thermus thermophilus). Here the percentage of degradation amounted 55.4 %.
Figure 18: Degradation of estradiol (light green) and ethinyl estradiol (dark green) with the different laccases after 10 minutes hours with ABTS added. The commercial laccase TVEL0 which was used as positive control is able to degrade all of the used substrates. The bacterial laccase BPUL degraded 100 % of ethinyl estradiol and estradiol. ECOL the laccase from E. coli degraded 6.7 % estradiol and none of the used ethinyl estradiol. BHAL degraded 46.9 % of estradiol but no ethinyl estradiol. The laccase TTHL from Thermus thermophilus degraded 29.5 % of estradiol and 9.8 % ethinyl estradiol. The original concentrations of substrates were 2 µg per approach. (n = 4)
The results of the reactions of the laccases with addition of ABTS are shown in Figure 18. The experimental set ups were the same as the reaction approach without ABTS described above. The X-axis displays the different tested laccases. On the Y-axis the percentages of degraded estradiol (light green) and ethinyl estradiol (dark green) are shown.  The degradation was measured at t0 and after five hours of incubation at 20 °C. The negative control showed no degradation of estradiol. 6.8 % of ethinyl estradiol was decayed. The positive control TVEL0 is able to degrade 100 % estradiol and ethinyl estradiol. The laccase BPUL (from Bacillus pumilus) degraded 46.9 % of used estradiol after ten minutes incubation. ECOL  was able to degrade 6.7 % estradiol. BHAL degraded 46.9 % estradiol. With TTHL (laccase from Thermus thermophilus) a degradation 29.5 % were determined.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," a positive impact in the doping world.
Realization
We have started taking the steps needed to reach our final goal of convincing the WADA Laboratory Expert group and creating a positive impact in the doping world.
Our first step
Our first step is to identify the best possible detection method.         For this, we need two important sources of knowledge. We need to know our customer, and we need to gather expert knowledge on our process. This step has been completed as part of our integrated human practices .
We analysed our key customers, the anti-doping agencies, via a value proposition canvas (figure 2). This value proposition canvas is a tool to investigate and map the added value of the product you want to sell, to ensure that it is a product that best suits your users needs. It is distributed into the segment Value (left) and Customer (right). For this canvas, we have chosen our main user, the (human) anti-doping agencies, and linked the way the agencies will benefit from our detection method and related services.
Figure 2. Value proposition canvas. This canvas describes how our product ADOPE can be of added value to our customer, the Anti-doping agencies. The left square describes what our products and services are and how they create gain and relieve pain for our user. The circle to the right lists the jobs of our customer, as well as what would benefit the customer (Gains) or what would be undesirable situations (Pains). The circle and square face each other, indicating the many overlapping characteristics between what our user wants and what we offer. More details on each point can be found in the dropdown below.
Value proposition analysis
Customer: Anti-doping agencies
The main customers for our gene doping detection method are anti-doping agencies. The national anti-doping agencies are all given directive by the World anti-doping agency (WADA), leader in stimulating research into anti-doping measures. Their jobs are to protect the spirit of sports, prevent unnatural performance enhancement and protect athletes' health. These three criteria are used to evaluate if a substance will be added to the list of banned substances, after which a detection method will have to be developed to enforce the ban.
Thus, they benefit from an implemented detection method for the substances which are on the list, in this case gene doping. In these tests, they profit from high data processing speed, making the analysis of doping tests faster so they might prevent doping users from starting a race as the results are in before then. In addition, it is advantageous for them to have high-throughput tests, allowing for the testing of many samples at the"

Tumblr Blog
Discussions on Biotechnology are often false biased because of a lack of detailed knowledge in this topic. Besides organising lectures and raising attention with facebook and twitter, we also established a Tumblr blog , where we continuously upload articles about Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology to make science accessible for broad public we are write in understandable language.
Articles entitled basic principles of biology, methods of gene technology like the PCR or modelling of biologic processes. We gave insights into genetics, cell structure and important ceellular processes. Moreover, we wrote about the pros and cons of biotechnology and our personal stories directly from the lab.  We aimed to catch the attention of our followers by providing funny and easy understandable texts that contain reliable and unbiased information to increase the amount of constructive discusssions about synthetic biology.
We were very happy to host guest articles from the iGEM Team Tübingen presenting their great project on blood conversion and iGEM Team Freiburg about the fascinating topic of optogenetics.

Some of the genes they used are involved in the sensing system, but they also may be related to pathogenicity processes. However, neither of them can cause disease by themselves, as they are not toxins. All the information about these genes is read by the team members, too.
2011 Imperial College London
The team Imperial College London wanted to protecting the soil from erosion. To achieve this, they design bacteria that would secret IAA, a hormone which would promote root growth. As the root growth faster after the seeds germinate, the ability for plants to hold soil will be enhanced, thus helping anchor the soil.
Since they’d like to introduce genetically modified(GM) bacteria into environment, they take the safety issue seriously. First, in their system, they design “Gene Guard” to prevent horizontal gene transfer. They engineered anti-holin into the genome, and holin and endolysin on plasmid. If horizontal transfer happens, accepted bacteria don’t have anti-holin to neutralize holing thus will be killed. Second, to make sure their project is practicable and safe, in human practice they have deal it from many prospect, including searching laws about GMOs. They also consulted many professors, such as social scientists, environmental scientists, plant experts and so on to ensure the safety of their idea. Last, they made a GM release guideline for future iGEM teams who may cope with the same problem. They aggregated their experience and wrote down many questions we need to carefully think about, and give some optional solution for them. This gives convenience to teams facing this situation.
2011 IIT Madras
Team IIT Madras made a revolution on the selection method we use today. Instead of the traditional idea that use antibiotic resistance gene, they replace it by Proteorhodopsin(PR), a green-light driven proton pump. Cultured in minimal media, PR expression will provide energy advantage to plasmid owner, for PR gives the ability to use light as an energy source. Thus make a selective advange.
In this way, they overcame some disadvantage of using antibiotics. For example, avoiding the risk of horizontal antibiotic gene transfer and spread. Besides, this could reduce use of antibiotics on synthetic biology, because antibiotics are in fact toxins to the environment. And this would make a more environmental-friendly future.
Since Proteorhodopsin uses retinal as a chromophore for light"

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Infiltrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"egmatis within the macrophages are relatively stable over this time period.
We next applied quantitative microscopy to characterize the behavior of our system inside live macrophages. We imaged macrophage populations under several conditions and time points and scored their rates of infection with E. coli, M. smegmatis or both. In all we scored over 13,000 individual cells collected from more than 100 separate images.
Figure 6 Coinfection of J774 macrophages with mycobacteria and E. coli expressing TDMH and LLO
E. coli (red) express mRFP as a marker and M. smegmatis (green) express GFP as a marker. Macrophages are observed to take up Mycobateria, E. coli, neither or both. This image was collected one hour after introducing the bacteria to the macrophage culture and following extensive washing to remove free bacteria.
Figure 7 Temporal dynamics of macrophages coinfected with E. coli and M. smegmatis.
E. coli and M. smegmatis, expressing mRFP and GFP respectively, were introduced to J774 macrophages. Fluorescent and bright field images were collected every 15 minutes for 6 hours. In these movies, the E. coli also express TDMH and LLO. Macrophages are observed to uptake E. coli, M. smegmatis, neither or both. The fluorescence patterns appear stable for these conditions and time period.
pH influence
  We wanted to study the pH influence on M. smegmatis growth and on TDMH enzyme activity. We know that the phagosomal pH is usually acid (around 6) but can reach 4,5. We wondered if TDMH enzyme was working at this range of pH.
We studied 7 different buffers :  3 ; 4,5 ; 5,1 ; 6,4 ; 7,35 ; 8,2 and 8,8.
Figure 8 shows the activity of TDMH enzyme at various pH levels.
Mycobacteria was unable to grow at pH 3 with or without the presence of TDMH.  Therefore we are unable to make any conclusions regarding the activity of the enzyme at very low pH values.
TDMH activity was active across a large range of pH from 4.5 to 8.8, though there was a small decrease in efficiency observed at pH 8.2.  This is a promising result due to the difference in pH between"

What are we doing?
For the past two decades, wheat stem rust fungus caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) has spread across the world, severely damaging the world’s food supply. When infected by Pgt, crops take 7 to 15 days to show symptoms, delaying the application of fungicides. (https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/Basidiomycetes/Pages/StemRust.aspx)  By designing an early detection mechanism to alert farmers of the presence of Pgt in their fields, they will be able to apply fungicide and treat their crops sooner. In addition, damage from the fungus is more severe when infection occurs early in plant development, making early detection crucial in crop efficacy. (https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/stpaul/cereal-disease-lab/docs/cereal-rusts/wheat-stem-rust/) The advancements made by our project will allow for higher crop yields.
Resistance genes are naturally occurring in wheat and are specific to different races of Pgt. The proteins encoded for by the genes recognize effectors, called avirulence factors, secreted by the fungus and trigger an immune response in the plant, preventing infection. If the crop does not contain a resistance gene specific to the infecting race of Pgt, the fungus is said to be virulent. (Identification of wheat"

BBa_K2053000  (for Bronze medal): Thalassiosira pseudonana silaffin kinase (tpSTK1)
T. pseudonana silaffin kinase (tpSTK1) is a central BioBrick part. It was described as an efficient diatom silaffin-phosphorylating enzyme [1]. Since it was shown that phosphorylation of silaffins increased their biosilification activity [2], we hypothesized that phosphorylation of silica-binding peptide from our fusion protein would increase its biosilification properties. To facilitate protein purification, we added a HisTag. To remove the HisTag, we separated the HisTag from the sequence by the TEV cleavage site sequence.
BBa_K2053002 (for Silver medal) : Fusion Si4-cellulose-binding domain-B of domain protein A
In order to functionalize a cellulose-based patch into a biodetection device we designed and created a fusion protein by assembling three parts: the phage displayed silica-binding peptide (Si4) [3],  the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa) [4], and the B domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (BpA) [5]. This fusion protein is used to bind to cellulose-based patch, increase its rigidity by biosilification, and make it a detection device by fixing the Fc fragment of specific antibodies. We used the preexisting iGEM BioBrick parts that we assembled thanks to commonly used flexible linkers [6]. To facilitate protein purification, we added a His-Tag composed  of 6 histidines at the N-terminus, or C-terminus. To remove the His-Tag, we inserted a TEV (Tobacco Etch virus) cleavage site downstream from the His-Tag.

The framing of the question here matters: Islam is not one person or one entity so Islam itself cannot see a                 tension in anything. Scholars and interpreters, however, lend their advice on the controversial subject of                 permitted interactions among forms of life on the planet. No one person or view speaks on behalf of Islam,                 but the tradition should be celebrated for its diversity and the liveliness with which the debate plays out                 everyday. Islam is clear on the hierarchy of life question - saving a human life trumps a bacteria’s life.                 When weighing ethical imperatives in Islam, we recognize the larger ecological and sociopolitical environments                 in which we live too.
We also spoke with Rabbi Hain about bioethics.
Can you describe the origins of bioethics in the Jewish account of the biblical narrative?
In our tradition one commonly cited interpretation is that when each species was created, humans were set aside                 as special. Humans were charged with the purpose of dominion and advancement: they were to rule over the                 other animals and plants and also be responsible for the advancement of life in the world. Another interpretation                 is that when Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, they were instructed not to interfere with the other                 life in the natural world. I think discussions about Jewish bioethics can be couched in these two components                 of the tradition.
Is there a need for reconciliation between the two interpretations if they’re handed down from the same text?
For me, I think bioethics is such a diverse field that either interpretation alone would fall short in explaining                 humanity’s best course of action. The nature of the dialogue about these topics is constantly evolving too.                 The responsibility is with all of us to weigh the merits of each argument fairly.
Our work presupposes a hierarchy of life. That is to say that the value of a human life is worth more than                     that of a bacterium because in the course of the treatment, bacteria will die. What can be said about                     this tension?
I think there would be a strong consensus that Judaism believes in a hierarchy of life in terms of the way this                 question is being framed with respect to your project. A distinction can be drawn between a whole, conscious                 living and breathing person and the conscience-lacking cells that might make up that person.

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"TEGRATED HP
This year, Team XMU-China is devoted to combine WET LAB, DRY LAB and Human Practices to form an organic integration, while the Human Practices function as a significant theme. As Peter Carr said, ""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" Based on this saying, our team will show the inspiration of our project, the ideas of how to design Human Practice activities and how the activities influence our project in return. What we can feedback to the society is also the point we'll show below.
During the Brainstorm stage:
Before having the discussion with Prof. Zhi Zhu, we read related literatures [1], and made the initial determination of using the aptamer sequence, SYL3C, which was referred to in literatures. In the beginning, we came up with three methods (Figure 1) to realize the ABCD system. However, we had no idea about the concrete operations. That was just the reason why we had the meeting with Prof. Zhi Zhu. After listening to the three methods proposed by us, Prof. Zhi Zhu offered personal opinions about them. After taking time restriction and operation feasibility into considerations, we ultimately chose the “competing method” (Figure 1.B) to realize our system. Not only did Prof. Zhi Zhu give us beneficial recommendations, but gave us specific guidance about how to apply the “competing method”. For example, he proposed that we had better use streptavidin magnetic beads as the carriers, and attached biotin on the end position of SYL3C aptamer sequence.
Figure 1. Initiative methods to enable ABCD system. A) Method A. B) Method B. C) Method C.
Therefore, the close combination of streptavidin and biotin could be exploited to fix the aptamer. She also reminded that in order to keep the reactions of competition as far away as possible from the surface of the carriers, TEG could be inserted between biotin and the aptamer sequence. In that case, TEG could serve as a spacer to reduce the effects of reactions on the surface. Suggestions like these, which were offered by our professor were quite a lot. These suggestions enormously facilitated the design of our experiment. On top of that, professor Zhu also listened to our ideas about the the designed model of thermodynamics (See more details in our Modeling page ). From her perspective, our ideas were quite acceptable. What more, she pointed out that we could try the “Complementary Trand”, which uses 9"

Fluoride riboswitch
We also plan on implementing and characterising a Fluoride riboswitch. This, unlike the Magnesium construct, is a positive regulator. The riboswitch, originally isolated from Bacillus cereus, serves as a transcriptional attenuator in the absence of fluoride. In the presence of fluoride its conformation changes and the repression is lifted. In B. cereus this serves to permit translation of a fluoride efflux pump, which allows the bacteria to cope with the potentially toxic fluoride levels in which it finds itself.
We have kindly been provided with a plasmid from the Breaker lab in Yale University, the key features of which are shown below:
The riboswitch construct we received.
Our aim was to characterise it in this construct, before switching out the riboswitch into the construct seen below. However, due to time limitations, this was not possible.

Introduction
This year our team focused on completing several human practices initiatives. By delving into both the environmental aspects, and the business realm of the project, we worked to gain a complete understanding of the implications of our project. As well, through participating in an online scientific journal, we gained feedback from experts and scholars, which helped improve our scientific writing skills.
BioTreks Paper
One of the means of communication is scientific writing. To practice this, we contributed to an online journal called Biotreks. Biotreks is a journal that publishes design articles on synthetic biology written by high school groups. We wrote a design paper about our project, SynthetINK called ""Synthetic Ink: using synthetic biology techniques to produce biological pigments in Escherichia coli"" and received two awards from writing it, “Best in Education and Best Visual Communication.” It will be published in the fall of 2017. Judges and other students were also able to give us feedback, allowing us to improve the article and the overall project design. Writing a scientific paper has helped us gain a clearer understanding of our project so we can adequately plan experiments for the future.
Business Plan
To investigate the viability of a product like our own in the massive ink industry, we have conducted interviews such as the Greg Vilk interview or the interview with Dave Warwick. Also, we have created a simple business plan to outline business elements such as some marketing techniques, licensing plans and details for up scaling. This plan is a large piece of our research into the potential viability of turning this product into a business. We concluded that it would be very difficult to compete with other ink products if we were to take that course, given the condition of the market today. In the future, we feel that a product such as our own would do significantly better in the business world, as the global energy market begins to turn away from a non-renewable source such as petroleum, and embrace more sustainable methods of energy generation.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.

In addition to this survey, we also talked to politicians who expressed their uncertainty about the removal of glyphosate from the soil. Hence, we modified the path of our project and made it our task to find a way to decrease the risks of glyphosate in the soil. The aim was to engineer bacteria to disarm glyphosate. You can find out if we were successful in creating bacteria that can deactivate glyphosate by following this link: Results.
In which year was glyphosate placed on the market?
1/24
Glyphosate was first synthesized by the chemist Dr. Henri Martin in 1950, while working for the Swiss pharmaceutical company Cilag , which was founded in 1936 in Schaffhausen . Unfortunately (fortunately?), Dr. Martin did find out that glyphosate may serve as a very efficient herbicide. About 20 years later, the American chemist Dr. John E. Franz who was working for the American company Monsanto (recently bought by Bayer ) observed that glyphosate specifically inhibits the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase in plants, fungi, bacteria and archaea. Hence glyphosate was registered an placed on the market in 1974 (1-4).
How much glyphosate was used in Germanys agricultural sector (2014)
2/24
In 2011 a survey by the University of Göttingen (partly lead by our panel discussion guest Horst-Henning Steinmann) was carried out among ~900 german arable farmers. Based on their statements, an application of glyphosate on an area of 4.3 million hectare arable land was estimated. This represents ~ 40% of the total arable area.
A newspaper article by the “Deutsche Welle” published on the 25.09.18 talks about the same data of glyphosate usage in the agricultural sector.
How many tons of glyphosate are produced globally each year?
3/24
From 1994 – 2014 various data of glyphosate application and production were collected globally. These data show that during this 40 years the glyphosate production increased significantly from ~ 50 000 tons to ~826 000 tons per year. The statistic also indicates that the glyphosate production is constantly increasing (approximately 40 tons/year).
In Germany about 5000 tons of glyphosate are used per year which makes up ~ 0.6 % of the global use.
Which company introduced glyphosate to the market?

      Biochtainment systems that couple enviromental sensing with circuit-based control of cell viability could be used to prevent escape of genetically modified microbes into the enviroment. In order to guarantee our chassis’ safety of the application in reality , we have taken a robust and significant strategy, dubbed ‘Toggle Switch’( ), based on a circuit which the LacI and TetR transcription factors are reciprocally repressive.
Overview
      For Human Practice , we have come up with a common question to President Shi that “If our project needs to be applied in practice, what will be the specific operation processes? And of what aspects shall we be conscious? ”. It is a essential reminder of his answers tha there is the need for constant care.     We decided to customize a ‘kill switch’ as a safeguard for our project,   simultaneously harbors a neutral statet that allows billions of microbes to happily thrive and avoid unexpectedly escaping of GEMs into the enviroment and transferring of non-natural plasmid DNA to existing soil bacteria.    ‘Toggle Switch’, based on a circuit which the LacI and TetR transcription factors are reciprocally repressive, but in which the expression off TetR is favoured owing to modifications in the strength of the ribosommal binding sites of the two transcription factors.

For the wet lab session, the participants were divided into smaller groups and they got to do several experiments such as restriction digestion, gel electrophoresis and beta-galactosidase assay.Through this workshop, we hoped that the participants could gain better insight on both iGEM and synthetic biology. We also wished that in the future, they would continuously explore their interests on both of the above subjects and live up the spirit of synthetic biology.
Education
This year, we had the opportunity to cooperate with an international school in Hong Kong to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to high school students. We had roughly around 30 students from The Independent Schools Foundation Academy (ISF Academy) visiting our school. They were grade 10 students who will be determining their IB subjects in November. The school was eager to expose these students into various areas of studies to allow them to explore their field of interest. Our team’s goal was to introduce these students to synthetic biology as the newly emerging field of in biological study and to give those potential future scientists some inspiration.We delivered a talk to the students introducing the basic concept behind synthetic biology and its real-life applications, as well as the iGEM competition and this year’s project “Finding Pneumo”. We explained the principle behind our construct, and it was pleasing to see the students’ enthusiasm to learn. In fact, we were surprised how much they understood considering they were only grade 10 students in high school! After the talk, we invited students to visit our lab, giving them a look of how a synthetic biology lab in university looks like. Moreover, we prepared a few small lab experiments such as gel electrophoresis and streaking plates for them to try out some hands-on wet lab experience.
Fig 3. Interaction with ISF Academy students
Interacting with these high school students was a lot of fun for our team. We saw their enthusiasm and passion in learning new things. We hoped this workshop would inspire the young generation to pursue and further develop the field of synthetic biology in the future.

Academy for Talented Youth
At the end of the summer we had the opportunity to be a part of another event at the university, as SDU was visited by the Academy for Talented Youth . We presented our project and had an extra focus on bioethics - and we had a really good discussion with them. We then supervised them in the laboratory.
Other talks
Symposion
As a good way of getting more feedback we held a presentation at Symposion - a philosophical association at SDU . The audience were composed of professors in philosophy, students from philosophy and other students who found it interesting. There were an almost hour long discussion with lots of good constructive critique and advices for our human practices. Their ideas and arguments had a big influence on our writings on bioethics and philosophy of science. They gave us ideas to other forms of arguments in bioethics, e.g. the religious arguments. They also gave us the idea of ""Track-record"" for a way of handeling the Precautionary Principle.
OldGEM
In September we had the amazing opportunity to meet with the previously iGEM teams from SDU. We held our presentation and they gave so much feedback that it filled 3 pages in notes! The feedback was a very welcomed gift that we used for adjusting our presentation. Otherwise than that, it was a lot of fun meeting the old teams and hearing their pointers on our project. They also gave us a little pep talk, which we appreciated!
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
The day before we left for Boston we had the opportunity to present our project for the whole Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) . This event was our rehearsel of the presentation, which we will bring with us in Boston. We are hoping that our presentation will inspire other students to apply for next year's iGEM competition.

SDU made an informational video about us and our project, which got featured at their facebook page and on youtube. It was so much fun recording it and we had a strict focus on showing a sense of humor and making our project understandable and relatable to the public.

Moreover, I am still concerned with our project. It seems as we are just doing what the Maranas group has already done with the OptStrain (OptStrain: a computational framework for redesign of microbial production systems. {Maranas 2004}). It seems like they have already done what we have done but their code is in GAMMS and isn't an open source program. Hopefully when our program is done, we will have some awesome cool features.

Last week I had the MCATS so I took a little break, but now I'm back. I've been trying to learn python and have been following Dr Bhalerao's book, ""Python Cookbook"".  My goal is to finish the book by the end of the week and learn some cool stuff. I will also refer to another book that I have torrented (shhh!, downloaded), ""Programming Python"".  I have also been messing around with the Kegg API and tried to figure out how it works.
Riyad This week I learned a good deal about making stand alone matlab functions. This would allow us to use the COBRA functions outside of a matlab environment. I also started doing research into the S-matrix and found some matlab functions that might come into future use. I continued to get familiar with python and made a random letter generator that spits out ""A"" ""T"" ""C"" and ""G"" ,randomly... It was fun to make but not sure how practical it is
Nate'
This week has been very exciting in terms of coding and programming.  I had fun learning about dictionaries and how to make them and use them in Python.  I was also able to manipulate the Kegg database in a number of ways through the KEGG API. Looking through the KEGG API, there are many commands, such as get_reactions_by_enzyme, and get_enzymes_by_compound.  However, I realized there is no command to get_reactions_by_organism.  Since our program will go from compound A to compound B through the various reactions listed on KEGG, I felt this type of function would be very useful to us.  This would be useful in determining a host organism by seeing which organisms each reaction can take place"

About us
Our team consists of 11 students and 2 supervisors (Jana Herrmann and Frank Groß). We are biologists, bioengineers and biochemists. If you want to know a little bit more about us, you can read some information on this site.
Jana
Jana studied Molecular Biotechnology in Dresden and Munich. From biophysics to biochemistry to chemistry, she has been working on projects in different disciplines. However, her favorite discipline has always been Molecular Bioengineering. Therefore, she is happy to support the TU Dresden team to get SPACE-P into the orbit of iGEM. Being outside the lab, she enjoys the nature while hiking or cycling, and for working off energy – if something is left at the end of a busy week – she likes playing badminton. She says: “The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for the students to get a feeling of what it takes to plan and perform a project (also from the organizational and financial side) and to realize that having know-how is beneficial, but having a good network is as important.”
Frank
Frank studied biology at the Universtät Hohenheim and got his PhD at the TU Dresden. After three years as a postdoc with Syngenta at the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA, he returned to Germany. He is interested in natural products, molecular bioengineering and lately in epigenetics due to group affiliation. “To be asked by the students to supervise the Dresden iGEM team is a honor. It was and is a hard learning process for all of us, since we are all novices in the iGEM hemisphere. Nevertheless, this project is a great opportunity for them to learn how science functions: planning a project, writing proposals to get funding and finally realizing the plans at the bench in the wet lab and present the results.”

Abstract
The Utah State University iGEM team project is focused on creating an efficient system for producing and monitoring PHA production in microorganisms. One goal of our research is to develop and optimize a method, using fluorescent proteins, for the detection of maximum product yield of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB, a bioplastic) in recombinant E. coli and in C. necator. In order to develop an optimal PHB detection system, we worked to identify the most efficient reporter genes, and the best promoter sequences that would allow the GFP reporter to indicate maximum PHB production.
Project Objectives
DESIGN: PHB reporter constructs (promoter region, reporter region, and PhaCAB cassette)
BUILD: PHB reporter constructs
TEST: functionality of constructs
Introduction
Polyhydroxybutyrate
Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a low impact and naturally occurring biodegradable thermoplastic. It is intracellulary accumulated by a wide range of microorganisms as a carbon and energy reserve material in response to an environmental stress, such as nutrient limitation. PHB belongs to and is the most prevalent member of a broader class of polyesters called polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). Over 80 different PHAs have been classified, and each varies in mechanical properties. The difference within the polymers depends on the R side chain. Specifically, PHB possesses material properties comparable to petrochemically-derived plastics (Lee, 1999; Lee, 1996). In addition to physical and mechanical similarities with conventional plastics like polypropylene and polyethylene, its biophotonic properties and biocompatibility with human tissues make it appealing for use in biomedical applications.

03/09/2018 About Peter Behnisch
Peter Behnisch is Chief Commercial Officer of the Dutch company BioDetection Systems b.v. (BDS). This company is specialized in bio-based screening technologies for safety, quality and bioactivity assessment.
Insights
Chemical analysis most often used, but very costly and often irrelevant results.
Water authorities are already familiar with bioassays. SIMONI and Daphnia-dependent assays are currently used methods. Since these techniques mostly rely on organism behaviour, they are not always reliable and measurements can be disturbed due to polluted water.
There are no national or European policies yet, although water authorities in the Netherlands are stimulated to approaching the problem.
There is a purification obligation in horticulture.
Ensuring the low-costs and high speed of DeTaXion, will make it a very beneficial and applicable system.
Applied
Confirmation that DeTaXion could ease chemical analysis and could be used as a precheck for chemical analysis.
Potential applications of DeTaXion would involve local measurements, such as:
Method for the detection of the health of the neighborhood
A quality check of water purification at the source.
Efficiency of pharmaceutical uptake of patients
Method to confirm predictions and national measurements

Maarten Nederlof is involved in water purification by sewage plants and Marlies Kampschreur is responsible for the innovation at Aa and Maas. Water Authority Aa and Maas is responsible for water quality and water purification for their district.
Insights
Identifying the impact and setting a concentration limit of compounds or mixtures of compounds is rather difficult.
Pilots on techniques with a higher yield of water purification are being done. It is important that these techniques are as cheap as possible.
Germany and Switzerland already have such high yield techniques. In the Netherlands a pilot is held.
There is an increase in bioassays being developed and used. Water authorities are testing whether these can be meaningful to determining the effect of compound mixtures in water on organisms, rather than the existing compounds. SIMONI counts as golden standard. a follow up on the compounds with an effect is still needed.
The disposal of waste from illegal drug laboratories led to shutting down sewage treatment companies.
Applied
Considering the designing of an end product that can track down illegal drug laboratories.

Overview of project-related Activities
Summary: Involving the Community
Although there are several scientific institutions located in Berlin which are conducting research in synthetic biology, there has never been an iGEM team from Berlin before. This is even more surprising as Berlin with its vibrant bio-arts and DIY-biology community seems to be the perfect location for successful iGEM projects. As an interconnected workforce, our team incorporates members from various scientific, cultural and creative backgrounds, which makes our team able to address complex issues from various perspectives. So far, iGEM Berlin consists of students from biotechnology, history, design, medicine, theoretical physics, informatics, and more. Our diverse team has been able to make valuable connections into the bio-arts scene of Berlin, working together with think tanks such as the Hybrid Plattform, as well as EU advisor Markus Schmidt and his Biofaction AG.
Supported by the Hybrid Plattform, we organized a science and design workshop event on the 8/9.08.2014 . During this event we conducted a series of short presentations about synthetic biology, as well as about prototyping and speculative design. Participants from different backgrounds designed and constructed interactions, which deal with the idea of a biological modularity. The resulting interactions addressed currently much-debated issues about the future applications of synthetic biology. Surprisingly the participants focused on topics like performance enhancement, transhumanism, alternative materials and housing as well as standardization. By explaining the basic principles of synthetic biology and approaching synthetic biology with a limited complexity synthetic biological speculation became easily accessible and reached wide variety of people.
In the beginning of September, we collaborated with the artists and scientists from the c-lab collective (UK) as well as the Artlaboratory - a berlin bio-arts space. In the Synthetic Biology Workshop artists and other people were introduced to synthetic biology and performed their own cloning experiment. The whole event came to an end in Berlins first Science Café event for synthetic biology organized and hosted by the iGEM Berlin Team. During this event, we had speakers from different backgrounds and"

Identifying a problem with a graphical method
Drinking water shortages and the lack of hygienic facilities in developing countries are the main reasons explaining current outbreaks.
Fig. 2: countries reporting cholera deaths and imported cases in 2016 1
The WHO reported over 1 million cases over the year 2015 and the mortality was around 1% 2 . In April 2017, a cholera epidemic burst occurred in Yemen. In August, more than 500,000 cases have already been identified. This epidemic, which turned into a sanitarian crisis, is still surpassing the abilities of the non-governmental organizations to help population 3 in the long-term. This fact highlights the limitations of the current solutions.
Using the first bibliography work, a problem tree was built to analyze the issue of cholera epidemic and confirm our choice to work with antimicrobial peptide to clean water.
Fig. 3: problem tree of the cholera disease (template from Synenergene , the iGEMer’s Guide to the Future 4 ).
A problem tree is very useful to have a global representation of the cholera background. The causes are located on the roots and the effect are in the foliage. The goal is to identify the root-cause and to solve it using synthetic biology. Many of the causes are related to water: insufficient water supply, unsafe drinking water for instance. This is quite logical as water is one of Vibrio cholerae life medium. If the water access is not safe, cholera continue to spread. What parameters conditionate the water quality? Water treatment and the external contamination like fluids coming from contaminated people. Indeed the human can be a true bioreactor for V. cholerae growth and multiplication. Other causes are also related to water like natural catastrophes and war which make water treatment facilities unusable.
All together these causes demonstrate that water treatment can be a true solution to contain cholera epidemia. This accession is confirmed by Webber et al. 2005 5 and Bardhan, n.d. 6 , expecting that the improvement of the water treatment quality can possibly reduce the cholera occurrence by 90% whereas the improvement of sanitation will have a moderate impact. The NGO Doctors Without Borders, in their guidelines, argue that the increase of purified water disponibility greatly reduces the attack rate (the ratio between reported cases on the number of peoples exposed to cholera).

The figure shows an example of this where the mammalian cell line U-2 OS is transfected with a Plug ‘n’ Play assembled plasmid expressing GFP with a targeting sequence localizing the produced GFP to the peroxisomes of the cell. As a proof of concept of the Plug ‘n’ Play assembly system, the Copenhagen team proved the easy assembly as well as successful function in bacteria.

Introduction
Palm oil is a huge business. From food products such as margarine and chocolate, to cosmetics and even applications in biodiesel, palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the world, and its demand is only increasing. But what most of the manufacturers of these products fail to publicly address is the massive devastation caused by ripping up rainforests in order to make room for oil palm plantations. Not only does this mass deforestation damage the planet by increasing carbon emissions and decreasing the amount of CO2 taken up from the atmosphere, it also destroys the homes and habitats of thousands of endangered animals, including orangutans and tigers. Additionally, many rainforests are found growing atop peatlands, and so it follows that when they are ripped up or burned, colossal amounts of CO2 are released. CO2 is of course a greenhouse gas and so obviously this has a big impact on the extent and rate of global warming. We discuss the devastation associated with the palm oil industry extensively over on our Ethics pages.
Palm oil is made up of four major components: palmitic acid (44%), stearic acid (4.5%), oleic acid (39.2%), and linoleic acid (10.1%). These four fatty acids are fractionated from crude palm oil and used in various different applications according to their degree of saturation- stearic acid is used primarily in cosmetics, where oleic acid is an important oil used in cooking, for example. The biosynthesis of fatty acids has been studied extensively in E. coli, which makes this the ideal chassis for our project.
Our aim is to overexpress the pathway of naturally occurring saturated fatty acids (palmitic (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0)) to result in a net increase in their production, and"

– controlling inteins with light
Introduction Experimental procedures Results Discussion References
ABSTRACT
Light-dependent regulation represents a promising way to control biological processes and it offers an unmatched spatio-temporal resolution and only minimal toxic effects. To complete our toolbox we therefore came up with an advanced system to induce intein splicing via blue-light illumination. Previously, attempts have been made to engineer light inducible split intein pairs using photoinduced complementation systems, these methods however only allow for light induction of inteins with low affinity and therefore low splicing activity.
inLOV (inteins controlled by As LOV2) uses small split inteins photocaged in the Avena Sativa LOV2 domain to inhibit the binding of inteins in non illuminated dark-state and to only facilitate protein splicing upon induction with light of λ=470 nm.
The system is fully compatible with our toolbox parts and might in future become one of the most efficient and universally applicable ways of photo inducing post-translational modifications in vivo.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," they are not going to achieve it. I don’t personally subscribe to that perspective because I think if the vast majority of countries have achieved it and we just have few countries left. And there’s a reason why it is not, […] I still think that celebration can occur.
    A fear of course is, that people start celebrating and then donors will say are saying: “Well then we don’t have to invest anymore”. Then we have a problem. That’s kind of what happened with leprosy back in the early 2000.
Daniel C.:
Back to talking about reasons why some countries still continue or might continue to have trachoma cases beyond 2020. What do you think are the main reasons, aside conflict in the South Sudan and other countries that this goal might not be achieved?
Dr. Courtright:
I don’t have an easy answer for that one. It’s a question that the whole trachoma community is struggling with particularly in terms of Ethiopia. As you might be aware the Amhara Region in Ethiopia has an antibiotic treatment in many of those districts for seven, eight, nine even ten years. And yet the prevalence of TF [follicular trachomatous inflammation] occurring in that regions is still quite high. The ministry of health in Ethiopia is really very concerned about it and rightfully so. So what is likely happen fairly soon is commissioning a much more in depth assessment of the situation to try to answer the question that you’re asking: Why is Amhara after so many years of antibiotic treatment not achieving lower prevalence rates of TF below the WHO threshold. I think many people would give you their idea why that’s the case, but I think getting kind of a global assessment of this will be helpful because it pulls in everybody’s perspectives on what is likely to be the gaps. My personal feeling the inadequate attention to transmission meaning that are the programs to reduce transmission whether it be through latrine construction, use of the latrines, you know clean phases, other approaches to reduce transmission. Are those approaches adequate? My sense is probably not. That’s said I see other countries that also don’t have, what I would call really robust wash programs and yet trachoma has decreased significantly. So what is unique about Amhara for example? I don’t have an easy answer for that right now, but I do think it has to do with transmission one way or the other. What is going on? That is still unclear.
Kai:
Would you think that for example our diagnostic device would be helpful to reduce the burden in such areas? Especially the financial burden?"
Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Future_-_-_TEXT.html," more expensive as long as it is based on petroleum, and shipping costs increase. Governments realise that it is about time to make the transition to renewables. Conferences are held in which new, this time binding agreements are made, involving the countries’ own emission of greenhouse gases. Not all countries participate in the agreement, but as the oceans’ CO2 absorbing capacity is reached, the global climate changes are becoming visible and other countries continue to see the need to act now, allowing slowly but surely for a change in the right direction.
Scenario 2 - Blue Bio Energy
Science and technology + Sustainable development
Research into synthetic biology and specifically genetic modification of bacteria is already carried out for a long time, but always safely within the boundaries of the lab. As it is no longer illegal to use GMOs in products the connection between synthetic biology and industry becomes stronger. Even though blue energy setups using genetically modified biofilms is strictly regulated to prevent release of bacteria into the environment, companies begin to see synthetic biology as an interesting option for solving problems that were not yet solvable before. It is seen that interest in applied research increases, especially because people expect that a trend is set that will be continued in the years to come. From 2030 on, more funds are available for research as the direct implication of the discovery of the blue energy principle serves as an illustration that research is the key to innovation and sustainable development. After years of research in large parts of the Netherlands, results are being seen. Research into problems like global warming has proven useful; bacteria are found that are able to capture excess CO2 from the atmosphere efficiently. Only time, lengthy procedures and strict regulations stand between the current situation and the building of large setups everywhere in the country. Additionally, people are looking into the possibility of making the conversion of sunlight to electricity more efficient by using modified bacteria or algae. The allowance of the blue energy setups with Bacillus’ biofilm in 2030 is in retrospect seen as a turning point in history. Up to 7% of the world’s energy demand can be provided by blue energy, providing a great addition to solar and wind power.
Social change
A shift is observed in the acceptance of GMOs in society. At first people were rather doubtful towards genetic modification, due to the stories in the news about extreme cases with negative consequences for the environment and biodiversity. From 2030 on, however, acceptance of the application of GMOs is increased by extensive promotion of companies and governments. Emphasis on transparency towards the public increases the trust of citizens in the current developments. The use of GMOs is restricted by newly set up regulations,"
BGU_ISRAEL,2016,Team:BGU ISRAEL#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," of our main guide lines is to create a safe and controlled work environment. Therefore, we followed strict                                 safety rules that enable us to ensure minimum mistakes and ideal conditions during our work.
Safety
Safe Lab Work:
All of our project's lab members received safety training by our advisors, and had to partake in a lab safety online                                  course offered by the Ben Gurion University safety department. In this course, we learned about emergency protocols,                                 safety classification of biological labs, and working with new chemicals.                                 In the lab, we wear protective clothing and gloves at all times (unless working with fire). In necessary cases,                                 we also wore protective glasses and face masks, worked in fume hoods / biological hoods etc. All experiments were                                  done considering all appropriate safety protocols, after consulting our PI and advisors.
In our project, we preformed multiple growth experiments using different intermediates in the PET degradation                                  pathway as carbon sources. Some of the chemicals have specific safety instructions according to their MSDS,                                  which were printed out and stored in the lab for all of the members to read and work according to.                                 (For example, at times, it was necessary to work with a chemical like Catechol, or to handle Ethidium                                 bromide waste, in a fume hood).
Working environments:
Regular work area
Chemical fume hood (EtBr and Catechol)
Safe Project Design (Safety Risks to the General Public):
Our final goal as the BGU iGEM team is to create an operating biofuel cell, which will break down polyethylene                                 terephthalate (PET) using E. coli and P. putida. We chose to work with these bacteria, as they                                  are known chassis organisms, are easy to manipulate, and are risk group 1 (P. Putida - DSMZ) – they                                 do not cause diseases in human. Moreover, we use the P. putida KT2440 strain, which is the first                                  Gram-negative soil bacterium to be certified as a safety strain by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee                                  (Federal Register, 1982(3)) and is the preferred host for cloning and gene expression for Gram-negative soil                                  bacteria (Nelson, K. E., et al. 2002(4)).
With the safety of the environment in mind, we designed a metabolic cascade to degrade the toxic intermediates                                 in the PET degradation pathway, to non-toxic compounds that can be used by the bacterium for energy in the TCA cycle.                                 This way, the degradation process does not release"

During idle time, the plate was shaken at 500rpm. The plate reader maintained a constant temperature of 37oC throughout the duration of quantification.
Figure 8. 24-hour growth curves of DH5α E. coli containing plasmids: (i) CP1 (ii) CP3 (iii) pBbB2k-GFP Keasling vector (KV; positive control) grown in LB broth (negative control).  KV(u) = Uninduced KV; KV(i) = 1mM aTc-induced KV, at mid-log phase, OD600 = ± 0.4.  The samples were measured every 30 minutes at OD600 using the BMG Labtech FLUOstar Omega spectrophotometer, under constant temperature of 37°C.  All points are the mean of 3 technical and 2 biological replicates for each plasmid, normalized to the blank with error bars = SD.
Fig. 8 shows that all of the E. coli samples with plasmids CP1 , CP3 , uninduced pBbB2k-GFP Keasling vector (KV(u)) and anhydrotetracycline(aTc)-induced pBbB2k-GFP Keasling vector (KV(i)) had normal growth curve patterns over the 24 hours period with no detectable growth in negative control.  Lag phases (T0-1) of all samples were identical, which was what we were expecting as the initial cell density should be uniformed (Cultures were normalized to OD600=0.05, 200µl of culture per well).  The exponential growth phases, however, were different for CP3 and the remaining samples.  Log phase of CP3 (T1-6) was comparably shorter than CP1, KV(u) and KV(i) (T1-8.5), suggesting that CP3 had shorter doubling time (29min) than CP1 (37min), KV(u) (56min) and KV(i) (70min).  CP3 entered the stationary phase (T8-24) after the transition phase at T6-8.  In contrast, other samples attained stationary growth (T10-24) 10 hours after the transition phase at T10. There was no observable differences in growth curve patterns between KV(u)"

I am Clement. My curiosity is my strength. Curiosity is my gas and science my vehicle to move forward.
Why iGEM? Because, it’s for me an opportunity to learn science by practising and thinking. It’s certainly one of the best science experience in my life. It is also an open window to discover new disciplines and ways of thinking. Moreover, I think iGEM is a chance for every student to learn from themselves. They can learn how to work in team, think as a team and develop an essential spirit for their future. No one can imagine this experience if he doesn’t live it !

""Turn your face to the sun and the shadows will fall behind you."" - Maori proverb
For me, science and daily life are highly connected, I always want to solve problems by the simplest way. I’m passionated by a lot of fields: sports, music and science, especially biology and astronomy. To describe me in 3 words : geek, curious, determined.
Why iGEM ? I wanted to be part of this contest given the possibilities synthetic biology has to offer. Then, I realised that iGEM would be the most complete experience I would ever have because our team started from nothing. Indeed, we learned a lot and in different aspects (fundraising, communication, innovation, finding sponsors...). This was really rewarding and I’m proud of what we achieved so far.

Day 2
Overnight cultures were diluted 100x in 0.5 L LB, with appropriate antibiotics, and divided over two 1L erlenmeyers. Cultures were were grown to an OD600 of about 0.8 at 37ºC while shaking. Next, cultures were put at 20ºC shaking for 30 minutes (cold shock) to induce expression of chaperones that aid in protein stability.
Cas9 expression was induced by adding rhamnose to 0.2%. In cultures that contained a pEVOL vector, expression of the aminoacyl synthetase was induced by adding arabinose to 0.2%. When appropriate, at this time also the synthetic amino acid was added to a concentration ranging from 200 µM to 1 mM. Cultures were shaken overnight at 20ºC.
Day 3
All centrifugation steps were performed at 4 ºC, and samples were kept on ice.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 x g for 15 minutes. Supernatant was removed, and cells were washed once in 50 ml Tris-HCL buffer, pH7. After spinning down the cells again, they were resuspended in 10 ml cold His buffer A. Cells were lysed using a chilled French press cell (pressure ~30,000 psi) and lysed samples were spinned at 16000 x g for 10 minutes. Supernatants were collected, filtered (0.45 µm filter) and purified using FPLC.
Since C321dA is not optimized for protein expression, we aimed to reduce protein breakdown by adding cOmplete protease inhibitor to our samples before lysis. However, high yield of Cas9 was also observed when this protease inhibitor was omitted.
Using the expresso vector for Cas9 expression introduced a C-terminal his-tag to our Cas9 constructs, which was used for protein purification. An AKTA Purifier system was used, with a 1 mL HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) that was equilibrated with His buffer A . The cell-free extracts were loaded on the column, and the column was washed by addition of 2% His buffer B to already remove some unspecifically bound proteins. Elution was performed with a gradient of His buffer B.

We expand on your Human Practice activity by integrating the investigating issues into the design and execution of your project. During the Investigation of Taxus yunnanensis in Yunnan, we learned that the yew plant bases in Yunnan are mainly allocated at sipsongpanna, Wenshan, Diqing, and so on. The distribution of wild yew trees is dispersive and in small population. They are affected by both natural and human aspects. See the Human Practice page for more information.

UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," recent interest in biofuel had dipped was that the renewable energy has heavily struggled to achieve economic parity with oil prices . Because the government agencies refrained from increasing already-substantial subsidies for farmers, biofuel production eventually began to lag, leading to a complete stop in the industry. Thus, he thought that if our project was to be successful, it had to somehow lower production costs on a sizable industrial scale.
Deliberation
We were extremely thankful for Frank's comment that biofuel production was a very niche issue that would be difficult from both an industrial and entrepreneurial perspective. Thus, we decided to broaden the scope of our project to a bio-production platform to have a more tangible impact. This achieved two things: (1) It allowed for a general implementation of our project, offering versatility in its end products and introducing the quality of modularity, (2) It allowed us to incorporate our original goal of addressing some potential shortcomings in current biofuel production methods if the environment was optimal.
Point 2: Gaining Insight on Current Problems in Biologics Manufacturing and A Possible Solution
Rationale
After our discussion with Frank, we also decided to get a more in-depth perspective of the challenges in metabolic engineering and associated fields. We reached out to Novogy, a Boston-based company that specializes in bio-based production of food, fuel, and pharmaceutical substances. This was particularly beneficial to us because talking to an industrial setting would allow us to see a cursory version of what we wanted to implement. Thus, we got in contact with Dr. Shaw, Senior Research Director .
Exploration
Dr. Shaw helped us focus on the experimental approach that we planned on taking. He encouraged us to make sure that our approach was:
Less susceptible to bacterial contamination
Cost-effective
Relatively easy to implement
To help, he also pointed us to a recent paper that he had published entitled Metabolic Engineering of Microbial Competitive Advantage for Industrial Fermentation Processes. In this technique, scientists engineered metabolic pathways into host organisms that allowed them to use unconventional compounds that contained nitrogen and phosphorus, allowing both bacteria and yeast to outcompete potential contaminants.
Deliberation
Dr. Shaw' s main concerns guided us throughout the project because it allowed us to have an end product that would actually have industrial relevance. We decided to tackle each point through further consultation.
Going back to Frank's point, we realized a key point of achieving economic parity with fossil fuels would be decreasing or eliminating the risk of bacterial contamination. We decided that implementing the ROBUST Method would provide a viable solution to this problem . In our research on industrial fermentation processes, we learned that the fact"

All experiments conducted in this project has been designed, executed and analysed by members of the iGEM Group Stockholm. We, as iGEM Team Stockholm, are confidently standing behind the presented data. We have put a special effort not to modify the actual picture that we got by conducting our experiments in any way.
Our project has been developed independently from other projects. We are not really building up on a single project. We discovered that the iGEM Team from Dundee 2013 has been working with a chimeric version of the EnvZ as well. Therefore, we have analysed their project and adjusted our experiments accordingly. After request, we were also very happy to receive the EnvZ deficient E.Coli strain BW25113 from Dundee, in person of Frank Sargent and Chris Earl.
We have been also inspired by the work that has been already conducted with the OmpR signaling cascade. Notably, the former iGEM Teams from Technion Israel.

Conclusions
The induction curve of the receiver device, reported in  page (M9 supplemented medium), was represented in PoPS units, while ours is reported in RPUs and has been obtained through a very similar protocol (see Growth conditions section). Anyway, the experiments we performed in M9 supplemented medium confirmed the induction curve shape of this device, with a switch point between 1nM and 10nM.
We also estimated the transfer function of this device in LB medium, for which no data were reported in the Registry from previous characterization. More experiments sholud be perfomed on the behaviour of  this device in M9 because the one performed show a great variation in RPU range.

Enzymatic Assembly Line Overview
Earlier this year, research at the Kee-Hong Kim lab of Purdue University had preliminary evidence showing that a trans-stilbene compound, Piceatannol, had an ability to inhibit the development of human adipose cells. The mechanism is based around the idea that Piceatannol interacts with a preadipocyte's (immature fat cell) insulin receptors in such a way that surpresses it's growth into a mature adipose cell. Piceatannol is a metabolite of resveratrol, a compoud currently under investigation for possible anti-cancer properites. Piceatannol differs from resveratrol by one hydroxyl group on one of the aromatic rings.
Piceatannol is currently very costly to synthesize. On the advent of such a discovery, we felt that if we were to engineer a pathway to optimize the production of Piceatannol from cheaper substrates through the utilization of our PUF and RNA scaffold projects, we could show the versatility of our PUF toolkit working with an RNA scaffold.
However, before researchers can begin using our PUF toolkit to produce piceatannol in vivo, we took steps to acquire and characterize the necessary genes for our:

2. Cell measurement protocol
We        were provided with six different devices (Test device 1 - BBa_J364000 ,        Test device 2 - BBa_J364001 ,        Test device 3 - BBa_J364002 ,        Test device 4 - BBa_J364007 ,        Test device 5 - BBa_J364008 ,        Test device 6 - BBa_J364009 ) along with negative ( BBa_R0040 ) and positive        ( BBa_I20270 ) controls which then we transformed into E.        coli DH5α strain. Devices express GFP under Anderson promoters of different        strength and are in the pSB1C3 backbone which carries resistance to        chloramphenicol.
We        made overnight cultures of two colonies of each transformation plate.        The next day, the cultures were diluted to OD600=0.02        and grown for 6 hours. The absorbance (600 nm) (Fig. 3A) and        fluorescence (485/520, gain = 50) (Fig. 3B) of cultures were measured        at 0 and 6 hours.
Figure 3. Average absorbance (A) and fluorescence (B) measurements of the 2 colonies and 4 replicates for each         sample, taken after 6 hours of growth.
The        negative control demonstrates the highest absorbance which could be        the result of the lowest metabolic load of all the devices, since it        has no GFP expressed. On the other hand, devices 1, 4 and 5 show much        slower bacteria growth even though the fluorescence of these devices        is not the highest. Furthermore, device 1 demonstrates a really        moderate absorbance and fluorescence increase after 6 hours        suggesting that environmental factors could have impeded sample        growth.
Next,        the previous data (absorbance and fluorescence) was normalized to the        comparable OD units (Fig. 4A) and then to particles (Fig. 4B) so that we could        determine the mean expression level of GFP per cell.
Figure 4. Normalization of fluorescence to the OD units (A) and MFEL per particle (B).
After        6 hours all the devices (except the negative control) demonstrates a        relatively decreased level of fluorescence. That could be explained        by cells reaching a certain level of GFP expression after which the        fluorescence stops increasing whereas absorption steadily goes up.

The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

BL21.  Chromosomal T7 polymerase gene is unstable!
BL21 is an Escherichia coli strain that bears the T7 phage polymerase gene into its genome. Therefore, it is used to express proteins that are                controlled by T7 phage promoters, as is the case of three of our Biobricks (Biobricks 8, 9 & 10). However, when we transformed the strain with the                Biobricks (blue and yellow chromoproteins), we could not measure any signal. After many tests, we hypothesized that the T7 phage polymerase gene was                unstable and did not resist stressful situations such as competence or transformation protocols.
We performed a PCR screening to find out whether the T7 gene was present. We used colonies of BL21 transformed with Biobrick 8 (blue chromoprotein) and                grew them on LBA medium. We performed a colony-PCR with a couple of T7 specific oligos designed by ourselves targeting a 1.5 kb region of the T7 polymerase                coding sequence.
Figure 7: 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. We saw that the bacteria forming the colonies did not have the gene that codes for the polymerase.
We then decided to check whether our glycerol stock of bacteria contained the gene. Maybe during the process of competence the culture was contaminated. To our surprise, the gene was present in every single colony we analyzed. Therefore, we decided to do a final colony PCR using the bacteria from the glycerol stock as positive controls, and using colonies from the non-transformed competent stock.
Figure 8: 0,8% agarose gel electrophoresis. In the BL21-glicerol stock the gene was present. Nonetheless, almost all BL21-competent cells lack T7 phage polymerase gene.
Our results reveal that BL21 loses the T7 polymerase gene at some point during the process of making"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," a Math majored senior student. As the boundaries among different disciplines of science are now blurring, I want to handle the ideology of maths to arrive at a higher standpoint to try to understand the principle of life. iGEM provides us with such a good state to learn from utilization.
In this group, I am the unique girl among nine boys, and the most frequently spoken of mine is ""Oh, it's my duty to get some soy sauce! "" Strange, huh?  The  connotation of it is not words but meanings. Those guys are too gentle to arrange me doing something of coding.So I am more involved in clerical works, I design the team uniform and our logo,arrange the scheduling and get in touch with sponsors and alumni connection. My life is full of unpredictable tasks, who can tell me what is the next?

Zhaoyi Li, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale & National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, lizhaoyi@mail.ustc.edu.cn </p>
During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

Protocol
I. Determination of the optimum concentration of SA for induction
Process:
1. Pick a single colony from the top of the board, expand it with liquid LB containing Amp, and control the time at about 11h.
2. Prepare for SA induction verification:
(1) The whole experiment can be done in 3-5 parallel groups. In the ultra-clean platform, the expanded liquid is divided into several 20ml large centrifuge tubes, each tube is filled with 2ml. Pay attention to the cover of the large centrifuge tube when filling the bacteria solution, wrap it with the sealing film, and tighten the rubber band (because the sealing film can be ventilated, if the cover is covered with oxygen, it will be insufficient).
(2) Adding SA, so that the concentration of SA in the system is 0 mg / L (ie, without SA), 0.001 mg / L, 0.01 mg / L, 0.1 mg / L, 0.3 mg / L, 0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L.
(3) 37-degree shake flask culture induction for 5 h.
(4) All the samples and the blank E.coli K12 of the expanded culture were placed in the upper 96-well plate (operated in a clean bench), using ELIASA to measure the fluorescence intensity and OD of each sample well, and the fluorescence was mcherry red fluorescence. (Absorption wavelength 580 nm, emission wavelength 610 nm).
Results:
As shown in the picture, when the SA concentration is 0.3-0.5 mg/L, the maximum fluorescence intensity per unit OD can be detected, so the optimum concentration for SA induction is 0.3-0.5 mg/L.
II. Find the optimal induction time at the optimum concentration
Process:
Find out the relationship between the time of induced expression and the fluorescence intensity at the SA concentration of 0.3 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L.
1. Expand the culture of puc19+emrr strain (note the addition of AMP resistance) for about 11 hours.
2. Set 3-5 parallel groups, in the ultra-clean platform, divided the expanded bacterial liquid into several 20ml large centrifuge tubes, each tube is filled with 2ml. Pay attention to the cover of the large centrifuge tube when filling"
Caltech,2012,Team:Caltech#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a bacterial system in coliroid that is switched between different states by light has been previously achieved with expression of a lacZ reporter. The system allows a lawn of bacteria to act as a biofilm, so that the projection of a pattern of light on the bacteria produces a high-definition chemical image. The primary focus is to achieve this same printing, but by using a fluorescent protein (mCherry) instead of the lacZ reporter. Also, we aim to animate the images produced by the bacterial film, by including degradation tags that will lower the intensity of fluorescent while light is being shone, and eliminate it when there is no light source. In this way, we hope to create an animation from these coliroid plates as the degradation tags degrade the image produced by the bacteria over time.

Was ist iGEM?
iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine competition) ist ein internationaler Wettbewerb, der jährlich vom MIT in Boston, USA veranstaltet wird. Teilnehmen können Studenten aus aller Welt, die sich mit der Molekularbiologie verwandten Themengebieten befassen. Einerseits dient dieser Wettbewerb dazu verschiedene Bildungsaspekte zu kombinieren und soziale Gemeinschaftsarbeit unter Studenten zu fördern und andererseits stellt er eine Sammlung von standardisierten und untereinander auswechselbaren Gen-Bausteinen bereit, welche in lebende Organismen, besonders in Modellorganismen, wie E. coli, eingebracht werden können.  Die teilnehmenden Studenten-Teams werden mit den benötigten Gen-Bausteinen, auch „BioBricks“ genannt, ausgestattet und bearbeiten über mehrere Monate ihr eigenes Forschungsprojekt.  Jedes Jahr wird das als „Registry of Standard Biological Parts“ bezeichnete Register von den mitwirkenden iGEM-Teams um weitere „BioBricks“ erweitert. Diese sind dann in den folgenden Jahren ebenfalls für die iGEM-Teilnehmer zugänglich und können von diesen für ihre eigenen Projekte genutzt werden.

Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Lab Book#FluID_-_-_TEXT.html,"PotD was successfully purified and characterized this week. SBP was still unobservable in induced 150ml cultures so 3 L cultures containing pQE80-L-SBP were set up.
27/7: Overnight Cultures for SBP Expression Assays and SDS-PAGE and Western Blot of PotD
Aim of experiment: To set up a 150 ml overnight culture containing pQE80-L-SBP for sub-culturing tomorrow and to run an SDS-PAGE and Western Blot the PotD samples from Friday.
Protocols Used: SBP: Overnight Cultures Note: 150 ml of LB was used and 150 µl of each antibiotic. PotD: SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Note: The membrane was left blocking overnight.
Results: N/A
Next Steps: 150 ml of fresh LB will be inoculated tomorrow with 7.5 ml of the overnight cultures containing pQE80-L-SBP. The PotD Western Blot will be completed tomorrow.
28/7: SBP Expression Assay and Completion of PotD Westen Blot
Aim of experiment: To set up day cultures using the overnight cultures from yesterday and test for expression of LbpA 6 hours after induction.
Protocols Used: Protein Expression Test Note: 150 ml of fresh LB was innoculated with 7.5ml of the overnight cultures. Only an uninduced control and an 1 mM IPTG induced culture was set up. The samples were not blotted, they were only ran on an SDS gel.
Results: SBP: Nothing was observable on the SDS gel. PotD: Figure 8
Next Steps: Since PotD has now been successful purified, the next step is to attach a fluorescent nanobead to the protein. Hopefully, this will be attempted in the coming weeks. Even though SBP was not visible on the SDS gel, 3 L cultures will be set up this week to try and harvest the protein since the culture size may be too small.
29/7: Overnight Cultures for 3L Culture
Aim of experiment: To set up overnight cultures containing pQE80-L-SBP for the 3L day cultures that will be grown tomorrow.
Protocols Used: Overnight Cultures Note: One 150ml overnight culture was set up using 150µl of each antibiotic.
Results: N/A
Next Steps: The 3L culture will be set up tomorrow allowed to grow to OD600 of 0.6-1 and then SBP expression induced with 1mM IPTG and grown for "

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," which synthetic biologists can     immediately recognize and utilize during the construction of unique     Biobricks. Additionally unique part names will be helpful to identify     the devices with more than one Biobrick in their constructs. Assignment     of unique and distinct names for parts describing their nature and content     will be helpful to researchers for the recognition of and search for     the parts.
Headings Selected From Previous Entry Forms for Indication of Standardized     Information
=========================================
=========================================
Table 1: The table above basically describes and designates     qualities of parts which identifies their compositions and demonstrates     the status of previously assigned standards. PartID refers to the unique     ID number for parts including atomic parts and assemblies. PartName     refers to the given unique names to parts. Bricks, refers to the shortcut     names which specifies atomic parts. ImageIDs, refers to individual or     combination of numbers that are assigned by us. RFCs refers to the states     of parts based on RFC standards.
iGEM both provides individual, atomic parts and pre-combined constructs     such as devices and systems. Availability of combined constructs is     important to the researchers as combining individual bio-bricks one     at a time will be very time consuming. These previously merged constructs,     serve as the repository for puzzle and they can be used for different     purposes. Up to date the largest and most trustworthy source, for synthetic     biology and its components, is iGEM’s parts registry. In 2010, iGEM     provided over 1000 parts that have initiated many projects. Having more     atomic parts available in the iGEM’s repository, will lead to the design     of more complex and robust constructs, and we would have a better chance     to design different constructs for unique purposes. Also, for the parts     that are already available, extra steps needs to be taken for the quality     control and surveillance of these products. The quality control of the     information for the parts is essential for the future of iGEM and synthetic     biology. Even though we have found pre-determined RFC standards useful     and included those to our standardized template, some individual parts     still requires re-organization of the information as RFC standards alone     for the functionality of parts, does not satisfy the needs for wet lab     biologists.
Without a question there is an urgent need to build a distinct and     specific database well organized with its own standards for synthetic     biology; however, development of such a database is not an easy task.

Reaction From Specific Prospective Customers
Our product is at an early stage of development and therefore, demonstration of a full prototype is not yet a possibility. However, we have had the opportunity to talk to numerous potential end-users about our technology, its application, and the potential market value. We spoke to HydroQual Laboratories, one of the major service providers of testing for a myriad of oil sands companies. They are a cornerstone for monitoring samples from oil and gas industries as well as other applications. Our talks with HydroQual have led to a validation that there is a use for our product in industry. HydroQual is owned by the large service/consulting based company Golder Associates. Golder also has identified value in our product and are interested in gaining further information about how FREDsense Technologies and Golder could be working together.
Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) and the Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI), two oil sands consortia that analyze prospective oil sands technologies, have also provided a large amount of input about our technology, and have been interested in seeing its development. This suggests oil sands producers have identified our technology as having promise within the industry.
Selling Activities
Penetrating this market requires that we sell our product to as many commercially accredited laboratories as well as service companies as possible. To gain a foothold in this market, three major targets have been identified as the leading laboratories who handle oil and gas related toxicological samples:
ALS Environmental - Most water and sedimentary analyses
AXYS Laboratories - Sediment analysis of toxins such as PAHs
HydroQual Laboratories - Water and sediment toxicology data
It will be critical that we partner with industry in order to demonstrate our product has a usable track record to correctly predict the toxicology of samples. This, along with government approved regulations and the clear advantages provided by our system, will allow us to achieve success in selling our product.
Clients will receive quotes for requests above 100-cartridge orders.  Pricing will contain cost of unit, shipping, and appropriate taxes. This strategy will allow us to competitively price bulk orders, saving both time and money for our company and our customers (see operations section for more information).  Clients will be billed for purchases and given a 1 month window for accounts receivable.  For some companies in the oil and gas sector, payment often times is made at 4 month intervals, which may make it so that we change our practices to allow for 120 days account receivable.
Advertising Plan
A multipronged approach to advertising will be taken to"
