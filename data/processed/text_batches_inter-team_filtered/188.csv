For the Lpp-OmpA-MBP which is displayed on the surface, previous work shows that over 20000 copies of mbps are expressed on the membrane per cell, with metal stoichiometries of ~1.0 Hg(II) per MBP monomer. But at the same time, the membrane protein consumes more energy. In contrast, the copy number of cytoplasmic MBP is 560000~800000 per cell, with a stoichiometries of ~0.455Hg(II) per MBP monomer at low concentration of Hg(II) and ~1.12±0.18 Hg(II) per MBP monomer at high concentration of Hg(II) and the energy needed to express the protein is less than the membrane protein. The data for Dsba-MBP, which is expressed in the periplasmic space is between MBP and Lpp-Ompa-MBP. However, given that our bioabsorbent is aimed to tackle the water with trace of Hg(II), we find us are trapped in the dilemma due to the contradiction between copy number of proteins and the absorption capacity if only one type of MBP is chosen. To make full advantage of the space in the cell and reduce the energy-assumption to the least, we assemble these three parts together, expecting MBP to express and play roles in cytoplasm, periplasm space and on the membrane simultaneously.

August 28 - September 3
It’s the first week back to school for a lot of us which gave us very little time to do some lab work. We attempted to assemble Cas9 once again. However, there was an issue with contamination so the experiment was invalid. We started talking about doing a writeup on the modeling that we have been doing alongside our projects. With the competition approaching, we are beginning to look for events that allow us to talk about our project and get some experience presenting.
September 4 - September 10
This week signaled the second week back to school for team. We attempted to use Gibson assembly for the Cas9 plasmid into an A3 and a C3 backbone, but it was unsuccessful. We also attempted to purify TLP using a His-tag miniprep kit, but it did not yield any significant results. Now that the semester has started, we anticipate that lab work might slow down due to time constraints.
September 11 - September 23
We made cryostocks of all three of our metal plasmids. We also completed our TLP+HLYABC plasmid. Unfortunately, our Gibson mix seems to lack efficiency so we decided to purchase a new one. We also were not successful in attaching an RBS to pAND+RBS+TetR+TT+pTet. This week, we were making lesson plans for some of our anticipated high school visits.
September 18 - September 24
This weekend, we went to a Young Researchers conference and explained our project through a poster. We noticed some flaws in our presentation and our poster and are working on fixing it. We did some preliminary shaker testing and incubation tests for our hardware project. We attempted to ligate Cas9 into a C3 backbone and a T7 promoter with RFP. We ran the Cas9 on a gel, but it was unsuccessful. We started looking at different methods to raise funds for our team and we have been planning some of our high school visits to teach students about synthetic biology.
September 25 - October 1
This week, we attempted to ligate the Cas9 with a C3 backbone using Gibson assembly, but it was unsuccessful. We performed some basic fluorescence testing with the copper and zinc plasmids. There wasn't much difference between the induced and uninduced samples of the zinc sample. There was some RFP fluorescence from the copper plasmid when induced in a 100 uM concentration of copper.

We can however analyze the doping detection field as a whole. We spoke with Mr. Olivier de Hon from the Dutch anti-doping authority on how to enter this market. “ What matters in the doping world is this: is it effective and scientifically validated? If the answer is two times “yes”, laboratories can use your method or will even have to use it obligatory. You need to convince the WADA, and more specifically the Laboratory Expert Group.” This is the way to realize implementation.
“What matters in the doping world is this: is it effective and scientifically validated? If the answer is two times “yes”, laboratories can use your method or will even have to use it obligatory. You need to convince the WADA, and more specifically the Laboratory Expert Group.”
Olivier De Hon, Dutch Doping authority
Before we can start convincing the WADA, we will need to pass two important first hurdles. We need to have enough funding to continue development, and we need to ensure that once we have convinced the WADA, we remain their detection method of choice. As a first mover, this is an important consideration. We need to continue being the best gene doping detection method even after others enter the market. This is important: by being the best we can be, we force other methods in development to be even better, thus helping the field advance more rapidly.
The steps then, to enter the gene doping detection market, are clear:
Identify how we can develop the best possible detection method.
Gather enough funding to complete development.
Demonstrate a method that is efficient.
Demonstrate a method that is properly scientifically validated.
Implementation by convincing the WADA Laboratory Expert Group of the efficiency and scientific validation of the method.
This is the road to letting our detection method have a positive impact in the doping world.
Realization
We have started taking the steps needed to reach our final goal of convincing the WADA Laboratory Expert group and creating a positive impact in the doping world.
Our first step
Our first step is to identify the best possible detection method.         For this, we need two important sources of knowledge. We need to know our customer, and we need to gather expert knowledge on our process. This step has been completed as part of our integrated human practices .
We analysed our key customers, the anti-doping agencies, via a value proposition canvas (figure 2). This value proposition canvas is a tool to investigate and map the added value of the product you want to sell, to ensure that it is a"

Decoys and Tough Decoys (TuDs)
We wanted something that would provide a tight double repression system with a very distinct change between on and off. The TuDs and Decoys design were originally inspired by the “Vectors expressing efficient RNA decoys achieve the long-term suppression of specific microRNA activity in mammalian cells,” paper. We copied their designs and wanted to reproduce the results in our lab. To do so, we ordered TuDs and decoys both with and without bulges. The bulges are designed to disrupt RISC complex activity; something which degrades short RNA like our decoys in the cell.

UCSC iGEM
This year, our team collaborated with UCSC iGEM because our projects relied on using the same organism, namely Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7492. We gave them the strain because their lab did not have it, and we also discussed a number of strategies on how to take care of the bacteria and culture them properly. In return, UCSC iGEM was very helpful in giving us advice as a new team. We were very inspired by their project from last year, and they even helped us get in contact with a regional director at the American Diabetes Association. In addition, they offered to assist us with the tagatose detection phase of our project because their campus had the detection column that we were looking for.
CC-TP iGEM
We also thought that it would be important to collaborate with teams that were near to us. Therefore, we reached out to the high school students across from UCSD who also participate in iGEM. Because our projects had different focuses, we decided to discuss presentation strategies and general tips on how to prepare for the Jamboree. The captain of the team has gone to the competition for the past two year teams, and she helped us start thinking about the structure and narrative of our presentation. We also discussed the possibility of media exposure for both teams on the San Diego Tribune.
SDA iGEM
As a team we wanted to focus on making synthetic biology accessible to as many individuals as possible. Therefore, we invited a high school student, Ayse, to intern with the Golden Lab during the summer and sit in on our meetings and get a sense of how to run an iGEM team. Eventually, Ayse went back to her school, San Dieguito Academy, and we gave a presentation to the Intro to Biotech class. Afterwards, several students from SDA reached out to us and expressed interest in starting up a team. We sat down with them and showed them all our resources for starting up a team; best of luck at next year’s competition!

2. The bacteria will not need to produce lipase to metabolize sunflower oil, therefore nitrogen will only be used for biomass production.
3. Polysaccharide nor di-rhamnolipid will be produced.
Visually, modified model will be as the figure below.
Equations
Following are equations after simplification based on points above. Values used for calculation were based on Henkel’s paper unchanged (Tabel 1).
We tested our model using the starting concentration of 100 g/L glycerol and 3 g/L NH4. It showed that our rhamnolipid production started just when the nitrogen is exhausted. If this is the case, our nitrogen system would turn on and suppress the xpression of rhlAB before production, so there would be no rhamnolipid production.
Therefore, we developed a new system which we used throughout the summer.

UPF-CRG_Barcelona,2016,Team:UPF-CRG Barcelona#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," their concentration to healthy levels and reduce the probability of developing colorectal cancer.
The second idea was inspired by the fact that polyamines are found in high concentrations in urine in cancer patients with a very low variation between patients, according to some studies. Despite this good correlation, measuring the amount of polyamines in a liquid sample would take days - even weeks - to get to the lab and return. Moreover, polyamines are measured usually through High Performance Liquid Cromatography, which is an expensive test considering the bad properties of the polyamines. Following this idea, we decided to develop a tumor risk marker using yet once more synthetic biology. Engineered bacteria dried frozen in a strip would, that through a urine sample, alert the user whether he/she has or hasn’t a high probability of suffering from cancer. Bacteria would be provided with a sensing genetic system so that when high levels of polyamines are detected in their environment, they would change color and thus the strip too. Depending on the purple saturation of the device, the cancer risk level could be deduced.
Methods
The Probiotic
To accomplish our first objective, the creation of polyamine-degrading bacteria, first of all we needed to make Escherichia Coli auxotrophic for polyamines so that they needed to uptake the polyamines from the medium to survive. This way, they would diminish their levels in the colon and at the same time reduce the independent living capabilities of the cell, to avoid any possible invasion of our own microbiome. In order to get this, we initially decided to make speC (consitutive onrnithine decarboxylase), speF (biodegradative ornithine decarbozylase) and speB (agmatine ureohydrolase) knock-outs, so that they were deprived of the enzymes involved in the production of putrescine, which is the  precursor of the polyamine synthesis. However, we saw that speF was not necessary since it was an enzyme that only worked at very acid media which was not the case of this study. So, we decided to create our PACO (Escherichia Coli Auxotrophic Bcteria which we made this way because it sounds cool). We used Crispr-Cas9 (pCas9 from Addgene) to generate these knock-outs, for which purpose we designed pairs of primers that annealed with the first bases of these genes. However, we realized that this were not easy knock-outs since they are compromising the survival of the cell because polyamines are completely necessary for living. For this"

Apart from the science related events, we have talked to many individual stakeholders and integrated their feedback into our design, as can be seen from our Value Sensitive Design .
3.1 Value Sensitive Design
Based on the interaction with all stakeholders we then created a Value Sensitive Design to improve our strengths and reduce our weaknesses to satisfy everyone’s needs and preferences. In figure 8, an overview is given of our values, how they are related to values we identified through interaction and the design requirements that we implemented based on this. Below you can read more about how the stakeholders have influenced us in every step of our project.

There have been many people that have had impact on our project as can be seen in figure 9. Below we list the ones that have directly impacted the paths we walked in our project and how these stakeholders influenced us.
Figure 9. Interaction figure of important stakeholder contact.
Sample Preparation
The Dutch National blood bank, Sanquin, has been of great influence for the development of our sample preparation. Sanquin is specialized in blood analysis and has it's own research departments to keep improving and developing new methods for the analysis of blood. Sanquin is responsible for all donor blood in the Netherlands, but is for example also specialized in tests focusing on the fetal cell free DNA in a mother's blood. This knowledge about analysis of DNA extracted from blood was exactly what was needed to develop a secure and optimized sample preparation for our project, ADOPE.
Two visits were made to Sanquin, one general introduction visit and one specialized visit where the specific DNA extraction method was taught to some of us. Aicha Ait Soussand and Ellen van der Schoot of the Experimental Immunohematology group of Sanquin helped us by explaining how they work with small fragments and DNA extraction and gave us access to their optimized extraction protocol used with the QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit. Since isolation of fragmented cell free DNA out of blood and white blood cells can be quite a hard challenge because of the low concentrations, the experience of Sanquin helped a lot in optimizing our DNA extraction method. In addition, they pointed at the delay in red blood cell development, which"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid"
BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Proof#test2_-_-_TEXT.html," different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased contradicting with the expected results.                                 Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. The circuits are shown in the Fig.9.                                 So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the (序号) with no arabinose added.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the CI-pR circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram of the relationship of the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％, the RFP can hardly express. The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with kill gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

SMS_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SMS Shenzhen#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," “suicide design” inside our E.coli, E.coli that are unfortunately dropped onto the plants will kill themselves instead of causing any problem.
- Since scale insects often appear in fruit trees and crops, we consider that it is extremely important for us to ensure that our Pesticide Mate is harmless. Besides, if people use our Pesticide Mate at home, we certainly don’t want them to get any hurt from E.coli. Thus, by adding this design to our E.coli, we can avoid any potential problem E.coli may bring.
- In addition, pesticide residue is a great concern as well. By using our Pesticide Mate, there will be no concern about pesticide residue!
3. Cost-Friendly!
- Since most of the farmers in China are actually live in poverty, we absolutely want them to have a better life. We hope our project can be beneficial to them not only by letting them avoid scale insect problem but also by saving them a large amount of money. Therefore, they would be able to support their families and put food on tables.
- Cultivation of E.coli is simple and convenience for companies, and the cost of making this Pesticide Mate is very low. Thus, our Pesticide Mate will be really cheap for farmers to buy them and enjoy the advantage brought by our Pesticide Mate.
- Our Pesticide Mate will also decrease the amount of chemical pesticide use, so farmers would save lots of money on buying chemical pesticides. By developing this Pesticide Mate, we sincerely want to benefit farmers in our country and help them to gain a better life, and after avoiding scale insect problem, they would harvest more for sure.
4. Usage-Friendly!
- Since we wish to commercialize our Pesticide Mate and make all those advantages come true, we collaborate with team SIAT-SCIE to enhance our project.
- The enzyme that team SIAT-SCIE found in tardigrades-microscopic animals enables our E. coli to endure harsh circumstance but still maintain activity. Then, we could dry up our E. coli and turn it into powder form.
- After that, those powder-like E. coli can be packed and transport to different stores and cities. During this transportation, the activity of our powder-like E. coli is still remained and can be resurrected. Therefore, when this product comes into the market, the only thing that customers have to do is mix it with water and spray the special water on the infected plants."

Overview
Bovine mastitis is the most costly agricultural disease, plaguing dairy cattle worldwide. It costs the United States around $2 billion annually, half of which is due to subclinical mastitis [1]. Traditional treatments usually involve the use of antibiotics. However, the use of antibiotics has led to increasing concerns of resistance as well as negative implications on human health. Furthermore, the development and synthesis of new antibiotics is slow and may not necessarily have the desired effects.
Bacteriocins are natural antimicrobial peptides secreted by bacteria to gain competitive advantage in their natural ecosystems. Functionally, bacteriocins kill target cells via different mechanisms, including pore formation, inhibition of translation, inhibition of transcription, and inhibition of cell wall synthesis. The use of bacteriocins as antimicrobial drugs has three significant advantages. First, bacteriocins are known to not be harmful to humans. One such group of bacteriocins, the Nisin family, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a food preservative [2]. Second, bacteriocins have a remarkably fast evolution rate [3]. Finally, bacteriocins are known to be very specific to certain species within the same genus, although some are known to have broad spectrum activity as well. This diversity among bacteriocins, along with their safety for human consumption, makes them a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics.
Figure 1: Aureocin A53 is a tryptophan-rich 6 kDa peptide with four alpha helices.
Despite presence of protease cleavage sites, it is resistant to degradation [4].
The pathogens of bovine mastitis can be divided broadly into Gram positive and Gram negative species, as well as contagious or environmental species. Our choice of bacteriocins is such that we can target the pathogens from all categories. Some potent bacteriocins have incredibly complex post-translational modifications, but we have also chosen ones that don’t require any modifications"

Interlab
Our team has participated in the Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study this year. The Interlab study aims on solving the problem of reliability and repeatability of synthetic biology study. This year we were asked to measure green fluorescent protein, which is usually used as a measurement marker. We followed the experiment protocol strictly to make sure our data are valid. After two weeks' lab work, we got the data we needed after several attempts.
Calibration Protocol
Three calibration measurements were done by following the calibration protocol, including an OD reference point at 600nm, one particle standard curve and one fluorescence standard curve.

I am a 19 year old student that just finish high school and now is entering university to study engineering in computational software. I started to study programming at the start of high school, being now the coordinator of wiki in the group, and taking care of the software. Maybe some people call me crazy, but I think this is the reason I can continue to move forward to a maybe uncertainty future, but sure that I'm capable of doing all the things that I propose. Maybe I really don't know what to do in my future, but i know that it will be awesome because I want to go against the world at my own game. GenettiX for me is a place different to all the world, it will let you realize how awesome the people are.

I am a 18 year old student cursing my last year of high school at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Mexico. For the first time this year I had the privilege to lead our school’s iGem team, and it’s been the most challenging, fun and engaging activity I’ve ever taken part of. I’ve always been interested in biology, chemistry and physics; but I like how iGem projects integrate what we do in the lab and take it even further, right into the real world. Overall, the iGem experience is without a doubt a fantastic opportunity to get more involved with science and actual research even before college: a life-changing experience I won’t hesitate to recommend to any student interested in the topic!

Week 8 (21/08-"
ArtScienceBangalore,2010,Team:ArtScienceBangalore#NoteBook_-_-_TEXT.html,", the design of ecosystems requires a completely different approach.
Yashas came across a chapter in a book by Kevin Kelly about designing Synthetic Ecosystems. Here's a quote, the sentiment very much echoes in the discussion that we had after watching The Clearing last week.
""We might as well develop a science of synthetic ecosystem creation since we've been creating them anyway in a haphazard fashion. Many archeo- ecologists believe that the entire spectrum of early humanoid activities -- hunting, grazing, setting prairie fires, and selective herb gathering -- forged an ""artificial"" ecology upon the wilderness, that is, an ecology greatly shaped by human arts. In fact, all that we think of as natural virgin wilderness is abundant with artificiality and the mark of human activity.""
Kelly then lists a number of considerations when designing an ecosystem intentionally:
Microorganisms do most of the work.
Soil is an organism. It is alive. It breathes.
Make redundant food webs.
Increase diversity gradually.
If you can't provide a physical function, you need to simulate it.
The atmosphere communicates the state of the whole system.
Listen to the system; see where it wants to go.
What would it mean to design an ecosystem in the context of iGEM. For one thing, it would have to be a self-contained, as it wouldn't be possible to release GM organisms in the wild. A bacterial ecosystem might be the best place to start.
Most of the lab techniques and protocols that deal with cloning and culturing bacteria are designed to keep everything as sterile as possible. We deal with mono-cultures of a specific bacteria, grown in an antibiotic environment to avoid contamination. However there are techniques that have been developed to study 'multicultural' ecosystems. The Winogradsky Column is a tool to grow multiple type of bacteria across a simulution of a more natural bacterial environment.
We asked the students to build a widowgradsky column, Jugaad-style.
It will take several weeks before anything interesting happens as the development of a natural ecosystem is a slow process (another interesting thing to consider when attempting to design one!).
In the meantime, the students have been thinking about how they might like to develop this idea further, perhaps towards their iGEM competition entry. Here's an idea from Karthik. It asks the question of whether a bacterial ecosystem could be designed to act like a multi-cellular organism:
Karthik came up with the idea of a moving eye: an enclosed glass vessel containing synthetic bacteria, floating on water.In the centre of the vessel is a colony of light sensitive bacteria on the surface of a"

The filter could be used in conjunction with the colour sensor, or with a basic light sensor and LED’s.  It is going to take various tests and trials to determine which option is the most logical and successful and will provide accurate results for this important test. In order to construct our circuits, we purchased a soldering station which will potentially be useful for teams that come after us.
In regards to the beginning of quantitative modelling we are breaking the system into smaller parts and starting to model each small part with the potential of combining all of these parts to model the entire system and the parameters. We are going to being with the reporter RFP which has already been plated and is ready to undergo testing, we are currently waiting on our purchase orders with our materials to see if the colour sensor is able to accurately detect this colour, as well as determine the true sensitivity of the device so that this is not a limiting factor.  Additionally we are going to look at every reaction and process taking place biologically in the system and start dissecting the system and working backwards from the reporter.  After this has been completed we are planning on finding the most sensitive components that will have a positive impact on time and are the “bottleneck” of the device.  Using these discovered factors we are going to apply them to the system and measure to see if any change has taken place and if our model is an accurate representation of the mathematical processes occurring.  Additionally we are are planning on looking more literature of modelling biological systems and into some of the build in features of the Simbiology toolbox.
Our plans from next week consist of contacting another lab that has a plate reader that will be able to automatically measure absorbance and RFP cell count in the bacteria culture transformed with RFP.  This will give us initial data from the reporter to begin working with.
Week 9: June 30th - July 4th
We started this week by exploring how our colour sensor operates, so when we receive this component, we can begin testing immediately. Additionally, we discovered a tutorial using the ColorPal sensor with Arduino Uno which included the sample code. (http://learn.parallax.com/colorpal-arduino-demo).  In order to easily convert the output of the sensor to colours, we downloaded the ColorPal Color Matching Program. The program has the capability to assist with calibration of the sensor when detecting black and white surfaces. The"

Improving the registry one BioBrick at a time
The WashU-PSU iGEM team tested 2 genes of interest in order to overproduce ATP (pck and pgk) and 3 genes of interest in order to overproduce electron donors (fldA, petF, and pfo). This resulted in 6 total constructs: two for ATP and four for electron donors. From these constructs, pck produced the most ATP and petF (and petF-pfo) successfully produced reduced eletron donors. Because of this, we chose to turn these genes into BioBricks. Additionally, we decided to turn the inducible promoter from our electron donor constructs, pTet, into a BioBrick, which included its repressor protein, TetR. Previous parts had only the pTet promoter region, making it a constitutive promoter. Our part allows for pTet to be an inducible promoter, controlled by the addition of aTc. Finally, we created a composite part with petF and TetR-pTet, which was the relevant gene sequence in the petF construct.
Additionally, we characterized an HSP BioBrick that had no previous data for our Gold medal requirement.

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PS_-_-_TEXT.html,"in mononucleotide (FMN) by another enzyme known as UbiX [8].  We now had a complete pathway to produce styrene in E. coli.
Step one:  Get the genes
In order to get the genes that encoded our three enzymes we extracted the gene directly from a host organism, synthesized the gene using Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), and, when possible, ordered the preexisting part from the iGEM registry.
Our first enzyme PAL was previously characterized by the University of British Columbia 2013 iGEM team.  We ordered their biobrick ( BBa_K1129003 ) from the registry.  However, this PAL gene was extracted from Streptomyces maritimus, which according to the literature had a very ineffective PAL enzyme [4].  So in addition to ordering UCB’s PAL biobrick we also ordered from IDT a codon optimized (for E. coli) version of the PAL gene from Anabaena variabilis.  We chose the PAL gene from Anabaena variabilis because it was well characterized in literature and had been shown to be the most effective version of the enzyme [7].
For our second enzyme, FDC, we both extracted the gene directly from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and ordered this gene codon optimized (for E. coli) from IDT.
For our last enzyme UbiX we both extracted the gene directly from E. coli and ordered this gene with a FLAG tag from IDT.  As we will explain later on, we added a FLAG tag sequence to the end of all of our synthesized genes in order to extract and purify the protein for in-vitro assays.
SDS PAGE Gel with Mark 12 ladder
Step two:  Put the genes into plasmids
After obtaining our genes, we inserted them into a pSB1C3 plasmid from the registry that had a T7 promoter and RBS ( BBa_K525998 ). We confirmed our gene insert through DNA sequencing with VF2 and VR primers.
The FDC gene we extracted from yeast has an illegal SpeI restriction enzyme site within its sequence, rendering the plasmids with the FDC gene incompatible with biobrick assembly methods.  To solve this we successfully performed site directed mutagenesis on this site [3].
Step three:  Turn genes into proteins
Now that we had all our genes in plasmids with a promoter and RBS, we transformed our three synthesized genes (PAL, FDC, UbiX) into T7 expressing NEB E"

6 positive controls (we know which DNA sequences these bind to)
3 of them being the F1 fingers of Zif268, OZ052, and OZ123
3 of them being ZF F1s derived from CODA.
90 generated sequences, picked from a subset of the chip
These are picked evenly across the 9,150 sequences generated on the cihp for the TGG triplet F1 target from the colorblindness ""bottom finger"" target, GTG GGA TGG.  This particular target was chosen because the F2/F1 is a GNNTNN combo, which might be more likely to get hits from our chip generation sequences.
The primer tag sequences for the 90 generated sequence subset will be the same as they are on the chip (for the sake of explanation, we will refer to them now as P1F and P1R in this paragraph).  The positive controls will be flanked immediately by the same primers as the generated subset so that we can amplify everything as one pool altogether should we need to (so this will be P1F and P1R).  However, we will also put an additional set of primers outside of the P1F/P1R primers for the positive controls so that we can specifically amplify the positive control subpool, should we want to.  These primers will be the same as the primers for the positive control on the chip (which will be called P2F and P2R here).
To recap, on the chip we will have the following oligos :
45750 other oligos for the 5 other target sequences Oligos (TGG set, 9150 total):   | P1F | type II binding site | generated F1 | type II binding site | P1R | Oligos (+ control, 100 total):  | P2F | type II binding site |  control F1  | type II binding site | P2R |
In our test pool of 96 sequences, we will have two types of oligos (note the two pairs of primers around the positive controls):
Oligo (TGG set, 90 total):          | P1F | type II binding site | generated F1 | type II binding site | P1R | Oligo (+ control, 6 total):   | P2F | P1F | type II binding site | generated F1 | type II binding site | P1R | P2R |

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," different points of view from our different countries and we managed to write a great report out of those discussions. Unfortunately, we barely covered three areas of the issues concerning synthetic biology, therefore there are still many other things we could still discuss about.
A word from each team concerning their experience on that collaboration: Toulouse-INSA-UPS: “We are so very lucky to have been able to collaborate all together on this subject. As we discussed above, the ethics behind biological research have become more important than ever, and in the context of our growing and changing world, we need to focus on just that: we are a part of the world, not just our country or our iGEM project. This humans practices-oriented collaboration has shown us all the diversity in this competition, and we hope that next year’s projects can unite even more different cultural backgrounds in a common goal.”
NUSGEM (Singapore Team-A): “NUSGEM is happy to have worked with Team Toulouse-INSA-IPS and Team ULaval on this piece about the bioethical, economic and cultural considerations of Synthetic Biology, its businesses and its technology. The human practices based research conducted by each of our teams has been instrumental in helping us understand the different facets of synthetic biology. Learning aside, this collaboration also served to illustrate how collaboration between different teams is important not merely a transactional relationship, but a synergistic one. We learned more than the sum of our individual sections combined, as we have gained a more holistic understanding of the field of synthetic biology.”
ULaval: “Here at Team ULaval we consider ourselves extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to work with Toulouse-INSA-UPS and NUSGEM Singapore iGEM teams. The collaborative work done on the human practices aspect of the project allowed us to look at synthetic biology with a new eye and with a different perspective. As synthetic biology is an ever-changing domain, we need to constantly re-evaluate how it affects society. We think that by working with teams from around the world allowed us to think more critically about the implications of our work. As a team that participates to IGEM for the first time, being able to work with veteran teams was invaluable. We look forward to meeting our collaborators in person!”

If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.

It has also been incorporated a red fluorescent protein (RFP) ( BBa_E1010 ) fused with an ALA-ALA-ALA linker  to one of the shell proteins (csoS1A) and a tag sequence that expressed the biotin ligase recognition peptide (BLRP)  (BBa_), which can be biotinylated in the presence of the biotin ligase BirA enzyme native from Escherichia coli. This process allows later on a strong interaction between the biotin and streptavidin that can be used for purification purposes, specifically as an extraction method for recombinant or protein complexes.
The operon was obtained from the pHnCBS1D plasmid (plasmid provided by David Savage, Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley). The BLRP sequence was an adaptation from the plasmid provided by the INTACT method (“The INTACT method for cell type–specific gene expression and chromatin profiling in Arabidopsis thaliana”.

4 More Plots
Experiment:
Different concentrations of IPTG were added to a 96-well plate of e-coli Top 10 cells containing LacI-RFP genetic constructs. Here we measured the optical density of the cells over-time, for different concentrations of IPTG to monitor the effects in the culture. The IPTG growth curve results are plotted below:
Figure 1: Effects of [IPTG] on cell growth: Note that the high initial OD value results due to cultures having grown for 1 hour prior the start of the measuring phase.
Analysis
Simply plotting the raw data does not give sufficient information about possible trends.  Therefore, further analysis was performed where: 1. The blank absorbance level was estimated
Figure 2: Variation of the blank well data in monitoring absorbance A1, A2, B1, B2: 4 wells containing blank M9 media.
2. We can see from figure 1 that there is an exponential growth phase that lasts for about 3 hours, so in order to extract the trend in growth rate, the ln(Absorbance) data was plotted over these time points (See figures 3,4,5).
3. In order to extract the trend, a linear regression method was applied and the growth rates were calculated.
Figure 3: Log plots of the exponential growth phase for different IPTG concentrations
We can see that the growth rate corresponds to the gradient of the linear phase in the graph. This was done for two parallel wells, hence why we have plotted two parallel lines (Scroll to bottom of the page to see all of the plots).
Results
Growth rates lie within a range of 0.1-0.2 /hour.
The standard deviation was found to be: 0.0093
Conclusion
Growth rate does not vary significantly for different concentrations of IPTG. This means that it does not have a significant impact on growth rate.

In the wet lab study, we measured both the expression level of YFP and RFP to validate the expected performance of the MINI system in comparation of normal promoters and terminators whose expression level are measured as well.
Meanwhile, we monitored the growth rate of the recombinant yeast to specify the expression of MINI system at a particular living stage. Moreover, we conducted qPCR towards corresponding protein in or-der for a further validation of MINI system’s strong expression on a post-transcriptional level.

We decided to use pSB3K3 as the other backbone to replace pSB3K5. We then created linearized backbones by digestion. We started to develop primers so that we could amplify our parts once we received them.
Members: Elisa and Lining
6/26/18
We sent out our part sequences to be synthesized through IDT, using our two plasmid ideas. The parts all had about 30 base pairs of overlap so we could put them together in the cell. We also designed our parts so there is a ribosomal binding site between the start of each enzyme, so they can be transcribed and translated into proteins individually if need be.
Members: Elisa and Lining

IDT was unable to synthesize all of our DNA sequences, so we had to break several of our sequences into smaller ones. Due to this, we had to create new primers for amplification of our new blocks. We also practiced running an SDS page, making sure that we had all the proper chemicals to do so.

To confirm the integration of the plasmid the test for sucrose metabolism will be carried out on Monday.
Modelling
Preparation work for modelling, learning to use VCell software. We started working our way through simple tutorials to get more familiar with the program before doing ""real work"".
Cell Shape model 
The structure and function of cytoskeleton were studied. The cell behaves like an isotropic fluid in terms of shape and movement, therefore some of the factors which influence the shape could be identified: Cell Volume, surface area, surface tension, hydrostatic pressure.
It turns out that eukaryotic cytoskeleton is characterised as a two-phase viscous, responsive and contractile liquid. If bacterial cytoskeleton is similar, it would complicate the modelling by a fair bit. More insight into the structure and physical properties of bacterial cytoskeleton is needed. In terms of cell growth and division it will be useful to look into the properties of FtsZ and MreB as well as properties of the vesicular membrane and physical triggers of the process of 'blebbing'. So that's a job for Monday.

University_of_Sheffield,2008,Team:University of Sheffield #Project_-_-_TEXT.html," an approach could bring together sensitivity and efficiency of a receptor on one hand  and reliability and good level of understanding of signal transduction pathway native to modified organism on the other.
Protein analysis
We want to use this approach in constructing a biosensor monitoring cholera contamination of water. Fusion receptor would consist of two parts, a signal receiver domain from CqsS, protein which is native to V. cholera and binds to CAI-1 molecules (autoinducers synthesised by V.cholerae) and signal conveyer domain of BarA which is a protein present on the surface of E.coli cell  and that passes signal downstream to DNA.
Our choice of BarA protein was driven by similarity of those receptors. Both of them are multisubunit molecules of similar topology and use the same method of signal transduction – they belong to Two Component Regulatory System (TCRS). Such a system includes two cooperating proteins a histidine kinase located in the membrane and its partner response regulator.  Histidine kinase detects signal from the environment and autophosphorylates itself at the His residue at its cytoplasmic surface. The phosphate group is then passed onto aspartate residue on a response regulator that interacts directly with the DNA or relays signal further on.
Both CqsS and BarA are histidine kinases. Their analysis reveals that they contain sequences that belongs to the same superfamilies -  HATPase_c and REC. 3D structures of those proteins haven not been established yet however multisequence alignment and comparison with proteins and protein's domains belonging to the same families revealed conserved structural patterns and probable similar topology. Their function and mechanism of action is most likely conserved. From there we deduced that we should combine N-terminal domain of CqsS protein that is responsible for recognition of autoinducers and autophosphorylation and C-terminal domain of BarA that accepts phosphate and relays it through aspartate downstream.
Final remarks
Big advantage is that we know exactly how the E.coli's native pathway we are employing works. Introduction of reporter system (e.g. GFP) within the site of DNA positively regulated by BarA should show if the stimulus we are sensing for is present in the environment. Shortly if E.coli shines water is contaminated by cholera. This could be general approach used
Few questions have to be addressed. Firstly, what is the concentration of autoinducers in water that corresponds to amount of pathogens recognised as contamination and if this amount high enough to trigger the response in the receptor. Second question asks how fusion would decrease efficiency of"

Famousse
Famousse (""Mousse"" means foam in french) is a gun that sprays an isolating material to fill walls. The fluid consists of bacteria that produce foam once in contact with oxygen and of yeasts that make CO2 holes in the foam. After a while, the foam solidifies and bacteria and yeasts die by apoptosis: the isolating material is finished.
RIDG pill
The RIDG pill (Régulateur intelligent Des Graisses or Intelligent Fat Regulator, IFR pill) is made out of bacteria that detect, once in the intestine, if the person suffers from obesity or anorexia thanks to hormone receptors. In case of obesity, the bacteria would respond to that input by secreting proteins that block lipid transporters in epithelial cells. In case of anorexia, the bacteria would secrete hormones that would make epithelial cells create more lipid transporters.
PestiBac
Bacteria substituting pesticides. These bacteria live on the leaves of the plants and secrete repelling substances. These bacteria have sensor in order to die if not in contact with the target plant or if they came in contact with animal's saliva. In addition they are modified to have a shorter lifetime, in order to limit population growth.
Luciolight
Luciolight is a Street Lamp made out of bacteria that copy biological circuit of fireflies.
Bacteriolavage
Bacteriolavage is a bacterial washing system to clean clothes with less water waste. Bacteria synthesize enzymes that degrade lipids and sugars in smaller particles that are more water-soluble, so that less water is consumed. Students used the concept of magnetic bacteria developed by the 2014 iGEM Berlin team to efficiently remove bacterias from clothes once the wash was finished.
Killpilus
Killpilus is a permanent hair removal cream. Bacteria contained in the preparation kill hair follicle stem cells. The team searched the internet for receptors specifically expressed in those stem cells to avoid off targets. For safety reasons, bacteria would commit suicide by apoptosis after one hour.
ConchitaColi
ConchitaColi cells digest dust and produce scented molecules. After the washing is finished, bacteria move towards a luminous bin where they die by apoptosis.
Healing+
""Healing+"" is a system to repair wounds. Mammalian cells circulating in the blood detect intrusion of pathogens and respond by mobilisation of collagen and platelets in wounds.

. We choose this example of PACE as our role model for testing of this highly complex method, needing the set-up of a continous culture, as well as a flow setup, demanding costly and highly sensitive hardware for its application. In the paper, Pu et al. grasp at evolving a small N-terminal domain of the T7RNAP for efficiently binding its N-terminal domain by help of two leucine zipper, strongly binding each other. Depending on their proximity, the two domains of the RNAP interact and can activate geneIII transcription. Taking this highly challenging experiment, we wanted build our own PACE device and investigate the general handling of the apparatus. We were first started with building up our PACE apparatus using the instructions of Kevin Esvelt back in 2011
RN44´
. For an accurate description of our PACE device and our procedure before starting PACE, please have a look at the Materials&Methods section. Thankfully, Bryan Dickinson´s lab was very helpful, so that they were sending us their constructs, strains and the phages they used for their evolution. Based on this, we could design our own constructs. Beyond that, we could quickly test our turbidostat, which we used instead of a chemostat, Dickinson and colleagues used for there PACE device. First, we aimed at cultivating our bacterial strains at an nearly constant optical density. This turbidostat-test was also used for evaluating the media consumption of the apparatus during an estimated PACE run suitable for iGEM conditions. Since the original PACE run has to include 29 days of continous evolution as well as ten different strains with different positive and negative selection stringencies, we were targeting at a shorter variant of this PACE experiment. By analyzing most of the data for the PACE run, we detected 3 of 7 essential mutations of the final variant of the N-terminal domain to be present in phages after only seven days of evolution. Outlining a more realistic example of a PACE run during a project implemented in only five wet lab month, we aimed for reproducing some of the mutations detected in the first seven days. In this context, we especially wanted to learn to handle the most difficult aspects of PACE:
phage washout
turbidostat contamination and working without contamination
flow rates
induction of mutagenesis
evaluation of successfully performed PACE
During several short PACE runs we already faced two of these challenging problems. First we had to adjust the flow rates in comparison to the flow rates in Dickinson-PACE based on the"

   1.Cooperation with the Indian Institute of Technology
As the project continues to advance, HP's exchanges and cooperations between teams are more frequent and in-depth. After seeing the cooperation application issued by the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-Madras) at the iGEM official website, we contacted IIT-Madras to discuss cooperation actively.
We are pleased to collaborate with the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-Madras) to make a video on the science of synthetic biology in the mother tongue. The Indian Institute of Technology is also working with other teams in English, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati and Hindi.
IIT-Madras sends an English script to our team. We need to match the provided slideshow video with the provided text and add the translated text to the subtitles, and finally make it into Chinese video.
We thought it was a simple matter, but there were some problems at the beginning. The problems are summarized as follows:
1. The English script does not exactly match the sound in the video, and some paragraphs are missing.
2. English and Chinese belong to different language families. They are slightly different in grammar, and the word order is reversed in translation.
3. Some video pictures and sounds are out of sync and need to be adjusted.
4. Our team members are not familiar enough with the Indian accent in English, and some words cannot be completely accurate.
After consultation and repeated revisions by the iGEM team members of the Anhui University of Technology, four days later, the results were satisfactory and the video was sent to the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology. We have established a good relationship with the iGEM team (IIT-Madras) of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
With the successful completion of the HP cooperation, the Anhui University of Technology iGEM team (AHUT-CHINA) looks forward to more cooperation opportunities with the Indian Institute of Technology iGEM team (IIT-Madras).

BGU_Israel,2013,Team:BGU Israel#Bricks_-_-_TEXT.html," the anticodon CUA (Fig.4) – Thus it recognizes TAG as its sense codon when incorporating the UAA. With the introduction of this tRNAcua pyl from archaea into bacteria it can compete with the bacterial release factors in the recognition of the UAG codon of the mRNA. This competition can manipulate the bacterial translational machinery (stop codon suppression) and thus render the TAG non-sense codon (Amber stop codon) to a Sense codon for UAA incorporation. UAA incorporation efficiency: For efficient stop codon suppression the expression of tRNA¬cua¬pyl  levels should be high. For this reason the pylT gene must be cloned (along with the PylRS) into a high copy number expression plasmid. In addition, multiple copies (6-9) of the gene encoding for the amber suppressor (tRNAcua pyl) can be added to the same backbone.[6]
For the characterization of those parts we designed and carried out two different experiments:
1. To determine and characterize our ability to incorporate an unnatural amino acid (Progargyl lysine) into a model protein site specifically we first used standard mutagenesis methods to add TAG stop codons to various sites in our model gene. Next we transformed the bacterium with our model protein on an expression plasmid and then transformed the same bacteria with an expression plasmid containing our PylRS and tRNAcua. We have grown bacteria in LB broth overnight with 1mM of expression inducers (IPTG) and 1mM of Propargyl lysine (UAA). Upon incubation we lysed the bacteria and performed a click reaction with a fluorescently labeled azide(See protocols - link) to determine the presence of propargyl lysine in place. In order to visualize the protein, we ran the lysates in an SDS fluorescent PAGE.[7]
Fig 4. - In this fluorescent SDS PAGE image, it is shown that we were able to incorporate our UAA with high yields into different sites of the protein. H117, D411, M412 are different mutants were the natural amino acid was replace with an UAA.
2. To determine selectivity and fidelity of our part we designed experiments were we aim to achieve selective progaragyl-l-lysine (UAA) incorporation into a model protein (CueO-6xHis). By selective we mean that when there is no proparagyl-l-lysine (Like in nature) only the truncated form of the protein will be expressed"

How Neoantigen-based Cancer Immunotherapy Works
Figure 1. Fundamental theory behind neoantigen based cancer Immunotherapy.
Cells become cancerous because of changes in their genetic makeup. These same changes can result in proteins that are differentially expressed on the cancerous cells but not human cells. These are called neoantigens, and refer to new cancer antigens that can signal the immune system to attack the cancer and eliminate it.
A patient is diagnosed with a cancer tumor. A biopsy of the tumor and a biopsy of healthy tissue are acquired to perform whole exome sequencing on both biopsies. A bioinformatic tool (such as CAPOEIRA’s Ginga ) processes the whole exome sequences of both the healthy and tumor biopsies used to identify neoantigens.        A specific neoantigen that is differentially expressed on tumor cells and not healthy cells is supplied to the patient through a vaccine formulation. Dendritic cells of the patient uptake the neoantigen from the"

Going back to school !
In parallel of attending the courses (which started the third of September), we kept on experiments for two weeks to finish the detection part of the system.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Modeling#bacterial Growth_-_-_TEXT.html," unpredictability of biology, we need a stochastic approach. Usually, the stochastic model converge to a limit which is similar to the deterministic model. A stochastic model is all the more pertinent as the initial bacterial population is small. It gives us an array of probabilities, that describes each possible state for the population at time t.
As in the deterministic model, we call $\lambda$ the birth rate : in a short time interval of length $h$ the probability that any particular cell will divide into two is $\lambda h$. Then for the population being of the size $N$ at the time $t+h$, either it is of the size $n$ at time $t$ and no birth occurs in the subsequent short interval $(t,t+h)$, or else it is of size $N-1$ at time $t$ and exactly one birth occurs in $(t,t+h)$. In fact, by choosing $h$ sufficiently small we may ensure that the probability of more than one birth occuring is negligible.
Since the probability of $N$ increasing to $N+1$ in $(t,t+h)$ is $\lambda h N$, it follows that the probability of no increase in $(t,t+h)$ is $1-\lambda h N$. Similarly, the probability of $N-1$ increasing to $N$ in $(t,t+h)$ is $\lambda(N-1)h$. Thus on denoting \[ p_N(t)(t) = \mathbb{P}(population~is~of~size~N~at~time~t) \] we have \[ p_N(t+h) = p_N(t)\times\mathbb{P}(no~birth~in~(t,t+h)) + p_{N-1}(t)\times\mathbb{P}(one~birth~in~(t,t+h))+o(h) \] i.e. \[ p_N(t+h) = p_N(t)\times(1-\lambda N h)+p_{N-1}(t)\times\lambda(N-1)h+o(h) \] On dividing both sides by $h$ \[ \frac{p_N(t+h)-p_N(t)}{h} = - \lambda N p_N(t)+\lambda(N-1)p_{N-1}(t)+o(1) \] and as it approaches zero this becomes \[ \frac{dp_N}{dt}(t) = \lambda(N-1)p_{N-1}(t)-\lambda p_N(t) \] for $N=N_0"

on the cell membrane.
\dot \gamma=\lim_{\delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\delta \theta}{\delta t}=\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial v}
For sound waves, I \propto p_0^2
, p0 is the acoustic pressure and I \propto s_0^2
, s0 is the displacement amplitude.
Thus we have I = \frac{p_0^2}{2\rho v},\Delta p_m=(v\rho \omega)s_m
, which indicates that the intensity of sound waves follow an inverse square law.
Shear stress in the fluid is given by \tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy},u=s_m\cdot f
To define the amplitude of dish vibration, we measured the sound intensity by using Brüel & Kjær 1/8-Inch Pressure Field Microphone with Type 2669 Preamplifier (4138-C-006), which is calibrated from 6 Hz to 140 kHz. [2] Sound speed in the air v=340 m/s, air density is 1.29 kg/m3 , angular velocity is 2π*15000Hz forced by the buzzer.
Fig. 13 Measure the sound intensity by acoustometer
Acoustic pressure \Delta p_m = 4\text{Pa}
is applied by the buzzer attached on the bottom of dish.  From the formula above, the amplitude of dish vibration is around 9.68*10-7m. The shear stress applied on the dish bottom could also be calculated and the result is 0.01 Pa, which matches accurately to the shear stress generated in the microfluidic channel when the flow rate is 50μL/min in the slow channel.
Ultrasound Experiment Analysis
First of all, a function was studied to give pressure on the surface of the ultrasonic transducer-water interface knowing the input voltage. Based on the interface pressure and physical properties of device, we constructed FEA models to simulate the ultrasonic radiant pressure field of the cell layer. Pressure field was studied in conditions of diverse power and distance between transducer interface and cell layer.

XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," project as they are essential pigments for us to “draw” a colorful map. Meanwhile, chromoproteins served as report gene when other parts in this project were tested.
Besides white, the original color of E. coli colonies, the global warming map also needs colonies with color of yellow, blue, and green to represent desert, marine and land areas. Moreover, as this project is a dynamic demonstration of global warming, there should be a balance between the chromoproteins’ degradation and accumulation to make sure one color can appear but later disappear quickly on certain parts of the map. To achieve these goals, 3 experiments have been done. The first two experiments confirmed that all the colors can be observed with naked eyes. The third one showed how the chromoproteins degrade with LVA and AAV tails accumulated in E. coli.
The chromoproteins that have been tested are: AeBlue chromoprotein (BBa_K864401), FwYellow chromoprotein (BBa_K1033910), amilGFP (BBa_K592010, yellow) and amajLime (BBa_K1033916, green-yellow).

Figure 1
The results indicated that these exogenous proteins were expressed successfully with little toxic effect on growth of the host bacteria. The expressed color shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 were also desirable.
Figure 2. The four on the left is Aebluechromoprotein, and the four on the right is Fw Yellow chromoprotein
There was also an experiment comparing the expression of chromoprotein under different temperature. The Aeblue chromoprotein was tested and in 16 degrees Celsius it gave a deeper color compared to 37 degrees Celsius which may prove that chromoproteins could be better expressed in lower temperature. However, because it is closed to blue when expressed under 37 degrees Celsius, later other experiments were set under this temperature.
Figure 3. These two are both Aeblue chromoprotein. The left one was induced under 37 degrees Celsius; the right one was induced under 16 degrees Celsius.
Next, amilGFP yellow chromoprotein (BBa_K592010), and amajLime green-yellow chromoprotein (BBa_K1033916,) were further tested as backup for the yellow pigments. We spent time on yellow protein screening rather than blue ones because there were more yellow proteins available from iGem distribution.
These two parts went after a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23119) and RBS (BBa_B0034)."

Off-Targeting Using Endogenous miRNA
Another application of our synthetic miRNA Kit profits of tissue specific endogenous miRNAs expression. These can be exploited for either Off- or On-Targeting.  To enable Off-Targeting, the GOI expressed on miTuner can be tagged with a miRNA binding site specific for one or a combination of endogenous miRNA of the tissue that is to be excluded from gene expression. In our experiment, we transfected Huh7 (human hepatoma) cells that endogenously overexpress miR122 with the miTuner construct after cloning different variations of binding sites for miR122 behind firefly luciferase. Figure 5 shows the results of the dual luciferase assay. Perfect binding sites result in almost complete inhibition of expression.

In line with the Off-targeting approach, In the case of On-targeting the presence of a certain miRNA in a cell switches on expression of the GOI. This can be accomplished by using a repressor that is targeted by an endogenously expressed miRNA. We exemplified this scenario by using a Tet Repressor fused with a perfect binding"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," origin of replication
Through multiforked replication some chromosomal region have multiple copies. It has been show that chromosomal integration sites close to the ori have a higher transcription rate in E. coli most likely due to the increased copy number of the gene (Sousa, De Lorenzo and Cebolla, 1997) . We assume that this will even more so be the case in Vibrio natriegens, as it replicates even faster and therefore has to do even more multiforked replication.
 
Experiment execution
Constructing of the parts for the chromosomal integration
For the chromosomal integration a construct was chosen, which includes the transcription unit for the chloramphenicol resistance and 1kb homology flanks on each side. The homology flanks were amplified by Q5 PCR from the place on the chromosome of V. natriegens we want to integrate at. The chloramphenicol resistance was amplified by Q5 PCR from the pYTK vector. After that the resistance fragment and a homology fragment for each side were fused by a Q5 fusion PCR. At the end we created 15 constructs for the integration at different places on the chromosome.
Integration of the parts into the chromosome
We introduced our fragments by natural transformation into Vibrio natriegens, because its high efficiency (Dalia et al., 2017). The integration in the genome appeared by homologous recombination. We verified a correct integration by colony PCR.
Growth measurement
The integration of the chloramphenicol may lead to growth deficits as it influences the transcription of neighbours gens. Therefor we conducted growth measurement were we always measured three cultures of the WT and three of the mutants with the inserted sequence. For every culture pre-culture was incubated at 37°C in a shaker until OD600= 0,4-0,6.  From this culture we inoculated the main-culture to OD600~0,02 and began to measure the OD600 every 15 minutes.
Strains
There are different E. coli strains for a variety of applications. In every lab diverse strains are stored in freezers for methods like cloning, protein expression and protein interaction. And all of them are being used. For our project Vibrigens, we decided to establish the world’s fastest three lab strains suited for specific needs based on our V. natriegens wildtype strain. VibriClone, VibriExpress and VibriInteract. VibriClone is engineered to be a chassis for accelerated cloning. VibriExpress is engineered to be a chassis to speed up"

Bacteriophages
Phage as an Organism
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria.  They are composed of a capsid and a tail made of protein. Inside the capsid, bacteriophages have either a DNA or RNA genome. Because they are so simple, they cannot replicate on their own. To do so, a bacteriophage must attach to a bacterial cell membrane and inject its genome into the cell. The bacterial cell's machinery will replicate the genome and produce the viral proteins. These come together to make new bacteriophage progeny that will subsequently exit the cell.
Traditional Use of Phage
Since being discovered in 1915, bacteriophages have been utilized in a variety of different methods.  After their discovery, phages were immediately considered for use as a treatment for bacterial infections.  In the early 1920's, several institutes began developing phages commercially to treat disease.  However, the discovery of antibiotics reduced the interest in using phage as a treatment as people found antibiotics more appealing.  Scientists began using phages to study genetic material, clone DNA, and study the mechanism of transcription.  Important discoveries, such as Hershey and Chase proving DNA is the genetic material and Jacob, Meselson, and Brenner discovering mRNA, have made phages a valuable research subject.  Eventually, interest renewed in using phage as a treatment for bacterial infections.  Bacteria began developing resistances towards antibiotics and scientists turned to phage once again as a potential treatment.  Today, countries around the world have begun using phage as a treatment to cure disease.  As people begin to recognize the many potentials of phages, it is probable that their use will become more widespread.

This system allows for the combination of arbitrary aptamers with the hammerhead expression platform. In its active state, the hammerhead ribozyme causes a cleavage event in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of the transcribed mRNA, resulting in accelerated degradation of the mRNA strand. Depending on the location and sequence of the switching and competing strands, the hammerhead ribozyme can be either constitutively active or inactive, with ligand binding switching it to the opposite state.
The riboswitch will consist of the hammerhead ribozyme expression platform, a progesterone-specific aptamer, and switching/competing strands oriented so that the ribozyme is constitutively active and then inactivated by rising progesterone concentrations. For our purposes, hrGFP will be the transcribed reporter gene. Progesterone bound to the aptamer will halt the degradation of hrGFP mRNA and allow our Y. lipolytica cells to produce GFP product. In this way we can detect the presence of progesterone by the fluorescence of GFP when progesterone is bound, and we can use SELEX to create aptamers that are less sensitive to progesterone and will show visible fluorescence when the culture reaches medically useful levels.
We need to engineer the riboswitch into the genome so consumers can always have a visual representation of when their culture is ready for use. Cory Schwartz from UC Irvine donated the pHR-D17-hrGFP plasmid to us, which has homology arms to the Y. lipolytica genome. The plasmid can integrate into the D17 pseudogene of the Y. lipolytica genome by homologous recombination and has a constitutive expression of GFP (Schwartz et al., 2017). We will add our short riboswitch sequence (219-222 bp, depending on the specific aptamer) in the 3’ UTR of the hrGFP reporter of the plasmid; this creates a one-gene reporter system contained within a  plasmid with ampR and ura3 selectable markers and an hrGFP reporter linked to a progesterone-specific riboswitch.

Other examples are the DIY biohacker spaces that are burgeoning outside institutions, such as the “Hackuarium”, a Lausanne-based bio-hacker community with which last year’s EPFL iGEM team collaborated [3].
If communication and more importantly interaction between scientists and the general public appears to be essential, another big question comes to the mind: which stance should the scientist adopt in the discussion process? Do his competences give him authority to stand above the general public? Prof. Trono insists:  “We [scientists] have to constantly be discussing with the public. However we must not present ourselves as those who know everything, compared to the uneducated crowd that awaits for a magic kit that works by simply pushing a few buttons”. Such position requires the scientist to step  back from his everyday research and from his own interests in order to get an overall view of the situation, which, as Prof François Lefort, biologist and member of the Parliament of the State of Geneva  underlines, is not easy: “One must bear in mind that a scientist does not only work to discover things, even if that is exciting [...]”, he told us, “But he then has to take the necessary time to understand  and reflect upon his discovery, to realize whether it is dangerous or not. It is not only philosophical, but very human. [...] It is a matter of survival”.
We also asked Prof. Lazare Benaroyo, ethicist and researcher at the University of Lausanne, about the position of the scientist in the information process. “I believe that interacting with the public and participating in the information process is part of the scientist’s responsibility”, he says, “It is a central matter. We hear people say: yes of course, we have to inform people because we have to respect their will, and for them to express it, they have to be informed. The problem is that when we are informing, we are already giving our own vision of things. So is it really an information?”. This analysis brings up another issue: scientists do not learn how to discuss their field of research with the general public and other experts such as humanities specialists. “It has to be taught to researchers during their training”, Prof. Benaroyo affirms, “A researcher has to be able to step back and question his own work”.
Responsibility
Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 has generated a heated debate on the way it could be used in gene therapy, which has led us to investigate the issue of the responsibility of the outcomes of scientific"

1) Re-suspend pelleted bacterial cells in 500 µl Buffer P1 BL (kept at 4 °C) and transfer to a micro-centrifuge tube. No cell clumps should be visible after resuspension of the pellet. Important: Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1.
2) Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and gently invert the tube 4–6 times to mix. Do not vortex, as this will result in shearing of genomic DNA. If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min.
3) Add 350 μl Buffer N3 and invert the tube immediately and gently 4–6 times. To avoid localized precipitation, mix the solution gently but thoroughly, immediately after addition of Buffer N3. The solution should become cloudy.
4) Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top micro-centrifuge. A white pellet will form. Apply the supernatants from step 4 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting.
5) Centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through (Optional): Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through.
6) Wash QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30–60 s. Spin for 60 seconds produces good results.
7) Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
IMPORTANT: Residual wash buffer will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation. Residual ethanol from Buffer PE may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions. They are right about this.
8) Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of each QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the number of nonoverlapping reactions in each metabolic system/subsystem, what percentage of the total they make up, and what was the greatest change for each system. Overall, amino acid metabolism had the highest number of changing reactions (78), but the greatest change was only 0.637. Membrane transport, exchange, and inorganic ion transport only made up roughly 15% of changing reactions, but had the largest gap in flux ranges (14.6). We also started brainstorming about potential routes to go down, given we were wrapping up our flavodoxin and ATP analyses. Laura proposed looking more closely at dependence of the model on ATP, given flavodoxin, by contrast, is only involved in a handful of reactions. We started compiling a list of the top 10 reactions that produce/consume ATP. I personally was responsible for identifying consummation reactions. Initially I generated an excel file of reactions that only included ATP, and from there I identified which reactions had the most positive flux ranges, given ATP almost always appears as a reactant in the model.

Igem meeting consequences
J_exp15
In our meeting with iGem, Laura and I reported that the model is ATP­limited, a conclusion that we drew from our max biomass vs. max ATP analyses. We also shared some of the main reactions that either produce or consume ATP, and identified that a majority of these reactionsare apart of the carbon metabolism system. After consulting with Tom, and as a step moving forward, we agreed upon knocking out each individual gene from the model to observe its effect on FBA. Him and Maggie also suggested adding additional metabolites in the model, potentially aiding cell growth. Laura and I decided to divvy up these tasks, with her taking the former and me the latter. My experience with python and gams coding is very limited, so I took it upon myself to begin with reviewing the existing templates that Maggie provided at the beginning ofWeek 1. With the help of a python syntax guide, I was able to get a feel for how to generateoutputs files that can then be used to run FBA and FVA.

Figuring out Overexpression

I continued reviewing my existing python and gams to come up with a way to overexpress each of the metabolites in the model. Tom suggested created a “dummy” transporter reaction in my existing python code, which would carry each individual metabolite into the cytoplasm.

Where We've Been.
Our Story.
Cornell iGEM’s multifaceted approach to tackling mastitis is innovative and different, but even still, we know that we cannot do this alone. We have spent each stage of our project visiting and interacting with experts in the field, making decisions carefully with the feedback of current dairy farmers in mind. We approached the project with human-centered design in three stages. First, inspiration. We derived our ideas from what was needed in the mastitis industry. Next, ideation. We sketched out prototypes and brought them to the farmer. And finally, implementation. We created our product. And at this stage, we knew that what we had created would be useful, because it was, in essence, the farmer, who had directed us throughout the process.

ProDAIRY
123 Lake St, Cooperstown, NY 13326
We began our journey by speaking with Caroline Potter and Rob Lynch from ProDAIRY. ProDAIRY is a dairy educational organization in New York state aimed to connect farmers and members of the agriculture business to valuable resources, research, and information to create strong businesses in the dairy industry. During this meeting we discovered that cows infected with mastitis have to be taken out of the milking process and are treated with antibiotics in quarantine. Even after a cow is cured, they have to be withheld from milking for several more days until all traces of antibiotics have left the milk. The treatment process and loss of milk is very costly to the farmer and Caroline and Rob emphasized to us that mastitis is a huge problem within the dairy industry. Through our conversations we found out not only where our treatment and prevention efforts should be focused, but also how big an impact our project could make in the dairy industry.

Collaboration
The emphasis that iGEM places on collaboration allowed us to improve our project and connect with other young scientists. We appreciated the opportunities this provided us and understand that it is a reflection of how the scientific process works in the real world. Over the course of the summer, we collaborated with four different teams: Missouri S&T, WashU/Penn State, The University of Virginia, and the University of Georgia. As this was our first year as an iGEM team, we also received assistance from the WashU/Penn State team, who quickly became our good friends and mentor team.
In July, we attended the Heartland Synthetic Biology Meetup, hosted by Missouri S&T. We helped Missouri S&T and Washington University host a public forum discussion on synthetic biology and host an educational event for children.
Our collaboration with the Virginia iGEM team consisted of us assisting them with a survey about biocontainment. This survey will be used to create a pamphlet for future iGEM teams that provides them with information about biocontainment and help make informed decisions in order to improve their practices. Improved biocontainment also serves the dual purpose of inspiring more trust from the public. The team created a badge that is now proudly displayed at the bottom of this webpage.
Finally, we helped to characterize the expression of an mCherry gene from the University of Georgia iGEM team. They sent us cells that had already been prepared to express the gene and we used our plate reader to take measurements of the fluorescence of their cells. This was all part of a larger multi-team collaboration effort meant to gather measurements from multiple sources in order to standardize their results.
Additionally, the Washington University St. Louis / Penn State iGEM Team  provided us with water samples. We plan to use these samples to test base nitrate levels and to potentially simulate a real-world environment for the testing of our system. They also provided us numerous contacts for potential sponsorship and mentored us throughout the summer. Our teams had similar project backgrounds, and so we were able to discuss our results and exchange ideas.

POSTCARD COLLABORATION
iGEM Team Dusseldorf-Cologne
In 2016, iGEM team of Duesseldorf launched a campaign initiative to promote synthetic biology to local communities through self-designed postcards. This year, team Duesseldorf-Cologne, expanding on the idea, reached out to all European iGEM teams to collaborate, design and exchange synthetic biology inspired postcards to further engage the public.
Overall, 28 teams participated in the postcard collaboration. All teams sent and received imaginative postcards, that teased their respective projects.
Our team’s design showcases all aspects of our project, from the various dry lab modeling tasks to the OSIRIS protocol developed to integrate human practices to our work. The design reconciles the minimal aesthetic with the hectic nature of the iGEM journey and encircles -pun intended- all these aspects with our logo, our team’s emblem.
We shared the fruits of this collaboration with the public during the TeamFair 5.0 event that took place last October in our university campus. You can read more about our public engagement initiatives here .

Description
Spider silk is an amazing bionanomaterial due to its exceptional features. It exhibits high tensile strength, high fracture resistance, high elasticity and it has biocompatibility and low degradability.  Some studies show silk can be compared to a synthetic polymer called Kevlar, that is made of aramid and is used to make body armor (Lewis). Silks are polymers composed of proteins. These proteins and their encoding genes present specific repetitive sequences that are associated with the already mentioned silk properties. Moreover, some studies suggest that the terminal domains of silk proteins play important roles in the polymerization process. In this way, it can be possible to add N- and C- terminal domains in several interesting proteins or motifs and spun it with native proteins to obtain a customized silk.
The size of genes, their repetitive sequences and high content of Cytosine and Guanine establish a challenge to many expression systems. However, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has naturally high GC content in its genome to deal with this difficulty, it can perform post translational modifications, and it can also secrete complex proteins, making the purification process easier. Furthermore, it exhibits low cost production, rapid growth, scalability and stable transgenic line generation, all desired characteristics to an expression system (Wijffels, Kruse, and Hellingwerf; Rosenberg et al.). It is important to highlight the low cost of microalgae cultivation, when compared to antibodies production in mammalian cells, which presents an average cost about US$150.00/per gram of raw materials and in plants US$0.05/per gram (Dove). Maylfield has estimated that microalgae can reach US$ 0.002/liter (Rosenberg et al.; Mayfield, Franklin, and Lerner). Chlamydomonas reinhardtii also is Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS), that is, it has low risk of being contaminated by virus, prions and bacterial endotoxins (Mayfield et al.). The purification ease and low risk of contamination are significant issues when making products for biomedical applications.

Finally, in the PCR3, assembling of the exons 2 and 3 is done in one single reaction (Final PCRα/Final PCRβ), using a mix of the products from PCR_HE2A and PCR_HE3A (to obtain the α chain) and PCR_HE2B and PCR_H3B (to obtain the β chain) and the flanking primers P1*-P4*/ P1’*-P4’*. The expected product size are 533 bp (for the α chain) and 566 bp for the β chain).                                 For more detailed information see the gene extraction notebook.
Collaborations
We considered testing the HLA gene extraction protocol that we designed during this summer using a different DNA sample.
UPF CRG Barcelona Results
The UPF iGEM conducted 3 PCRs for the obtention of the β chain of the HLA-DQ. They used a different DNA sample to prove that the designed protocol was robust. We provided them with all the reagents necessaries to perform it, including primers and the DNA Polymerase (iProof HF). Our designed primers efficiently amplified the exons 2 and 3 of the β chain.
The resulting product flanked with the restriction sites is ready to be cloned in a pET22b vector!
Congratulations UPF CRG Barcelona!

The devastation caused by rust is exacerbated by the lack of education and resources within the community. Farmers often apply insecticide or a lethal dose of fungicide to crops affected by rust. Berhe also noted that many farmers lack proper protection and training while spraying and disposing of pesticides, resulting in damaging effects to their health and environment. They also lack access to seeds with novel resistance genes, forcing them to use recycled seeds, which in turn increases susceptibility to rust and other fungal infections. Other factors contributing to the prevalence of rust noted by both researches were wind and temperature. When the conditions of both are in a certain range, rust becomes a large issue.
The researchers stated that improved rust detection would be an invaluable tool for farmers by allowing them more time to purchase and apply fungicide. It would allow them to properly allocate resources and prevent devastating losses. In addition to these benefits for solitary farmers, the researchers notes that if we were to connect our hardware to the internet, it would be beneficial for the government and researchers by allowing them to track the spread of rust. Such information would help the government better allocate resources to farmers to help them protect their crops.
When discussing methods of sharing information between farmers, the researchers noted that the farmers tended to organize within their individual communities. These organizations thrive because the farmers share information and resources among one another. Berhe suggested that the groups would be the best outlet to spread information about improved farming practices and to distribute resources. More specifically, he mentioned that the groups could be used for promoting safe fungicide application and introducing our device.

Discussion
E. coli, the pet of many molecular biologists, suffers great underestimation. Although, it is capable of much more than just cloning procedures and protein expression, many utilize it like an old nag. In our project, we allowed it to follow its most natural instinct: swimming towards its favorite honeypot. By establishing a mutant library via saturation mutagenesis, we trained E. coli to become a “tracking dog” for uncommon substances. Furthermore, we “played fetch” all day long, which eventually enabled us to establish a completely new selection assay. Last but not least, speed improvement was the third backbone-piece of our work to make E. coli a highly evolved tracing machine.
The identification of two novel Tar receptor classes that were each associated with two or three novel chemoattractants, respectively, led us to the assumption that our saturation mutagenesis and selection assay worked as expected. This is supported by the results of the negative control with water as chemoattractant in our selection assays. Unfortunately, we were not able to identify highly specific receptors that are associated to a single substance. Nevertheless, this might be due to the small coverage of about 2x105 out of 3.2x106 numerically possible mutants. Furthermore, a structural similarity of the different chemoattractants, or the presence of a universal binding pocket of the receptor might be the reason for an unspecific recognition. Our finding of two very similar amino acid sequences within one class backs up this speculation (see Fig. 18 B – Results section).
For a fully functional chemoattractant tracking system, the receptor itself is just one brick of the puzzle. The promoter constructs for the"
