The mixture is spin coated onto the flow layer with:
15 seconds ramp, 2800 RPM, 30 seconds dwell
20 seconds ramp, 100 rpm, 1 second dwell
0.1 second ramp, 100 rpm, 0 dwell
After removing the control layer mold from the vacuum chamber any residual surface bubbles are destroyed by blowing on top of the PDMS layer. Any visible particles on top of the control channel grid are carefully removed by blowing on them with a pasteur pipette.
Both layers are cured in an oven for 20-30 minutes at 80°C.
Following polymerization, both molds are taken from the oven and allowed to cool for 5 minutes.
The control layer is then diced with a scalpel and holes (1–8 and B, S, C, O) are punched at the control input side using a hole puncher or a 21 gauge lure stub.
The channel side of the control layer is thoroughly cleaned with Scotch Magic Tape.
The cleaned control layer is then aligned to the flow layer on the stereomicroscope.
The device is bonded for 90 minutes at 80°C in an oven.
Bonded devices are removed from the oven and allowed to cool for 5 minutes.
Following the outline of the control layer each individual device is cut with a scalpel and peeled off the flow layer.
Holes are punched for the sample inlet and outlet (S1–S7 and O) using a hole puncher, and the chip is cut along the alignment crosses.
The flow channel side is cleaned thoroughly with tape before aligning the device to a spotted glass slide.
Flow mold is cleaned of any residual polymerized PDMS either by peeling off the thin layer of PDMS using a pair of tweezers or by an additional PDMS layer. For the latter, 11 g of a 10:1 Sylgard mixture (10 g Part A:1 g Part B) is mixed for 1 minute at 2,000 rpm (~400 × g), degassed for 2 minute at 2,200 rpm (~440 × g), poured on the flow mold cured in the oven for 30 minute at 80°C, and peeled off after cooling down to room temperature.

There is agriculture tax in China. After a year work, they will earn 1000 yuan per mu ($245.35 dollars per thousand square meters).
Other farmers represented by Mr Dai and Miss Wang reported that richer families (three or four people in a family) usually have 10 mu (6666 square meters), while some poorer families only have 5 to 6 mu.
Pesticides & fertilizer sellers reported similar questions and one of them told us compound fertilizer would make farming easier. However, they told us that peanut and paddy field usually needed only a litter fertilizer, but the real condition is that if fertilizer is not applied, crop failure is unavoidable.
We think that our E.Coli Prometheus can reduce the usage of nitrogen fertilizer and if designing properly, we can also even bind potassium with it. As we can fertilize directly, potassium will not be wasted, even cause water bloom as normal fertilizers.

STIR Protocol
Considering human practices as part of our research project means considering the ethical, social, legal, or economic dimension of a project to better understand what issues might influence or might be influences by the design and use of our technologies. This year, as part of our silver medal criteria, we decided to implement the STIR protocol into our project, which helped us to have a better understanding of how our work is going to affect several socio-political scenarios, and how these realms have affected our project. STIR is designed to take the form of a structured, cyclic discussion which takes place with members of a lab about decisions made over the course of a research project. STIR is designed to encourage laboratories to address broader societal dimensions and to integrate those societal considerations into their work. We are the second iGEM team to implement the protocol and took inspiration from the Imperial College 2016 iGEM team [1] .
In order to better implement the Socio-Technical Integration Research (STIR) protocol [2] , we contacted the STIR associate in the UK, Dr Paul Everest, in order to have a better overview of the processes that characterise the protocol. Even though we had previously read and examined the videos and reports that describe the protocol, we thought it would be valuable to have a human approach with someone who was directly involved in the implementation of STIR. Dr Everest accepted to speak to us and explained the typical features that distinguish the STIR protocol.
Dr Everest explained that STIR is entirely based on the idea of a collaboration between social and natural science. In order to achieve this, a joint effort was needed from both the social and the natural world, which could be created with the use of targeted questions that identified connections between the scientific project and how it could have had an impact on the rest of the world.

The Issue
By 2016, HIV still affected 36.7 million people across the globe. 71% of those people live in sub-Saharan Africa; over half of them do not know they are HIV positive. Although the developed world considers HIV a manageable disease, many sub-Saharan African countries have mortality rates as high as 761 deaths per 100,000.  Furthermore, not knowing one’s HIV status causes several problems: spreading the disease further and decreasing life expectancy as well as the quality of life from not receiving treatment. In many of these countries, ARVs are free and readily available through numerous nonprofit organizations. It was found that 86% of people who know they are HIV+ proceed to take ARVs; better diagnostics is needed in order to help decrease the burden of disease caused by HIV. Our goal as a team is to fill this need by creating a test that would allow many of these people who do not know their status to find out.
However, diagnosing HIV is problematic in this region. In Rwanda specifically, an HIV positive test costs on average over $1300 USD. This may not be a lot for those who have health insurance in first world countries; however, the average hourly wage in Rwanda is $0.53/hr USD. In order to pay for a single HIV positive test, a person who works 40 hours a week would need to work for over 1 year consecutively with no other expenses. This is completely unreasonable. The economic factors associated with getting diagnosed are massive and need to be reduced. One way to do this is to create a reliable rapid test that is as affordable as possible.
Another barrier to diagnosis in the region is access to these tests. Current laboratory tests are not only expensive but they are also located in laboratories. The laboratories can be days away on foot from people. Oftentimes, these people cannot afford to go to the clinic because they need time off work and transportation itself is costly, and/or too hard. These machines also require equipment and electricity; things that are uncommon in rural parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, the issue of diagnosis in this region is massive but consists of several key issues.
Another factor that contributes to the overall cost of the tests is the recovery of the protein. To make the downstream recovery easier, a thermo-stable variant of the lectin can be engineered to ensure that it will not denature if"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  For today, colony PCR primers will be designed in order to use them to verify that the correct plasmid and gene is inside our clones.  The protocol will be laid out to do the procedure when reagents our moved to the Boelter lab.  Preparation will also be made for protein expression this week.
Colony PCR primers:
The file “pET-22b with PCquad Optimized” was created by using a RE digestion and ligation reaction on Benchling.  Primers were designed to overlap part of the PCquad gene and the vector.  The primers designed were the following.  Note PCquad gene was inserted reading right to left.
Forward:  5’-GAAGGTGTCATAATCGTATCCAGTCG-3’
Reverse:  5’- GGTGATGTCGGCGATATAGGC-3’
Notes:  For reverse primer, a self-dimer with delta G = -5.19 kcal/mol formed, while the max delta G = -41.97 kcal/mol.  A heterodimer forms with -6.66 kcal/mol while the max delta G is -45.9 kcal/mol.  All other parameters are ok.
The colony PCR primer forward seems to anneal to the “PCquad original” everywhere except 3 base pairs. The order was placed from IDT.
Conclusions:  Most of today was used in preparation for protein expression of the cage.  It may be nice to give a presentation on the techniques involved for characterizing the protein cage, as well as to become acquainted with the theory.  If possible, tomorrow will be used to do colony PCR to verify that the Yeates strain contains the proper plasmid and gene."

iGEM in Rural China Project
China is a vast country and its development is unbalanced. In Beijing, the per capita GDP is $16375.96 (Nation Bureau of Statistics of the People’s Republic of China) in 2012 which is similar to developed countries, while in rural areas, such as Weifang, Shandong Province, which we gave a speech about iGEM, the per capital GDP is $6926.61 according to the data in 2012 (Weifang Bureau of Statistics). According to the officer website of iGEM, only students in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hefei and Guangzhou participated in. These are the richest areas in China.
As students from Beijing Normal University, we pay great attention to educational equality. Our iGEM in Rural China Project aims at improving the educational equality, so we choose Weifang, a rural area in China, to deliver the scientific frontiers to them.
On August 1st, we gave a speech about biology and synthetic biology to students from 6 different schools in Gaoge village, Weifang. We were deeply moving by their thirsty for knowledge.
On the way to schools in rural areas
BNU iGEM team giving classes in Weifang
When we were talking about some knowledge out of their text books, they showed amazed expression and were thirsty to know more, for most of them don’t have any access to the Internet and the only way to know the outside world is by TV. However, TV program never deliver scientific knowledge timely in detail. They are the ones that in need of our help.
However, according to previous wikis, communicating with senior high students from schools in urban areas is really rare. High school students in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have already enjoyed best education resources, while rural areas in Shandong Province, such as Weifang, are badly in need of that kind of education"

Fig.4 The diffusion in the Gassian chip We set that the Cx = 1uM (for diacetyl) ,the optimum concentration can be sensed by the C. elegans. We set that the Cs = 288uM (for diacetyl),
According to the equation we can get that the erf (\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}})
=0.9965 and then referred to the Table 1.1 we can get that the \frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}}
=2.2, and D is the diffusion coefficient for 2-nonanone or diacetyl in PDMS. We need to calculate the D to get the time t according to the equation. We used the force-field method to get the D of those two chemicals (the concrete operational process is shown in 1.3).
D(2-nonanone) = 6.78*10-6cm2/s
D(diacetyl) = 6.78*10-6cm2/s
Finally, we can get the time t = 12 mins, on the other words, we cannot inject the C. elegans until the chemicals are injecting for 12 mins in layer 1(for diacetyl).
The Calculation of Diffusion Coefficient D
The diffusivity of a gas in an organic solvent, polymer, or zeolite can be calculated by simulating the molecular dynamics process and calculating the mean square displacement of the gas in the material. This allows us to calculate the self-diffusivity coefficient of the gas and gives an insight into the overall diffusivity. As we are performing a molecular dynamics calculation, we can analyze the effect of temperature, pressure, density, and penetrant size and structure on diffusion. We used force-field method to calculate the D in PDMS by Material Studio® (MS) a software for material calculation. [2] [3]

First, we set up the initial structure of the PDMS and the chemicals (Fig.5 and Fig.6).

This week we also held our first annual iGEM Fundraiser. Space Slam was a huge success and we raised over $2000 for the team through a combination of ticket sales and silent auction items.
Week 23: October 2 - October 6
For the collaboration with iGEM McMasterU , we prepared and autoclaved the M9 liquid media and the M9 plates. The plates were not poured smoothly. As such, we re-made the M9 plates after autoclaving more plating media.
Week 24: October 9 - October 13
We made four overnight cultures, with two for E. coli DH5α and another two for B. subtilis WB800. After 24 hours of incubation, the OD600 absorbances of the overnight cultures were measured and diluted appropriately with M9 liquid media to attain a cell density of 106 cells/mL. No growth was observed on the two plates after 36 hours so we re-made four plates, with 2 for E. coli DH5α and 2 for B. subtilis WB800. Again, no growth was observed. Overnight cultures were re-made, one for E. coli DH5α and another for B. subtilis.
Week 25: October 16 - October 20
The DNAzyme sent by iGEM McMasterU was diluted to the suggested concentration of 8μM. After 48 hours of incubation, the growth on the E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 quadrants of the plates were enough to plate the DNAzyme. After incubation, a picture was taken of the wet-lab experiment results. Due to limited amounts of DNAzyme sent by iGEM McMasterU , no replicates or repetitions could be done.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Education & Public Engagement
The importance of learning has been a priority for our project from the beginning. From start, our project have been focused on learning from, and sharing our knowledge with society in order to raise public awareness of our project. In the beginning of our project we got the impression that public awareness about protein folding and chaperones seems to be somewhat sparse. This is something we wanted to change.
We attempted to make a change in public awareness about our topic by focusing on education. In order to engage the public during events we tried to spread some of the valuable knowledge we have gained throughout the project. Through our collaborations and integrated human practice we were also given the experience of other iGEM teams, society and different stakeholders.
Podcast: Attempting Science
An effective way of updating and staying updated nowadays is through podcasts. Since podcasts have the potential to reach a large group of people and can be about virtually anything one finds interesting or funny we though this was a good way to reach out to a larger audience with our project. The result became a podcast that has been updated on a regular basis throughout our project called ""Attempting Science"". In this podcast we talked about our project, in order to get a slightly broader range of subjects we also talked about other interested subjects relating to our fields of study and synthetic biology. After the Nordic iGEM conference we also invited the iGEM team from Chalmers University to participate. In this episode we talked about their project and about problems we have been facing along the way.
By posting our episodes on Soundcloud anyone could listen to them. We also posted about our podcast on our social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) to increase the reach of each episode. This let us achieve one of our goals, to find a fun way to let people learn more about synthetic biology and to reach out with our project. It is avaliable on our Youtube and Soundcloud!
- A podcast given a glance is a podcast with a great chance.

Dr. Gerlinde Metz
Dr. Gerlinde Metz investigates the influence of experience and environment on behaviour and brain plasticity. Her work was the first to show that stress affects motor system function and diseases of the motor system, such as Parkinson’s disease and stroke. This research indicated that adverse experience at any time in life can become a predisposing or precipitating factor of disease. More recently, her laboratory has developed a rat model of transgenerational prenatal stress. This model allows the study of transgenerational inheritance of health and disease and epigenetic linkages from early development to old age. Her contribution to Synbiologica will include work in animal models of disease and physiological manipulations and assays, and related behavioural studies.

Modeling
We developed several models to help design our biosensor to maximize output variation (i.e. the difference between a person with cancer and a healthy person) and to maximize the overall output so the fluorescence can be detected more easily with cheaper equipment, which would drive down net cost of using our sensor in a medical setting.
These include:
NUPACK modeling : Used NUPACK to model the secondary structures of the toehold switches in their closed and open states to maximize dynamic range.
Mass action kinetics modeling : Built a mass action kinetics model to identify the most important parameters to optimize in our design. We ported this model to JavaScript to make it easier for our design team to use and to explain the model to others.
Stochastic modeling : We collaborated with Oxford to validated our mass action kinetics model, by stochastic modeling of the uncertainties of the parameters.
We also built a cost model to provide insight into using our device as a mass-screening tool, which we tied into our human practices work.
NUPACK model
NUPACK is a software tool that can model the secondary structures of RNA systems. [1] We used NUPACK to optimize the design of our toehold switches.
We ran our simulations at 37°C, with 100 picomolar of miRNA, 20 nanomolar of DNA and 500 picomolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.

Test Expression
Introduction
After cloning the subtilisin E into the vectors pTEF-MF, pyes2 and the genome integration vector pCfB255 [ 1 ] a test expression was made. We used the following methods to test for proteolytic activity:
Skim Milk Assay
The skim milk assay is a non specific test for proteolytic activity. Lysis of casein leads to a clear solution while the solution remains white when the proteolytic activity is missing.
AAPF Assay
The AAPF assay is a very specific test for proteolytic activity in serine proteases.
TCA Precipitation
It is used to precipitate proteins from cell culture supernatant to gain a higher concentration.
SDS Gel
An SDS gel can be used to make proteins visible. SDS (sodiumdodecyl-sulfate) charges all proteins negative, so that they migrate in an electric field. It is a size based sorting method.
Results in pTEF-MF
In the pTEF-MF the secretion tag MFalpha should lead to a secretion. We tested the supernatant of 24 h, 48 h and 72 h cultures with the methods described above but did not get any positive results. We also crushed the cells to test them with the same methods after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h but there was no positive result either. Subtilisin E expression was not possible in this expression system.
Results in pYES2
In the pyes2 vector with additional MFalpha secretion tag Subtilsin E also should be secreted.  We tested the vector like pTEF-MF except we induced it first with 20 % Galactose and fed 20 % again after every 24h.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#28 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," Verification of J13002-LuxOD47E-B0015
Today I did a Colony PCR in order to verify the presence of the B0015 terminator in our contruct.  I followed the protocol and the cycling conditions from July 7th 2009.  PCR prodcuts were visualized on a 1% agarose gel run with 1.0kb+ GeneRuler DNA Ladder.  See gel photo below.
Analysis: Lane 1 is a size control of BBK LuxOD47E, lane 2 is another size control of J13002-LuxOD47E, Lanes 3-6 are J13002-LuxOD47E-B0015 trial 2, Lanes 7-10 are J13002-LuxOD47E-B0015 trial 3, lane 11 is left blank and lane 12 is a negative control.
From this gel, it looks like the B0015 terminator may have been cloned into colonies 1,2 & 3 of trial 2, as the bands in these lanes appear slightly higher than the band in lane 2 which is J13002-LuxOD47E.  I will proceed by preparing overnight cultures of trial 2, colonies 1-3 in order to isolate plasmid tomorrow and do a verification digest, before hopefully choosing a colony to send down for sequecning.

Competent Cell Testing with Serial Dilutions of pBluescript
Serial dilutions of pBluescript were used to test transformation efficiency of competent cells made yesterday. "
Wisconsin-Madison,2012,Team:Wisconsin-Madison#modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," in available plasmids and transcription rates [Dennis and Bremer 1996], so that the cell can achieve the necessary enzymes concentration in the growth phase.
Enzyme concentration = Transcription rate x Copy number of plasmid x Time in growth phase
The time of T = 100Hrs was used to solve the set of ordinary differential equations to capture sufficient time of cell in stationary phase. The optimization model shown in figure 3, takes given Time, initial concentration of substrates and enzyme kinetic model. The algorithm sets the concentration of all enzymes at initially 1nM. Through a directed evolutionary approach, the concentration of the enzymes in sequence beginning from E1, is modified by a multiplication factor and the new Limonene produced by the model solved at time (T) is calculated by the algorithm.
The best performing enzyme concentration of E1 is fed back to the model. In the subsequent turn the following enzyme E2 is multiplied from a set of factors and sent as input. Similarly, the best performing enzyme concentration is fed back to the model for the next enzymes (E3)‘s run.      The algorithm is run several times until the maximum limonene produced reaches a stable concentration with the enzyme concentrations optimized at after each run.
Results:
The concentration of limonene produced , using the kinetic model solved at T=100 Hours (Figure below) at different concentration of each enzyme, keeping the concentration of other enzymes at their best optimum, shows that HMGS, GPPS and LIMS are the rate limiting enzymes . The production is also sensitive to the concentration of IDI.  A comparison of rate of change in slope of the curves of HMGR, GPPS and LIMS showed that the limonene production was more sensitive to HMGS and LIMS compared to GPPS, at high concentration near 10mM.
Criticism:
• Substrates in the pathway such as limonene and HMG-CoA have been shown to be toxic1 to cell growth. Hence the over-expression of HMGS for large production will have toxic effect on cell growth. In which case, HMGS may not play the role of the rate limiting enzyme.
• Many enzymatic reactions are reversible in this pathway, however in this model all reactions have been considered to be irreversible. This fallback is probably responsible for the sensitivity of the IDI enzyme reported, since IPP -> DMAPP maintains an equilibrium balance using only a forward reaction.

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"ing interview, we became clearer of our whole project. This interview greatly helped us on the design and actual execution of our project.
3. The dialogue with experts in synthetic biology: greatly helped us on the design of our biosafety system
With the advent of synthetic biology, genetically modified microorganisms are being increasingly used for biomedical, industrial and environmental applications. Deployment of these engineered microbes in large scales and open environments calls for the development of safe and secure means to restrain their proliferation.
Also in the biosafety investigation we took, we found that although most of the labs strictly obey the management rules, there are still some labs with poor management and faint consciousness on biosafety.  For example, about 10% of the labs we investigated have no resting area separated from the experiment area. More than 15% of the labs we investigated pay less attention to the treatment of organic waste or materials with engineered bacteria. What's worse, more than 40% of the people investigated would have meals in the lab. These researchers are facing serious safety problems which made us become aware of the importance of biosafety.  As the Chinese saying goes, a solid dyke can collapse because of an ant hole in it. Although only a few labs pay poor attention to biosafety, it could still probably cause serious biosafety problems.
After the investigation, we organized many activities to get researcher pay more attention to biosafety. Meanwhile, we were also considering whether our project needed a design to avoid the potential risks of our 'controller cells'.
In order to get professional opinions on our biosafety considerations, we had a dialogue with the experts in this field, Jun Feng. After introducing our investigation and consideration of biosafety, Jun Feng gave us highly appreciation. Also he proposed some suggestions on how to construct a biosafety system.
From the dialogue, we know that traditional metabolic auxotrophy strains are hampered by the potential for inadvertent complementation by cross-feeding or by the presence of the metabolite in heterogenous environments, and synthetic auxotrophy systems rely on extensive genome-wide engineering that may be impractical for many industrial production and biotherapeutic microbes.
An alternative approach to biocontainment is to use gene circuits to maintain essential gene expression or block toxin gene expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions. Upon loss of the biocontainment signal, the circuit blocks essential gene expression or induces toxin gene expression to kill the cell.
After the discussion with Jun Feng, we read plenty of literature about biosafety system design. Finally, we designed a biocontainment system for our AI-2 Controller.

What went wrong?
Why didn’t the colonings work? Possible reasons for our failure are that we tried to perform a PCR using the wrong primers or that we committed an error somewhere else in the procedure. Another possibility is that we had the wrong stem of Bacillus subtilis from the beginning, because only the stem 168 has the required genes.
We also tried to order the parts for our clonings from IDT, but they were not able to send them to us in time for us to still work with them."

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Bioaccumulation_-_-_TEXT.html," products are toxic and pose new harms to the environment.
Bioaccumulation instead of Biodegradation
Figure 3: Structure of fluA(blue) with its ligand fluorescein(green) [ source:PBD ]
As biodegradation does not conclusively solve the problem of diclofenac in the aquatic environment, we propose the utilisation of antibodies for accumulation of diclofenac, which would solve the problem of toxic degradation products.
Although an antibody against diclofenac has been developed [ Deng et al. (2003) ], in vivo verification of successful binding would not be straightforward. Therefore we aimed for a first proof of principle and decided to investigate another substance that is targetable by antibodies for which verification is feasible. One attractive option is the well-known fluorophore fluorescein which was used by the team Freiburg 2008 . Fluorescein fluoresces until bound by the binding protein fluA, which makes characterization tractable. The covalent binding of fluA and flourescein is shown in Figure 3.
We submitted an improved version of the Freiburg Biobrick for fluA (see Table 1) and created a transgenic moss plants ( PF-15 ) with the fluorescein binding anticalin fluA on the extracellular part of the receptor.
Producing engineered binding proteins for medical purpose in the red biotechnology is one of the main research fields in which anticalins play a major role. Lipocalins such as bilin-binding-protein BBP (from Pieris brassicae) can be used for generating molecular pockets with a diversity of shapes and for creating a stable receptor protein for a ligand of choice, so that development of binding proteins against nearly chemical structures with comparable size is possible. Hence it should be possible to target a great variety of pollutants by already available binding proteins.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"Heparin chromatography: The fusion protein is a DNA-binding protein (used to purify both Tn5 and dxCas9 individually).
MonoQ chromatography: It’s an anion exchange resin, utilizing the charge of the fusion protein as a purification property.
Results and interpretation: Of the three chromatography methods, both heparin and monoQ were successful. As a result we developed a production process which includes heparin chromatography as a capture step, followed by monoQ as a final polishing step.
We used heparin chromatography to capture the fusion from the crude lysate. The fusion protein has a high affinity to the heparin resin, resulting in good initial separation of the fusion protein from contaminating and degrading species. The results suggested that the fusion protein was cleaved at the linker, resulting in a dxCas9 contamination (figure 14, lane 2 to 10) . The dxCas9 contaminant has a lower affinity to the heparin resin and eluted at lower concentrations of salt (figure 14, lane 2-10), whereas the fusion has a higher affinity to the heparin resin and eluted at high concentration of salt (figure 14, lane 11-13). Only the last three elution fractions were pooled (figure 14, lane 11-13), and further purified.

We used MonoQ chromatography to polish the fusion and remove any remaining contaminants. The fusion eluted in a broad peak (figure 15, lane 6-14) from the resin, however the fractions are relatively pure and the dxCas9 contamination was mostly eliminated.

Today we had our first real day of lab work.  We settled ourselves into the lab bench that we will work at for the summer and set up our area.  Along with familiarizing the new members with lab protocols, we had a productive day of hydrating and transforming.  We really liked the linearized vectors that the Registry sent along with the plates, very nice addition. Today we designed what our wiki will look like and talked about some finer of the details of our project such as the exact construction method and a work plan.  We are considering using Gibson assembly for all of our construction although in our lab it is still being debugged in a different side project.  Results are promising though as biobricking has its drawbacks.  Among other things, planning of an all-you-can eat sushi lunch is in the works.  We will plan our work schedule around that.

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#AnalysisMotivation_-_-_TEXT.html," our project firsthand. We engaged with over 260 people from over 16 countries – at least one from every continent (except Antarctica)! It was a great way to directly engage with other iGEM participants too, and generate global interest in our project.
Business & Applied Design
We took the biocircuitry of our biosensor that we made in the lab, and turned to engineering to design and assess the viability of a final biosensor product. This involved considering optimisation, immobilisation techniques, potential designs, initial sketches and prototyping.
We also pitched our idea to a range of potential consumers, and worked with them to evolve our design. From there, a full plant sizing and costing was done to assess if the investment would provide a worthwhile return.
Collaboration
Collaborating with other iGEM teams worldwide was an invaluable experience. We did extensive collaboration with the UNSW iGEM and Hamburg iGEM teams in particular, as well as engaging in minor collaboration with 6 other iGEM teams. On top of that, we connected with 46 more iGEM teams on Instagram.
Outreach & Public Engagement
We engaged with people from as young as 4 years of age, up to 65+ years of age, and many between! Through numerous social events and workshops, we successfully taught thousands of people about synthetic biology, the importance of not squeezing fruit to see if it’s ripe, and introduced them to our project. To find out more about how we used this information, check out the Outreach page.
Integrated Human Practices
Through Skype sessions and site visits, we engaged with Zespri Kiwifruit, Avocados Australia, and Fresh Produce Australia, to gain an insight into the context of our project.,
To find out more about how we used this information, check out the Integrated Human Practices page.
Microbe Card Game Project
One of our team members set out to design a card game that stylised various bacteria as little monsters. The card game was intended to be both educational and fun, introducing some of the more common bacteria that are involved in food and health to the wider community. To keep things simple, the game was going to have standard “top trumps” style rules, with categories like “pathogenicity” and “antibiotic resistance.” More complicated words would be bolded, with a reference list explaining these words in an educational way. Although the project was not completed, it remains an idea that will be pursued in the future. You can see some of the designs below.
We also created our own series of hand-sewn versions of our microbes"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Jaqueline Oolthuis. This very dedicated lady lives in Doetinchem. She was very interested in our project, sending us a crate of K’NEX. She was excited to see the printer when it is finished!
On the 18th of August we made a tour through South Holland to collect all the K’NEX.  It was very nice to see that so many people were interested in our project and willing to help. Jan was the first person who reacted on our twitter message. He works at Aerospace Engineering (TU Delft) and he had the specific red gears that we desperately needed.
Laura van Dijk. After Jan we drove to Den Hoorn. After getting lost a few times we finally found the right house. Here we found a 6 year old boy. His mother told us that he was bored of playing with the K’NEX within a few weeks. He definitely had no idea what cool stuff you can build with K’NEX, so we invited him to come by the office to see that.
Jelle Dijkstra. Then we travelled farther to Oegstgeest. At first, there was no one home. Jelle told us to that he had left the parts next to the front door. Luckily, he just came home when we found the package, so we could thank him personally.
Marjan Berkheij. We were already really satisfied with the amount of K’NEX we got, but when we arrived at the next address in Katwijk, we could not believe our eyes. Marjan had 5 boxes full with K'NEX. She told us her sons were already in their twenties, so they don’t use it anymore. She wanted to give it to charity, an orphanage for example, so we are going to look for a good charity organization to give it to.
Trees Prins.We drove already for a few hours through the Netherlands. For the last meeting we drove to Den Haag to Trees Prins. Now the car was full and we are ready to drive back to the office.
Leontien Smith and Max. On Friday Leontien Smith came by with her 12 year old son Max. We immediately saw that he was a real expert. He had a lot of ideas how we can improve the printer, so we sat down with him and started building. We really welcomed his advice. Afterwards, we gave him a tour through the building. He enjoyed the day very much, and so did we!

Abstract
BioBrick-A-Bot: Lego Robot for Automated BioBrick DNA Assembly
BioBrick-A-Bot
Commercial Liquid Handling Systems are extremely expensive, and are typically beyond the reach of the average molecular biologist interested in performing high throughput methods.  To address this problem, we design and implement a liquid handling system built from commonly accessible Legos. Our goal is the automation of BioBrick assembly on a platform that can itself be easily replicated and we demonstrate a proof-of-principle for this system by transferring colored dye solutions on a 96-well plate. We introduce a new concept called LegoRoboBrick.  The liquid handling system is build from 3 new LegoRoboBrick modular components: ALPHA (Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly), BETA (BioBrick Environmental Testing Apparatus), and PHI (Pneumatic Handling Interface).  We will demonstrate that the same BioBrick assembly software can run on multiple plug-and-play LegoRoboBrick instances with different physical dimensions and geometric configurations. The modular design of LegoRoboBricks allows easy extension of new laboratory functionalities in the future.
Project Goals
Low Cost – Robot cost significantly lower than $10,000, the price of a commercial liquid handling robot. (Actual cost of BioBrick-a-Bot prototype: ~$700)
Hardware Platform that is easily accessible.
Hardware Design that is easily replicable by other iGEM teams.
Software Design  that is robust, plug and play. Can swap modules from other iGEM teams.
Design that is easily extensible, to allow future collaboration with other iGEM teams.

Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Modelling Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html,"A, degmRNA OmpA, degmRNA lgA - mRNA Degradation Rate - Average mRNA half-life is known to be approximately 5 minutes however to reflect variation in this number between different mRNAs, we screen here over half-lives of 1, 5, 10 and 15 minutes for each protein [10]. Degradation rate is calculable from half-life using the formula; deg = ln(2)/halflife [11]. Using this formula degradation rates per minute are calculated as:
1 minute half-life - 0.69 mRNAs per minute
5 minute half-life - 0.14 mRNAs per minute
10 minute half-life - 0.07 mRNAs per minute
15 minute half-life - 0.05 mRNAs per minute
trlBamA, trlOmpA, trllgA - Translation Rate - Translation is known to occur at approximately 20 amino acids per second [12]. Length of each protein was found  for BamA [7], OmpA [8] and lgA [9] by searching through protein databases. Here we show the calculation used to find the translation rate per minute for BamA, OmpA and lgA:
trlBamA - (20/810)∗60 = 1.48 proteins per minute
trlOmpA - (20/346)∗60 = 3.47 proteins per minute
trllgA - (20/315)∗60 = 3.81 proteins per minute
degBamA, degOmpA, deglgA - Protein Degradation Rate - Protein half-life was determined using ProtParam Tool [13]. ProtParam uses the N-end rule [14] to determine protein half-life, the estimates given for each of BamA, OmpA and lgA are (>)10hrs in E.coli and 30hrs in reticulocytes hence an average 20hr half-life. In order to reflect the inexact nature of these computationally derived half-lives, we screen over possible half-lives of 10, 20 and 30 hours for each of BamA, OmpA and lgA. Applying the same degradation rate formula as previously deg = ln(2)/halflife [11] this yields degredation rates per minute of:
10 hour half-life - 1.16 * 10 -3 proteins per minute
20 hour half-life - 5.78 * 10 -4 proteins per minute

Analytical PCR was done to verify if the parts that we obtained from the Distribution Kit 2011 to build the GFP Reporter and Protease Producer plasmids have they corresponding size. The results were positive. Then we proceeded with the PCR products purification. Finally we did the Gibson Assemblies to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid and the Protease Producer Plasmid, using pSB1K5 and sfGFP as positive controls. The Assemblies worked all right! Afterwards, we sent all our constructs (Working Plasmid, GFP Reporter Plasmid and Protease Producer Plasmid) for sequencing.
Also, we are very happy because we received the free license of Matlab. Hopefully we will use this tool for modeling.

Proof of principle for the avidin-biotin ""polymerization""
We chose the avidin-biotin system because of their high affinity and rapid association. Our successful polymerization tests showed that cell density, concentration of biotinylated BSA in the bioink, and streptavidin concentration in the reservoir are the three major factors that impact performance. Thus, more BSA entailed higher structural integrity. We successfully printed defined objects with our technology and developed an optimal ratio of constituents. Aggregation was visually confirmed in the micromanipulator.
First bioprinting results using the biotINK bioprinter
We successfully produced first prints of defined spatial structure in our bioprinter and show that our technology compares favorably with existing Inkjet and microextrusion technologies in bioprinting, especially in terms of cell viability.
A vascularization inducer based on a hypoxia-sensitive promoter
We designed a hypoxia-driven promoter, which we tested for its functionality under low oxygen as well as normal oxygen conditions. Although the promoter does not increase gene expressions when cells are exposed to hypoxia, it remains remarkably steady - a feature that most promoters do not have.
Safety evaluation of our project and the kill-switch
Sequencing results showed a point mutation in both the part by the iGEM team of Freiburg 2010 and the Slovenian part of 2012. The mutation led to a PstI restriction site, that complicated cloning according to iGEM standards. After a site-directed mutagenesis (Quickchange) the restriction site was removed and the sequence hence repaired.
Quantitative analysis by mRNA measuring of Poly-A-sequence addition showed 4.6-fold higher mRNA stability in comparison to the non-Poly-A-construct.
Kill-Switch induction turned out to be difficult when using the prodrug famciclovir. Although HEK293T cells are known to produce aldehyde oxidase [1] and xanthine oxidase [2] the conversion of famciclovir into its active form penciclovir seems not to proceed effectively enough in HEK293T cells.

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system.

Usually an iGEM project mainly focuses on the lab work. We wanted to expand this view by                 investigating how our project might impact the economics of land grabbing by making                 use of the production of terpenoid-derived bioproducts. This resulted in a report, which outlines                 different aspects of land grabbing, such as population growth, prices for food commodities                 on a global scale, political and social influences and how an industrial-scale production of                 biofuels derived from artificial endosymbiosis could change either of these aspects towards a                 biobased production instead of land grabbing for resource generation.
In order to enable a scientific exchange between different iGEM teams, we also hosted the                 ‘iGEM meets Marburg’ meetup for the second time. Taking place in the beginning of august,                 we were able to welcome all German iGEM teams as well as the team from the SDU Denmark for an                 amazing weekend full of different activities and great discussions.
Because we also wanted to reach out to the general public, we had the opportunity to give several                 talks to different audiences, for example a group of American exchange students or during the junior                 GBM meeting in Marburg. Besides this, we were hosting the booth for Synmikro, the Institute for Synthetic                 Microbiology at the University of Marburg, at the Hessentag 2016, an annual fair of the state of                 Hesse. Here we had the possibility to reach out to a vast majority of society and discuss with them the                 goals, methods and possible threats of Synthetic Biology.

Results: We designed a biobrick based on the pLM005 plasmid which we used for our project (described above). It uses the silver RFC[23] prefix and suffix for insertion of a eukaryotic ORF into that site where it is tagged at the C terminal end by a YFP and expression is driven by the strong, constitutive PsaD promoter (see figure 19). We used the complimentary 1000bp gblock offer from IDT to synthesise fragments of our biobrick with 18bp overlaps for Gibson assembly. However, this large construct required 7 fragments (see figure 20) and we were unsuccessful in our attempts to assemble.

WEEK 3
June 18 2013 - June 25 2013
Goals:
It was increasingly important that we decide on our project. At this point we were considering a quorum sensing/cell signaling project that would build upon previously created quorum sensing parts submitted in the registry. We were also considering a methyltransferase-DNA binding domain fusion project with the goal of creating a new methyltransferase. We wanted to begin cloning t9002, a GFP producer controlled by an AHL signaling molecule receiver into psb1C3 from psb1A3 in order to use it in a quorum sensing device we were imagining.
Achievements:
This week we got all of our minipreps submitted for sequencing, and we made headway on our first cloning reaction. We figured out how to add restriction sites for cloning reactions using PCR and completed our first cloning reaction according to our successful colony PCR. We experimented with different thermocycler conditions and polymerases for our PCRs that had previously failed, and began to perform PCR with more success.
WEEK 4
June 25 2013 - July 2 2013
Goals:
This week we wanted to think about applications for selective methylation in E. coli and figure out how our project could be useful for future research. We brainstormed how we wanted to create our constructs and began thinking about the cloning reactions that would be required to create them. We also wanted to begin creating our wiki and start generating useful content.
Achievements:
We confirmed that we completed our first successful cloning reaction. We transformed and miniprepped the biobrick parts for the quorum sensing system that we envisioned creating, with one cell having a light-induced AHL producer, and another cell having a AHL producer downstream of an AHL activated promoter. We thought about creating a device that would spatially separate the cells, as opposed to having them in the same media. We used a simple restriction digest assay to test how BstUI, a methylation sensitive promoter, would behave.
WEEK 5
July 2 2013 - July 9 2013
Goals:
We wanted to experiment with USER cloning for assembling our gene blocks and minigenes. We also wanted to characterize pdawn and mcherry, parts we got from a lab at the University that we could use in our quorum sensing project.  We wanted to attempt to PCR assemble our MsssI and begin fabricating a device for our quorum sensing project.
Achievements:
We practiced measuring fluorescence using our pDawn and mcherry constructs. We successfully completed"

B. Ethylene Glikol Chromic Acid Assay
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a plastic that is a polymer of ethylene terephthalate (C10H8O4) units (Sarker et al., 2010). Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be degrade via limited enzymatic hydrolysis of the ester bond of the polymer backbone, one enzyme that have been assesed for this purpose is cutinase (Ribitsch et al., 2012). When polyethylene terephthalate degraded, it will produce terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol (Venkatachalam et al., 2012). Ethylene glycol is one of alcohol compound. Oxidation of alcohols by strong oxidants such as chromic acid (K2Cr2O7) in suphuric acid(H2SO4) is possible, but differs depending on the degree of alcohol. If a reaction has occurred using chromic acid in sulphuric acid, there is a color change from orange to green. In our project we use chromic acid to detect ethylene glycol as product of the PET degradation by LC"

We used this tool to generate all possible gRNA’s at exon-exon junctions in EPO, taking into account all codon substitutions possible. The tool is far more versatile, however. It can easily generate gRNA’s at a position of choice for all possible codon substitutions. This can also be useful for other applications that deal with high amounts of synonymous mutations in the gene they want to sequence.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#riboregulator#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," hand,    fluorescence can be observed when cis-repressing sequence is present because firstly, the RBS is sequence is correct, and secondly because the cis-repressing sequence failed    to repress the translation.
After repression, the system needs to be activated when taRNA is expressed. After the addition of arabinose, taRNA is expressed. Out of the three cognate riboregulator pairs that  were repressed, only two showed significant increase after arabinose induction. Lock 1- Key 1 cognate pair showed around 13-fold increase for both 1% and 2.5% (%w/v) arabinose  induction. Lock 3- Key 3 cognate pair showed around 1.5 and 3 fold increase for 1% and 2.5% of arabinose induction respectively. Lock 1-Key 1 and Lock 3- Key 3 behaved differently  for different concentrations of arabinose induction. Full induction was observed at 1% arabinose for Lock 1- Key 1 cognate pairs while full induction for Lock 3- Key 3 was observed at  2.5% arabinose. Statistically, no significant fold increase could be observed for Lock m- Key m cognate pair.
Discussion
The fold increase for Lock 1- Key 1 is lower than that of riboregulator pair mentioned in the Isaacs et al.’s paper.
iGEM 2005_Berkely, when they first introduced the riboregulator system to the iGEM community, they  mentioned in the Part Registry page that Lock 1 and Key 1 are “Biobricked  version of Isaacs’ riboregulator” crR12 and taR12 respectively. We can therefore expect the Lock 1 and Key 1 fold increase after induction to be similar to what Isaacs et al. have  observed and mentioned in the paper. Isaacs et al. mention that for crR12 and taR12 cognate pair, they have observed 19-fold increase (Isaacs et al., 2004), our results showed only  showed around 13 fold increase. One possibility for the deviation could be because the Lock 1 and Key 1 sequences are not 100% match with crR12 and taR12. Because scars are  introduced in 5’ and 3’ end of a Biobricked parts, iGEM 2005_Berekeley had to shorten the original 5’ and 3’ end"

What can be said however is that the tag doesn't seem to have any conformation other than a floating loop between the original amino acids of the protein on which its been hooked. We can also question the usefulness of such a construct for our project since it has neither the reach nor the rotation freedom of the floating C-terminus tag. It might be interesting for future teams that would want to maximize the number of tags to add to their CsgA though, providing the structure alteration isn't too important, which is an information we didn't have enough time to investigate this year.
Ni-Chelation
After the structural changes brought by the tags we tried to determine the chelating activity of the tagged CsgA. So we simply added nickel ions in the neighborhood of the tags and let the minimizations and dynamics do their magic.
CurLy'on Nickel chelation - iGEM INSA-Lyon 2014
Results
Wildtype CsgA chelates nickel
The very first result we are going to talk about is that even without an His-tag, the wildtype protein is able to chelate nickel. That is something we didn't expect and were surprised to discover. We put some nickels next to CsgA (in a 10 Angstroms radius), and Sybyl computed the simulations (with AMBER FF002 library, cutoff at 12 Ang, during 10 to 20 000 fs). Nickel can be captured by either a group of ketones that are close to each other, but even more surprising, we observed histidines, aspartic acids and other amino acids already present in wildtype CsgA were ""grabbing"" the ions and literally pulling them  between the beta strands into the center of the protein in some cases.
The natural protein can chelate nickel by itself.
After witnessing this we ran simulations with wildtype CsgA alone and a lot of nickel ions, and realized that its chelating power was quite high as it could retain a bit more than twenty ions.
Chelation by the His-tags
A far as the folded conformation is concerned, both His1-tag or His2-tag, cover already existing chelating sites of CsgA, but are still able to chelate nickel ions. The simulations showed that, though the tag could also fold a little to catch a nickel with two of its histidines, a bond between the nickel and both the tag AND CsgA often occurred, thus stabilizing the folded structure of the tag. However, with its reach decreased and the covering"

    In the field of biodetection and bioremediation, despite numerous proofs of principle, most bioreporters and bioabsorbents have remained confined to the laboratory (van der Meer and Belkin). Also, bacterial reporters and absorbents are NOT rational enough in design and NOT complex enough in function (Chakraborty et al., 2008; Diesel et al., 2009; Sharon Yagur-Kroll, 2010). Additionally, we notice that genetic manipulation in this field is in need of streamline methods (Hansen and Sorensen, 2000) and it's time for a series of issues on the field application to be taken into consideration (Kuppardt et al., 2009).

Fig2. Our heavy metal decontamination kit consists of a bioreporter system and a bioabsorbent. Bioreporter system acts as a sensor for certain heavy metal and will report the presence and extent of heavy metal pollution in water by a quantifiable and naked-eye recognizable output signal. When heavy metal detected, bioabsorbent will be put to use. Bioabsorbent is genetically engineered bacteria which is capable of absorbing heavy metal from water significantly and will auto-aggregate and sediment after water detoxified.
    Based on the principle of Biological Network Control and Reverse Engineering (Chikofsky and Cross, 1990), we engineered our bacteria to resolve these hard truths mentioned above. MerR family transcription factors (TFs) were exploited to construct a series of biorepoters for heavy metal detection and bioabsorbents for heavy metal decontamination (Fig.2 and Fig.3, Hobman, 2007; Hobman et al., 2005).

We primarily took system apart, followed by description of function, structure and operation of each part, especially the heavy metal responsive regulator.

The cultures containing the lysis device not induced (dashed red lines) shows a slow growth compared to BBa_K173010, maybe because of leakage of the inducible system causing a weak lysis or because the device decrease bacteria’s fitness. The culture containing the induced lysis device (red lines) shows a rapid decrease of O.D. after 15 minutes from induction, followed by a O.D. increasing. Different colonies had comparable dynamic growth.
This experiment has been repeated two times (data have not been reported): the first one (Experiment 2) lysis failed for unknown reasons, while in the second one (Experiment 3) it worked as in Experiment 1.
We deduced that the slow O.D. increase in lysed cultures (as well as the apparent genetic instability of the inducible device, which was unresponsive to 3OC6-HSL in Experiment 2) could be due to a positive selection of mutant cells unresponsive to 3OC6-HSL (or defective in the lysis device) or to the shortage of free 3OC6-HSL. To test this hypotheses, we performed a fourth, independent experiment, using  inducible system,  as a negative control and a culture containing only  part (not functional because the operon lacks a promoter). The test has been performed with two different inducer concentrations (100 nM and 10nM) and following the standard protocol of [ Microplate reader experiments ]. In this experiment (Experiment 4), lysis was induced at t=0 and, in previously induced cultures, also after 4 hours of growth to test if they were still responsive to 3OC6-HSL.

The growth curves of the second experiment are in agreement with the result of Experiment 1. Moreover, our hypothesis of mutant generation for  induced culture is confirmed by the second induction: if the increase in O.D. was perhaps due to a shortage of 3OC6-HSL in the growing population, the second induction would have caused a new decline in O.D., which is not our case. This hypotesis is also confirmed by the growth curves of induced (at t=0)  cultures, which show a decrease (from 15 min to 2 hours) followed by an increasing growth, comparable with the negative controls growth and faster than  non induced cultures growth.

Thank You
The PoPPY team would like to thank everyone who made this project possible, especially those described below. For the past five years, undergraduates at UCSC have participated in iGEM. This year, the team is composed of students studying Bioengineering (Biomolecular), Bioinformatics, Bioengineering (Assistive Technology: Motor), Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Marine Biology, and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence and Human Computer Interaction. Our diverse group of individuals is crucial for the creative process behind using synthetic biology to help others. Modern engineering demands collaboration between individuals and pushes them to think critically and work efficiently. Through synthetic biology, the 2018 UCSC iGEM team is solving worldwide issues and developing methods to expand their research in the future.
The Project Idea
After several journal club meetings, our team determined the PoPPY project was the most meaningful pursuit. The initial idea was proposed by captain Morgan Tardy and mentor McKenna Hicks .

In this experiment, N-acetyl D-glucosamine (“NaDg”; analogous to a chitin monomer and widely used in the literature for assessing chitin binding) was first titrated into 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD and no isotherm was calculated because binding sites were not saturated by the ligand. Cu was then titrated into the 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD + NaDg complex and this resulted in a Cu affinity at Ka= 7.61 +/- 1.49x 106 M-1 that is largely comparable to 2x-HHTC-Re (no CBD) and lowerby an order of magnitude than 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD without bound NaDg. Data show 20 1 µL injections. 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD was selected as the candidate for testing because it displayed the most consistent and strong results during protein purification procedures, and seemed most promising for downstream applications (such as our filter). Work is in progress on optimizing the 3x and 6x fusion proteins and creating prototypes (thus far, protein production as been successful).

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,".  Will be ready to innoculate some liquid cultures tonight around 5 pm or 6 pm and grow them up overnight for making glycerol stocks.
Unfortunately, the plates for our new shuttle vector and promoters were spread far too thick to achieve colonies.  Will try to restreak them tonight with hopefully better results.
Primer design:
Due to the palindromic nature of the enzymes that flank a Biobrick part, all primers that contain these sequences will have some degree of self-complmentarity.  This may or may not present a problem.
We are discussing the issue of where to put the binding sequences on each promoter.  It appears that for all activator reporters that we received, the binding sites come right before the promoter, which is mCyc.  However, for all repressor reporters, the binding sites appear to come in the middle of the promoter.  Since our system incorporates a combination of both, we will have to consider where the optimal placement of the binding sites should be. This will likely require a literature search on our part.
We also devised another test (Test #1.5) to conduct after we have done Test #2.  This test will involve two mutually-repressive constructs, only one of which is under control of an inducible promoter (PMET25, perhaps?).  This test will occur only after Test #2 because Test #2 will tell us which repressor/activator pair we require in order to get good competitive binding.  Then we can choose a different repressor to be the second construct in Test #1.5, which will require a different fluorescence.  This Test #1.5 will be a closer approximation of constructs Z and Y from our final design, which mutually repress each other.

Assay
We performed 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid assay (DNS assay), because this assay takes less time, costs a less money and is used in the previous article measuring chitinase activities [1]. DNS assay is based on this fact: Being boiled, 3,5-dinitorosalicylic acid (DNS), whose color is yellow, reacts with reducing saccharide by boiling and changes into 3-amino-5-nitorosalicylic acid, whose color is brawn. [4][5]
The more the amount of reducing sugar is, the more this coloring reaction proceeds. We can quantitatively evaluate the degree of this coloring reaction by measuring OD 550, because OD 550 is indirectly the amount of the reducing sugar.
We will react DNS reagent with the media where chitin and E.coli introduced chitinase gene are added. If chitinase is secreted in media, chitin is decomposed into reducing sugar, for example, N-acetylglucosamin and coloring reaction proceeds. Therefore, by measuring OD 550, we can indirectly measure chitinase activities.

This figure shows the overall of DNS assay
The detail of these experiment was written in Protocol
To measure chitinase activity by DNS assay, we thought to need four following things to get accurate result. We need
to plot the relationship of reducing sugar concentration and OD 550
to evaluate the impact of components of media on OD 550
to evaluate the impact of remeineded E.coli in media on OD 550
to measure chitinase activity
3-1. Standard Measurement for ChiA1.
In order to know the relationship between OD550 and the amount of reducing sugar, we prepared the standard curve by using glucose as standard. It is known that the correlation between glucose concentration and the absorbance can be plotted in a linaer way.
From the result, a strong correlation between glucose concentration and its OD550 was observed.

Introduction of a new olfactory receptor
Previously it was found that that the yeast pheromone signaling pathway can be coupled to a mammalian olfactory receptor. Minic et al. succeeded in functional expressing the rat 17 OR and its trafficking to the plasma membrane in S. cerevisiae.  Between the three GPCRs that are known in S. cerevisiae,  Ste2, Ste3 and Gpr1, the sequence similarity is limited. Except for pheromone receptors in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Kluyveromyces lactis, Ste2 and Ste3 are largely unrelated in sequence to other GPCRs [5]. Nevertheless, the yeast pheromone receptors can be functionally replaced by several mammalian GPCRs so that the pheromone pathway can be activated by the corresponding ligands [4]. For localization of the receptor into the membrane and a higher affinity with the alpha-subunit we made a chimeric design of the receptor, after the research of Radhika et al. [7]. For a detailed design, and how to do this yourself, look at the DIY receptor design page .
Niacin olfactory receptor
The receptors GPR109A and GPR109B are known to bind the compound nicotinic acid [8].  It was previously described that GPR109B acts a low affinity receptor for nicotinic acid and GPR109A acts as a high affinity receptor for nicotinic acid and  other compounds with related pharmacology [molecular identification of high and low affinity receptors].  The chemical compound methyl nicotinate is closely related to nicotinic acid. Because one of the compounds in the breath of tuberculosis patients is methyl nicotinate [9,10], the high affinity receptor for niacin is a good candidate for testing the ‘olfactory yeast’ as a diagnostics tool.

To live the spirit of iGEM our team collaborated with other teams.
Team Heidelberg
When we introduced Gibson cloning in our team we were facing quite some challenges but after several months of optimizing protocol and reagents and doing refinements we succeeded easily to have positive colonies carrying correctly assembled plasmids. We wanted to pass this laborious achievement and knowledge on to other iGEM teams. To help team Heidelberg establishing Gibson cloning for their project we decided to visit their laboratory.
For team Heidelberg it was very important to get Gibson cloning running as soon as possible. Their constructs are quite complex and time was running short. To demonstrate Gibson cloning we brought along a reporter plasmid of our project. This reporter plasmid consists of four parts: the backbone pBS1C3, a CMV promoter, an avGFP and a BGH terminator. Together we calculated the amounts of DNA fragments needed the Gibson reaction and pipetted the mix. After revealing some tricks and myths the Heidelberg iGEMs were able to yield E. coli carrying the reporter plasmid. To verify the functionality of the construct they checked for fluorescence and were happy to see green color.
To top this collaboration off Team Heidelberg provided a CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cell line, which we could manipulate by our uniCAS toolkit.
Besides spending time in their iGEM lab we were shown around on campus and in the city of Heidelberg. Finally, we all enjoyed a fabulous dinner in the heart of the historic city center.

・iGEM Japan Kansai Forum
iGEM Japan Kansai Forum was held in Kyoto University. Team Kyoto , Team Nagahama , Team Gifu , Team Botchan Lab Tokyo , Team HokkaidoU_Japan ,         and many ex-members participated in this event and shared information about their teams and their projects.
Team Kobe also took part in this event. We made a presentation about our project, and listened to their presentations. As we participate in iGEM competition for the first time, all presentations were inspiring to us. We understood what other teams were planning at that time, and realized what we didn’t consider about our project. For example, Team Botchan_Lab_Tokyo inspired us to think more seriously about our human practice.
After each presentation, we had a Q&A session. During this session, many participants actively asked questions, and all teams including presenters could understand their projects more deeply. We team Kobe are also inspired by their good questions and these questions gave us an opportunity to review our project plan and to learn more about tea itself.
Besides Q&A sessions, all participants wrote feedbacks on questionnaires so that they could share their thoughts and improve their project.

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Implementation#testing_-_-_TEXT.html," an all-or-nothing response, and is thus not tunable. Christina Smolke of Caltech published a paper investigating the dynamics of the Gal induction system, in which she discovered that knockout of the Gal2 gene makes pGAL1 tunable, giving it a linear response to concentration of galactose.
Gene knockout in yeast is a surprisingly simple procedure.  Amplifying the kanamycin resistance gene using primers each containing 30-40bp of homology to a site on the yeast chromosome yields a product that, when transformed into yeast, disrupts the gene at the chosen locus while integrating the Kan gene. This renders knockout cells  resistant to the antibiotic G-418, which is then used for selection.  We have preformed the Gal2 knockout using the primers designed for the paper, and hope to use pGAL1 as a tunable promoter

The spectra of these three fluorescent proteins can be separated to quantify their individual concentrations.  We have had success imaging our strains on a confocal microscope, where different lasers are used to excite each fluorescent protein at a precise wavelength sequentially, minimizing the possibility of bleed-through.
Viability Tests
In addition to testing the promoters and parts provided to us, we wish to apply our network to tests that involve
Apoptosis test- induce apoptosis externally and then save cells with the limiter device! -this test has important medical relevance, seeing as many tumor phenotypes are characterized by a noted decline or absence of apoptotic activity
-for yeast, extrinsically-signaled apoptosis depends on oxidative stress or salt  -involves the following system:  Possible target for downregulation could be Bir1p (from BIR1 gene), a homolog of survivin from humans that is thought to stabilize XIAP Another possible target is AIF1, a homolog of the human AIF1  -released from mito.and travels to nucleus -interesting fact about S. cerevisiae is that they are facultative anaerobic yeast and can survive even with complete removal of mitochondria, making them an ideal system for studying PCD (Frolich- Yeast apoptosos)

We use hexane to dilute geraniol and farnesol and use decane to collect antibacterial fragrances from E. coli culture. Hexane and decane are flammable. These solvents are not used beside the fire. We have worn rubber gloves and have sterilized all wastes to reduce the risks, including safety level 1 procedures.
b) Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
We only use E. coli JM109 and E. coli DH5alpha encoding extra DNA parts that are originated from E. coli and in Spring 2015 Distribution. These organisms are derived from E. coli K-12 strain that belong to Risk group 1. So we think that these organisms have no risks to the safety and health of the general public.
c) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
We are using only E. coli JM109 and E. coli DH5alpha. They belong to B1 level in biological safety in Japan, and can not live in nature. So if they escape from our lab, there is no risk to the environment.
d) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
All E. coli and DNA parts are stored in private refrigerators for our project, and the refrigerators have been locked when we do not use them.
e) What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
As described above, we only use B1 level E. coli in our project and all biological materials are autoclaved before waste according to our institute rule.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
What would happen if all your dreams came true, and your project grew from a small lab study into a commercial/industrial/medical product that was used by many people? We invite you to speculate broadly and discuss possibilities, rather than providing definite answers. Even if the product is ""safe"", please discuss possible risks and how they could be addressed, rather than simply saying that there are no risks at all.
Q) What new risks might arise from your project's growth?

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook )."
Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the idea of synthetic biology and newly established an iGEM team on our instruction. In addition, inspired by the principle of opening science, we interviewed Ms. Shi, a doctoral student in pharmacy, revealing the true living and studying condition of common sci-researchers in China to people outside the industry. Finally, some artwork was created to help explain our STEP system to the public, saturated in the two-way constructing process of humanity and technology.
1. An image of sci-researchers in China
In our wildest dream of childhood, there always existed a profession named ‘scientist’. But only a few of us hold on to it ultimately. Researchers are always a mystery to the public. In public mind they are a group of people burying themselves in labs and isolated from normal society. Nevertheless, the truth is far from that while the public has started to think differently. Rooted in China, we focus on the topic Society, Research, Researchers to reveal the true living condition of sci-researchers in China today.
Begin Reading
In the meeting with Shi, a typical doctoral student of pharmacy, we discover the change of public attitude towards the field of research. What’s their working pattern? How do they step into this field? What do their future look like? Her one-step-at-a-time experience gave the answer.
2. Future scientists — from kindergarten to college
To propagate synthetic biology and share the fun of iGEM with future synthetic biologists, we organized a series of activities and lectures to students of all ages. Kindergarten: A mini-lab For kids in kindergarten, we host a mini-biolab to introduce some basic concepts regarding microorganisms in an interesting way. Moreover, we helped the lovely children cultivate their interest in synthetic biology as well as  inform them of the significance of keeping personal hygiene.  PS: Safety is guaranteed during this activity.
Canton primary school: Volunteer teaching When our team is working as volunteer teacher in rural areas of Canton, we also always bear the responsibility of sharing the idea of iGEM to more people. In Canton, to broaden their horizon to a grander world, our deliver introduced our project and some basic situations of iGEM to hundreds of seated students from primary school and junior high school. Though due to the limit of equipment and knowledge, they could not be iGEMers now, we have planted seeds of synthetic biology in their naïve heart which might grow up to a glorious tree one day in the future.
