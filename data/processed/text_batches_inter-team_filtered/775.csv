TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Team#Esmee_-_-_TEXT.html," I had a meeting with Conrad for the wiki, Janneke and I looked for bio-bricks of previous iGEM teams which we can use for our own project.
Week 19
Tania and I did research on the properties of Mussel foot protein 5. On Friday we discussed the best way of going on with the whole team. We deciced to divide our project in three subprojects: cell-cell adhesion, cell-surface adhesion, and enhancement of the ahesive properties of Mfp-5. In the afternoon we had a meeting with the other three Dutch iGEM teams (Amsterdam, Wageningen, Groningen) in Amsterdam. We teams presented our project after which we discussed each project in more detail in smaller groups. In the evening wee drank beers and ate pizza with the whole group. It was fun to meet the other teams and to get an idea of what they are doing!
Week 18
This week we presented our ideas of iGEM to the other team members. I looked into bio-bricks of previous iGEM teams and sent emails to people who worked with Mussel foot proteins to increase our knowledge.
Week 17
On Easter Monday we had the idea to combine the two left topics to one, but on Tuesday we finally decided to go one with just one: adhesiveness of Mussel foot protein. On Wednesday and Thursday we studied the literature on Mfp. For relaxation we made a boat trip trough the canals of Delft. We presented our final topic to the Biotechnology department on Friday. Afterwards, we went to the Beestenmarkt to drink some beers. We also drank some beers in the Botanic garden because of Mark Loosdrecht's medal.
Week 16
On Monday we had our third brainstorm session with advisors and supervisors. On Tuesday our 100 ideas were narrowed down to a top 20. We did literature study on these 20 topics and on Wednesday we made a top 10. On Thursday 4 topics were left. On Friday we gave a presentations about each topic to businessmen, adivisors and supervisors. Two ideas survived the elimination race and were further studied during the weekend!
Week 15
On Tuesday Drew Endy gave a presentation at Department of Bionanoscience!!! On Wednesday we had a meeting with Lesley Robertson, Biological Safety Officer of the Faculty of Applied Sciences. On Friday we had our second brainstorm session with advisors and supervisors.
Week 14
On Friday we had our first brainstorm session with advisors and supervisors.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#build#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from fumarate. This impairs the efficiency of the TCA-cycle and the production of amino acids; since some amino acids are formed from TCA-cycle intermediates (Waegeman et al. , 2011) (Fig 1a). Team Amsterdam faced a similar problem and aimed  to incorporate a glyoxylate shunt into Synechocystis to increase fumarate production.  The glyoxylate shunt is composed of two enzymes, which are Malate Synthase and Isocitrate Lyase. They form a shortcut in the TCA-cycle (Fig. 1b).  In this way, the glyoxylate shunt restores some of the flux through part of the TCA-cycle, which should lead to a more efficient TCA-cycle. This is predicted to be beneficial for the cell in terms of fitness, as modelled by iGEM team Amsterdam.  For E.coli, a similar approach could be adopted, since E.coli can express the glyoxylate shunt genes to produce malate from isocitrate via glyoxylate. Thereby, in the process of producing malate, also succinate is formed. Because the cell can produce FADH2 by converting succinate to fumarate, the formed succinate will go to fumarate. In this way we are able to gain fitness and fumarate production, by having the glyoxylate shunt active.
Figure 1. The TCA-cycle with and without glyoxylate shunt. 1a). Fumarate is produced in a growth coupled way as a side product of arginine production. By knocking out fumarase, it cannot be degraded to malate. This way Fumarate accumulates. The TCA-cycle however is ‘broken’.1b). By expressing Malate Synthaese (MS) and Isocytrate Lyase (ICL), we can partly fix the ‘broken’ cycle. Now Isocitrate is made into both glyoxylate from which malate is synthesized and into succinate, which can be converted into fumarate. This way we have a better functioning cycle and more fumarate production thanks to the glyoxylate shunt.
However, when we look at the E. Coli physiology, the glyoxylate shunt genes are already present, but repressed by a repressor encoded by the iclR gene (Waeg"

Communicating and collaborating in iGEM - The HumHub Report
As our team started collaborating with the Stockholm team, their team had had some communication issues and discussions about the communication platform that they should use. Little did they know, our team struggled with the exact same issues in the beginning of our project. Stockholm was quick to act, and before we knew it they had put up a platform called HumHub. Our teams became some of the very first users of this new collaboration platform. As our project came close to the end, we wrote a report on how we used this platform and what we felt were the pros and cons, while looking back to our teams’ communication situations in the beginning. This is the HumHub Report, a result of the collaboration between Aalto-Helsinki and Stockholm.
In the beginning there was social media
In team Stockholm, in a meeting before lab work had started, the question of communication via Facebook was raised. Facebook was their team’s main means of communication and a lot of important information regarding iGEM was mixed up with more typical Facebook material. This situation was not considered optimal. The communication on Facebook was spread out over different groups and chats; a group for our whole team, events, individual chat groups for"

Human Practice
In order to improve our project design, we created some opportunities to exchange ideas with company, professors, iGEM teams and senior students in the form of workshops and interviews.Most importantly, we conduct a CCC project for studying the cognitive gap between the public and scientific communities as a social research.
Microfluidic Chip Operation Optimization
In August, we visited a company, Universal Analytical & Testing Instruments Ltd. in Guangzhou. During the visit, we discussed about the optimization procedure of the microfluidic chip. One of the key limiting parameters is the encapsulation rate of chip. They proposed that we could adjust the pressure thresholds and cell concentration to increase the encapsulation rate. After the application of the ideas, it actually helped us to get closer to our goal. The encapsulation rate has a 5-fold increase comparing to our original protocol.
Dolomite Microfluidics in UK
At the same time, we contact Dolomite Microfluidic in UK through email for trouble shooting. The fiber coming from liquid and atmosphere often block our microfluidic chip and are very hard to remove, which is a disaster. This problem has been bothering us for a long time. We communicated with a senior engineer who provided us some hints of solutions. We then improved our protocol for cleaning the chip and filtering the biomaterial before use.
Expert Interview
We cooperated with Prof. Xin Cheng’s lab to build our novel micro-well system for biological application. One of our team members participated his lab to learn the fabrication of"

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Argentina_-_-_TEXT.html," On one hand, in the field of health are being studied and / or targeted therapies applied to prevention, such as vaccines, in vitro diagnostics and new therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy. Furthermore, the prominent place that Argentina reached the export of biofuels worldwide, marks a turning point in the sustainable production of new energy from basic inputs with different biotechnological processes in which Argentina has a big export. At the same time, the development of plant genetics to offer seeds for crops by locally owned companies that have implemented the best biotechnological processes, ensures new opportunities to continue to be part of world leadership in the production and export of proteins at the same time opening markets for products and quality seed (Câmara Argentina de Biotecnologia).
The National Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion, through the Argentine Fund Sector (FONARSEC) invites public or public-private partnerships for the presentation of projects to generate biotechnological platforms that allow progress to improve the combination in  science: basic research, biotechnological applications and technological innovation, ie, the application of knowledge gained in basic research laboratory to practice. The goal is to partially finance these biotechnology projects based on new technologies and innovations made in science. It  prioritize sustainable and viable projects in technical, institutional and organizational terms. It seeks to articulate care practices oriented translational research on biotechnology (Agencia nacional de promocíon científica y tecnológica).
EVENTS RELATED TO SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
In 2012, courses in Introduction to Synthetic Biology  were organized by prof.Dr.Alejandro Nadra, prof.Dr.Ignacio Sanchez and prof.Dr.Alejandro Colman-Lerner, administered by the European Synthetic Biology Organization (EMBO). However, there is still widespread in Argentina one line of Synthetic Biology research itself. There are introductory courses, discussions and exhibits at conferences, such as the REDBIO. REDBIO is the Latin American and Caribbean Meeting on Biotechnology, where many issues are discussed and exposed in relation to the practices and results of biotechnological development in Latin America, including the Synthetic Biology

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," an auxotroph and cannot transmit plasmids to other strains (it is a F- strain).
We have constructed resistance marker cassettes expressing ampicillin, hygromycin, or neomycin resistance. The antibiotics mentioned are used in public health settings to treat infections and therefore the spread of antibiotic resistance is very problematic and can have great implications on the public health. If these marker cassettes were accidentally released and a given microorganism was naturally transformed with the DNA there could be a small chance that the organism would have acquired resistance to the respective antibiotic. However, this is unlikely to happen. Should our E. coli DH5α containing a plasmid with antibiotic resistance be released into the environment, it would be unlikely for the strain to transfer the plasmid, as the strain as earlier mentioned is F-. Therefore the spread of antibiotic resistance genes poses a low safety risk. The Aspergillus nidulans strain used in this project is also an auxotroph and to survive outside the lab, it requires high concentrations of arginine, uracil, and uridine. The mammalian cells transfected with plasmids containing antibiotic resistance would not be able to survive outside the lab, because the U-2 OS cell line like many other mammalian cell lines requires very specific growth conditions.
c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
We have evaluated that there would be no risks to environmental quality if our biobricks or devices were released by design or accident, because the coding sequences mainly encode fluorescent proteins. As mentioned before the strains we were working with are not able to grow outside the lab and therefore do not pose any risks to environmental quality. It is important to dispose biological waste correctly to prevent accidental release of the biological material from the laboratory. If all safety precautions are followed according to all local and federal regulations our project will not raise any safety issues. The guidelines for disposal of biological waste as defined by the Center for Microbial Biotechnology (CMB) at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) was followed to prevent possible release of genetically modified organisms (GMO).
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
No, the parts we have constructed are in themselves or combined not a threat to security. The aim of our project is to develop an assembly standard that is easy and fast to use, but the assembly system can of course be misused, and thereby pose a security risk. However, this is the case for all technologies within biotechnology, and would require the knowledge and expertise of designing experiments and conducting them.

NTNU Brixells Modelling Collaboration
The collaboration focused on two elements:
Calculating the probability of formation, including the probability of E. Coli bonding correctly.
Calculating the effect of arm length on structure changes increases. This has been motivated by the observation that the longer the arms the higher the likelihood  that the e.coli cells can attach because they are less closely packed and such wouldn't get in each others way.
There are many methods to look at this kind of problems, but the most realistic may require huge computational resources. So it is necessary to find an approach that is experimentally relevant, computationally tractable, and reflecting the biophysics underlying Brixells.
We, Team NTNU Trondheim have offered ideas, modeling frameworks, software simulation, and data analysis to answer these questions, based on information theory and thermodynamics. For Problem 1, we have suggested an approach in terms of binding affinity and specificity where the information entropy is used as a measure of specificity. For Problem 2, we have suggested a thermodynamics approach using the Poisson-Boltzmann theory where the zinc fingers and E. Coli are approximated by a set of beads (one large bead for the E. Coli, small beads for each zinc finger, and a rod of beads for the DNA arm. Team Warwick has been enthusiastic about this approach since it is a stochastic method that they have not considered, and they have provided that us with data related to the geometry of E. Coli-arm formation.

Codon Optimisation
A codon table for Marchantia polymorpha
Method
Our dataset was made of large gap read mapping transcripts obtained by mRNA sequencing conducted by the Haseloff Lab on the M. polymorpha Cam strain.  Open Reading Frame (ORF) and Coding Sequence (CDS) predictions were made using the CLC bio Transcript Discovery plugin [1] .
We used ran blastx on our data [2] to verify the validity of the predicted ORFs and to compare the sequences with the proteins present in Arabidopsis. A list of candidate genes was compiled from the results and this list was used to calculate a frequency table of codon usage for M. polymorpha.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1: Our codon table for m. polymorpha
The number of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) resulting from our initial predictions totalled 99 000, which seemed too large to be realistic, and half of these were only 100 amino acids (100 aa) long. By filtering the dataset using a threshold of 300 aa for candidate genes we obtained a distribution of lengths that seemed reasonable.
Figure 2: A histogram of the lengths of predicted genes in m. polymorpha
In the blastx output, the longest complete sequence match was 40%. This is small as expected given the phylogenetic distance between M.polymorpha and A. thaliana [3] [4] .
The Codon Usage table we obtained for M. polymorpha is not strikingly similar to that of A. thaliana, as expected from the 400 million years of evolutionary divergence between them [5] .
However, there is a similarity in the slight preference for C over other bases at the end of codons and that for G-p-C sites, as can be seen in the codon table.

Circular mRNA ver.2.0
In last year, we succeeded in designing the sequence which synthesizes circular mRNA and long chain protein in Escherichia coli.
In this year, we had 2 purposes in our study. One was an efficiency of the circularization. The efficiency was lower in our previous study. This was why the splicing was hard to happen because two sequences to act as ribozyme for splicing were far each other. So we incorporated complementary sequences around the ribozyme regions. We thought that the treatment brought two regions close and the efficiency of the circularization improved.
The other was to synthesize useful proteins. In our previous study, synthesized long-chain proteins lose their function because the folding of the proteins was broken. So we incorporated linker sequences into circular mRNA to synthesize the functional long-chain protein.

We prepared tubes of color before the girls arrived using water, glycerol, and kool aid powder. After inserting the colors into the gel, the girls were able to watch as the electric current from the power source pulled the colors down the gel. After the gels ran for about 10 minutes, the girls were able to cut out their colored bands and take them home!
Quantitative DNA Extraction
This activity allowed the girls to get quantitative data by extracting the DNA from both strawberries and blueberries to see which fruit had the most DNA. After weighing out 20g of fruit, the girls added 10mL of the extraction liquid and were able to mass the fruit. After filtering this into a cup, the girls added isopropyl alcohol. After stirring, they filtered the DNA from the mixture into a test tube and recorded the weight of the fruit DNA. By the end of the camp, we were able to collect data comparing the weights of DNA from blueberries and strawberries. We found that the girls were able to extract much more DNA from the blueberries than the strawberries.
All of the data collected from TouchTomorrow and the Women in Science camp was compiled into a report that was sent to the iGEM Team at The College of William and Mary so that they can use our experiences to update their protocols for more effective scientific education for children."

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," our desired output (see section on output). We decided to generate an entirely protein-based circuit that still produced the TEV protease.
We initially considered sterically inhibiting TEV protease in the absence of cruzipain. However, due to the crystal structure of the protease, specifically the location of the N- and C-termini oriented away from the active site, we decided this would not be a reliable method. We then discovered split TEV protease Wehr et al. 2006, in which two haves of the protein are present individually in an unconnected, and therefore inactive form. The halves are attached to dimerisation partners and on dimerisation TEV becomes active. We combined the split protease design with the ideas put forward in a paper using split fluorescent proteins in a protease detector Shekhawat et al. 2009. The result of this was two TEV protease fragments, each of which are bound to leucine zipper coils A, B, and B*. A is bound to inhibitory coil B* by a cruzipain-cleavable linker to prevent spontaneous activation. Inhibition is relieved on cleavage by cruzipain. When cruzipain cleaves, the A and B leucine zippers are free to dimerise, activating the TEV protease. This goes on to amplify the signal, producing a detectable output. This is shown schematically below.
Before cleavage, it is more entropically favorable for the B* coil to bind to the A coil as it is joined by a linker; dimerisation of the A and B coils is therefore inhibited. Once the linker (A–B*) is cleaved, A binds to B as this is the enthalpically favored reaction. Two of the Leu residues in the B* leucine zipper have been mutated to Ala residues, decreasing the enthalpic benefit of binding to A (another Leu zipper) by approximately 0.5 - 2kcal/mol per substitution, giving the B coil the advantage.
We hypothesised that introducing a feedback loop to amplify the signal would make the signal more sensitive to the levels of cruzipain and decrease the time taken to produce enough output to detect. In this system, both our input (cruzipain) and our intermediate output (TEV protease) are proteases. We designed the system so that TEV, as well as cruzipain, would cleave the A-B* linker. As a result, our system would require only a small initial signal to produce"

2015 Georgia Tech iGEM Team
Undergraduate Research Team
Kellie Heom
Kellie is a second year chemical engineering student. She has always been interested in all the sciences and to this day fears having to decide what she wants to do with her future. This may account for her eager attitude towards iGEM; she looks forward to integrating a number of exciting concepts in synthetic chemistry, molecular biology, protein engineering, and evolution to create a product that could advance the healthcare industry. Outside (and inside) the lab, she enjoys listening to almost any kind of music, cracking sarcastic jokes, and emitting positive energy.
Jordan Nafekh
Jordan is a fourth year student studying chemical engineering. As of now he plans on going to law school after graduation, but deep down he still has no real idea what he wants to do and his plans could change on a whim. His interests outside of school focus mainly around basketball, of which he is an exceptional player.
Anthony Mok
Anthony is a senior biology student at Georgia Tech, who plans to attend medical school after graduation. He is extremely interested in how biological systems evolve and finds it fascinating that humans can utilize this mechanism. He is also fascinated by theoretical physics, of which very little he understands but would love to learn more. Outside, he loves binge eating, then playing basketball, then sleeping.
Julianne Oliver
Julianne is a second year biochemistry pre-health student. She is extremely interested in the human body and medicine, so enzyme evolution for the purpose of bettering drug delivery is what excites her the most about this project. She hopes to continue this project in order to help people in the future. Outside of the lab, Julianne is an avid runner and writer who loves to read blogs and drink way too much coffee.
Brandon Holt
Brandon is a second year biomedical engineering student, who also plans on attending biomed/bioengineering graduate school after his senior year. He is most interested in learning about and doing research in the fields of immunoengineering (in particular, the complement system) and hematology. Brandon was a hockey player for 12 years, but has recently switched to swimming, and also happens to be half-hungarian. His favorite thing to listen to is M83 and he loves to read science fiction.

Continuing the Conversation
Sustainability is an incredibly important when building community partnerships. Lasting relationships and collaborative learning require intentionality. Our team is dedicated to continuing our meaningful community conversations even outside of competition season by creating new annual programs and large events. Our efforts in sustainability can be found here .
Major achievements:
Year round visits from local high schools and the establishment of a new University class Mentored Teaching in Synthetic Biology to support these visits
Building with Biology Public Forum with over 80 participants ages 6 to 60
The creation of a new summer internship program
A new partnership with the STEMINISTS a Women in STEM campus organization with over 100 new members this year
Database
Last year our team created an Outreach Database which supports the iGEM values of sharing and building on past innovations, specifically with human practices. Currently the database contains every outreach and IHP project from gold medal teams in years 2015 to 2017. The database holds approximately 2,2000 entries, rigorously characterized, accessible and centralized to one page. This year our team used the database as a tool to create new and improved upon past outreach projects from our intentional community. To help other teams efficiently utilize the database to improve upon their human practices projects we created an Outreach Planning Guide and a Quick View Outreach Planning Guide .
Together the database and Planning Guide will help promote innovation and progress in iGEM outreach. To read more see our Database Page .

SUSTC-Shenzhen,2014,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," we conjugate a luciferase gene to Cas9 gene and imaging its activate in the live mice. We will then optimize the delivery method and dosage of the A-B toxin-gRNA plasmid complex and monitor the changing in GFP expression of transplant cell using either biopsy or intravital fluorescent imaging.
Permanent implanting Cas9 gene into hematopoietic stem cells
Hematopoietic stem cells are the progenitor of all blood cells, including CD4+ T/B cells. It’s very difficult to extract all CD4+ T/B cells from the human blood system, doing the gene modification and then sent them back. Also, these cells can’t replicate, which means regularly gene modification should be done, which is unrealistic. Instead, one of our team members called Lin Le suggested to modify hematopoietic stem cells because all the offspring of the modified hematopoietic stem cells, including CD4+ T/B cells, carries our system, and it won’t loss since the renewal of CD4+ T/B cell will continue if the modified hematopoietic stem cells are still alive. The field of gene therapy has help accumulated a lot of knowledge in this area but it was partially hindered by the viral vectors used. The recent developed high efficient genome editing method including CRISPR/Cas9, Transcription activator-like effector nuclease（TALEN） and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) might provide a safer approach.  A recent report (Holt et al., 2010) using engineered ZFNs to eliminate CCR5 in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem /progenitor cells (HSPCs) revealed the possibility to manipulate hematopoietic stem cells. Mouse model used in the report shows positive results after genome editing by ZFNs, indicating promising future for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing.
Using CRISPR/Cas system to integrate Cas9 into human cells
Our current project uses Piggybac transposon system to deliver Cas9 into human cells for proof-of-principle studies. However, the integration site of Piggybac is non-specific, and it also has preferences for active transcribing sites, which may be normal or oncogene sites. Thus it is not ideal for clinical usage. However, the genome editing tool we used in this project (CRISPR/Cas system) has strong specificity for its target and the target can be designed to non-coding regions on human genome by carefully designed gRNA. One of the possible solutions is to integrate homologous recombinant sites around Cas9"

iGEM Toolkits: Background
As the iGEM competition grows, iGEM teams are looking to build increasingly complex systems with many gene inserts. In some cases, we want to transfer whole organelle-level systems from host organisms that may be difficult to culture or have other undesirable traits to model organisms that are easy to manipulate. This type of large-scale gene manipulation has been accelerated by new DNA assembly techniques, perhaps most notably the Gibson Assembly method. These new tools allow for multiple inserts and allow precise design down to the nucleotide level without ligation scars which can degrade the performance of gene circuits. Since 2010 the UW iGEM team has been researching methods to improve cloning efficiency for Gibson Assembly and have submitted to the Parts Registry two ""toolkits""': the Gibson Assembly Toolkit and the Magnetosome Toolkit.
Gibson Assembly Toolkit
To expand on work started by the 2010 UW IGEM team , this year we developed and submitted a set of plasmid backbones for BioBricks that are optimized for Gibson assembly. Based on the BglBrick standard RFC 21 , these pGA (plasmids for Gibson Assembly) vectors comprise the Gibson Assembly Toolkit . These vectors have much higher cloning efficiencies than the equivalent pSB vector and are fully compliant with BioBrick RFC 57 developed by the 2010 Cambridge iGEM team.
What's in the Gibson Assembly Toolkit?
Five plasmid backbones for high-efficiency, multiple-fragment assemblies.
2 high copy vectors for gene extraction and cloning: pGA1A3, pGA1C3
1 medium copy expression vector: pGA3K3
2 low copy expression vectors: pGA4A5, pGA4C5

Although we have spoken to several HAT experts, we were missing the inside information on viral diseases. Is the situation with health care and diagnostics the same as in HAT? What are the current issues in diagnosing viral infectious diseases?
Dr. Pascale Ondoa
Senior viro-immunologist, AIGHD Amsterdam
Because of the talk with dr. Ondoa we realized that cell culturing might be a bottleneck when performed in the field. Moreover, in her opinions screening large populations for viral diseases is important for monitoring.
Read more
Dr. Pascale Ondoa is a viro-immunologist with expertise in HIV at the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development (AIGHD). She also conducts research on laboratory systems, with a specific focus on alleviating barriers to the laboratory workforce in sub-Saharan Africa. In the opinion of dr. Ondoa, the cell culturing step will be one of the bottlenecks of our proposal, as expertise and bioreactors etc. are needed and the level of training in the field is low. The most important thing at the moment is that we find out which need we can fulfill: we need to look into the available technology, logistics, and education. We should consider the complete health system and find out how our diagnostic would fit in there.
She felt that HAT is not the best example for a new diagnostic device, as the disease has been combated quite successfully already. However, this changed after we explained that we would like to compare our diagnostic to current methods. Since HAT is a long known disease, it is suitable for comparison.
In case of viral diseases where no distinct symptoms are present, the need of the diagnostic changes completely. In this case, it would be of more use for screening the presence and development of a disease in the population and to place positively screened individuals in quarantine. Thus, the focus is on prevention of spread rather than specific treatment of infected individuals. If the device is used in such a way, the effect of vaccination on the spread of disease can also be seen.
Dr. Pascale Ondoa emphasized that we should look more into biosafety. Moreover, we should not forget that research and development costs are high. This needs to be considered when calculating the estimated cost of our diagnostic.

Approach 2
Overview
ComR approach details
Still with the aim of creating a rapid UV-response system, we elaborated a second approach based on a regulation pathway, the ComR and ComS system, originally found in Streptococcus thermophilius. Our goal is to produce a UV inducible promoter.
ComR and ComS mechanism
The ComR and ComS system controls natural competence and allows quorum sensing in S. thermophilius.  ComS is a small peptide encoded in the genome. After synthesis, it is matured and extruded from the cell into the medium. The peptide’s import allows other cells to sense the signal. When a basal level is reached it will trigger a competence in the whole population.  Indeed, once reimported in the cell the ComS will be able to bind ComR protein. This will allow the formation of a ternary complex (peptide-protein-DNA) with a specific DNA motif (ComR-box) and trigger the downstream gene’s expression (See schema here below).
Our little trick?
The ComS’s mature sequence is LPYFAGCL. An aromatic’s substitution by an alanine would block the binding to ComR. Hence our objective is to synthetize this peptide while replacing the tyrosine by a tyrosine-ortho-nitro benzyl (tyr-ONB). This should indeed prevent the binding unless there is some UV exposure and the ONB or photocage is released. This will result in the gene’s expression controlled by the ComR box’s  induced by exposure. Using a red fluorescence protein should signal the UV exposure.

Protein Import
Control over the peroxisomal proteome is an essential requirement for our project. Our objective is the obtainment of a fully orthogonal import system by utilizing the two peroxins Pex5 and Pex7.
Engineering of Pex5 and PTS1
Designing our receptors
To achieve the engineering of an orthogonal import pathway, we followed two approaches regarding Pex5. The first is based on targeted mutagenesis based on educated guesses which is first verified by molecular dynamics and later experimentally in the laboratory.    The second approach is based on a recently published paper: We searched for literature dealing with the modification of the peroxisomal import machinery. During our research we came across a paper of Alison Baker et al., published in 2017, in which they present a synthetic construct of the Pex5 protein, partly Arabidopsis thaliana and partly Physcomitrella patens. Compared to the wild type Pex5, this one shows different binding affinities since it interacts with a PTS1* variant that does not interact with the wild type Pex5. Since the protein sequences of yeast's and plants's Pex5 differ quite a lot, we aligned both sequences to understand where the mutations were set.
Figure 1.1: Alignment of the Arabidopsis thaliana's PEX5 and Saccharomyces cerevisiaePex5
Figure 1.2: Alignment of the yeast’s Pex5 with the Pex5 variant R19
The alignment shows three red marked amino acids we changed in our receptor sequence. Interestingly, these mutations are located within the TPR motifs of our Pex5 protein and this persuaded us to try out this receptor, we call it R19. Due to lack of time we tested this Pex5 variant in silico and in vivo simultaneously. We started molecular dynamics simulations with a couple of PTS variants that we already tested with our previous designs − one of them was actually the variant they used in the paper (YQSYY). The details and results of our structural modeling can be found in the modeling section .
Furthermore, we synthesized this variant and together with two receptors we designed based on educated guesses we got three receptors for our experimental work.

Current HIV diagnostic testing administered in Sub-Saharan Africa costs 79 USD, must have a doctor present, and requires 4 weeks of waiting. However, given the slow time of confirmation and poor access to medical facilities, the current diagnostic is unacceptable in addressing the needs of the HIV epidemic. In order to minimize these health impacts, our rapid diagnostic lateral flow assay should remove the pressure from physicians and outsource HIV diagnostics to the household. With a quick, cheap, and accurate test using our thermostable griffithsin, people should be able to perform this test easily only with a few drops of blood.
We hope to introduce our model to both American and Sub-Saharan households. Given the emergence of 2.9 million cases every year and approximately 19 million people who don't know they have HIV, there is a clear application and need for our lateral flow assay. When compared to other commonly used means of diagnosis such as RNA and ELISA tests, our proposed model should be able to detect HIV earlier and be very easy to interpret (Figure 1).
Each the factors in this chart are important and emphasize the novelty and importance of our diagnostic tool. Paramount to our Lateral Flow Assay is its ability to detect HIV earlier. Research has been done to show if HIV can be detected earlier (within 3 weeks of infection) there will be much better health outcomes for the patient. Almost all of the tests currently available diagnose HIV after the fourth week once there is an antibody response. Since our diagnostic tool does not test for seroconversion or an immune response, this test is perfectly suitable to test young children, who often still have antibodies from their parents who may or may not have HIV or Zika antibodies to improve the accuracy of diagnosis.

To achieve final concentrations, add 1mL of stock per 1L of media, except for chloramphenicol, where 0.6mL per 1L of media is added instead
Pour directly from the flask into sterile petri plates. Use a quick pass with a bunsen burner flame to snuff out bubbles that form during pouring. Do not subject the plate to continuous heat or the plate will melt, and the heat sensitive ingredients added in the previous step will be destroyed. Bubbles can allow cells to access nutrients without being exposed to the plate's antibiotic, and should be blown out immediately before the gel can set. It's a good idea for one person to pour while another flames bubbles.
Allow the plates to stand right side up overnight, or until the gel sets if they are needed sooner. Plates should be stored upside down to keep condensation from falling on the media. Store petri plates in the plastic bags they ship in, in the 4 degree cold room.

Samples need to be spotted on the 384 spot MALDI plate: Odd rows are used for samples, and even rows are for calibration standards. It is important that one sample spot in the odd row is coupled by a calibration spot in the even row.
Samples are cleaned up with C18 Zip tips before spotting onto the plate.
Start with a fresh Ziptip, using a 10 µL pipette, and slowly withdraw and dispense to waste 10 µL 90% (v/v) acetonitrile / 0.1 % TFA three times. Do not throw away the tip.
Slowly withdraw and dispense to waste 10 µL 0.1 % TFA five times to equilibrate the C18 material in aqueous buffer.
Slowly withdraw and dispense your first sample (10 µL) ten times. After this step the peptides from your digest are bound onto the C18 resin in the tip.
Withdraw and discard to waste 10 µL of 0.1 % TFA five times. This washes away unwanted salts and contaminants. Make sure you expel all the liquid on the last wash.
Withdraw 1 µL of matrix solution. This contains 70% acetonitrile so it is used to elute peptides in the presence of matrix. (4 mg / mL CHCA [α-cyano-4-hydroxycynnamic acid], 70 % MeCN, 0.1 % TFA).
Spot the eluted peptide sample in matrix solution directly onto the MALDI target plate in an odd row, trying not to touch the surface of the plate with the tip. Record the location of your samples. New C18 tip is needed for each sample.
BSA digest at 1pmol/µL is used as control. This does not required ziptipping.
Next, prepare calibration standards (Pepmix and Matrix solutions at 1:1 ratio), and spot 1µL of this onto spots in even row next to your samples. These are your near-point calibration standards.

Current agenda:
trying to set up a nice database-integration for PuppetShow
database will house Protocols and Samples
succeeded in inserting and querying from localhost database
aiming to figure out how to properly incorporate deletion and updating
had lengthy discussions with Swapnil and Chenkai regarding Protocol Graphs
discussed class infrastructure complexities
pondered methods of saving/recording sample history
configuring tables for ideal data structure setup
Update: During our discussion, we were analyzing the table-structure that Swapnil and Viktor were discussing a while back.  Swapnil mentioned that he doesn't like the visual redundancy in the proposed ProtocolNodeTable, which inspired me to try to create a ""symmetric"" ProtocolNodeTable and SampleNodeTable.  Both table-structures should work, but Swapnil tasked us with determining the total number of queries required for the specific tree I proposed as well as a generic tree with n-nodes.
Having analyzed both table-structures, I counted up to 8 queries for both structures.  However, if you needed to be explicit and grab SampleNodeTable data between queries (such as the SampleNodeTable.SampleName for defining the Sample Node when reconstructing the graph), the total number of queries would increase significantly.
Therefore, for the very general case, the proposed query counts are:
In-and-Out table-structure: Sample with N-parent-nodes needs N queries (vague) or up to N+S queries, where S represents the number of parent-Sample-Nodes (explicit to the same level as ""Symmetric"").
""Symmetric"" table-structure: Sample with N-parent-nodes needs N-queries (explicit, since every query pulls up relevant information about both Samples and Protocols :) ).

PROTOCOL
Cell Fractionation
At first Cells cultured at 37℃ until cell density(OD600=0.6-0.8), after cultured at 25℃ for 24 h. Harvested cells were washed, and resuspended in PBS buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and lysozyme at 10 Ag/mL. After 2 hincubation, cell suspension was treated with an ultrasound sonication at 30 sec  2 cycles. To obtain total membrane fraction, whole cell lysate was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 1 h using an ultracentrifuge (Optima LE-80K; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The supernatant was regarded as soluble cytoplasmic fraction. For further outer membrane fractionation, the pellet (total membrane fraction) was resuspended with PBS buffer containing 0.01 mM MgCl2 and 2% Triton X-100 for solubilizing inner membrane and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then the outer membrane fraction was repelleted by ultracentrifugation.
Western Blot Analysis
An equal volume of each fraction (cytoplasmic and outer membrane) of the cells containing inp-mSA were mixed with SDS sample buffer (TaKaRa, 4X Protein SDS PAGE Loading Buffer), boiled for 15 min, and resolved by 12.5% (wt/vol) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by electrophoretic transfer to Hybond-PVDF membranes with transfer buffer (48 mM Tris-HCl, 39 mM glycine, 20% methanol, pH 9.2) by using a Trans-Blot SD Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 100V for 1h30 min. After blocking for 1 h in TBS buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was then incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature in antibody solution (1% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk"
US_AFRL_CarrollHS,2017,Team:US AFRL CarrollHS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Afterwards, it was finally time to begin the InterLab study for the iGem project. The students began re suspending the wells. However, they soon found out that there were no more plates of LB- Chloramphenicol and thus had to make more. They had to postpone the InterLab studies and finished the day by creating a lot more plates for future experiments.
Packaging: To start the week, the RX team made LB Broth with Ampicillin and later transferred colonies of E. coli cells with the pBAD-CsgA plasmids to allow them to grow. To accomplish this, the RXers patched colonies of the cells onto LB agar plates with Ampicillin and then transferred the remainder of the colonies into culture tubes containing LB Broth with Ampicillin.
Tuesday (07/11/17)
Sense/Respond: The student researchers began the InterLab the next morning. They split up in 2 groups while one group worked with the competent cells kit and completed Day 1. The other group transformed the wells inside the plates provided by iGem. The students did a great job following protocol and growing the bacteria on the agar plates from the previous day. After they were done, the students began filling out the necessary forms for the InterLab as well as planned out the dropdown menu and the slideshow for the website.
Packaging: The RXers spent the morning miniprepping twenty-one samples of DH5 alpha competent cells with pBAD-CsgA. Around five milliliters of each sample from the culture tubes of the previous day were pelleted for miniprepping and one milliliter was reserved for storage.
Wednesday (07/12/17)
Sense/Respond: The next morning, the young students attended a lecture taught by biologists from the Purdue University. It was very interesting and higher level, and the students were very excited to hear topics relevant to their iGem goals. Afterwards, they returned to the lab with their mentor to examine the overnight bacteria colonies. However, they were disappointed to learn that the competent cell test did not work out. Instead of an expected 300+ colonies, the plates only yielded about 25 colonies. The students spent the rest of the day redoing the protocol in hopes of achieving the needed amount of colonies in order to proceed.
Packaging: The Nanodrop was used to check the concentration of several samples of the miniprep results. Then, a restriction digest was performed on the miniprepped pBAD-CsgA plasmids with NcoI and KpnI. Digested and undigested pBAD-Csg"

Abstract
The Fantastic Lysisbox: Genetically engineered cell death is essential for the application of biotechnology, such as in bioremediation area. In order to control the cell-death, we designed “Lysisbox”, which consists of a pair of modules: “Killer gene” and “Anti-killer gene.” As the Killer gene for Escherichia coli, we noted the lysis cassette [SRRz/Rz1 gene] of lambda phage coding for holin and endolysin. The holin form pores in the inner membrane and the endolysin access and degrade the peptidoglycan passing through the pores, leading the E.coli to death. As the Anti-killer gene, we chose SΔTMD1 coding for a dominant-negative holin that inhibits the formation of the fatal pores. The balance of these two genes' expression level has the key to the E.coli’s life or death. In addition, such controllable membrane pores should show critical functions for all living organisms with lipid membranes and a cell wall. “Lysisbox” will contribute a lot to all the future iGEM projects, thus you must say “FANTASTIC!!!""

Mood Detection
The physiological conditions underlying mental illnesses vary between patients resulting in a need for individualized treatments. We have evaluated potential biomarkers linked to mood disorders and developed a set of bacterial sensors that could detect mood-related symptoms in the gut.

Background Inflammation Anxiety Osmotic Stress Conclusions References
Background
In order to target mental health issues such as depression and anxiety in a responsive manner it is necessary to design sensors that respond only when triggered by specific biomarkers. This means that mood sensing probiotics designed by our team will only release neuroactive compounds when a patient actually goes through clinical depression or a panic attack instead of being constitutively active. This is achieved by transforming bacteria with plasmids with signal sensing promoters upstream of the effector genes.
Infamous Insidious Inflammation
Clinical depression is likely caused by a chronic low grade-response to inflammation [Link] M. Berk et al. So depression is an inflammatory disease, but where does the inflammation come from? in European Journal for Medical Research, 2013 [1].   Although the pathway from inflammation to depression is complex and not fully understood it has been shown that the immune response is often accompanied by symptoms such as oxidative and nitrosative stress in the gut. [Link] Leonard B. and Maes M. Mechanistic explanations how cell-mediated immune activation, inflammation and oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways and their sequels and concomitants play a role in the pathophysiology of unipolar depression in Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews Volume 36, Issue 2, February 2012, Pages 764–785 [2].
Therefore, one of the promoters we have used is the PyeaR promoter, which is sensitive to nitric oxide in the cell and was inserted upstream of different effectors . This promoter uses the E. coli native enzyme Nsr"

Beyond The Bench
Where could our construct be safely and legally used? What social and economic impacts would this have on the surrounding communities?
To understand this question more thoroughly we broke the question down into various locations, considering needs of each individually.
Europe
In Europe the release of any synthetic organism that changes its surroundings in any way is completely forbidden under EU law. In addition to this, many countries in the EU already have the means and funds to either use a more expensive clean up method such as composting (you can find out more about current clean-up methods here ), or else rebuild communities away from contaminated sites now that health risks have become apparent.
USA
In the United States of America it is legal to release synthetically modified organisms. This gives our project huge scope to be used in the remediation of many of the pollution sites detailed in 'The Problem' .
Bioremediation using this method is much more viable -both economically and in practicality– than current methods that require transport of soil or large amounts of energy to complete.
This could make utilizing E.R.A.S.E a very attractive prospect to the parties responsible for the pollution; hopefully encouraging them to partake in clean up efforts rather than ignore the environmental implications of their work. This may previously have been an unattractive option due to the high cost and workload a soil remediation would incur.

Due in part to the more recent industrial revolutions that have occurred across Asia, a great deal of explosive residue has been created during both military and civilian activity. However for many countries in this continent space is limited and expensive/time consuming techniques such as incineration of soil are not a priority, due to more vital issues requiring the governing bodies efforts.
It is here that we believe our project could be of great use, as in many parts of Asia it is legal to release synthetically modified"

Sensynova Framework parts
Part range BBa_K2205007 – BBa_K2205030 The Newcastle iGEM team has developed the Sensynova framework to ease biosensor development through the use of mixed cell populations interacting via intercellular communication molecules. Each cell type has a distinct function according a design-pattern determined through systematic review of 121 previous iGEM biosensor projects. The system is detailed in the figure below – The dotted orange lines correspond to the junction between parts. A target molecule is detected by a protein constitutively expressed in our Detector cell. A promoter sensitive to this protein drives the expression of the lasI gene. The LasI protein catalyses the production of 3O-C12 N-acyl homoserine lactone (C12 AHL). C12 AHL diffuses out of the cell and interacts with LasR, which is constitutively expressed in the Processing cell. LasR activates the pLas promoter. In the system, the pLas promoter drives expression of the rhlI gene, producing the RhlI protein which catalysis the formation of our second connector 3O-C4 N-acyl homoserine lactone (C4 AHL). The C4 diffuses out of the cell and interacts with RhlR in the output cell. This complex activates the pRhl promoter which regulates the transcription of an output device, such as a fluorescence protein. Therefore, upon triggering a detection device in the detection cell, intercellular connectors are able to propagate this signal to cells containing processing and output devices. As the"

His own opposition to this is based on the economics: the control of the food chain by a small, powerful clique of multinational companies; this is also a concern for existing conventional agriculture. He is also concerned about the impact on small farmers, both in this country and developing countries.
He said the way patent law was applied to genetics, and the structure of ownership of intellectual property, ought to be changed. Then there would be room in the political landscape for a wider debate about risks and benefits. But for the time being, he expects continuing opposition to commercial use of GM in agriculture.
Allan asked if people are more comfortable with GM organisms that produce pharmaceuticals.
Patrick said there is less anxiety about GM techniques in the ""lab"", for research or production of drugs, that don't impact the real world in terms of biodiversity.
Allan mentioned the distinction between ""contained use"" versus GM ""in the field"". Patrick said either case always requires a degree of careful thought. We can't simply say everything science does is wonderful, or terrible.
Yassen asked what regulation Patrick wanted to see.
Patrick said nobody should be in a position where they eat GM food without knowing about it. It should be clearly labelled.
He said gene patents are a hard area for a small country like Scotland to deal with. We need a wider approach at the European and global level. The Scottish Green Party doesn't currently have any Members of the European Parliament, so can't really contribute to the European debate.
Yassen asked what approaches could solve the world's environmental problems.
Patrick said that some scientific and technology techniques will be absolutely crucial for humanity's ability to get through the next few decades of dangerous resource constraints (especially fossil fuels) as well as the impact we are having around us (climate change, loss of biodiversity and habitats).
However, he said technology can only help us achieve long-term sustainability if we change the way we live. Fundamentally, we must change our economics. Our current economic system has caused these problems. Desperately ""fire-fighting"" the effects with science and technology is not a viable survival strategy; we need to stop doing the harm. Science and technology will help us fix the harm we've already done, but if we only try the ""techno-fix"", without changing our behaviour (which he said is causing an ecological crisis like none ever seen before), then we won't succeed. Science and technology are not enough to see us through.
Yassen asked what advice Patrick would give to future synthetic biologists.
Patrick said he wouldn't presume to give advice, but he would hope people working"

Chitin
Apoptosis
Overview
Our main project is to simulate mammalian skin using chitin in E. Coli.
In mammalian skin, mitosis occurs in the basal layer of the epithelial cells and cells travel outwards towards the surface of the skin as they mature. As the cells move further away from the basal layer, they die and their cytoplasm is released and the cells are filled with keratin, thus forming a continuously regenerating protective layer on the outer-most part of epithelial layer; our project is modeled after this.
First, a specific strain of Escherichia Coli is used to generate a thick bacterial biofilm lawn, which is formed on an enriched LB agar plate. The strain also does not produce chitinase so that the produced chitin is not digested.
Then a fast, high-expression signalling pathway initiates production of chitin in the top-most layer of the lawn. The gene for chitin synthesis is extracted from the genome of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, more commonly known as Baker's Yeast, while the signalling pathway and expression parts are identified from the parts registry and extracted from the iGEM 2010 Distribution kit.
Simultaneously, a slow, medium-expression signalling pathway initiates production of a cell lysis expression vector in the top-most layer of the lawn. The apoptosis part used is the T4 Bacteriophage apoptosis cassette, and this part as well as the signalling and expression parts, are identified from the parts registry and extracted from the iGEM 2010 Distribution kit.
With both vectors, the E.Coli cells in the top layer generates chitin then lyses, thus depositing a layer of chitin in the top-most layer of the bacterial lawn.
To identify the expression of chitin, a chitin-specific rhodamine stain is used. To identify the efficacy of the apoptosis cassette, a live-dead assay is used. With these stains, the colony can be imaged vertically through confocal microscopy to show the deposition of Chitin in the top layer.
Whenever there is damage to the chitin layer, the signalling pathway can be reinitiated to regenerate chitin in the damaged location.

Northwestern,2012,Team:Northwestern#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,      did you document these issues in the Registry?     How did you manage to handle the safety issue?     How could other teams learn from your experience?
No, none of the BioBrick parts that we made this year raise safety concerns. If additional safety issues arise over the course of our continuing work they will be noted and  documented.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?      If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?     If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
The Northwestern University Office for Research Safety (ORS) and the Northwestern University Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) work together to ensure safe and ethical research practices in the Northwestern community. Although we did not discuss our project with the ORS and the IBC, we worked under the supervision of advisors whose labs have received IBC approval. If we had gone to the ORS and IBC for review, we would have addressed any safety issues in terms of researcher, public or environmental safety as discussed in greater detail in the previous questions.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Dealing with safety issues is a critical part of iGEM and bioengineering in general because the field is new and standards of safety are not well established. One idea that would improve the established safety standards of iGEM would be to increase the safety documentation of parts in the parts registry. Currently, iGEM teams are not required to submit any sort of safety datasheet along with the genetic and performance reliability data on parts. By requiring teams to submit a standardized safety datasheet on each submitte d part, the parts registry will not only become a more valuable resource for future iGEM teams, but will also serve as an example in the bioengineering community on how to consistently establish safety standards in a large scale fashion.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Biocontainment_-_-_TEXT.html,"E is a more labile protein than MazF, degrading faster. For this reason, TA systems like MazEF are also known as addiction modules; the organism expressing the system becomes ""addicted"" to the antitoxin, and cell stasis or death ensues should expression be halted. In its native organisms, MazEF has a regulatory function. Under ordinary conditions, the proteins are co-expressed and the organism stays stable. However, under stressful conditions, such as nutrient starvation, this expression ceases. MazF is then free to cleave essential mRNAs, causing what is inferred to be a state of bacteriostasis 4 . This process is reversible up until approximately six hours after taking effect, the point of no return. Much like programmed cell death (PCD) in multicellular organisms, this prevents excess growth the bacterial population cannot afford, improving viability.
The optogenetic kill switch is designed to exploit this mechanism. The theoretical construct functions as follows: rather than having both proteins expressed until the population encounters stress, the kill switch places MazF under control of pDawn. This means that in the darkness of the beehive, where blue light irradiance is close to zero, no toxin is produced, allowing the cell to remain stable. Any leaky expression from the promoter can be countered by constitutively expressed MazE. However, when the cell is exposed to (sun)light over a longer period of time, large amounts of un-countered MazF are produced, resulting in cell death. Like microbial vampires, any BeeT bacteria that make it outside will perish in the light of the sun. With a response time on the order of several hours for both the toxin-antitoxin system and light sensor, the kill switch's design is well-suited to its function. Incidental exposure to light, such as opening the hive for beekeeping activities - as described by our beekeeper contacts - will not suffice to fully trigger the switch. Aside from biocontainment, the optogenetic system is also used in further regulatory mechanisms for BeeT. This is detailed on the Regulation page.
Figure 1: Basic designs of the optogenetic kill switch. Arrows indicate activation of a part, bars indicate inhibition. Top: Constitutively expressed toxin MazF is countered by MazE expressed under pDusk, which is active in the dark. In light, antitoxin production drops, causing cell death.  Bottom: MazF is kept repressed by pDawn, which is inactive in the dark. Leaky expression is countered by weakly expressed"

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," regulatory sequences, we would have different amounts of catalytic biomolecule depending on the regulatory sequence in each droplet. Moreover, the amount of product nucleotide produced would also be connected to the protein amount in the droplet. Finally, if we would have a stronger regulatory sequence that allows greater catalytic biomolecule expression, we would see that by an increased amount of Product Nucleotide.
Therefore, the regulatory sequence strength can be indirectly, but precisely assessed using CAT-seq.
Regulatory part cross-interaction measurement
Finally, CAT-Seq can be used to assess the cross-interactions of different regulatory sequence combinations.
Let’s take Toehold Switches as an example. They consist of two parts - the Toehold Switch and activating RNA. The Toehold Switch forms an RNA loop on the RBS of the controlled coding sequence and in turn inhibits the translation. The expressed activating RNA can bind to the Toehold Switch RNA sequence and open RBS to the translation machinery. Testing a big number of combinations toehold switch pair combination while searching for orthogonal switches is an extremely time and resource consuming task. That is because each combination must be assessed separately.
Using CAT-Seq, the cross-interactions of large libraries of Toehold Switches and RNA activators can be recorded in a single experiment. In this example, two libraries would have to be prepared - the toehold switch and RNA activator. Then, both of these libraries are ligated next to the same catalytic biomolecule. What we then have is a new library that consists of fragments which have random toehold switch and RNA activator combinations and the same esterase.
Depending on how activating RNA affects toehold switch in each droplet, the Product Nucleotide amount will vary. After the amplification and sequencing in each fragment, we would see three main things - the specific toehold switch sequence, the specific activating RNA sequence and their performance or activity score in the form of Product Nucleotides.
Validating the measurement accuracy
While ultra high-throughput is extremely important, the precision and accuracy of the system is just as critical. In order to assess if our system is measuring activities properly in high-throughput, we have first made low-throughput measurements using standard and well-established methods. Then, we have compared them with the results acquired using CAT-Seq.

In silico designed mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio) was extracted and sequenced with"

As a team we realize the importance of education when it comes to shaping and sharing the future of synthetic biology. Therefore, we incorporated education and public outreach throughout our project to mutually learn and open up the discussion about developments that have the potential to inherently change our society. Our project, ADOPE , encompasses more than the design of a detection method for gene doping and stimulates people to actively be aware of the opportunities as well as the threats of synthetic biology as applied to gene technology and beyond. In the table below we give a brief overview of what we have done, how we did it and the achievements.

AstraZeneca’s treatment plant was especially interesting for Biotic Blue since the pH of the fungal treatment is optimal for the enzyme as well as a controlled temperature.
""This could reduce the amount of sulfamethoxazole in both WWTP effluents, the wastewater and the sludge."" - Pharem Biotech
Meeting with the CEO Martin Ryen and Domenico Palumberi from Pharem, we had the opportunity to pitch our idea - Biotic Blue. Pharem produces enzymes for treating Swedish wastewater, and they both gave us useful advice and insights in the lab procedure. Martin, the founder and CEO of Pharem thought that it would be feasible to incorporate Biotic Blue before the biological treatment of wastewater since it would reduce the risk of triggering antibiotic resistance. After our meeting, we got back to revise our product implementation and discuss in which location our vision makes the biggest impact.
Regulating the field
×
Britta Hedlund from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, Swedish: Naturvårdsverket) helped us to understand how the knowledge behind law and regulation is compiled, where the EPA provides the parliament with knowledge within the field. Britta got us to understand that there is no standardized way of measuring pharmaceuticals in the ocean or the wastewater. We, therefore, contacted lawyers specialized on environmental problems and the Water and Ocean department in Gothenburg. One of our most vital works in the good fight for the removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater was through the International Standardization Organization (ISO), standardizing the limits of pharmaceuticals in water. You can read more about our Standard Student Society within ISO at our Public engagement page.
Water is a necessity for our existence, and without it society would not sustain. After our meeting with Britta, our interest in law, morals and regulations was sparked. We therefore contacted Per Sandin, Associate Professor in Philosophy and lecturer in Bioethics and Environmental Ethics at SLU (Uppsala). He got us to grasp the importance of understanding how a product could be used for detrimental purposes (dual-use). He emphasized how important water is for all individuals, and how vulnerable we would be if our water sources would become contaminated. Learn more about our insights in our booklet “How safe is your project?”.

E. Chrono
Vanderbilt University Microfluidics
E. chrono attempts to merge synthetic biology and microfluidics into a novel hybrid system. The goal of E. chrono is to leverage quorum sensing in ''Escherichia coli'' to produce a microfluidic based fluorescent watch.  The E. chrono project focused on 3 major goals
1)Learn the microfluidic device design process and select a software platform capable of rapid design
2)Develop a cheap and efficient means for rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices
3)Fabricate and test microfluidic designs
Additionally, E. chrono sought to produce a cheap and efficient methodology for the rapid fabrication and prototyping of microfluidic devices. It is our hope that the designs and methods implemented in our project can be utilized in future competitions by other iGEM teams.
Below is an artist rendering of our intended E. coli watch.

Risk-assessment
Host:
Bacteria:
E. coli is naturally occurring and the strains used for amplifying vector-DNA/proteins is not reported pathogenic
Al material used in bacterial work is autoclaved and/or inactivated with iodofor
Strains:
A cell-culture from a higher eukaryot which does not contain any endogene vectors that would be able to mobilize parts of the transferred genetic material.
The strains used have not been reported pathogenic
The cellular strain is very fragile and is unable to procreate or survive outside of laboratory conditions, as they need the correct temperature, humidity, pH, CO2, O2 and nourishment
Al material used in bacterial work is autoclaved and/or inactivated with iodofor
Donor:
Naturally occurring healthy genes of insect origin and it is not believed to be able to transform/infect human cells in vitro/vivo. The risk is therefore considered to be minimal. The S.E. gene has homology in E. coli and is therefore not considered to pose any threat.
Vector:
Vectors are of pUC or pOT2 origin and nothing from the vector has human recombinations/infection potential and the risk of working with these strains are therefore believed to be minimal.
Our vector is in addition equipped with resistance to antibiotics and cannot exist without it. Should discard the resistance if not within a antibiotic environment.
Insert:
Is naturally occurring genes with well-defined tags and it is believed that they cannot transform/infect human cells in vitro/vivo. The fusion-protein has had limited testing, but is also considered safe. The risk is therefore believed"

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Model#EKD_-_-_TEXT.html," nodes surrounding the first enzyme, the flux value, J, is set to be the rate of production of the first enzyme based on Michaelis-Menten Kinetics. Whilst at the second enzyme, the flux value is set to be the rate of consumption of the second enzyme based on Michaelis-Menten Kinetics. The files for generating the geometry and solving the system are available here , with a MatlabREADME.txt file supplied to describe how the model can be manipulated. An example mesh for the two enzymes is shown (Figure 7).
Figure 7: A solved mesh of our geometry. The half circle on the left represents the source, while the half circle on the right represents the sink. The tetrahedral elements that form the mesh make up the nodes; each side of the tetrahedral elements joins at a node. The values of x and y correspond to the units used to build the geometry of the system. In this case, the enzymes are set 2 units from the center at x values of -2 and 2, whilst the radius of the half sphere is set to 4 units. The z value corresponds to the concentration of substrate, creating the 3D image.
From this mesh, the concentration of substrate at various nodes can be extracted. This allows for the generation of graphs of concentration versus time, and concentration versus distance, amongst others. Thus we employed the finite element method to solve our system, utilising MATLAB to numerically solve the system.
Reflections
Overall, the model served to effectively support our initial hypothesis that reduced distance between enzymes would increase product yield. We believe the boundary conditions and assumptions do not limit the possibility of validating the model against experimental data. However, we did not reach the stage in building our prefoldin scaffold where such validation was possible. Thus the model served mainly to verify our design process, and could not be modified based on experimental results. Furthermore we believe there is better-suited software specialised for designing molecular meshes and solving numerical problems, such as the FeNics toolkit. Ultimately we would like to expand the model to account for varied enzyme stoichiometry in the geometry of the model. Currently stoichiometry can be included by changing the rate of production or consumption at the sink or source. For example if one wanted to include a second consuming enzyme, it could be implemented by doubling the rate of consumption at a single sink, however this is an approximate method. Additionally in future we would like to incorporate the effects of electrostatic interactions that can occur between enzymes and substrates. Such interactions can create 'channeling' effect and have been postulated as the cause"

Constitutive promoters from B. subtilis as novel BioBricks
The second group of promoters are a set of constitutive promoters from B. subtilis that we have added to the Registry. We evaluated the promoters PliaG , Pveg and PlepA using the lux operon as well as the lacZ gene as reporters.
PliaG ( BioBrick:BBa_K823000 )
PliaG is a constitutive promoter from B. subtilis. It is responsible for the transcription of the last four genes of the liaIHGFSR locus and hence for the production of the components of the LiaRS system, which is important for the detection of cell wall antibiotics (Jordan et al., 2006) . PliaG was evaluated with the lux operon (see Data constitutive promoters
) as well as the lacZ (see Data constitutive promoters
) as reporter. This promoter showed a much higher activity than the Anderson promoters, but was still relatively weak in comparison to other evaluated Bacillus promoters.
Pveg ( BioBrick:BBa_K823003 )
Pveg is known to show a strong constitutive activity during the vegetative growth phase and sporulation. This promoter is important for the transcription of the veg gene, which plays a role during sporulation (Fukushima et al., 2003) . Pveg was only measured by using the reporter gene lacZ (see Data constitutive promoters
). This promoter was the strongest of our evaluation. It failed to clone into the lux reporter vector, presumably because of its strength.
PlepA ( BioBrick:BBa_K823002 )
PlepA is a constitutive promoter that is important for the transcription of the bicistronic operon. One of the expressed proteins is the protein PlepA (Homuth et al., 1996) . PlepA plays an important role during translation as it can move the mRNA-tRNA complex one step back in the ribosome which is expected to improve the fidelity of translation (Qin et al., 2006) . This protein was evaluated with the lux operon as a reporter (see Data constitutive promoters
). The activity of this promoter is between the activity of the strongest Bacillus promoter Pveg and the weak PliaG.
