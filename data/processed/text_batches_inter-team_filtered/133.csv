After a period of time technicians will come again to check if one more dose or a new plan is needed. Finally, the termites disappear from the region. Devices will be taken back to the company for sterilization and reuse.
Ancient building protection department
Many ancient buildings are made up of woods. To some extent, woods are fragile. They can be destroy by fire, strong wind and importantly, termites. These ancient buildings are significant coltural property and if we lose them, we may lose them forever. Fortunately, thanks to today's technology, some wood structures are able to be repaired and consolidated. But if the damage is due to termites, repairing will be only a temporary protection.
The ZJUTT (ZJU TERMITE TERMINATOR) sees this problem and therefore cooperates with the ancient building protection department. When repairing is needed, ZJUTT technicians will show up first, rather than the maintenance worker. If the termites are convicted by the technicians, termites control shoold be applied first to eliminate the future danger. Devices are placed in optimum places and taken back by our technicians.
In order to keep these buildings in safety, ZJUTT will provide the monitoring service. Every few years, special devices will be placed near the building. These devices are used to attract termites to check if there is any new hidden termites nest. With the monitor, precaution can be taken and use ZJUTT devices kill termites before they cause any damage.
School
Under the dazzling sunshine of summer, students are sweating, reading their textbooks. There is a little annoyance upon their faces, because the final exam is coming. However, that is not the only problem. What's more annoying is that, the termites are also coming! Every summer, the termites are flying all around. They are hovering around your head. They stop at everywhere, your arms, your clothes, your desk and your textbooks. Termites are really bothering students' school life.
The school principal decides to help his students. He advise the school stuff to buy a few small size termites killing devices from ZJUTT. Following the instruction, they open the outer shell, put the box of food inside, spread some water on the surface of the food, and place the device in a corner where is dark, damp and termites can be seen. Outside the shell there is a warning sign to prevent students' contact. When 3 months pass and there are nearly no termites, take out the food box form the device and burn the rest"

Undesired and unexpected interactions among parts or among systems should be diminished to the maximum. For example, a double transcriptional terminator ensures that the transcription regulation affects only our system, avoiding the transcription of downstream genes. In this way the promoter affects only our system, ensuring that no new regulation interactions arise with the downstream genes. It is important to think that the properties of one part modiffy other parts interactions or interaction strength. For example the number of transcriptional terminators affects the promoter possible interactions.
Safety issues in our project.
Probability:
Could there be an unplanned event or series of events involving your project, resulting in death, injury, occupational illness, damage to equipment or property, or damage to the environment?.
Yes. Hydrogen production in great amounts poses a risk to the investigators and the equipment. Accidental plasmid release poses a risk to public health.
How likely is that going to happen?.
Hydrogen production will be limited to bacteria in petri dishes or flasks with one liter capacity or less. This makes the production of great amounts of hydrogen very improbable.
As of accidental plasmid release, our work is bound to the appropriate safety measures, which makes the release very improbable.
Does your project require the exposure or release of the engineered organism to people or the environment (e.g. as medicine, for bioremediation)?.
Not in this stage. It may will in further applications.
Hazard:
Could your device, when working properly, represent a hazard to people or the environment?.
No. However it will require the proper hydrogen handling devices in further applications.
Is your engineered organism infectious?.
It is known to infect neither humans nor other animals. It does infect the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris roots, forming specialized structures known as nodules, in order to enter the symbiotic stage.
Does it produce a toxic product?.
No. However hydrogen handling requires specialized techniques which, as of July 15, we are investigating.
Does it interfere with human physiology or the environment?.
Our bacteria don’t interfere with human physiology.
Rhizobial organisms participate in the nitrogen cycle performing nitrogen fixation. Experiments evaluating the release to the environment of genetically modified Rhizobia inoculants have been carried out. Most studies revealed that the number of Rhizobial organisms dropped rapidly after application to soil or seeds but then numbers stabilized for months or years (3).
What would happen if one or several bioparts change their function or stop working as intended (e.g. through mutation)?.
The hydrogen production pathway is composed of"

This is one of the reasons why biotechnology in Indonesia is far behind the other Asian countries. In fact, the total funding per gross domestic product for Indonesia is around 0.07%. This value is smaller than those of Ethiopia (0.17%) and Colombia (0.16%). Even with the lack of government funding, some institutes and universities have the urge to develop biotechnology. There are around 30 institutes and some universities in Indonesia that join the development of  biotechnology industry so far.
Perception of Synthetic Biology
Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) iGEM 2013 team conducted interviews with 5 random citizens in Indonesia. The interviewees came from different background. The interviews reveal that all of the interviewees did not know what synthetic biology meant. (R.N, 2013). The term synthetic biology did appear in newspapers and blogs, but no formal studies have been conducted to measure the perception of synthetic biology in Indonesia. Considering that not many people fully understand the term biotechnology, it seems like the concept synthetic biology, a relatively new field, is even less prevalent.
Research, People & Organizations
Research
Scientists in Indonesia are actively conducting researches related to biology and biotechnology. For example, Indonesian Institute of Sciences Biotechnology Research Center (LIPI) has been conducting numerous researches related to biotechnology. It is probably these kinds of research institutes that will adopt synthetic biology techniques once it becomes more prevalent in Indonesia.
The following table summarizes some of the researches of LIPI

Introduction
As a naturally formed immobilizing structure of bacteria, biofilm outstands in many ways such as the ability to withstand considerable degree of environmental fluctuation, the possibility for more efficient cell-cell communication as well as cooperation, and the stratified structure which may function greatly in phase-related synthetic processing. With this understanding and beyond, 2011 ZJU-China iGEM team tried to explore more about the potential of biofilm in applications.
Cellulose utilization for renewable bio-material production (especially bio-fuel production) has been a heated research interest for quite a long time. Due to the structural complexity and poor permeability of cellulose, a big obstacle for enzymatic break-down process, progress in promoting the utilization efficiency is slow.
Considering this problem with the advantage of biofilm as a reactor system, we believe the employment of biofilm and its stratified feature would help to surmount such obstacle.
Firstly, Sugarfilm, a three-layer biofilm-based expression system, is designed to directly attach to the surface of substrate (for instance, a sheet of cellulose debris). In this way, the distance between our “degradation engine” (E.coli cells) and the targeted substrate would be reduced greatly, laying the foundation of a more efficient system.
Two main cellulases involved in the first step of degradation, Cex (Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase, BBa_K118022 , iGEM08_Edinburgh) together with CenA (Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanase A, BBa_K118023 , iGEM08_Edinburgh) will be expressed in the bottom layer of biofilm (as described in the “Design” part below in detail). Therefore, the secreted enzymes would get in touch with the substrate instantly.
In the next step, the preliminary products cell"

12. Fluorescence assay with microplate reader and Flow Cytometry
1) Take glycerin cryopreserved bacterium, marking out on a LB plate, put the plate at 37 ℃ for 12 hours.
2) Pick a single colony from the plate into 5 ml LB liquid medium, 37 ℃ 200 RPM shocking culture for 12 hours.
3) Take some bacterium liquid from step 2 (1:200 dilution) into 40 ml LB liquid medium, 37 ℃ 200 RPM shaking culture for 3 hours.
4) Take some bacterium liquid from step 3 (1:1000 dilution) into 40 ml LB liquid medium (appropriate revulsant is added synchronously if it is necessary), 37 ℃ 200 RPM shaking culture.
5) During the E.coli reproduction, 200μl sample is taken into the 96-well plate for fluorescence assay every 1 hour.
6) Before measuring fluorescence intensity, the microplate reader (BERTHOLD Technologies) needs go through a self-testing routine.
7) MicroWin 2000 software is used for measuring. Some parameters are as followings: 1 second counting time, 2000 lamp energy, excitation wavelength 450nm, and emission wavelength 530nm. Load plate and analyze fluorescence intensity."

UCL,2015,Team:UCL#blah_-_-_TEXT.html,"The pretty wife of one of the czar's valets had the following unpleasant         experience of his skill. The husband of the ""maid"" accused her of         flirting, and vowed revenge. The czar noticed the valet seated in the         ante-room, looking forlorn, and asked the cause of his dejection. The         wicked valet replied that his wife had a tooth which gave her great pain,         keeping them both awake day and night, but would not have it drawn.
""Send her to me,"" said the czar.
The woman was brought, but persisted in affirming that her teeth were         sound, and never ached. The valet alleged that this was always the way she         did when the physician was called; therefore, in spite of her cries and         remonstrances, the king ordered her husband to hold her head between his         knees, when the czar drew out his instruments and instantly extracted the         tooth designated by the husband, disregarding the cries of the unfortunate         victim.
In a few days the czar was informed that the thing was a put-up job by the         jealous husband, in order to punish, if not mar the beauty of, his gallant         wife, whereupon the instruments were again brought into requisition; and         this time the naughty valet was the sufferer, to the extent of losing a         sound and valuable tooth.

Using the blue light inducible promoter PBlind [3], we aim to use blue light (6hr, 475nm) to induce the transcription of a truncated version of Intimin (denoted intimin'), a cell surface protein [4], fused to either SpyTag (13 amino acids) or SpyCatcher (138 amino acids, 15kDa).
SpyTag and SpyCatcher are two binding partners that come from CnaB2 (immunoglobulin-like collagen adhesin domain) of the FbaB protein, found in the invasive strains of S. pyogenes [1]. SpyTag contains a reactive aspartate that forms a strong isopeptide bond with a reactive lysine residue in SpyCatcher when in close proximity [1]. Thus when two cell lines displaying either SpyTag or SpyCatcher on their cell surface are mixed together, we will achieve cell-cell adhesion (see Figure 2)
Figure 2. Cell surface display of SpyTag and SpyCatcher. Intimin, a cell surface protein is truncated at its N terminal onto which SpyTag or SpyCatcher is fused.
Design note: after analysing multiple cell surface display proteins, we opted for Intimin (EaeA intimin) as it has shown to display passenger proteins of similar size to SpyCatcher and it had not been characterised by iGEM teams before. Other cell candidates considered include: ice nucleation protein, PgsA and OmpC ().
For blue-light induction of cell adhesion, we designed 2 composite parts to be introduced into E. coli cells. Upon blue light exposure, cells harbouring these constructs will display either SpyCatcher or SpyTag on their surface with the help of the Intimin protein and will aggregate.
Similar to stereolithography, structures would be generated layer by layer from a flat surface by exposing a particular radius with blue light.

Pblind, a blue light inducible promoter developed by Jayaraman et.al (2016), is activated by EL222 (BBa_K2332005) upon blue-light exposure (465nm). Pblind will only allow RNAP to transcribe genes downstream upon blue-light (465) exposure, as this will"

Once it reaches State 3, it loses the transcription factor, so whether it is combined with the PC chain, it will no longer increase the output of the system. In other words, it cannot transition from state 3 to state 1 or 2.    Based on the above content, we establish a birth-death process model, whose state transition diagram is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5. State transition diagram of the birth-death process. The TC chain can transition its states along the arrows with the corresponding exponential distribution parameters p,c and d. Since the mean of a exponentially distributed variable is the reciprocal of its exponential distribution parameter, the longer the mean value is, the smaller the corresponding probability parameter is. Therefore, in the case of stable external environment (temperature, pH, etc.), p is positively correlated with the concentration of PC chain, d is negatively correlated with the binding ability of the two chains, and c is positively correlated with protease cleavage ability.
Conclusion
The mean of the total time E(Me) that a TC chain has undergone from being placed on the cell membrane to being cleaved by the protease reflects the activity of the system (i.e., the greater the output of the system is, the bigger the reciprocal of it is). Hence, dynamic range is positively correlated with the expression shown in Figure 6. We also display the graph of it with protease cleavage ability as the independent variable.
Figure 6. The relationship between dynamic range and protease cleavage ability. In order to show the relationship between protease cleavage ability and dynamic range better, we assume DR=kE(Me1)/E(Me2) without loss of generality, where k is a scale factor.
It is clear from the figure that the negative correlation between dynamic range and protease cleavage ability is caused by different growth rates of background noise and saturated output when protease cleavage ability rises, which gives a explicit guidance on further experiment.
Binding abilities
Introduction
After losing its transcription factor, a TC chain may still be combined with a PC chain, which makes the latter occupied but does not contribute to system output. We use the indicator called system efficiency (SE) to measure the extent, to which TC chains out of transcription factor occupy system resources. By promoting SE, we can achieve the same level of system output with fewer resources (i.e., lower chain generation rates)."

Market Overview
Synbiologica’s initial target market will be scientific researchers, particularly those with PhDs who are in control of their own research and equipment. These scientists will be responsible for making the decision to incorporate BEAR into their laboratories. A demographic overview of science and engineering PhDs showed that 9 out of every 10 scientists and engineers worked in a large city in 2001. 1 60% of science and engineering PhDs work in education and at government institutions. 2 In 2001, the average earnings of PhDs working in the public sector surpassed those in the private sector. 3 On average, a scientist or engineer with a PhD employed on a full-time basis earned $70,000. 4
In 2001, the average age of employed science and engineering PhDs was 46, much older than the average age of 39 for employed Canadians. 5
There were 4 times as many men with science and engineering PhDs than women in 2001, but this gap is gradually narrowing. Female PhDs also earned only 77% of what male PhDs earned. 6
BEAR will be valuable to scientific researchers, particularly those of the endocrinology and neuroscience demographic. There are 447 endocrinologists practicing in Canada, 78% of which work in a health science centre and 37% of which work in a university. 7 In the United States, there are 5341 practicing endocrinologists, approximately 1500 of which are involved in research. 8 As scientists learn more about the role of specific hormones in the brain, the more they can contribute to the development of treatments for neurological and mental diseases. The opportunity to publish their research is an interest shared by all scientists. Producing publications allows researchers to continue funding new projects.

An interface to it is provided by a software bridge, which maps protocols expressed in CHRIS to sequences of native robot instructions.
The Resource Management layer maintains resource state information and allows for high-level interface standardizations for initializing, requesting, naming, aggregating, and accessing resources to the Language layer, analogous to a ''system call'' suite. This interface abstracts resource management away from the protocol specification language.

An initial version of the Puppeteer stack is fully integrated with the Clotho software platform and implemented within the wet lab.  Basic BioBricks assembly protocols have been implemented and validated via the physical assembly of basic devices.  Two protocols central to BioBricks assembly—Restriction Digestion and Ligation—have been created using the Puppeteer language.  The Puppeteer implementation was validated by executing multiple trials for both protocols and verifying the results via running gels.
Collaboration with other iGEM teams:
In order to ensure reproducibility and promote collaboration, we visited the Weiss lab at MIT to implement the Puppeteer stack with their robot configuration.  During the visit we encountered a few MIT iGEM team members and coordinated with them to test the Puppeteer flow with the MIT Tecan robot.  After we got settled, we noticed several differences between MIT's and our own Tecan robot deck setups; this required modifying settings within the Puppeteer flow for proper protocol execution.  As such, we separated modifiable settings into an easy-to-edit settings file to ensure that Puppeteer maintains configurable settings for varying deck layouts.  The Puppeteer flow was then tested on MIT’s robot, and everything proceeded as expected.  The entire collaborative experience with MIT’s iGEM team remains fruitful since it enforced a more robust and functional Puppeteer flow across multiple robot configurations.
Restriction Digest:
For restriction digest we digested the plasmid containing the BioBrick BBa_J52028 in order to isolate the GFP. After cutting the plasmid with EcoRI and SpeI we ran it on a one percent gel along with a ladder in order to determine the amount of base pairs for each DNA part. As GFP is about 1221 bp the location in which it is located on the gel is correct. Also the backbone was about 3189 bp which is also located in the correct location on the gel.
Ligation:

In return, iGEM UC Davis requested us to test the effects of hydrogen peroxide on bacterial cells to allow iGEM UC Davis to better understand their own results on testing hydrogen peroxide on mammalian cells. We tested hydrogen peroxide           at a concentration of 100 ppm on 10 different stress reactive strains (Figure 3). The strains pSoxS, pUmuc, pBaeS and plbpA do not show a positive stress response when exposed to 100 ppm hydrogen peroxide. However, the strains The KatG gene encodes for hydroperoxidase I. It protects aerobic, phosphate-starved cells from oxidative damage.

This promoter is therefore related to               protein synthesis stress[6]. Read more about CpxR on its iGEM registry page pCpxR do show a positive stress response following hydrogen peroxide exposure.
pSoxS, pUmuc, pBaeS and plbpA are           involved in           DNA damage stress responses[1][2], envelope stress [3] and cell division[4], respectively. For these strains hydrogen peroxide does not invoke a stress reaction, indicating that these pathways are not           upregulated and suggesting the           bacterial cell does not experience these kinds of stress. Because these stress visualizing strains reacted to the exposure to 100ppm H2O2 these results indicate an involvement of H2O2 in the stress pathways of oxidative stress, protein           synthesis and homeostasis stress.

We select the biotin-streptavidin system to accomplish our adhesion because it is known as the strongest covalent binding system in nature. By introducing ice nucleation protein (INP) and monomer streptavidin adhesion (mSA) fusion protein to E.coli, we express mSA on its surface with INP, which is intergrated into the out membrane itself.[8][9][10] Meanwhile, we express biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) and biotin ligase (BirA) in the S.cerevisiae strain EBY100.[11] This strain of yeast contains pYD1, which has another surface-display system called Aga1p-Aga2p adhesion system. By using this strain, we will be able to express biotinylated BAP on the yeast surface. Ultimately, E.coli and S.cerevisiae can connect firmly with each other through the covalent binding of biotin and streptavidin.
The following question may better elucidate our designing details:
Click here to see Q&A
Q1. Why choose to establish an adhesion platform?
At the beginning of our project, we wanted to express cellulosome in S. cerevisiae, where cellulase can located. Then the cellulase can degrade Enteromorpha into cellose and xylose. The latter two can be used by S.cerevisiae as the source of fermentation. Although cellulosome is a method to degrade cellulose with high efficiency, it also has a complex structure combined with multiple scaffold proteins and cellulase domains which will accrete the difficulty of experiment design and give the S.cerevisiae a heavier burden.[13] Obviously, too much burden can harm the ferment efficiency.
Fig 2.1 Domains and enzymes on cellulosome.
Thus, we think of E.coli to do the part of cellulosome. Because E.coli is a model strain, we can change its feature and function easily, and its plasmid has both proper copy number and size that can lead to a lighter burden than that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Moreover, we can separate degradation step and fermentation step through this method, which leads to higher efficiency.
Q2:What’s the preponderance of our platform?
This platform consists of two parts, monomer streptavidin surface display system and biotin surface display system. It is known that avidin can"

Interview: María & Mehmet
Interview conclusions were:
It is difficult for artists to get in touch with scientists. Maria and Memo met by coincidence.
In this aspect, Printeria could help to approach artists to scientists.
Presevation of bioart plates is one of the biggest problems. The best way to preserve them is leaving the plates in the fridge. But using epoxy or other resins can help preservation.
We leave them on the fridge and we are trying to fix them by using transparent nail polish.
Consider working by layers when working with different types of bacteria. The slow growers should go first and after growing them, fast growers should be added.
As we are only working with E. coli, we are having no problems. But this piece of advice should be taken into account if Printeria ends up using other different chassis than just E. coli strains.
They don’t create their own GM microorganisms, so they think Printeria could be a useful machine to do so. Memo encourages us to write a manuscript out of this, even if the machine does not totally work. This could make people start using it so that Printeria could evolve.
The idea of doing a manuscript caught our eyes and we are planning to do so. It also made us think about creating the ‘Printeria user manual’ as well as an activity booklet for the user to learn even more about SynBio.
Do not only focus on creating colourful bacteria but on stand-alone scent pathways.
We achieved to create mint scented E.coli but we will continue doing some research in stand-alone scent pathways.
For doing bioart, just try different techniques: using glass beads, pipetting liquid cultures, using sowing handles.
We knew nothing about bioart and, thanks to Maria and Memo, we started developing our skills to quickly learn the basics about this type of art. We used the pipetting method to create Yturralde’s living art and the sowing handles for creating Printeria’s logo and for letting students create their own masterpieces in MAG.
Memo thinks Printeria is a nice multidisciplinary project. He encourages us to show who we are, and the way we learnt to speak a common language in which biotechnologists, engineers, designers and informatics, understood each other.
It is very important for people to know that Printeria is more than just a biotechnological project. It is a machine in which lots of different disciplines worked together with a single goal. And this piece of advice really helped us while creating our poster and while planning our Giant Jamboree’s presentation.

Perspectives
We realized early on that there are many interesting applications for our chosen sub elements, and as we got to talk with different experts, we saw even more opportunities. On this page we have highlighted some of the most interesting applications, to give you a broader perspective of the true potential of each sub element. We have also included some of the high school students' ideas from the workshops. So take a look and be inspired to how Bacto-Aid’s sub elements can be integrated in your future.

Bacteriocins
The promising MIC results of the bacteriocins gives us the opportunity to use them as a supplement to traditional antibiotics, thus facing the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here is some of the ideas for their future applications.
Combination of traditional antibiotics with bacteriocins ( Top )
The bacteriocins could serve as a supplement to traditional antibiotics, since our purified bacteriocins are capable of inhibiting the growth of Methicillin Resistant S. aureus strains. It could also be hypothesized that a combination of traditional antibiotics with bacteriocins could elicit a synergistic effect towards resistant bacterial strains. This leaves us with the opportunity to shift the balance of resistance. This could prevent the evolution of antimicrobial resistance against traditional antibiotics Dan, Y., et al. (2012).

Today, the only transformation which worked was the JM110 with BBa_K346004 (Bioaccumulation Biobrick)!!
- JM110 com BBa_K346004 – pSB1C3  (Bioaccumulation Biobrick).
We made a subculturing on solid and liquid LB chloramphenicol 34 ug/ml of JM110, with BBa_K346004.
Also was done an inoculum of JM110 in LB media with Streptomycin 40 ug/ml.

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html,", like the decision whether or not to use Synthetic Biology in an application, one balances the risks against the benefits. But is actually meant by “risk” isn’t always clear. Textbooks state that the Risk is the magnitude of the Hazard when it takes place, multiplied by the Frequency in which these hazards actually occur (R = H * F).
These risks are partially factual risks, which can be scientifically assessed, like assessing the chance that an organism will share DNA with surrounding organisms upon deliberate release into the environment. There are also virtual risks, like exploring the probability of creating a biological weapon with open source BioBricks.  When the future impact of a certain decision, like in the case of using Synthetic Biology in increasing levels of artificialness, risk assessment actually becomes risk perception: the response of the public, NGOs or consumers are unknown, as well as the scientific possibilities and application areas. If the risk is “low enough” (and one has to wonder who decides that), a certain action can be justified. Some would calculate the Justification of a decision as the Impact of something going well, times the Chance of it going well, minus the actual risk (J = I * C – H * F).
The problem with these kinds of analyses is that the (financial) impact or hazard can be calculated, or well estimated, but the occurrence of the events generally cannot. Then, values for impact or hazard are chosen arbitrarily, attributing a certain value to what a stakeholder deems important. Many individual assessments play a role. Experiences of the company or academic institution, experiences of others, experiences of individual employees, public attitudes, litigation, fear of bad media attention, activism by NGOs, etc., all play a role in “calculating” the risk or in justifying the actions of the company as a whole and to make money or generate knowledge within all legal boundaries.
It becomes clear that the risk assessment regarding synthetic biology relies on many uncertainties. Some risks can be scientifically assessed, but many other risk assessments related to this new technology take into account many uncertainties. Ethical considerations can help create some structure on what to focus on in risk assessments. By focusing on synthetic biology and its applications, two main fields of risk perception are distinguished in this report: risks associated with new technology and risks associated with open source technology. These two will be addressed in the next sections.
3.2.2 Synthetic biology as a novel technology
As stated before, probably all new technologies give rise to new risks and risk perceptions. This has been observed for genetic engineering, nuclear energy, cars, etc. Modern research on the newest technology may also"

We solved the dynamics first by using a preprogrammed function solver in python to solve the nonlinear equations. Then - to solve the dynamics itself - we used the implicit euler, which is a Radau IIA method of order one. As a proof of concept, implicit methods were necessary because of stiffness. The method enabled us to prove the concept, but it has the same structure as the SDIRK method, which is of order maximum three. So if necessary we can improve the error by easily changing the solver method.

SVA-NYC,2015,Team:SVA-NYC#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Clinton Hill. The owner of the garden has been working on it for 25 years. An experienced gardener, he gave me a brief  overview of the different plants he has been growing here.
#18 - Mulberries
This location is covered in mulberries - I wondered whether this factor contributes to the lush carpet of grass or would interfere with the testing, which we discussed with the owner of the house.
#19 - Dry Soil
At this location, the yard is sitting under the shade of a huge maple tree.  We are not recommended by soil sampling protocol to collect from under the tree but we still do since sometimes when there is no other option. Each yard is unique and equally important. There is no vegetation in this yard and the soil is tough and dry. I have to come up with alternative solutions for getting my samples.  The power of my hand muscle is not enough to get through the surface using the auger. After stepping on the auger and pushing on with the weight of my body I finally get to the desired depth. The sample is taken and I briefly chat with the participant about the soil condition.
#20 - Bushwick constructions
I arrived at another location in Bushwick.  This time the yard looks well developed, but the soil is covered with bark. I carefully remove the bark to expose the soil surface. Everywhere I look I see the sprouts of these huge vines suffocating the tree in the corner of the yard. The little pool in the center  is partially covered with small white particles. I suggest that these are the part of styrofoam they use in construction next door. I share my story citing that the whole yard is being covered with styrofoam particles from a giant condo construction next to us. Somedays it looked like it was snowing. I called 311 4 times, I talked to supervisor of construction numerous times - nothing was done. I am off to my next location.
#35 - Gentrification
Gentrification has overtaken much of the city.  Land is a lucrative resource as a financially stable entity.  This location was reclaimed from a once shell of a building that was a playground for vagrancy.  The property was purchased in Harlem and rebuilding the shell into the magnificence it once was begun by its new owners.  Soil that was collected was previously buried under a layer of concrete, broken bottles and the remains of barrel fire debris. This tale has been told throughout the city for many years.  It reclaims discarded buildings and transforms them into beautiful structures once again.

Procedure
Set up
Generally, we prepare more than one gel in case one leaks.
Make sure every component is washed and cleaned properly.
Beforehand, align the small glass and the bigger glass (the little one should face towards you) in the green clasps on an even surface.
Close the clasps to fixate the glasses and snap it into the big plastic stand (fits two gel next to each other).
Put the gel cast under the laminar hood.
Gel preparation
To prepare the gel add the following to a 50ml falcon tube (calculations for 2 gels):
6.72 g of 7M urea
5.3 ml of 40% Acryl/Bisacryl
1.4 ml of 10X TBE
1.4ml of water
5.6 μl of TEMED (will be added after microwave)
46.2 μl of 30%(w/v) APS
For a total volume of 14 ml.
Add everything expect the TEMED and the 30% APS and heat it up in the microwave for about 10 seconds (the tube should be clear).
TIP: let the tube in the microwave for 3-4 secondes, take it out and shake it again for 3-4 secondes.
Under the laminar hood
Add the TEMED second to last and the 30% APS last as the reaction starts quickly after you add those components.
Gently let the gel mixture flow between the two thin glasses. Add the gel comb. Nothing should spill down.
Let it solidify for about 5 minutes.
Unclip the gels from the clasps and gently"

Question 3: in what way do you think GMO could influence people’s health? Analysis: 44.19% of the respondents believe that GMO is potentially harmful (meanwhile not beneficial at all) to human health, while 30.88% believe that GMO could bring both benefits and harm to human health. Which means the respondents were not fully informed about the truth of GMO, some of them don't know the benefits GMO could bring, and the others cannot hold a certain attitude on it. Therefore, it is our job to inform as much people as possible about the facts about GMO.
Question 8: What’s your attitude toward the researches in the field of transgenosis? Analysis: 74.22% of the respondents support further researches in the field of transgenosis, which means transgenosis and GMO have the potential to be accepted by the majority of the public and the public wants to know more about GMO."",,,,,,, 1826,GZHS-United,High School,2017, https://2017.igem.org/Team:GZHS-United,None,Education and Public Engagement,Leaflet about GMO & Leaflet about Mosquito Control,Just Product,""<a href="""" https://2017.igem.org/Team:GZHS-United/HP/Gold_Integrated """"> https://2017.igem.org/Team:GZHS-United/HP/Gold_Integrated </a>"",""We made two leaflets that were used as educational and popularizational materials, on the two main focuses of our program, GMO and mosquito control"",Other,General Public,Educate on the iGEM program,</ul>,Integrated Human Practices,""GMO Leaflet

Taq DNA Polymerase  (0.5µl)
Nuclease-Free Water  (31µl)
Primers were designed to anneal flanking regions of the gene, and to include the biobrick prefix and suffix sequences on either end of the amplified gene. The Melting temperature (Tm) of the primers were to be within 1oC of one another (~60oC), and to have a guanine/cytosine content (GC%) of between 30% and 50%. A 6-nucleotide random DNA sequence was also added to the primers which lets the enzymes cut efficiently.
A longer initial denaturation time of 5 minutes was used since the DNA was still contained within the cells.
The annealing temperature was taken to be a 2oC lower than the average melting temperature.
The extension time was suggested to be 15 seconds per kilobases of DNA being amplified. Following amplification, the PCR products were digested (using a restriction site known to be present in the amplicon) and gel electrophoresis was used to check for successful amplification.
SDS-PAGE
Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate – Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to analyse the effect of the expression plasmid (designed to overexpress xylose isomerase) on the entire protein complement of the E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and compare to normal cell protein expression to conclude whether the expression plasmid (part K2442371 ) works as hypothesised.
BL21(DE3) strain E. coli cells were first transformed with the expression plasmid. 3 separate fresh 3ml liquid cultures (labelled cultures A, B and C) were made using separate colonies, L-broth, and with the addition of of chloramphenicol (Cm) (1,000X) and glucose (20mM/l). Glucose was added to the media because it precedes lactose in the E. coli sugar-consumption hierarchy, and the lactose-induced lac operon loci is known to transcribe RNA polymerase. As such, a source of glucose suppresses RNA polymerase transcription, and so gene expression only occurs after addition of the lac-operon inducer Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
Each culture was then diluted 100-fold"

    Secondly, we get to the conclusion that warrior II is actually quite ideal as it does not kill itself and that its killing effect towards Beggar I is obvious. Warrior I needs some improvement because it kills itself and the killing effect is rather weak.
    These results are consistent with our orthogonality test , as Warrior II is truly ideal but warrior I is not. Therefore, it is reasonable that we use RFP to indicate killing effect of warriors in orthogonality test.
    In order to improve Warrior I, we have to modify our gene circuit so that warrior I does not kill itself and at the same time, effectively kills Beggar II. (see improved gene circuit )

We built two mini-houses using KT Board (made of polystyrene) to simulate two rooms, which connected with a corridor. We design control group without any drugs, and experimental group with cockroach killing chalk, BAYER-Premise and out product equipped with M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder. Then, we put thirty cockroaches into one room each time, and came back to see the results after three days. We focused more attention on migration rate and mortality.
Finally, we got results that the migration rate of control group was 7.78%, while 21.11%, 20.00%, 6.67% respectively in groups using cockroach killing chalk, BAYER-Premise and our product. For mortality in three days, 77.78% in group using chalk, 84.44% in group using Premise, 28.89% in group using our product, and 2.01% in group using nothing. Statistical Analysis in our model shows our product with M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder will not cause a high migration rate of cockroaches comparing with traditional products, although it has lower mortality within three days.
What’s more, we tested the mortality between groups using and without using our box to equipped M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder. The mortality in group using our box was 34.14%, while 12.22% in group without using any box. The result show that that it is necessary for us to use our Green-Ground box to hold M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder.

Purdue,2013,Team:Purdue#Project#Standardized Datasheets_-_-_TEXT.html," the datasheet. We decided on the final design seen above, and we decided that it would be best if the more experienced programmers at Boston take on creating the actual datasheet program. This way Purdue iGEM would handle the outreach and design, and the Boston team would handle the implementation and functionality.
Now as the competition draws near, both of our teams realized that creating this program and system is too difficult and complex to do in a single competition year. So both teams agreed to use the 2013 competition to build support and interest about the project, and then continue with the collaboration next year.
However, we were able to stylize our part page for BBa_K1225000 in the manner of our datasheets. This provides a good look at how the datasheets would appear on the registry. This can be seen here: BBa_K1225000
Future Plans and Collaboration
The Purdue Biomakers and the BostonU iGEM team are planning to continue this collaborative effort to create a standardized data sheet design and program to improve the iGEM registry. Although we could not fully implement the datasheet system this year, we plan to work very hard at the beginning of next year's competition to finalize the program and the design so we can get as many teams to use it as possible for the 2014 competition. Then once we've had a test year, we can present our system to iGEM HQ and they will hopefully try to officially integrate it into the iGEM competition and registry.

A low-cost DIY methane sensor for Team Braunschweig
Our colleagues from Braunschweig are cultivating microorganisms that grow on methane (CH4) which is supplied via the gas phase. To monitor the methane uptake by their E. co(w)li, they would like to measure the methane concentration in the gas phase. With the standard analytical methods in the lab, this is very difficult, but when they told us about their problem, we knew that we might be able to help them. We assembled an Arduino-based methane sensor and wrote a program to record the data.
The componentes for the methane sensor include:
Arduino Nano V3 clone
SainSmart MQ-4 Gas Sensor
A Breadboard and some wires
To set up the electronics for a measurement, the sensor and the Arduino have to be connected according to the following scheme:
Connecting the MQ-4 module to the Arduino
Only three wires are required to connect the MQ-4 module to the Arduino Nano.
We sent all the components to Braunschweig and they assembled the Arduino and sensor module in an incubation chamber:
MQ-4 sensor in the gas phase
For anaerobic cultivation, a wireless connection might be better.
Online data on a laptop
The Arduino is connected to a laptop running our Serial Client software to plot and collect online data.
The software used to monitor the online methane concentration data is the Serial Client that was also developed by our team.

Our Project: Context
Since the development of recombinant DNA technology (Cohen et al., 1973), recombinant protein production gradually became a major branch in modern biotechnologies bringing production of both biopharmaceutical and industrial enzymes to the unprecedented importance it reached today.
In the protein production process, the choice of a suitable host organism through several criteria is pivotal. In that regard, E. coli thanks to the availability of many molecular tools and the ease with which it is cultivated, remains an host of choice. Even though E. coli is a firmly established model organism, there is many remaining drawbacks to its utilisation. High among those, figures its inability to efficiently secrete protein into the growth medium but should also be noted that quite often high protein production induces E. coli’s stress response which hinders growth, and the very limited possibilities of post-translational modifications in E. coli.
In order to recover the biosynthesized product from an E. coli culture, bacteria must undergo lysis. This operation is expensive, inefficient, time consuming and implies that bioreactors must be restarted from scratch.
These problems drove a lot of researchers to the lab but it also drove the industrials away from E. coli and towards new host organisms.
The objective of our project is to reestablish E. coli as a microorganism of choice for recombinant protein production thanks to an easily implementable biobrick allowing regulable universal recombinant protein secretion.
Such biobrick could reveal itself to be a convenient alternative to cell lysis and be of great use in continuous mixed flow reactors for recombinant protein production and potentially many other applications. Moreover, cytotoxic protein production would also be greatly facilitated.
The idea behind The Gatekeeper is to create a porin regulated by inducers such as transition metal ions. To obtain this porin, we started from the pIV porin of the f1 bacteriophage. This porin allows the virion extrusion out of the bacteria without affecting its viability.
Through our semi-rational targeted mutagenesis approach, we should be able to quickly create  high diversity pIV mutants libraries. Among those we aim to select the mutants for which we could affect the open/close state through the use of the"

BactaSun
Although melanoma accounts for less than 1% of skin cancer cases, they are responsible for the vast majority of skin cancer deaths. More than 80% of melanomas are caused by the exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.

Global issue
Over the last years, our exposition to UV rays has increased and scientists noticed an upward trend in the risks of developing skin cancers.
Protection exists
Although we can protect ourselves against this health hazard, we cannot feel the UV rays and when sunburns appear, it is already too late.
Badge design
Hence, we have designed a wearable UV-sensitive badge to help warning people on their level of exposure anytime and anywhere. The badge turns red when exposed to a certain level of sunlight.
Culture design
This badge contains a liquid cell culture. The bacterial cells are engineered o produce a red fluorescent protein, which is only developed when. They only produce it when the badge is exposed to UV rays, thanks to a photocaged amino acid.

Culture preservation
Introduction :
Bacterias can be stored for months and years if they are stored at -80℃ and in high percentage of glycerol
Materials:
50% glycerol solution
Day/overnight culture
1.5mL centrifuge tube
Method:
Pick a single colony off a plate and let grow in an appropriate selectable liquid medium (5ml) overnight.
Add 400 uL 50% glycerol into a 1.5mL centrifuge tube.
Add 600 uL bacteria liquid .
Gently vortex to ensure that the culture and glycerol are well-mixed.
Store in a -80℃ freezer.
GEL extraction
Steps:
Perform agarose gel electrophoresis to fractionate DNA fragments. Use fresh TAE as running buffer.
When adequate separation of bands has occurred, carefully excise the DNA fragment of interest using a wide, clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighting it in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Assuming a density of 1 g/mL, the volume of gel is derived as follows: a gel slice of mass 0.3 g will have a volume of 0.3 mL.
Add 1 volume Binding Buffer (XP2).
Incubate at 50-60℃ for 7 minutes or until the gel has completely melted. Vortex or shake the tube every 2-3 minutes.
Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column in a 2 mL Collection Tube.
Add no more than 700uL DNA/agarose solution from step 5 to the HiBind○R DNA Mini Column.
Centrifuge at 10,000×g for 1 minute at room temperature.
Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
Repeat step 7-9 until all of the sample has been transferred to the column.
Add 300uL Binding Buffer (XP2).
Centrifuge at maximum speed (≥13,000×g) for 1 minute at room temperature.
Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
Add 700uL SPW Wash Buffer.
(Note: SPW Wash Buffer must be diluted with 100% ethanol prior to use.)
Centrifuge at maximum speed (≥13,000×g) for 1 minute at room temperature.
Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
Repeat steps 14-16 for a second SPW Wash Buffer wash"

We characterized this part by placing a reporter GFP gene downstream of the promoter and determined that GFP expression was up-regulated when the yeast was shifted to galactose media.
Data for Pre-Existing Parts
Experience - Limonene Synthase Composite + Lac promotor, BBa_K118025 (Edinburgh, iGEM 2008): This part was previously uncharacterized. We expressed it in C41 E. coli that possesses a pRARE plasmid that enables it to translate proteins with rare codons. The limonene synthase was purified from a culture and subjected to an enzymatic assay for its ability to synthesize limonene monoterpene from GPP substrate. GC-MS analysis showed that limonene was produced, demonstrating that this part works! Experience - Yeast GAL1 Promoter, BBa_J63006: We characterized this part by placing a reporter GFP gene downstream of the promoter. However, using the same protocol that successfully characterized our newly submitted BBa_K517000 GAL promoter and BBa_K517001 GPD promoter, we were not able to obtain clear evidence of BBa_J63006 promoter induction under exposure to galactose. Instead, for induction by galactose, we recommend using the BBa_K517000 GAL promoter created by our team until more evidence of BBa_J63006 functionality is obtained. Experience - E. coli Isopentenyl Diphosphate Isomerase, BBa_K115056 (TU Delft 2008): We sequenced this part using the VF2 and VR primers and found that the sequence between the original EcoRI and PstI restriction enzyme sites (1) did not contain the XbaI or SpeI sites and (2) was not homologous to any part of the IDI gene. We recommend that this part is removed from the registry and taken off distribution.
We've also characterized the following parts
Main Page - GPD constitutive yeast promoter, BBa_K517001: Promoter for constitutively high expression. We characterized this part by placing a reporter GFP gene downstream of the promoter and determined that GFP was expressed regardless of whether the yeast was in glucose, raffinose or galactose media.

Another experiment should also be carried out to test the influence of the C0053  inhibitor on the K145150 promoter,  (see figure below)(Experimental circuit: Construction: BBa R0080 , BBa_C0053, BBa_K145150 , Part: BBa E0240).
Experimental circuit. Repression by c2p22
Theoretical quorum sensing circuit
The promoter upstream from the inhibitor is induced by arabinose.
Circuit III
The Quorum sensing should also be tested (see figure below): we use promoters whose  regulation can be controlled by LuxI and LuxR. The fluorescence rate would be measured according to time and population density. Then, we can determine the time necessary for the bacteria to reach a certain density allowing them to produce the LuxR-HSL complex.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectModeling_-_-_TEXT.html," tree structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the tree structure changes, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange the two chains with equal unicode_c. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm could be used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code is actually a representation of the path from current node to the root, we can restore the tree structure from the set of Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes set of leaf nodes could uniquely represent a tree structure. We could generate a string, unicode_t for tree structure by splicing the Huffman codes and their weight of all leaf nodes sorted by their weights and adding a asterisk between two adjacent codes, for example:
[000:0:1][001:1:3][010:2:3][011:2:4]
Based on this idea, we could obtain the tree unicode_t for any possible order by exchanging equivalent chains and choose the order which make the minimum unicode_t value. By checking the unicode_t value of permutation, chains are grouped in a number of equivalent classes, which contains one or more chains. Chains within each equivalent classes are equivalent: exchanging order of any two chains will not change the tree structure.
It is easy to compare two Chain-Model structures with the help of chain sorting. We only need to compare unicode_c value of chains in the chain list and unicode_t value generated under that order. If two structures are equal, their chain list and tree structure must be equal since the chains order is unique in our chain sorting method. If two structures have same unicode_c value of each chain and unicode_t value, they must be same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the strings.
How to find species with specific structural pattern of a template one?
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.
Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks"
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," after one day of incubation and M9-minimal agar for the observation of chemotaxis (Burkart et al. 1998; Farrel et al. 2005).  M9-minimal agar did not support intense swimming. Instead, swimming was initially observed after 2 days. In order to allow chemotaxis on M9-minimal agar, the addition of L-methionine was required, as described by Adler, 1972. In comparison to the tryptone-swimming agar, chemotaxis experiments were much more reasonable with the defined M9-minimal agar leading to a high degree of reproduction. Thirdly, different stocksolutions of attractants in the Whatman paper were tested, including L-aspartate (10 mM), a mix of amino acids (0,2% w/v) and tryptone (0,5% w/v). These components were used to trigger chemotaxis of the bacteria. Here, we used L-aspartate in most experiments when we worked with the aspartate receptor Tar of E. coli. We adjusted the volume of all attractants to 100 µl, which was the maximal amount that could be soaked into the Whatman paper (2 cm X 2 cm in size). Furthermore, it proved beneficial to pipette the 100 µl attractant solution on the Whatman paper before the paper was placed onto the center of the semisolid agar. Moreover, the incubation temperature turned out to be a crucial parameter for swimming assays. It is known that long-term bacterial growth at 37°C leads to inhibition of flagella growth. Therefore, incubation of swimming assay Petri dishes was conducted at 33°C. The fine-tuning of the experimental setup was closely related to the choice of our E. coli strains. Since we worked a lot with the tar-knock-out mutant (Baba et al. 2006) that was created in the background of the laboratory strain DH10B, we tested all our media and parameters with DH10B in the first place. But, soon we realized that laboratory strains were not developed to be the best swimmers and we figured that other strains might have better swimming characteristics. Therefore, the chemotaxis strains MG1655 and RP437 joined our collection. In addition, the E. coli laboratory strain BL21 showed better swimming properties than the laboratory strains DH10B or XL1 blue (Fig. 1).
Library selection assay
The main aim of our project was to “engineer E. coli to act as tracking dogs”. Seven substances were chosen as new attract"
SUSTC-Shenzhen-A,2013,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the experiment: mix cell A and cell B and add appropriate amount of Zeo and nickel to adjust the sentence under different situation. Observe the growth curve of bacteria. Coat the plates and count the number of yellow and red colonies. The results at different times can be recorded by Flow Cytometer; the growth curve can be recorded by microplate reader.
Second part: the iterated prisoners' dilemma
1) This situation is more practical. Because cell A and cell B cannot adjust strategies specifically, we adjust the strategies of cell A and cell B artificially by using different promoter combination for each step and adjust the two promoters specifically at the same time in multiple experience. It can also be simulated by computer.
2) This can be achieved by microfluidic chip controlled by computer programme.
Third part: the space inflatable prisoners' dilemma
1) As the degradation speed of 6HSL and 12HSL is high and the diffusion coefficient is limited, the influence distance of cells in agar plate is limited. So we can study the interesting phenomenon of cell A and cell B forming in the agar plate.
2) If rbs is adjusted that no HSL is delivered by cells, the cell can grow at a slow speed. Paste very dilute cell A and cell B solution in the plate, at beginning, bacteria can grow in small colony and accumulate HSL partially. At this moment, the prisoner’s dilemma is begin.
3) Because of the effect on growth and the relation to distance, the increase of diameter of different two adjacent colonies and the strategies are performing the space inflatable prisoner’s dilemma.
4) Between a pair of cell A and cell B, as the communication of near-end and far-end are different, the colony cannot be roundness. The asymmetric shape is an experiment of prisoner’s dilemma and also an observation of the diversity of the situation.
5) Adjust the strategies of cell A and cell B, observe the effect on the shape of colonies.
Biobricks characterization
results
We chose four biobricks to detect after search. They are xylose,KNO3,glucose and 12HSL.
BBa_K733018 : xylose
First we used the microplate reader to detect the fluorescence of this part, because we could not see the transition point and we were wondering what it would be look like. The data we got is not so good, for we didn’t see the transition point obviously, and also has some differences comparing to the data from HKUST team. According to the data from HKUST, fluorescence produced in about 5% xylose is more than that in 10"

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Practices#Maker Faire_-_-_TEXT.html," concept that unites different classes:  Assembly of the bioreactor in a science class, analysis of the software in the computer science class and using the bioreactor in the biology (they have an S1 lab) and chemistry class. Unfortunately, we could not realize the project before the jamboree because of the summer holidays in German schools.
With all our discussions and explanations we did not only teach others about DIY biology, but also learned a lot about the principles of openly shared knowledge and the opportunities this generates. We got useful tipps and ""how to's"" about laser cutting, 3D printing, edging and many other standard DIY tools.  Asking the question ""what would you add to the bioreactor?"", the most common answer was: ""microbes"".  However, there was also some feedback on the technical aspects of our reactor system, which influenced our next design process, for example the demand to use bioreactors of different volumes.

First encounter with the Technik Garage

Apart from demonstrating our bioreactor, we had a look at all the amazing projects made by the other makers. It happended that we came across one the very few German Community Labs, the “Technik Garage”. Among other things, they built a pH-value system that automatically corrects the pH of a measured solution by pumping vinegar or diluted drain cleaner into the solution. Such as we do, they use rotation pumps. However, they used to buy pumps from the internet. That is why, they were really interested in our low-cost DIY pump design.
During the discussions about open hardware and open biology, we came to know that one of their projects is perfectly matching our strategy. To be more precise, the Technik Garage  developed a DIY system to extract CO2 from thin air. Together with the next generation electrolysis cells of Sunfire which can convert CO2 to methanol, this would be the perfect method to exploit an alternative sustainable carbon source. Since we had so many overlapping interests, we agreed to meet again. All of this inspired us to have a deeper look into the German Community Lab scene.

Human Practices
To improve the feasibility of our project and stimulate public interests in our work, we did the following human practices. First, we held meetings with experts in cancer-therapy research to get academic advices on our project. After finishing a sketch of our project plan, we made surveys among faculties in cancer research and attend a cancer summit in Changchun to get suggestions and comment about the feasibility and safety of our plan.  Next, we discussed with some professors in law to understand better the potential biosafety issues of our project. All these work helped us make great improvement of our project. To help people understand more about cancer therapies and our project, we attended a HUST-Cheering meeting, did a TED presentation and were interviewed by some local TV programs, including the Jilin University Television. Furthermore, we made online games, established a public Wechat platform and a twitter account to get feedback from the general public on the internet. To stimulate the interests in science among high school students, we gave a seminar on synthetic biology and our project in a local high school.

Lethbridge_Entrepreneurs,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#exec summary_-_-_TEXT.html,". Investors will have an opportunity to be part of a revolutionary, potentially lifesaving biotechnological development.
The major milestones Synbiologica Ltd. will achieve in upcoming years include acquiring an Alberta Innovation Voucher for the amount of $15,000 to have an Opportunity Assessment Report conducted.  The Alberta Innovates Technology Futures Voucher Program is designed to help small early stage technology businesses operating in Alberta to be successful in a global market place. This program provides a third-party opportunity assessment fund, with which the value of our prototype will be determined in relative markets. Additional voucher support programs though Alberta Innovates will be pursued. Synbiologica then plans to acquire the support of early investors for $500 000 and industry knowledge support for further prototype development and initial market entry.  By the 5th year, Synbiologica will seek a second round of investment of $20-30 million for clinical testing and FDA approval for up-scaling production. At this point Synbiologica anticipates that the impact of the technology will be recognised by larger biotechnology and medical device companies, to whom we plan to license-out and eventually sell BEAR technology. Synbiologica would then move on to new projects.
Management of the company will be the responsibility of the members of the Lethbridge Entrepreneurial iGEM team (2013):

Chugging along
Things seem to be going quite nicely in the lab at the moment. There are a few screw ups here and there, but it really feels like most of us have enough lab experience to get things done right more often than not. That, or we're just feeling the pressure now, the iGEM wiki freeze is in just 4 weeks now! Today, both groups did ligations, the Repressor group did 10, and the Antiterminator group did 7. Annemi and Patrick did the 19 transformations we had to do. I was glad that I was away during the afternoon because of my TA job, 19 transformations is a LOT and must've been boring to do ;). Unfortunately, it's going to take 3 more days before we're able to continue working on the constructs we made today, our little bugs have to grow! Luckily, people are dedicated enough to come in on weekends from now on, so the pace should pick up quite a bit. Hopefully the Repressor group will be done with their constructs next friday, ready for characterization!

Another one of those days...
Today was one of those very frustrating days when nothing works. We had many plans in the lab for today: doing PCRs, preparing overnight cultures, doing digestion, etc. However, as it has turned out we could not do the cultures, because the resteaks of ligation products from Friday had some problems, so we had to figure them out first and to redo them again. We have also run into some problems with our PCRs, which sometimes would not work for some strange reason. Then we could not start digestions because we have spend too much time focusing on smaller tasks in the lab and organising different things. Nevertheless, we still managed to finish many things during the day and hopefully we would be able to solve our problems tomorrow.

No one was able to be in the lab this morning, so Maya, Patrick and I started the lab work at 12:30, after lunch. Patrick and I were happy to see that the transformations I did yesterday looked good, meaning the ligations Patrick did Wednesday most likely went well! We have a few"

The   existing  knowledge  from  the  previous  level  was  augmented  with  in­depth  book­reading  and   feasibility analysis. After a week, the two ideas were consolidated and extended presentations   were made to be presented to the professors.
Pitching of idea in front of professors:
The  shortlisted  ideas  were  presented  in  the  form  of  two  long  presentations,  followed  by  a  detailed  question­answer  session.  All  faculty  members  of  our  department  were  present  and   were  actively  involved  in  it,  putting  forth  their  ideas  and  queries. After  a  2  hour­long  debate,   finally one of the ideas was chosen to be feasible for the project. However, due to lack of any   available prototype at that point of time, many of the professors rejected the idea of participation   in this  year’s  competition,  stating that it would be unwise to give  consent to  something which   had  no  proof  of  materialising  within  a  week’s  time.  As  the  deadlines  for  registration  were   approaching,  we  had  serious  troubles  in  convincing  the  professors  that  we  would  be  able  to   deliver the results in the right time. This session was to be followed by a meeting with the dean and a panel of high­ranked officials   of our institute. But that too got delayed due to the absence of the dean on some urgent matter.   We had no option in hand but to request the iGEM office for an extension in the deadline on the   plea of delay in arrangement of funds. To our luck, the iGEM office responded positively, and   extended the deadline by a few weeks.
Registration, consolidation of idea and selection of guide:
Not all the professors had opposed to the idea of our participation in this year’s iGEM. Prof. Dey   and Prof. Ganguly were in strong favour of the idea. This prevented us from losing all hope and   we kept on the struggle. With their help, we were able to rearrange the meet with the dean and   after a lot of effort, the plan was approved. As a result, funds were sanctioned by the institute   and we were able to register towards the end of April. All the registration formalities were carried   out  and  Prof.  Ganguly"

Finally, we asked whether or not a device like ours would pose a dilemma for PAX, since on the one hand it would be a step in solving the landmine problem, but on the other hand it involves synthetic biology, which might be conflicting with the Christian roots of PAX (Parent organizations IKV, which stands for interkerkelijk vredesberaad (interdenominational peace council), and Pax Christi, which is rooted in the Catholic Church, where both Christian organizations). “It would surprise me. PAX works on the basis of two central values of peace in conflict areas: human dignity; solidarity with peace activists and victims of war violence, so a world without landmines and cluster munitions. We are fully focused to fulfill that endeavor, so we would be very happy with any opportunity to do this. The requirements are implementability, economical feasibility and it should be comprehensive. Discussions that might arise from a method like yours are to be dealt with when they come.”
Report RIVM meeting ""Dealing Responsibly with Synthetic Biology""
Summary: The RIVM and the Rathenau Institute hosted a meeting during which the Dutch iGEM teams told about their projects to start of the discussion about the future of synthetic biology.The main conclusion of the discussion was that in order to get synthetic biology accepted, a clearly beneficial real-life application is needed. Our ELECTRACE system could play a big part in this by enabling biosensors to be used outside the lab.
The RIVM, which stands for RijksInstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment), in collaboration with the Rathenau Institute, which  promotes the formation of political and public opinion on science and technology, has organized a meeting concerning synthetic biology.
