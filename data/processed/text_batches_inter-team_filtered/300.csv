Both the ligations and the transformations didn't work
Procedure
1) Processing the cotC-GFP-smtA in pMUTIN4 E. coli transformants
a) Mini-preps of cotC-GFP-smtA E. coli transformants
The mini-preps of the 12 colonies of E. coli cells (which are potentially cotC-GFP-smtA transformants) were carried out using Sigma-Aldrich's GenElute HP Plasmid Mini-prep kit with it's attached protocol. There were no changes to the protocol and the resulting plasmid DNA was placed in the -20ºC freezer.
b) Digesting and analysing the mini-preps
The 12 mini-prep samples were digested using BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes. The digests were allowed to happen for 1 hour under 37ºC incubation (using the water bath). The contents of the 12 Eppendorf tubes were as follows:
10ul DNA
1ul of FastDigest BamHI restriction enzyme
1ul of FastDigest HindIII restriction enzyme
2ul of 10x FastDigest restriction buffer
6ul of sterile distilled water
The 12 digests were then analysed by DNA gel electrophoresis to yield the GelDoc photograph below.
This gel shows an unusual result - it appears that there is a huge amount of plasmid backbone DNA and only a very small amount of insert DNA. Whatsmore, the two bands don't even match the sizes predicted by information supplied for both pMUTIN4 and cotC-GFP-smtA. The band produced by the backbone fragment is roughly 4360 bp whereas it should be roughly 8,600bp; additionally the band produced by the insert fragment looks to be between 2027bp and 2322bp when cotC-GFP-smtA is actually 1385bp!
However most of the colonies picked seem to exhibit these band patterns which highlights consistency and means contamination is probably not a factor. It could be that the digests haven't worked properly.
c) Preparing midi-prep cultures
Based on the consistency of the bands exhibited by the 12 picked colonies of potential E. coli + cotC-GFP-smtA transformants, we took the decision to midi-prep culture sample 8 (hoping that the erroneous results were due to restriction enzyme error).
The mini-prep process only used 3ml of the 5ml LB (containing E. coli + cotC transformants) available so we could use "

Brainstorming
About E.coslim by Kuanwei Sheng
In order to help people lose weight, besides our three devices, we also have come up with many other creative ways.
Ⅰ.Short chain peptides synthesis
Recent researches have indicated that some short chain peptides in intestine have effect on inhibiting appetites, therefore decrease the food intake. We thus formed the idea that we could synthesis a DNA chain that encodes those short peptides.
Ⅱ.Biosynthesis of L-carnitine
L-carnitine is a molecule that facilitates the progress of transporting fatty acids into mitochondria where these fatty acids will be disintegrated. We once considered use L-carnitine to help the host metabolize fatty acid better. However, the biosynthesis of L-carnitine has too many derivatives or the pathway is patented by others.
Ⅲ.Xylose isomerase
Xylose is a prebiotics that can hardly be absorbed by human. We consulted many papers and find that glucose can be converted into xylose by xylose isomerase. Therefore, we thought maybe we could lower the glucose available in intestine by expressing xylose isomerase. However, this process is shown to be reversible latter. Mutated the sequence of the protein may generate high converting rate, yet it is too laborious and risky for a short time project.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"2005).  Given that the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC), which bans development, production, stockpiling and transfer of “microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic protective or other peaceful means” was undermined by the non compulsory nature of the convention, that in the Fifth Review Conference in 2001, the United States suspended the review, claiming a threat to national security from inspections and a threat to economic competition (the treaty unusually was also binding to private parties within signatory states) (U.N., 2001)  The result of this was a dismissal of the Ad Hoc Group of experts, ‘no binding protocol would be agreed upon and further talks would only concern a non-binding framework’ (de Jonge, 2006).
Given that British Defence Science Advisory Council agreed to examine ‘the military opportunities and threats arising from the field’ (my emphasis) (Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, 2008).  Given the grant from the Alfred P. Sloan (a not uncontroversial figure himself) Foundation of $570,060 to ‘explore the risks and benefits of this emerging technology, as well as possible safeguards to prevent abuse, including bioterrorism’ was to be investigated by a collective effort of M.I.T., the J. Craig Venter Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. (MIT News, 2005).  So a critical and objective review and account was to be created by the co-founder of MIT’s Synthetic Biology Working Group (and a large part of the iGEM competition), a leading research centre that has already spent years and raised millions from venture capital to exploit the new technology and the Homeland Security section of the CSIS.  Given these examples, coupled with the promoted “closer working relationships” between intelligence services and the biological sciences mentioned above and the evidence of woefully low levels of awareness of key policy concerning biosecurity amongst synthetic biologist researchers would make even recognition of potential military use/misuse of research an unlikely event to be reported. (Kelle, 2007).  These things would seem to suggest that the threat of Bioterrorism rests more with those who have put sustained political and financial backing into a range of military applications and increased deregulation of the industry than with malcontents and students.

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," the use of genetic modification in the following areas: Food Medicine Cosmetics Environment
It was clear that among the group the only widespread acceptance of genetic modification was for use in medicine. The data we gathered was consistent with expected results. In the questionnaire we also tried to identify why exactly the students disagreed with GM for the various industries. Several of the reasons included;
“There is too much uncertainty of the effects on humans and the wider effects on the environment”
“Food should be natural”
“Natural is safer”
“Could make people sick”
“Food should not contain chemicals or be modified”
“Could cause animals to have a bad life” (in reference to GM for environment)
“Someone could have an allergic reaction”
“Organic is always better”
“Because our environment is beautiful and should not be harmed”
“They (GM products) are not what they were originally meant to be”
“We already interfere enough by accident, we will cause more harm than good”
Even though the data on the first question indicates that the students did not know what synthetic biology was, our interaction with them indicated otherwise. The term synthetic biology was new, however their knowledge of genetic modification proved to be quite expansive. Most, if not all of their prior knowledge came from media controversies. There were several GM topics which sparked debate amongst the students, including dog cloning, designer babies, Hela cells and nature versus nurture
At the end of the talk we handed out questionnaires to determine what the students took from the presentation. The first question asked to the students was whether their opinion with regard to genetic modification had changed subsequent to the presentation. 80% said that their opinion had changed.
The second question asked to them was if they had found the Golden Rice video helpful in gaining an understanding of synthetic biology. 91% believed that the video was helpful.
As one of the major components of our project involves the development of a therapeutic platform for leishmaniasis vaccine we thought it would be apt to ask the students if they had heard of this NTD before presentation. 98% had not heard of leishmaniasis
We also asked the students if they had any unique ideas on how Synbio could be used to solve any societal issue (in reference to GM for food)
“Lessen the need to slaughter animals and cause less extinction” (in reference to GM for food)
“Solve world hunger” (in reference to GM for food)
“Make food taste better” (in reference to GM for medicine)

By allowing the phage to lyse the cell it resides in we expected that this would impose a fitness burden onto the lysogen population, causing it to be eventually outcompeted by the wild type toxigenic strains. This possibility was analysed and the conclusion was that despite this potential fitness cost the fact that enough of the newly replicated phages could infect wild type toxigenic strains more than compensated. This means that overall it was beneficial to retain the phages’ ability to undergo cell lysis. It was seen that allowing cell lysis fulfilled a requirement highlighted by the human practices work which was to reduce the number of medications patients must take; this was in particular found to be an issue with elderly patients. A phage which could undergo lysis and spread to toxigenic bacteria would mean that a second dose of prepared phage would not be necessary. In addition by allowing phage-induced lysis the modelling results conclude that having an initially high dosage of phage particles is not crucial. This is in contrast to when a strictly temperate phage is used as a very high initial dose is required to ensure a high enough proportion of lysogens to toxigenic strains are produced. The preparation of a high titre of phage particles was one issue raised by the experts during our human practices interviews where it was noted that preparation can be arduous and costly. The conclusion therefore was that the holin gene should be left undisturbed in the final iteration of our device.
In order to achieve our goal of engineering a toxin-suppressing phage specific to C. difficile we investigated two general approaches to gene suppression; dCas9 (CRISPRi) and antisense RNA (asRNA). Both of these approaches benefitted from knowledge of which promoters would give high expression within C. difficile. With this in mind a range of promoters were investigated, three from existing registry parts to which we added a new ribosome binding site part and four of which have been deposited into the registry as new parts entirely. The four parts we added are from three different Clostridial species. This series of promoters were assessed for expression in E. coli and in C. difficile using two separate assays. This allowed us to select two promoters which were predicted to have the highest expression levels in C. difficile to use in both the CRISPRi and asRNA approaches. Another key finding of the promoter work was that one of the new parts we added"
UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," it is important for scientists and engineers to keep in mind the people who will benefit from those advancements. Community engagement and outreach is one important mechanism assisting scientists to ensure that design is purpose-orientated and useful for the community. Open dialogue with a wide range of members from the public, academia and industry has helped our team, and can help scientists more generally, recognise alternate perspectives and values which may inform their work – which is particularly important given the variability of community values.
Considered and purposeful design is particularly important for synthetic biology-based tools, as they have the potential to cause major unforeseen damage to the global community. Research has found that many harmful products are the result of designers being unconcerned with the overlapping causes, content and consequences of their solutions1. This suggests that dangerous and unsustainable systems can be avoided by ensuring that consultation with ethics, regulation and public opinion is undertaken.
This is particularly important in an Australian context, given the steep upward trajectory of the field of synthetic biology, and Australia’s place as a significant global contender, ranking 14th globally for publications in synthetic biology-associated areas.2 Therefore, it is essential that scientists, particularly in Australia, facilitate and encourage open dialogue with the wider community to ensure they remain aware of public expectations and needs. One way to do this is by hosting seminars and research symposiums that involve a two-way exchange between audience and presenters to facilitate learning and collaboration3,4.
On the Day
With this in mind, the UNSW iGEM team hosted a symposium that gathered experts from a variety of synthetic biology-related fields, to engage in a Q&A with members of the wider community. Friends, family and colleagues were invited to listen and pose questions loosely relating to the title of the session, ‘Challenges in the Australian Innovation Landscape for Synthetic Biology’. The experts that made up the panel were:

Dundee team
We worked side by side with the Dundee collegiate team on our respective projects over the summer holidays. They were an incredible help, and by working on separate yet similar projects at the same time, we have all achieved much more than we ever could have alone; every step of the way we have been providing each other feedback and advice in order to develop wikis, presentations, surveys, graphic design and our projects as a whole. This was invaluable for both teams as it meant things were constantly being approached from multiple angles and viewpoints, allowing us to very quickly develop and move forward with our projects.
iGEM Northern UK Meet-up
We met up with the Edinburgh UG, Edinburgh OG, Glasgow, Dundee and Newcastle teams in Edinburgh for the day, where we presented our project. This was an excellent opportunity as it provided us with lots of fantastic feedback, as well as the chance to meet and chat with all the teams from Scotland (as well as one from England).
iGEM UK Meet-up
As part of our collaboration with many UK iGEM teams, we attended a meet-up hosted by the University of Westminster team in London. This meet-up allowed us to prepare ourselves and see what the Jamboree would be like as we had a poster session and a presentation slot. We received feedback on both, which allowed us to further improve on them. We were also asked some questions like “How are you going to make the RNA specific to the target bacterium?” which we were able to further elaborate on. Doing the presentation also allowed us to gain confidence because of the large audience, a big help for when Boston comes around.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Interlab_-_-_TEXT.html," a particular unit and protocol was performed.
PROTOCOL
The protocol for plate reader stated in the iGEM Headquarter was used. All details were followed except for the OD measurement and the E. coli strain in use. OD595 was employed rather than OD600 due to the limitation of the plate reader in the HKUST. E. coli strain DH10B which is highly similar to Top 10 was used.
Calibrations of the machine, EnVision multilabel reader, and the OD595 reference point were done before the measurement.
Parts and Materials
An InterLab kit was provided by the iGEM headquarter.

CONCLUSIONS
From the results obtained through the measurement, device 1 showed the highest overall green fluorescence level while device 3 showed the lowest fluorescence. This outcome was mainly due to the differences of the promoters of the three constructs. With the strongest promoter, BBa_J23101, the GFP produced by device 1 would be the highest among all three.

The end goal is to create plants that can fix their own nitrogen by moving from the cyanobacteria into the chloroplast of the plant. Endosymbiotic theory postulates that cyanobacteria are the ancestors to chloroplasts, so this is the natural progression.

The Big Picture
Haber-Bosch is so 1909
Why are we doing this project
Synthetic biology is an exciting area of research that aims to genetically improve organisms to make them more efficient and hopefully more useful to us as well. The human population in 1950 was 2.5 billion, yet it is predicted to surpass 9 billion by 2050 [2] "". Even with population growth slowing, increasing life spans and standards of living will soon tax our natural resources. One of the most concerning is our food supply. The agriculture industry needs a revolution in order to keep up with our expected growth rates. Currently about 80% of chemically fixated nitrogen is used as agricultural fertilizers, the majority in developed lands [1] . Intracellular nitrogen fixation in crops could help to sustain the burgeoning world population, especially in areas with less fertile soil without taxing the planet’s waterways. The exponential increase in nitrogen fertilizer has led to more runoff into rivers and oceans. Fertilizers then provide nutrition for algal blooms that result in hypoxia and form oceanic dead zones. These dead zones lead to the death of marine species and have potentially large economic consequences.                                  The ramifications of nitrogen fertilizer runoff can be averted by genetically engineering plant crops to fix their own nitrogen. Some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen for nutritional needs, while most organisms can only acquire it from the food it consumes. Synthetic biology allows us to transfer this ability to fix nitrogen to a heterologous host that has many genetic tools, Escherichia coli, so that we can learn how to give single cell organisms, and eventually chloroplasts the ability to create their own nitrogen fertilizer.                                  Diazotrophic (organisms that fix nitrogen) cyanobacteria such Nostoc Punctiforme or Anabaena use heterocysts (specialized nitrogen fixing cells) to create a mini-anaerobic environment to aid nitrogen fixation. However, Cyanothece "

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

The Team
The DTU iGEM Team 2015 is composed of a group of ten motivated DTU students dedicated to exploring and sharing their passion for science. The team includes both Bachelor and Master students with a diverse set of nationalities and educational backgrounds in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Pharmaceutical engineering and Computer Sciences. Many of the team members are highly engaged in internationally recognized research groups, leading biotech companies or student organizations, where they have obtained valuable competences within science, programming, project management and communication.  Our team is unified by the shared goal of providing significant achievements within the field of synthetic biology.
The project officially started with an introductory iGEM meeting in January, facilitated by our supervisor Chris Workman. From then on our team met weekly with idea development until Mads and Pernille, came up with our project idea. Many months of project planning, fundraising, lab work and coding have lead to the product we now present for you. All laboratory work and presented activities documented on this wiki were performed by our team members and the three high school students unless stated otherwise.
We would like to thank our advisors who assisted us during the whole project and have provided invaluable advice and feedback. We would also express our thanks to everyone else who has supported us over the course project! Thank you for your expertise, facilities and materials. A full list of attributions can be seen below.

Aim Restriction analysis of pHIPZ7-Zcas to confirm correct integration of fragment
Isolate plasmids from the overnight cultures of colonies corresponding to lane 1 and 11 of the pHIPZ7-Zcas colony PCR using a plasmid miniprep kit.
See Restriction analysis protocol . EcoRI and SpeI are the restriction enzymes used.
Results
Lane 1 and 2 contain negative controls. Lane 4 and 5 contain restricted pHIPZ7-Zcas. Restricting the plasmid with EcoRI and SpeI should give a fragment of 2 kB and 1300 bp. Lane 5 shows the desired bands, but the intensity of the upper band is higher than the lower band. This could mean that the colony consist of 2 different transformants.

Aim Transformation of pRS313-Hxt7-PAL2 and pRS313-Hxt7-PAL3+pYD1-CipA3-EGII+pRS425-CBHII-BGL1 into YPH499
Even though the restriction analysis on the 2 positive colony PCR hits was negative the plasmids are still transformed into YPH499. This is because a positive colony PCR was only possible when the insert was integrated into the plasmid, due to the selection of primers. Both positive hits are transformed individually and together with the cellulase plasmids.
See high efficiency yeast transformation protocol . 200 ng of each plasmid is used for transformation. See Verduyn protocol . Verduyn plates with URA, LYS and ADE are used for transformation of the triple plasmid combo. Verduyn plates with URA, LYS, ADE, TRP and LEU are used for transformation of pRS313-Hxt7-PAL2.

SCUT-ChinaA,2018,Team:SCUT-ChinaA#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"otechnology Research Institute is the first in the world to realize the full bio-production of L-alanine and industrialization. The production cost and energy consumption are reduced by more than 40% compared with the traditional process, and the wastewater volume is reduced by 90%. As of June 2017, the technology has added an additional value of 500 million yuan to Huaheng Bio, with a foreign exchange of 40 million US dollars, and the international market share of products exceeded 70%, which led to the formation of a new industrial chain of alanine chemical industry. For example, the Institute of Physics and Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has strong enzymatic gelatin technology and industrialization advantages. The enzymatic gelatin technology developed by it has shortened the production cycle from 50 to 60 days to less than 3 days, and the water consumption per ton of glue is 400~ 600 tons reduced to 200 tons, the product with a freezing strength of 200Bloom g or more is increased from 50% to 60% of the traditional alkali process to 100%, the production workshop area is reduced by 30%, the labor consumption is reduced by 10%, and the production cost per ton of rubber Reduce by 10%. In September 2016, the technology was put into operation in Ningxia Xinhaoyuan Biotechnology Co., Ltd., which realized the production of 3,000 tons/year. It marks that China's self-developed enzymatic bone gelatin production technology has undergone pilot and industrial demonstrations. Commercial operation stage.
At present, China's economic development has entered a new normal, and is in the stage of growth rate change, structural optimization and power transformation. With the tightening of land, energy, resources and environmental constraints, the growth rate has shifted from high speed to medium and high speed. At the same time, the structural supply and demand of China's real economy is unbalanced. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to cultivate new growth drivers. With the implementation of the “five in one” overall layout and the “four comprehensive” strategic layout, the development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing has been deepened, and the structural reform of the supply side has been gradually promoted, whether it is bulk fermentation. The upgrading of the industry, or the embedded application of the chemical industry, must be implemented as a key task of “going capacity, reducing costs, and supplementing short boards”.
At present, China's large-scale fermentation products such as amino acids, vitamins and organic acids rank first in the world; bioenergy replaces"

Modelling
The questions which the modelling team set out to answer were inspired by the questions the wetlab groups were asking. We had to select a reporter enzyme that would be effective and durable for our lateral flow strip system. As we scrutinized how reporters, the detector, and other biological devices could merge together in our sensor, we realized these modular protein components could be assembled in many configurations. We were eager to learn the optimal configuration in which they could be combined to be most effective in our prototype so that we could inform the direction of our experiments in the wetlab. We aimed to understand how the system would work so that we could develop the best system possible to impact the lives of those this system could impact.
To reduce the number of wet lab experiments to develop our sensor, we followed a two-pronged modelling approach to help answer our questions. First, we used spatial models in Autodesk Maya in which we assembled and animated 3D protein structures for insight into their function in the prototype. Also, we analyzed the kinetic properties of several common reporter enzymes, culminating in our selection of two novel reporters. Finally, we deployed a quantitative Mathematica prototype model to test how amounts of target DNA versus detector proteins would influence sensitivity of our lateral flow strip, and a Scilab differential model to predict how our final system would function.

Tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (Tris) is an organic compound extensively used in biochemistry and molecular biology experiments as a component of buffer solutions, such as in Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) and Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, especially for solutions of nucleic acids.
Although Tris is considered as a low-toxic reagent, long-term exposure may still lead to potential threats through skin and breath. Thus, gloves and eye protectors are recommended.
Paraformaldehyde (PFA) is the smallest polyoxymethylene with a typical degree of polymerization of 8C100 units. PFA commonly has a slight odor of formaldehyde due to decomposition. Once paraformaldehyde is depolymerized, the resulting formaldehyde may be used as a fumigant, disinfectant, fungicide, and fixative. The applications of PFA include production of polyoxymethylene plastic (POM or Delrin), root canal treatment, etc. PFA is widely used in organic chemistry labs for various synthetic reactions.
PFA is not a fixative; it must be depolymerized to formaldehyde in solution and kept in sealed containers at a temperature between 2 and 8oC.
It's widely accepted that PFA is a strong carcinogen which is mainly absorbed through skin. It is also irritating to eyes, respiratory system and skin. Thus, lab workers should wear suitable protective clothing, gloves and eye/face protectors and work in fume hoods. In case of contact with eyes, one should rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical treatment.
Phenol is widely used in laboratory for its high efficiency in extraction of DNA and RNA. However, this reagent is also highly corrosive to eyes, skin, and respiratory system, leading to burning, allergy reaction or dermatitis. Inhalation or exposure of high concentration of phenol may lead to some diseases in nervous and cardiac system. Besides, long-term exposure to phenol is also toxic to liver or kidney due to both hydrophobicity and the formation of phenoxyl radicals.
According to its toxicity, careful protection is required when operating phenol reagents, such as thick gloves, protection suits and eyes protectors. In case of contact with skin, polyethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol or plenty of water should be immediately rinsed before seeking for further medical treatment"

Synopsis
Every year millions of dollars’ worth of produce is damaged, lost, or never produced due to frosts. Frost causes the plant’s new tips and buds to be damaged due to the formation of ice crystals within the tissues, rupturing cells. As a result, new plant and fruit growth are severely inhibited. The majority of producers still utilise costly, and often ineffective, traditional methods of frost avoidance. Creating inherently Frost-Resistant crops will increase yields and will allow farmers access to crops previously unable to be grown in certain regions.
Project
Overview
Market Pain: What market problem does this technology solve?
Currently, many industries in agriculture suffer large crop losses due to snap frosts. This project has the potential to reduce frost damage to existing crops and introduce crops which cannot be used due to threat from frosts.
Solution: How does the technology solve this problem?
We can provide the technology which could be developed into future frost resistance crops. Growers will have higher yields, increasing supply, reducing costs for consumers and increasing profits for growers. Growers in regions with frequent frosts would also have increased access to crops previously off limits. These mechanisms will be intrinsic to the crops so while solving the frost problem this also reduces the reliance growers have on alternative mechanisms of frost protection.
Potential Applications: Potential applications for the technology.
Crops which are currently susceptible to frost, especially those relevant to New Zealand’s economy such as Grapes, Kiwifruit, and Stonefruit. Other applications include crops currently not grown in large volumes in New Zealand due to the difficulty with climate including papaya and bananas. It is possible that this technology could be applied to non-human crops such as cow feed to aid in feed shortages during winter.
Project Budget: How much will this portion of the project cost.
We have raised $21,000 to fund this portion of the project
Estimated time to market: When is it likely available for sale.
5-7 years to first crop. A further 2-4 years for crops under human consumption.
Project
Plan
Project outcomes: The target outcomes of this project.
This portion of the project is a pilot study investigating frost resistant mechanisms. The target of this portion of the project is to characterise frost resistance mechanisms to see if"

We were welcomed warmly by the local iGEM team and built up our tent while enjoying the marvelous weather. Naturally we brought a typical hospitality gift for a Düsseldorf team – top-fermented dark beer.
After being divided into colourful smaller groups we had to corporately master some tasks in the city, including drinking a “rusty nail” - a typical shot of the city and a hot tip for anyone visiting Marburg.
On Saturday, the projects were presented after a great breakfast and the teams could get to know the projects after getting to know each other the day before. After the presentations a grand bubble soccer tournament was held – the only competitive event on a very cooperative weekend.      After a tasty barbecue we went to the city again to party the whole night.
It was a very nice weekend! Getting to know all the teams and their projects, socializing and making friends is a really great part of the iGEM experience.
Many thanks to the iGEM team Marburg for superbly organizing the weekend and for making it possible to get to know everyone!

However, they may also be due to systematic error of the fluorometer.
Figure 2: Fluorescence variation in blank wells at 42ºC
Variation in fluorescence
28ºC
Table 1 shows the raw values for fluorescence. Again, this was done for different blank values (for more details see the raw data file)
Table 1: Fluorescence results over time at 28 ºC
At 28 ºC, we can clearly see that the fluorescence is repressed, relative to the constitutive promoter (positive control).
The blue line is low, and fluorescence output is low. Therefore, the promoter is repressing downstream genes.
Figure 3: Fluorescence at 28 ºC
42ºC
Table 2: Fluorescence results at 42ºC
In figure we can observe that fluorescence levels drift towards a steady state and are no longer low (as in the 28 ºC case).
This plot starts at a value of 4000 fluorescence units because the cultures were shifted from 28 ºC to 42 ºC overnight.
In figure 5 we have accounted for the effects of evaporation (as it happens due to an increase in temperature) so we can now see the positive control at a relatively constant level. This was not the case in figure 4, where evaporation was not taken into account. This, as mentioned earlier, could also be the reason of variation in the blank results.
There is a clear difference with teh 28 ºC case, showing that indeed, at higher temperatures the downstream genes from the promoter are no longer repressed.
Figure 4: Fluorescence results at 42 degrees
Figure 5: Fluorescence results at 42 degrees (corrected for effect of evaporation)
Conclusion
The characterization of the thermoinducible promoter is as follows:
At 28 ºC, we cannot observe any fluorescence (GFP) output because its expression is repressed
At 42 ºC, we can observe an increase in fluorescence (GFP) output, as its expression is no longer repressed
Hence, we can conclude that in the E.ncapsulator system, an increase in temperature de-represses the expression of downstream genes, which trigger the genome deletion phase.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," translation of gene to continue from one biobrick to another. However, by joining biobricks scar DNA sequences, containing STOP codon TAG are incorporated. To overcome this problem, additional T nucleotide was added at the 3’ end toehold sequence. This additional nucleotide, together with a longer version of biobrick prefix sequence (gaattcgcggccgcttctagag) on the downstream gene block part are combined to allow the translation to continue from the toehold riboregulatory part to the controlled biobrick part as depicted in, for example BBa_K2621035 .
We have then tested our re-designed Toehold Switch and its RNA trigger by ligating them next to a CAT-Seq Esterase gene. We have also used the same Toehold switch with different RNA trigger as a control of part orthogonality. After the constructs were built, we have spectrophotometrically assessed the production of Esterase. The reaction kinetics were measured using the spectrophotometer as a decrease of absorbance at 310 nm due to the hydrolysis of substrate nucleotides
Using cell-free protein expression assay, the construct housing our Toehold switch and the correct Trigger RNA successfully synthesized the Esterase enzyme, as the hydrolysis of substrate nucleotides was catalyzed. The orthogonality control did not produce any changes in absorbance, and in turn we could conclude that our toehold switch is controlling the translation effectively.
Figure 1. The catalytic activity of each Toehold:Trigger RNA construct matrix
CAT-Seq Esterase mutant sequences were placed downstream the riboregulatory sequences with corresponding trigger part and they catalytic activity was measured. The decrease of absorbance corresponds to catalytically active enzyme. The graph shown as a matrix concludes that only Toehold sequences expressed with their corresponding Trigger RNA produce an active enzyme molecule.
Experimental validation of the CAT-Seq Esterase Mutants
After carefully selecting the mutations in-silico, we have synthesized and measured the Activity of those Esterase mutants in the laboratory. The mutations have successfully altered the activity of the original Esterase. Also, there were no cases of complete inactivation of enzyme catalytic activity.

Conclusions
We have improved an existing toehold switch in the biobrick registry BBa_K2486176 that was actually a composite part consisting of toehold regulated RBS sequence and a Green Fluorescence Protein ("

Could you formulate a universal principle to deal with complexity?
A concept that has been followed in empirical science for the last years is trying to reduce complexity to simple circumstances.
What do you think of the approach of reductionism?
In empirical sciences up to now this approach can register success. The approach has two sides. One of them is top down, the reductionism. There we reduce a phenomenon to a simple fact.  We assume that a complex system is nothing but the sum of its parts, and that an account of it can be reduced to accounts of individual constituents.
This is followed by bottom-up where we try to explain the complex phenomenon sufficiently. If the bottom-up and the top-down approaches are in harmony a phenomenon is acceptably explained.
In the past this model has proven itself in technological implementations. We came from a simple model of communication to mobile phones, computers and even airplanes flying.  The strategy has worked as long as the human consciousness has not been part of the scientific investigation. Here the book “The view from nowhere” written by Thomas Nagel in 1989 comes to my mind. There he discusses Objectivity, Subjectivity, and how they relate. Already the philosopher René Descartes has dealt with the problem of subject and object. If we want to get the most adequate image of an object we have to remove all the subjectivity from our description.
Do you see a correlation between increasing experience of life and complexity?
For me personally the privilege of being young is the ability to be unbiased und open-minded. There is plenty of time and many occasions to be taken by surprise by the world. Becoming older means having already encountered more situations, having more experience, one starts to observe reoccurring motifs. Motifs in actions as well as motifs of thoughts. You become more aware that multiple factors might be responsible for the outcome of a situation.
Where in your leisure time do you encounter complexity?
I have been dealing with the famous body-mind problem for a long time now. On one hand we have scientific facts about the brain and its development and the communication within complex processes delivered by neurobiology.  On the other hand we have the subjective way of describing processes occurring in our mind. The latter leads to a description in the first form singular where we have the means of language to describe processes of the mind.  For"

Chemical structure of polymerized polyamide formed from pABA
Results
We attempted to introduce PabA and PabB into E. coli using the Biobrick part BBa_K909014 from the 2015 iGEM DNA Distribution Kit. From that, we planned to extract these genes in order to linearize them and combine them with the gene PabC through Gibson Assembly. However, our colony polymerase chain reactions (CPCR) of our transformed colonies were ~300 base pairs (bp) when we used the primers VF2 and VR, but we expected the plasmid to be approximately 2,700 bp. In empty pSB1C3 plasmid, the amplified region, using primers VF2 and VR, would be approximately 300 bp. After performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing the plasmid part, we confirmed that the plasmid was empty and could not be used for this crucial part of our project. In Figure 1, lanes 5 and 6 are 2 colonies picked from the transformation with BBa_K909014. Lanes 9 and 10 is NEB 2-Log DNA Ladder . The green arrow indicates the desired band size (~2,000-3,000 bp) and the red arrow indicates the actual band size (~300 bp).
Figure 1:  Gel Electrophoresis Results of Cells Transformed with BBa_K909014 after CPCR
To implement more copies of DAHP enzyme into E. coli, we used BBa_K1060000 . When we performed CPCR, we had a product of band size ~1,000bp, as shown in lane 8 and by the blue arrow of Figure 1. According to the BioBrick page, the product should be 1,053 bp. This was promising; however when we sequenced it, the results did not overlap with the published sequence.

BBa_K2848001 is a combination of chitin synthase NodC and chitin deacetylase COD to produce chitosan in E. coli. The part was created based on BBa_K2380002 (NodC created by Team Darmstadt 2017) by inserting our improved version of the COD, BBa_K2848001 . A particular property of this composite part is that both coding regions are under the control of promoters which are induced by different molecules. The NodC is controlled by an arabinose inducible promoter and the COD is controlled by an IPTG incucible T7 promoter. This allows sequential expression of the two proteins which might be advantegeous since the final product, a chitosan-pentamer, has antimicrobial effects.

This was a weekend filled with lectures, workshops and fun challenges. During the weekend, we also worked in teams of 2-3 students (from different iGEM-teams) and tried to make Biobricks. During our stay in Denmark, we also had a chance to explore the campus of DTU and their student life and look how fun we had!
Date: 18/6-20/6 - 2018
Dear Diary,
What a week! The past three days have involved a lot mashed kiwi fruits, lots of exploded filters and a bunch of wonderful teens interested in science. This is a summary of our experience of “Sommarveckan”.
We had very fun, most teens were enthusiastic and interested in the experiment we did and it felt appreciated that we actually tried to make it fun. Because that was one of the main purposes of these days: to have fun and learn something in the same time! Who does not love to crush fruits and them mix them ethanol? It basically like candy crush in real life (with the addition of alcohol"
Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," point mutations into further consideration, we implemented a machine learning based tool to compute the change of change of Gibbs free energy (ddG) between a tuple of considered amino acid exchanges.
Background
The ddG values for proteins are computed from the Gibbs free energy difference between their unfolded and folded state before and after the respective point mutation. A ddG value of less than 0 indicates, that the inspected mutation causes destabilizations within the protein structure. Contrary, a value bigger than 0 indicates that the mutation may even increase the structural solidity. A ddG of 0 indicates no change in the protein's stability.
Machine-Learning-Model
Our machine-learning algorithm is based on gradient boosted trees from the python library XGBoost. Using XGBoost's implementation of gradient boosted trees regression we trained on the S2648 dataset obtained from ProTherm, a thermodynamic database for Proteins and Mutants. The dataset features 2648 datapoints containing: the PDB ID, the wild type amino acid, its chain and position, the mutation amino acid, the PH and temperature at the time of measurement and finally the ddG value for the amino acid exchange. All amino acids were encoded using the blomap introduced in MHCBoost's encoding of amino acids with a few modifications. Our feature encoding was expanded to include the number of neighbours in contact with the currently encoded amino acid and its secondary structure type encoded in three bits (helix(010), sheet(100), or none(001)). Residue neighbours were labeled as such if they weren't directly linked and if their sidechains were less than seven angstroms away from each other. It all in all amounted to a feature vector length of fourteen (5 per blomap, 1 for neighbourcount, 3 for secondary structure).
Figure 5: Feature vector used to train XGBRegression-class (yellow = blomap old residue, red = blomap new residue, green = number of neighbours, blue = secondary structuretype)
Training the learning algorithm on eighty percent of a set with 2648 datapoints, allowed us to test our regression on the remaining twenty percent (529 datapoints). Evaluating the first results we decided to remove the five datapoints with the highest ddG-value since heavily skewed the average of values. They likely result from measuring errors and impact machine learning algorithms to a large degree. Moreover, analogous to the reasoning given in MHCBoost, we explored and optimized hyperparameters using randomized-search and subsequently grid-search (Table 3).

Additional Background Information
Genomically Recoded E. coli
Whole-genome recoding was reported for the first time in 2011 by a team including our advisor, Professor Farren Isaacs, when it described replacing all TAG codons in E. coli by TAA. 9 Both TAG and TAA are stop codons (amber and ochre), but their transcripts are bound by different release factors (RF1 binds UAG and UAA, whereas RF2 binds UAA and UGA), not only making this recoding nonlethal but also allowing the deletion of RF1 (ΔprfA) from the recoded strain, given RF2’s response to both remaining stop codons.
This genome-wide recoding was enabled by lambda-Red recombineering10 and multiplex automated genome engineering. 11 lambda-Red recombineering uses the lambda prophage’s protein Beta to mediate the homologous recombination of an exogenous single-stranded oligonucleotide, delivered into the cell by electroporation, with the host genome, by annealing that oligonucleotide to single-stranded genomic DNA exposed on the lagging strand of the replication fork. 12 A 30-bp region of homology at either end of a sequence is sufficient to drive recombination of the entire strand, including mismatched regions, and mismatches thus incorporated are passed to progeny at high efficiency (up to 30%) in strains lacking methyl-directed mismatch repair (ΔmutS).13
Multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) using lambda-Red recombineering can then make many directed mutations across the host genome, as was necessary to replace all 314 TAG codons in the strain EcNR2 (E. coli MG1655 ΔmutS::cat Δ(ybhB-bioAB)::[λcI857 Δ(cro-ea59)::tetR-bla]).9 To allow recombineering, the lambda prophage was introduced into the host genome by P1 transduction. Because the probability of each target sequence being mutated in a given cycle is at most 30%, attempting to introduce all 314 mutations using a single pool of 314 mutagenic oligonucleotides would much sooner generate any of ~2314 other partially recoded strains before the fully recoded strain, and running enough MAGE cycles to obtain that strain"

As with any scientific method or technique that is seen as interfering with nature, molecular and cellular cloning has endured decades of debate.  This is because many people, including scientists, believe it must be a priority that a procedure can be first and foremost implemented without risk to humans, and then as well to other animals and the environment. The main issue, is that the progression of science should not be used as an excuse to abuse or rampantly exploit any organisms on earth.  In response to this concern, many guidelines and policies have been drafted in order to ensure that safe practices are employed in laboratory settings worldwide. Additionally, it is forbidden by law, in most countries, to violate any of the regulations.
Animal cloning emerged randomly as a result of experiments that focused on determining which types of cells were required to clone animals. The first cloned animals were Northern Leopard Frogs in 1952 (1).  Soon after, plants began to be cloned at an increasing rate. The major breakthrough in the cloning of animals was the cloning of Dolly, a sheep.  This came about as a result of the progress made in SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) technology. Dolly’s birth created much heated debate and discussion as this raised many ethical concerns regarding the eventuality of human cloning (1). The cloning of animals has not been perfected as evidence suggests that Dolly the sheep was only “conceived” after more than 300 attempts (1).  This is compounded by the fact that Dolly had to be euthanized early in her short life due to health problems.  Despite the great advances in scientific technology and its techniques, the perfection of cloning is still in the distant future.  The greatest moral issue seems to be that if it takes 300 attempts to achieve success, is it relevant to continue research on animal cloning, despite the evidence of such failure?  In response to such issues, scientists who perform research on rats and other mammals are forbidden from conducting research in which the organisms are willingly killed or mutilated (2).  This indicates that great strides have been made in dealing with the ethics of right and wrong when conducting scientific research.
In the laboratory, bacterial microorganisms propagate through asexual reproduction and once scientists discovered this, they begun to formulate questions about this unique way to reproduce.  Currently, bacteria’s ability to rapidly reproduce asexually is exploited in laboratories all around the world.  Bacteria have proven to be a valuable resource in their capacity as model organisms in research, and their use has been well documented and studied to ensure"

Blog #4 - We are approved!
By AZimmermann 11:00, May 4 2014 (CDT)
Hello iGEM enthusiasts,
we are more than happy to finally be able to announce that our application has been finally approved by the iGEM headquarters. Now nothing will stand between us and our journey towards the giant Jamboree at the end of October!
This will bring a few changes towards especially this site. With the approval we now have access to our own wiki website hosted on the iGEM servers. We will migrate all our previous content towards this site in the next weeks. This will include everyhting already posted on here. As soon as we have finished preparing the full migration you will automatically be redirected, so you do not need to remember a different website for all your IGEM Aachen information.
As soon as the migrations has been completed you will also find all the details you need to know about our project we have been teasing about the past weeks on facebook and twitter. So stay tuned!
The project has been progressing nicely in part due to the awesome iGEM Kits provided by NEB:
NEB you are awesome!
Also as always you can follow us on Facebook or Twitter for more information and a look behind the scenes.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Results-content_-_-_TEXT.html," of safety issues this might be prevented by further coating of the beads, for example by adding polyethylene diamine. This was done by the iGEM Team Paris Bettencourt for their project in 2012 [5].
Figure 4: Standardized relative survival rates of E. cowli encapsulated in alginate beads and in the supernatant
In conclusion, non-encapsulated E. cowli does not seem to be able to grow in rumen fluid (Figure 1) . However, bacteria immobilized in alginate beads showed a higher survival rate possibly due to a better nutrition supply [6]. The alginate matrix hypothetically protects the bacteria from ciliates feeding on them [2]. Moreover, the beads are easier to administer to the animal in comparison to a bacterial suspension. One could also consider modifications of the alginate beads, for example by including a buffer substance providing an appropriate pH value (see modeling ) which does not inhibit growth of the cells. Another possible supplement is paraffin oil which has been shown to increase methane uptake and could thus also be incorporated into the beads [7]. Furthermore, the beads could be produced using a common growth medium providing the cells with nutrients.

Biosensor Competing Technologies
Microtox® CTM - The Microtox® Continuous Monitoring (CTM) system allows for on-line autonomous monitoring for 4 weeks without requiring maintenance, and will take continuous readings of toxicity levels in an environmental site. We believe that the method by which this technology has accomplished this continuous monitoring using live bacteria could be something that our system could be adapted to in the future. As well, other methods are being explored theoretically in order to adapt our system so that it can provide the same complement to the Microtox® technology that the portable version provides. The continuous monitoring system answers a call specifically to the requirement for long-term monitoring of sample sites. Our technology provides a solution for rapid spot-testing rather than continuous systems.
DeltaTox®II and ToxTrackP - Both of these systems are portable methods for general detection of toxins in the environment. These are direct competitors to our product line and hold a stake within the global general toxin sensing market. Market adoption of our technology will be critical in achieving our product success. Our system provides several key advantages over these systems including a fast response, more reliable reads, and decreased cost.
Portable Analytical Devices
Portable GC/MS, HPLC, and FTIR Systems - These technologies for portable sensing using traditional analytical methods are also being developed, as well as smaller systems for easier analysis. However, we believe that cost and ease of use of these systems will continue to be a barrier to their widespread use in field testing applications. This has been seen in the market since many of these technologies have not been widely utilized by industry.
Emerging Technologies
In addition to this direct monitoring technology, other means of collecting samples over time are being developed. SPMDs (Semi‐Permeable Membrane Device) are composed of a membrane lined with a thin film of lipid, and are put onto a metal frame to be deployed into the environment. These devices will be deployed into water systems in order to capture the bioavailable, lipophilic pollutants present. Contaminants that can be captured by such a system belong to hydrophobic classes of chemicals (aliphatic hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons). These compounds are capable of penetrating and disrupting cell membranes, and often cause acute and chronic toxic effects to wildlife.
Another system known as POCIS (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler) will be used to capture polar, hydrophilic, water soluble toxins. This system is composed of microporous polyethersulfone membranes, between which a solid absorbent compound is held."

Aims of the Week
With the presentation to UCL next Monday, we have many aims to complete this week. We need to complete a first draft of the presentation, and make matching t-shirts for the team. We would like to complete our new DIYbio plans, especially as last week we managed to book a lab space for the event. After last weekends excursion to Bournemouth to collect sands samples, we also hope we will find time to analyse the sand for plastic pollution. Carina is working hard to finish her 3D model, so we will have a something tangible for our presentation, and she also plans on finishing designs for the wiki homepage and our poster. In the lab we aim to carry out curli characterization with congo red and nuclease characterisation with DNAse, culturing marine bacteria Oceanibulbus indolifex and generating a new bank of competent cells. Finally, for modelling we want to generate model that shows how irrE gene, for salt tolerance, influences e coli metabolism.

Tn5 protein functionality testing 3: integration assay
Integration assay was performed to test the integration of adapter DNA by Tn5.
The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

From previous result, we learned that:
High amount of glycerol might be needed for integration since previous experiment without glycerol did not result in any integration.
Since finally Tn5 has to function together with dxCas9, we will try to do the reaction in lower temperature, since dxCas9 might be denatured at 55°C.Therefore, in this experiment, the adapter loading and integration experiment will be done in one go, at 37°C for 2 hours.
New adapter will be used, which has ME sequence on both sides to test whether this type of integration (integration without splitting the fragment into two) would work better.
The reaction was done following the pipetting scheme shown on Table 2. All samples and reagents were kept on ice during preparation.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.

Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

In more case, iGEM teams wrote down sentences in a straight-forward, affirmative voice, leaving no room for more consideration and thinking. In other     words, though there may be many factors contribute to one phenomenon, for many time we hesitate if we should consider an article as “there is no     attribution of responsibility provided” or “There is one attribution of responsibility provided.”
2. The exclusion of school education. In this research, we won’t and are unable to investigate the effectiveness of school education, though it is the most     important part of laying down the scientific knowledge basis for our society.
3. The limit to audience. In this research, we assume that the information is transferred and translated to general public with basic knowledge about     science, the so-called educated layman. Besides, the target audience of newspaper, journal and iGEM wiki diverse form each other, making the comparison     invalid to get important information form analysis.
For iGEMers who are interested in social research, here are some dilemma we encounter:
i. Hard to consider the difficulty of a technical term
A. Gene technology-related term:
Understanding of understand a term may vary.
Take CRISPR/Cas9 for example, many college students may have heard of it, but to what degree do they know about CRISPR/Cas9? When we consider restriction     enzyme as high school level gene technology-related term, some, or to say, many high school students may not actually understand how this protein works.     And to know how restriction enzyme works is beyond what undergraduate have to know.
B. Not gene technology-related term:
Take 2013 iGEM Colombia Uniandes wiki for example:
It is widely accepted that exposure to stressors increases secretion of glucocorticoids, cortisol, and corticosterone in a wide variety of gnathostome         vertebrates (Stephens, 1980) (Greenberg et al, 1987). Research in animals, have demonstrated that allostatic overload of this hormones and other         mediators, resulting from chronic stress, causes atrophy of neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex; brain regions involved in memory,         selective attention and executive function; likewise, it causes hypertrophy of neurons in the amygdala, the brain region involved in fear and anxiety         as well as aggression (McEwen, 2004).
We say understandability is highly related to difficulty of terminology. In this project, we look into gene tech related terminology which is an important     part in accessing the understandability of a"

Introduction
In the modeling part, we decide to prove that using NASBA to amplify the circulating tumor DNA is necessary and to estimate the optimal concentration of the circulating tumor DNA for detection.
The influence of cell free DNA on the effectiveness of the detection device:
In real physiological environment of the plasma, there are many factors influencing the effectiveness of dcas9 protein binding with the targeted DNA sequence (EML4-ALK), the most prominent one of which is cell free DNA. Cell free DNAs come from apoptosis and necrosis of normal cells and may include gene EML4 and gene ALK, which are potential ligands bind with dcas9 protein and lead to a decrease of the effective concentration of NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 protein. The effective concentration is referred as the concentration of NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 which bind to the target sequence (EML4-ALK fusion gene), leading to one DNA molecule bears both NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 to enable the transcription of report gene. In order to determine the magnitude of the influence from the cell free DNAs on the effectiveness of split-T7-dcas9 in binding with EML4-ALK, the following model is made. Assumption that NT7-dcas9 binds with sequence of EML4 and CT7-dcas9 binds with sequence of ALK is made in the formula.
As shown in the formula above, given the total concentration of NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9, the effective concentration of NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 decreases as the concentration of cell free DNA increase. In real physiological environment of plasma, the concentration of cell free DNAs is seven orders of magnitude larger than the concentration of circulating tumor DNAs. Therefore, it can be assumed that d[EML4] and d[ALK] approach to infinity. Hence, in this scenario, the change in effective concentration of NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 is equal to negative infinity, revealed as no signal emitted even if EML4-ALK fusion"
UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Human Practices#Commercialisation_-_-_TEXT.html," important factor during synthesis (e.g. Taxol side-chain synthesis and Astaxanthin synthesis) directed our approach to future applications from that point on.
This directed our conversation at the  symposium that we hosted, where we asked the audience for their opinion on which area they would like to see advanced by synthetic biology tools. As 46% of the respondents voted for pharmaceutical applications, we decided to make Taxol our preferred commercial case study. Following this decision, we analysed the enzymes involved in Taxol side-chain synthesis with our modelling to determine the theoretical increase in product titre which could occur from Assemblase enzyme scaffolding. We also designed the gBlocks that would be required to integrate the Taxol enzymes into our project, but did not have the time to experimentally validate this section of work. We have put the effort into designing these experiments for future teams to continue, so that they will be able to pick up from where we left off.
Outcomes
IAA is not a commercially viable application of our Assemblase system but remains a good model to demonstrate the effect of our scaffold on multi-step enzymatic reactions.
The potential of our scaffold to generate high-value pharmaceutical products more efficiently could attract investors.
One example of an enzymic biosynthesis where our scaffold could be used is the Taxol-side chain biosynthesis pathway, a process producing an expensive but very useful molecule. The case-study of taxol may help interest and explain to industry (and investors) the potential benefits of using our scaffold, given the large commercial and social benefits of lowering the cost of producing this important anti-cancer therapeutic.
The commercialisation landscape in Australia means that a large amount of effort would be required to refine our Assemblase scaffold into a commercial product - but the right synthesis pathway and appropriate intellectual property protections could attract investment regardless.

3.      We can deliver continuous operation. Currently,             any perchlorate reduction system uses batch processes. In our system, the             astronaut can immediately use the purified Martian soil.
The reasons             above illustrate why our project has a significant potential for             entrepreneurship. We have no competition on Mars, because we are at the             bleeding edge of science. We are the first group in the world to develop a             biological system for breaking down perchlorate on Mars. Due to the             microgravity experiments we ran, we are also able to guarantee that our             bacteria behave in the same fashion as on Earth.
 
Business             on Earth
Before we are             able to send our bacterium to Mars, we need to make a proof of principle on             Earth. If we can demonstrate that we are able to solve perchlorate-related             issues on Earth, space agencies will be convinced about our potential on Mars.             In The Netherlands, there is a lot of interest for the application of space             technology on Earth. This process is called ""downstream technology"". An example             is using spectrometers found in satellites to detect whether vegetables are             ripe. During a meeting with the ESA Business Incubator, they were in ecstasy             about the potential our system has for downstream technology. They have invited             us to continue our project -in the shape of a company- in their business incubation             track. The Leiden Bio Science Park has also invited us to participate in such a             track. As of now, we are considering what would the best choice. The Science             Park has a lot more support for life science companies, while the ESA knows a             lot more about aerospace engineering. Besides these partners, a local venture             capital firm called ""Innovation Quarter"" wants us to pitch for investors to             qualify for investments. These are not even the most exciting negotiations we""ve             had. On September 29th, we""ve pitched our business case for a large group of             Russian, Japanese, American and Chinese investors. That week, there was a forum             for large-scale investments in The Netherlands. For more information, see the             official letter for the Russian trade mission: https://www.arccom.org/second-annual-conference/agenda/ . The host of             the forum contacted us to pitch for the investors. This group of investors was             especially interested in biotechnology, and they were delighted to hear about             our project.

For our project, we had an opportunity to partner up with Healios, a biotech company in Japan that works in the field of stem cell regenerative medicine. The CEO of the company, Dr. Kagimoto, gave us insights on how we can integrate this new field of stem cells to our project. One idea of how this may work is to take patient derived stem cell, fix the gene, then place it back so that it would regenerate in the human body in the right location. Since this year, we were able to confirm that CRISPR Cas9 works on fixing the mutation of the disease in a living system, we are hoping to develop our project further in the future to ultimately apply CRISPR Cas9 on animal, and eventually human stem cells. In fact, there was a recent paper written by Chu-Qing Song and Dan Wang that was  published in August this year that already demonstrated this proof of concept in a murine model, a mammalian system. Promising results like these further validate the potential of gene therapy in treating patients of A1AT Deficiency along with range of other mutational diseases.
Contact with Dr. Seyama
August 14, 2018
Another expert we were able to contact was Dr. Seyama, who is a researcher on A1AT Deficiency in Juntendo University in Japan. What he provided us was further insight on A1AT Deficiency itself especially regarding the mechanism and progression of the disease as well as the current clinical treatment applied to patients. This kind of insight helped us reinforce our understanding on why a treatment using CRISPR Cas9 and stem cell would be more beneficial compared to the treatment we have as of now.
Advice from Tokyo Tech and Gifu iGEM team
August 14, 2018
During the summer, we had an opportunity to attend the Tokyo Tech meetup, where many iGEM teams from across Japan gathered to share each other's project. During this meetup, we were able to get helpful suggestions on ways to modify our constructs. Specifically, we told them about how we were struggling with protein purification process using column chromatography and"

Finally, 450 microlitres of LB was added to each tube and incubated for an hour at 37C on a shaker. 100 microliters of each culture was added to each plate and incubated overnight at 37C.
Had meeting with Nigel and Catherine and one of the advisers. He showed us which benches and desks to use, where he would like us to run and image gels, the fridge and freezer space, etc.
A doodle was created to find a time that worked for everyone for group meetings.
Thursday:
All cultures have bacterial colonies. They were placed in the fridge.
Purchased miniprep kit, pipet tips, eppendorf tubes, round bottom culture tubes, and plates from the storeroom.
5mL of LB and 5 microlitres of the appropriate antibiotic (antibiotics are 1000x) were placed in culture tubes. Colonies were added with fire-sterilized materials. We picked 2 colonies for each strain, just in case. Colonies were incubated at 37C shaking overnight.
Friday:
Miniprep of the 16 cultures. Cells were spun at 5,000 G / 46,000 rpm for 20 minutes to pellet the cells. Quiagen Plasmid DNA Purification using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit and microcentrifuge was used. See protols. DNA was resuspended in 50 microlitres of ddH2O.
Used NanoDrop to analyze plasmid concentration and purity. Concentrations for samples 1-16 ranged from 30ng/ul to 100ng/ul. Link to results: [[File:110520nanodrop.xls]]

Indeed the private funding for research in Europe is much smaller than it is in the US and this private funding is also more focused on a marketable product. So the focus on indeed having a return of the investments made is higher in the US than it is in European research initiatives. Getting access to venture capital to start a scientific business is usually easier in the US than it is in Europe because there are more venture capitalists interested in giving the money there.
On the lighter note it is also interesting to find that Americans are also better at selling their own argument, even in plain discussions, whether it concerns business or science itself. It may be because they are much better trained in presenting what they do and transmit it correctly.
Is there a possibility that our iGEM team to participate in some of the EC projects to raise awareness among policy makers about the ongoing iGEM activities and involving them early in this discussion?
This is possible in an indirect way. The EC funds projects, but doesn’t organize debates themselves. It is a really positive evolvement that the K.U.Leuven iGEM team is in contact with the Rathenau Institute and they are involved in one of the projects that is funded by the EC. The presence of iGEM teams and research groups would be welcome in their project.
It is also important to note that there is not so much regulatory activity on synthetic biology ongoing in EU because of the position of the EC. At the moment the member states cover synthetic biology with the legislation on GMOs. Currently the EC is monitoring bio-safety regulations, talking to the US in relation to global standards et cetera.
In many of the conferences in Western Europe there is an ongoing debate on life sciences. For instance he UK has an ongoing dialogue on synthetic biology not really on policy but more generally about creating an early awareness on the theme.
8. Conclusion
It was an intellectually enriching experience for the students of the K.U.Leuven iGEM team to learn about these developments and initiatives on synthetic biology at the EC. This activity was a result of the good self-governance initiative from our team to reach out to policy makers and people involved in the future policy making on synthetic biology in the EU.

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," advantage of the ease of gibson assemblies. We designed primers for each subunit. The forward primer would contain an overhang to correspond to the part it would attach to as well as a ribosome binding site. The reverse primer would simply anneal to the end of the subunit, excluding the final subunit, which would also contain an overhang that would correspond to the backbone. The products of the PCR reactions would then be put into a gibson reaction with a plasmid that had a chloramphenicol resistant backbone and an insert of the lac pL promoter. The proposed order would be MMOB, MMOC, MMOD, and MMOX, with MMOB having an overhang with the end of the lac pL promoter, MMOC having an overhang with MMOB, MMOD having an overhang with MMOC, and MMOX having an overhang with MMOD (in the forward primer) and the backbone (in the reverse primer). This method, too, was not providing us the results we were expecting.
Our final attempt at creating the sMMO plasmid involved purchasing two new G-Blocks, one with the promoter, a ribosome binding site, and MMOX, and another with ribosome binding sites in front of MMOB, MMOC, and MMOD. These G-Blocks were designed with overhangs to be combined with each other and be used in a gibson reaction with a chloramphenicol resistant backbone to create a plasmid. This plasmid was then to be combined with the MMOY/MMOZ plasmid using a 3A assembly. Unfortunately, despite screening over 20 Gibson assembly colonies, none of them yielded the correct sequence. As such, the sMMO plasmid has yet to be completed.
Fructose
To assemble this part we ordered two G-Blocks, one containing a lac pL promoter, a ribosome binding site, and MDH2, and another containing ribosome binding sites in front of HPS and PHI and a double terminator. The G-Blocks were designed so that they had overhangs that corresponded with each other as well as the ends of the backbone. We performed a gibson assembly to put all the pieces together and got our final product of the assembled plasmid.

Modeling
We summarize here our main contributions modeling The ST$^2$OOL. Our hypothesis, formulae and analysis can be found in the modeling section .
Stability We have modeled the variation of activity per cell of Biobricks with temperature and pH changes by considering variation in their transcription        and translation rates. Our model fits the cell fluorescence trend as a function of temperature. We have found that transcription rate increases with temperature due to a higher number of free σ factors, and translation rate decreases when temperature is above the optimal. Unfortunately, this is not all the story. Our model dramatically fails to fit the amount of variation, which is much larger experimentally than the predicted one. Let us compare theoretical predictions and experimental results. In both studies, XL1-Blue strain transformed with Biobricks Bb1 or Bb3, we find that the ratio between theoretical prediction and experimental result is the same at sub-optimal temperatures (in fact, accidentally too close given the error bars). This fact suggests that the extra temperature dependence not included in our model should come from cell mechanisms independent on parameters of the Biobricks (promoter strength, ...). Quite on the contrary, the comparison of theoretical"

Collaborations
We participated at the University of Maryland's (UMD) meet, thanks to this event were were able to meet other iGEM teams and collaborate with them
University of Maryland
The University of Maryland iGEM team really helped point out the weakness of our initial design and they gave us suggestions based on their experience and research. Our initial project or device had 3 different proteins controlled by one promoter and they helped us redesign it so each gene is now controlled by its own promoter. From the beginning everytime we needed help they were readily available and responded quickly.
University of Virginia
Our first project was based on a previous project from the University of Virginia iGEM team, we were very glad to have met their team at the UMD's Meet. Through email we were able to collaborate, specially with our measurement study, they helped us navigate the different types of vectors the devices were in and what we can do to optimize our transformation to get better results. We would like to specially thank Rena for being a bridge between the two teams
Loudoun Lyme
Because of our project we were able to collaborate with Loudoun Lyme, an oganization dedicated to the spread of information and awareness in our region about Lyme disease.  This collaboration also gave us great exposure in our community and the iGEM program, we were glad to meet a fellow igemer from a past Duke University iGEM team. We were able to talk about Lyme disease, explain strategies on how to have a safe nature experience and show case our project. We distributed flyers with information, our booth was very popular, so much that we got the attention of NatCapLyme (National Capital Lyame Disease Association). A natinal organization dedicated to the treatment of Lyme disease. We are really looking to collaborate with NatCapLyme this coming year .
Broad Run High School
Once we learned that Broad Run HS had an iGEM team we started collaborating with them, explaining what iGEM offers, and specially the IDT offer to all teams. They came to Rock Ridge several times and we talked about our projects and we share our accomplishments and experiences at Rock Ridge and we offer lab space for their project since they had to travel"

To investigate in which ways our technology would influence the world, we performed a Stakeholder Analysis. Do you want to know more ?
Photanol
We visited Photanol for an inspiring look into their laboratory. We received information about the first steps of upscaling and accompanying challenges. For further information, you may click here to see what we have learned.
ZAP
What does it hold to make a pilot plant? What kind of permits are needed? The experts of ZAP patiently explained it to us.
KNN
KNN is our main biomass supplier. KNN provided us with their product Recell and are curious to see how we will use their product as a feedstock to produce styrene. Find our first talk with them here .
BioBTX
BioBTX is a company which has similarities to us in some ways. They produce biobased aromatics, but in a chemical way. We discussed the differences between chemical and biological ways of styrene production here .
Upscaling of our end-product
After realization of a proof-of-concept, several interested parties are willing to make investments. You can read more about our conversations here .
Introduction
For the StyGreen project, Human Practices was not a box that needed to be ticked. On the contrary, it was a tool to integrate our project into the real world. As production of plastics can be a sensitive subject, Human Practices was important from the very start of our project.
As Human Practices is not binary, but a continuous and constant process. Here provide a summary of the biggest influences on the design of our project. Additionally, many insights were gained by talking to our friends, family and complete strangers. One of the first questions was always: “why more plastics?”. We have discussed this with several experts and investigated the advantages and disadvantages of different plastics. We looked into both ‘biodegradable’ plastics , as well as non-biodegradable plastics.
The starting point of our project was a look at the world as it is. We have marvelous technologies which make our lives better, things that were problems 100 years ago are forgotten and information can be shared faster than ever. However, there is also something terribly wrong with this world. Temperature is rising, animals go extinct: our advancement is at the cost of the planet.
We love all these advancements. We would lie if we say we did not, but we do want to solve the downside of our development. Therefore, we took a closer look at plastic. Plastic is a wonderful product and these days it is impossible"

We are also working closely with the Purdue Biomakers team this year to work on a standardized data sheet.
While working from the 2012 BostonU Team’s start on the Data Sheet app, we learned that the Purdue Biomaker’s team had a very similar concept in mind for creating a standardized way of sharing information about parts.
Early in June, we contacted the Purdue team to let them know that much of the groundwork has already been laid by the 2012 team here at BostonU. We shared our rough draft of the data sheet format with them and inquired if they had any plans to write software to implement the new data sheet.   By July, the Purdue replied to us that the would like to use our data sheet draft as the basis for the project. Purdue’s team members had been collecting survey data from over 75 teams around the world to find out what information they thought was essential to a data sheet and showed them a version of our draft. Purdue also video chatted with several teams to demonstrate what the data sheet’s functionality and ask for more feedback. We also video chatted with Purdue to discuss more changes to the data sheet format and how we wanted to propose that we would build a web app to create the datasheets. Each team began to develop a simple mock up of what we envisioned for the user interface and shared them with each other.
In early August, Thomas flew out to Indiana to visit Charlotte Hoo and Chris Thompson from the Purdue team to show them our progress and plans on the web app. At the meeting, we compared programs at talked about what the final product might look like. Both teams mutually agreed that the BostonU team would handle all of the software side of things while Purdue, with their extensive network of team contacts, would continue to refine some of the specific assay data fields for the data sheet and work on distribution and promotion of the new standard. Furthermore, one of our other collaborators, Jake Beal of BBN Technologies heard about our collaboration through iGEM HQ and offered to give some advice on the information that would be needed in the flow cytometry section of the data sheet.
Corporate Collaborations
We are collecting large quantities of characterization data from our flow cytometry experiments.  To analyze this data, we have been working with BBN Technologies and utilizing their BBN Synthetic Biology Tools . These tools came out of the TASBE project, which was a collaborative effort between BBN Technologies, the Densmore Lab at Boston Univeristy, and the Weiss Lab at MIT.

Modified from Brown et al.
The model of MerR’s action is shown in Fig 2. In (A), merR (showed as green dimer downside the DNA strand) bound to PTPCAD and recruited RNA polymerase but was unable to form an open complex. Hg (II)’s binding to the dimer  changed its conformation and transcription was initiated.  (Brown, Stoyanov et al. 2003)
By annealing PmerT-forward (5’-3’) and PmerT-reverse (5’-3’) primers, PTPCAD carrying a sticky end of EcoRI and SpeI was cloned upstream of BBa_E0840, a GFP generator. With exogenous expression of  MerR in bacteria, GFP’s expression could be induced by Hg (II) in a dose response manner. The PTPCAD-E0840 was then cloned into pSB3K3 backbone and the BBa_J23103 (constitutive promoter)-merR into pSB1A3.
Protocols for promoter characterization
An overnight culture of bacteria carrying the two plasmids pSB3K3 and pSB1A3 were grown in LB broth with ampicillin and kanamycin at 37°C was reactivated by diluting the culture in a ratio of 1:100 with fresh LB. When OD600 reached 0.4-0.6, the bacteria was disposed to several EP tubes, each owning 500uL, and different dose of Mercuric chloride solution was supplied with 3 duplicates and the final concentration varied from 0 to 1.0E-6 mol/L. 100uL of the 500uL was added to the black-96-well plates for GFP intensity’s measurement and another 100uL was pipetted to the transparent-96-well plates for OD600 measurement. In-plate culture fluorescence and OD600 was recorded at 20min intervals from 0 to 275min and the GFP intensity of 20min before induction was also measured. Temperature was constant at 37°C.

The protein production for our device
For the production of proteins we inserted in our sequences the iGEM suffixes and prefixes, the ribosome binding sites (RBS) and the T7 terminator, and the codons START and STOP.  The vector plasmid pET-32.a(+) used, contains a strong T7 promoter for protein production. In addition, we added a His-Tag followed by a TEV site in the sequence. This His-Tag will facilitate the purification of our proteins in a Ni-NTA chromatographic column. After purification, the His-Tag will be removed at the TEV site by a protease. (see Figure 4)

Les thérapies actuelles [1]
Les médicaments actuels
Les médicaments sont des entités chimiques ou biologiques, qui contiennent au moins un principe actif, et agissent sur une cible cellulaire, en vue d’un intérêt thérapeutique.
Dans le langage courant un médicament est une substance administrée pour corriger, modifier ou restaurer une fonction affectée de l’organisme.
D’un point de vue chimique, un médicament est une molécule (parfois un élément (ions)) qui interagit avec une cible moléculaire, c’est-à-dire avec un récepteur biologique. La liaison du médicament modifie alors les propriétés de la cible, ce qui conduit à une réponse de la cellule. Ceci est à l’origine des effets bénéfiques et indésirables d’un médicament.
La plupart des médicaments actuels ont une cible protéique. Les protéines sont indispensables à la survie de notre organisme. La majorité des maladies humaines sont associées à leur disfonctionnement. De nos jours, un bon nombre de protéines peuvent être facilement produites grâce à l’ingénierie génétique, elles peuvent ainsi être utilisées comme un traitement efficace pour un large spectre de maladies, dues à des protéines absentes ou déficientes.

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," the very district where the state of split EBFP2 with intein lies in.
The higher right part, on the contrary, is chilling to the bones. Here, ${k_{on}}$ is low and ${k_{off}}$ is high, which means that the two parts tend to disassociate. The state of spilt EBFP2 without intein falls into this region.
If we compare the two figures in parallel, we can see that the values in the “titration” map is lower than those in the “dimer” map. This is in accordance with our experimental data. Wet lab work shows that with a constitutively-expressed part, channel capacity is lower. The model match and explain the phenomenon.
To sum up, mathematical modeling reveals the impacts of thermodynamic constants on the gene regulatory circuit’s ability to convey information.
Deterministic Modeling
In order to achieve this, We use ordinary differential equations. ${x_1}$ to ${x_7}$ stands for ebfp2N, ebfp2C, EBFP2N mRNA, EBFP2N mRNA, EBFP2N, EBFP2C and EBFP2.

\[\frac{{d{x_2}}}{{dt}} = {k_1}\left[ {dox} \right]\left[ {c - {x_2}} \right] - {k_{ - 1}}{x_2}\]
\[\frac{{d{x_3}}}{{dt}} = {k_2}{x_1} - {d_2}{x_3}\]
\[\frac{{d{x_4}}}{{dt}} = {k_2}{x_2} - {d_2}{x_4}\]
