Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," 2007). These experts also suggest that an economic model combining patents with legal devices ensuring free knowledge sharing and use would be the best way to the economic development of synthetic biology and to the spreading of innovations.
Should we not consider that the bases of a synthetic biology commons have already been defined, by several organisms, including the iGEM Foundation itself ?
The iGEM community has already some attributes of a commons. However, we consider that this commons could be better structured and could play a far bigger role in orienting the development of synthetic biology. The objectives of our initiative are threefold :
First, leading every member of the iGEM community to be aware of participating to a commons;
Second, provoking a debate within the iGEM community to precise its founding rules. The community should collectively deliberate on the definition of a set of rules regarding the rights to access BioBricks, to use them, to control their application, to impose sanctions if necessary, etc.;
Third, leading the iGEM community to discuss its place and the role it may play in the development of an overall synthetic biology commons, involving different kinds of actors : other associations such as the BiOS Initiative, public research units and higher education organizations, companies, and so on. Though building an overall synthetic biology commons is far from being an easy task, it seems to be a growing concern for many actors, including public authorities. For instance, the current Minister of Higher Education and Research in France, Geneviève Fioraso, recently wrote a comprehensive Parliamentary Report on the scientific, technological and economic stakes of synthetic biology, which was published a few months before becoming a Minister (Fioraso Report, 2012). This report notably highlights the crucial role of iGEM in the development of synthetic biology.
Special thanks to our faculty advisor O. Brette for his advice and his help on our intellectual property reflexion.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements&action=edit_-_-_TEXT.html,"olytic cleavage, even though the secretion tag itself is apparently cleaved off during processing as it should be; otherwise the protein would have been about 47 kDa.
Interestingly, the MlrA with the secretion tag containing three propeptide parts appeared to have a molecular weight between 50 and 75 kDa. This could correspond to the calculated weight of the enzyme with the whole secretion tag, which is 62 kDa, which would mean that there had been problems with the cleavage of the tag. In addition, it seemed that there had been problems with producing the protein, as  there was only a very faint band corresponding to this construct on the western blot.
Our plan was to purify the enzymes with the histidine tag located on the C-terminus. Failure to purify MlrA using affinity chromatography Ni-NTA spin columns had been reported before by Dziga et al. (2012). However, as we made a preliminary attempt to purify a larger quantity of the enzyme with FPLC, we succeeded in purifying a small amount of MlrA: the full results can be read from our lab page. Our results thus indicate that affinity chromatography purification of MlrA is possible, although optimization of the purification conditions would be necessary to obtain better purity and higher yields of purified protein. Although we didn’t have time to try these improvements ourselves, we had ideas of what may give better purification yields. This includes a very slow initial elution buffer gradient to wash out unspecific binding. In addition, optimizing the pH of the sample could improve binding; a higher pH might allow for better binding to the nickel in the column, as the number of histidines with a complementary charge would increase. Diluting the sample in phosphate buffer and desalting the sample could improve its binding to the column. Additionally, binding could be facilitated by extending the 6X His tag to a 10X His tag. In the study mentioned above, purification of the enzyme to some extent with ion exchange chromatography had been successful. Although we didn’t have time to try this option, we were able to demonstrate that it is not the only method for purification, as also affinity chromatography could be successful.
However, as we didn’t manage to purify the enzyme enough, we weren’t able to quantify the amount of MlrA needed for the purification of a certain amount of microcystin. Furthermore, measuring the rate of degradation will also help in characterising the enzyme. In order to have the final product, an enzyme capsule capable of detoxifying a bucket of water"

Since ompR #73 and #64 aligned to ompR, we're cutting it out with XP to put the whole promoter-RBS-ompR-term part into a vector with either a CDF or SC101 origin. However, these digest products were inexplicable. One had a bright 4kb band and a faint 3kb band. The other had a bright 3kb band and a very faint kb band. Although the latter is similar to what is expected, the insert was extremely faint. Digest was repeated.

Since none of the alternative strategy mtrB or P105 is working, we tried to PCR out the parts again with Phusion, as it is a more processive polymerase and our products are all >2kb.
Phusion protocol says to use Tms ≥ 60°C, so we tried both a high and low temp set for each Rx. The low temp was optimal temp from using Platinum Taq; the high temp was the highest that indicated some form of a band.
The high temperature set used as template previous iterations of the same PCR. The low temperature set used either miniprep DNA or a colony.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Press_-_-_TEXT.html,"cheidende Neuerung: Das Münchner iGEM-Team hat einen Weg gefunden, die Zellen beim Drucken direkt miteinander zu verbinden. Bisher funktioniert Gewebe-3D-Druck vor allem so: Man nimmt ein Gerüst aus Hydrogel und „bevölkert“ es mit lebenden Zellen, die sich vernetzen. Anschließend wird das Hydrogel aufgelöst. „Dieser Auflösungsprozess bedeutet für die Zellen allerdings sehr viel Stress und ist nicht gut für ihre Überlebensfähigkeit“, sagt Clemens Ries, der an der TU München Biologie im Master studiert. Statt Hydrogels zu verwenden, haben Ries und seine Kommilitonen die Zellen deshalb genetisch verändert.
Im Grunde haben sie die Zellwände mit kleinen Haken versehen, damit diese sich besser zu Komplexen zusammenfügen können. Dazu nutzten sie das Protein Streptavidin. Mit der Hilfe eines Moleküls auf den Zellwänden, das sich mit diesem Haken verbindet, lassen sich die Zellen miteinander koppeln.
„Damit bekommen wir eine sehr starke Verbindung zwischen den Zellen“, sagt Ries. Wenn die Zellen sich dann nach einiger Zeit auf natürliche Art und Weise aneinander festhalten, „können wir das Grundgerüst, das wir ihnen gegeben haben, wieder schonend rauswaschen“."" by Anna Schughart

Thank You
The PoPPY team would like to thank everyone who made this project possible, especially those described below. For the past five years, undergraduates at UCSC have participated in iGEM. This year, the team is composed of students studying Bioengineering (Biomolecular), Bioinformatics, Bioengineering (Assistive Technology: Motor), Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Marine Biology, and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence and Human Computer Interaction. Our diverse group of individuals is crucial for the creative process behind using synthetic biology to help others. Modern engineering demands collaboration between individuals and pushes them to think critically and work efficiently. Through synthetic biology, the 2018 UCSC iGEM team is solving worldwide issues and developing methods to expand their research in the future.
The Project Idea
After several journal club meetings, our team determined the PoPPY project was the most meaningful pursuit. The initial idea was proposed by captain Morgan Tardy and mentor McKenna Hicks .

    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria"

Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck, or a hundred duck-sized horses?
I would definitely choose a hundred duck-sized horses. Ducks can be aggressive and I wouldn’t want to meet one that is bigger than I am! On the other side, if I could tame the duck, then I would have a pet that might be big enough to fly with me on its back? In that case I would choose the duck!
What did you work on during the project?
I was a big part of the Interlab project, and did most of the cloning required. I provided feedback for the design for the wiki, and was involved with testing and developing of the biosensor project. I was the teams travel agent, and booked tickets for our trips to Stockholm, Paris and most importantly Boston.

What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
I’m deeply fascinated with synthetic biology, and the problems the technology can solve today and will be able to solve in the future. The fact that we have come to a point in time where programming life is a relatively trivial task is fantastic, and I want to be a part of the development of this field. Also I like the smell of yeast!

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Introduction to the off-target model
Our project involves employing Cas13a for detecting antibiotic resistance genes. Cas13a acts like a detective that can signal the presence of specific RNA sequences. Its target description is provided by a specific single guide RNA sequence, denoted as the crRNA, that is positioned (loaded) within the protein. Cas13a is activated when the loaded crRNA pairs with a complementary (target) sequence. The crRNA is therefore essential in directing Cas13a towards a predefined target. Besides specific target recognition, proteins from the CRISPR-Cas family may also exhibit off-target activity. While offering possibilities to target related variants"

Since the T. versicolor laccase is a eukaryotic enzyme, it is post-translationally modified in the native host - containing two disulfide bonds and N-glycosylations at three sites. These modifications are important for proper folding and activity of the enzyme [2]. In prokaryotic expression systems, such as Escherichia coli, such modifications would not be introduced into the protein.
Instead we decided to use yeast, a widely used eukaryotic expression host with many genetic engineering tools. We chose the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris over the more commonly used Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker’s yeast) for several reasons. First of all, a higher protein yield has been reported for laccases in P. pastoris than in S. cerevisiae [3]. Furthermore, it secretes few endogenous proteins, simplifying purification of our recombinant protein. Lastly, hyperglycosylation can be a problem in both yeast species and could impair enzyme activity. However, in P. pastoris N-linked oligosaccharides are typically composed of 20 residues compared to 50 to 150 residues in S. cerevisiae [4].
For expression of our enzyme in P. pastoris, we used the pPICZα A vector from Invitrogen. This vector includes the α-factor secretion signal from S. cerevisiae under control of the methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter. The vector directly integrates into the P. pastoris genome at the native AOX1 locus. Upon addition of methanol to the culture medium, the promoter will be activated and the yeast will start producing the enzyme.
For purification of our enzymes we used immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), a method relying on the affinity of polyhistidine tags to metal ions chelated to the column resin. A 6xHis tag was included at the N-terminal end of all enzymes, to make it easier to purify them with the same method.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HansJonas_-_-_TEXT.html," priority to their safety, even when participation in the iGEM competition is hampered. At such moments, you will recognize the most fundamental value(s). Furthermore, Jonas argues that due to the enormous complexity of interdependences in the modern technology, uncertainty becomes a factor we always have to bear in mind. Because of these two factors, the irreversibility effects of conduct and the uncertainty due to the complexity of modern technology, we need to be prudent on the long-term. Both the actual complexity and the effects in the long run, are new features that did not exist in the Greek polis. The principle of precaution implies that not every risk is acceptable (e.g. an nuclear disaster), even if it is very unlikely to happen. Some risks are too hazardous to incorporate in a benefit-risk model, but this principle needs to be adopted into the considerations and decisions. One may think of long term effects of nuclear material, that introduces a time span that has never been envisaged before in the history of mankind. Between the lines, one can read Jonas’ implicit conviction that modern technology does not respect with the principle of precaution, because it still sticks to pre-modern concepts of responsibility.
Jonas proposes that a radical new concept of responsibility should be the answer to the problems raised by the modern technology. This responsibility is closely connected with the increase of power of modern technology to manipulate reality (Achterhuis, 1992). Jonas holds that due to this increase of power, a merely anthropocentric approach for judging technological developments cannot suffice. Because the impact of our conduct has influenced much more people over a far longer period of time, the responsibility has increased immensely. This new responsibility is not a response vis-à-vis my conscience, God or my parents, but arises from an appeal by the living nature in its vulnerability.
Jonas gives the example of a baby who is totally dependent on the care of his parents. This example illustrates the vulnerability and that the existence of the baby itself is valuable. The instinct of the parents causes them care for their baby, but Jonas would not agree with only this explanation (Van der Valk, 2009). It is not about the instinctive approach of care, because that would give the impression that Jonas reduces the responsibility of the parents to biological necessity. It is about his ontological status, which in itself is valuable. The parents are subject of responsibility, because the baby is object of responsibility. Another example of responsibility is a politician. Politicians choose to be responsible for the wellbeing of the community. They are responsible for the continuity and the identity of the state, during their nomination, but"

DESIGN
OVERVIEW
Our system is composed of four main biological components: bacteriophage, host bacteria, elastin-like-polymers (ELP), and a metal binding protein.
Together, the four components will work to sequester and remove metal ions from a solution.
BACTERIAL HOST
When considering a potential bacterial host that would be compatible with our system, the following criteria must be met.
I) The host can be parasitized by a bacteria-phage amenable to engineering.
II) The host can survive in high metal concentrations.
III) The host can resist temperature fluctuations and aggregation.
Chosen according to the criteria, we have decided to explore the host bacteria: Escherichia coli as our proof of concept as it is a well-studied model organism with defined methods of genetic manipulation and is easily accessible in our lab.
In real-life applications of our system, we will be using methanotrophic bacteria as they are one of the few natural organisms that can survive in the detrimental environment of tailings ponds. By using methanotrophic bacteria it also ensures a cost-efficient and sustainable system as the bacteria already naturally exists in the tailings pond. The additional benefit of working with E. coli is that results obtained in the system will inform in silico modelling, allowing us to design other phage systems for different organisms.
In summary, the choice of host defines numerous properties of the system in terms of energy input, phage production, and efficiency of removing the metal ions from the oil and mining tailings ponds. Our initial efforts with E. coli will inform our design of other host-phage systems, and alter the way in which our device works to capture and sequester ions in mining and oil tailings ponds.

Aalto-Helsinki,2017,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," After the World Biotech Tour weekend our plasmid blocks were donated to a voluntary workshop meant for tortured refugee families coming from really hard conditions and especially for the children of the families. We were happy to be able to give our plasmids another life and purpose after Heureka.
Play is the highest form of research.
Albert Einstein
For introducing real lab work and methods scientists use in their daily work we had an activity called Protein Hunt. It was a game based on simple color change reactions called colorimetric reactions, which are used in laboratories to find many different types of proteins in samples such as blood, saliva, sweat etc. We had 96-well plates with some of the wells containing protein and some without protein. Every player had a chance to learn how to use an automatic pipette and to try to find hidden proteins from the wells.
We also helped Heureka to set up Pipette by Numbers activity where visitors were again able to use a pipette and create together a piece of art. We created one platform for this activity and we also took care of another one that came from the World Biotech Tour. It was fun to watch how patiently and neatly some of the visitors were coloring the pictures. Some of our team members were also enjoying this relaxing activity which was really close to mindfulness practices, if you had a stable hand!
March For Science
We attended a peaceful march - March For Science, in order to make a point that in this, cynically named, ""post-factual"" era, science is not highly valued. It is important to tell people that science is the way of acquiring knowledge - even if it is based on probabilities. The trending other opinion, trusting individual experiences, is far more likely to be dangerous for both the individual and our environment. Science is incredibly difficult to grasp, if you are not a scientist, and that is exactly where Public Outreach comes in. Let us help people understand science!

About ABACUS
The integrated plugin ABACUS is actually constituted by two parts: the executable, written in Java and not hosted on Github, and the caller, written in Python and located in biohub/abacus/. Due to some technical reasons, we cannot provide the executable. If you want to test ABACUS locally, you may use one of our remote servers by writing the following content to biohub/abacus/config.json:
{ ""ABACUS_REMOTE_SERVERS"": [ ""http://106.15.205.191/"" ] }
Setting up the frontend
The frontend of Biohub 2.0 lies in frontend/main. Firstly you should install the dependencies:
$ cd frontend/main $ npm install
During developing, Biohub 2.0 uses webpack-dev-server for hot-reloading. You should configure the proxies in frontend/main/domain.config.json to make it work properly. As above, an example file is available:
{ ""dev"": {         // during developing, plugins and the main frontend are compiled and served separately         // the following field maps each plugin to a port where its frontend files served         // to serve a plugin frontend files, run `npm run dev <port>` in its frontend"

Overview
Background
Two years ago the Michigan Software 2014 team began development                of ProtoCat 1.0. Like many innovative ideas, ProtoCat began because of a problem. Studies have estimated                that only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible.  A 2014 survey conducted                by the Michigan Software team confirmed that the repeatability problem exists in synthetic                biology, with every scientist surveyed reporting prior struggles with replicating protocols.                The majority of these scientists indicated unclear language and missing steps are the greatest                contributors to the irreproducibility of synthetic biology protocols. A second study conducted by last                year's Michigan Software team only further confirmed the sentiments of the first study. These                issues are what ProtoCat has been designed to solve.
Solution
Every respondent of the second survey indicated that they                would use a database to browse and download protocols, with over 85% indicating that                they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed. ProtoCat 3.0                is a free database of crowd sourced protocols designed to make existing protocols more                repeatable and enable more accurate computational models of biological systems. We believe                this can most efficiently be accomplished with a commitment to open source protocols and a                broader more active community of digital troubleshooters. ProtoCat 3.0 works to establish                such a community by giving anyone with an internet connection or smartphone access to a                repository of synthetic biology protocols collected from all over the world. Additionally,                ProtoCat 3.0 encourages the development of higher quality, more repeatable protocols by                allowing users to document, rate, review, and edit existing methods.
ProtoCat 4.0
ProtoCat 4.0 is optimized for collaboration among users                and offers the best user experinece we have developed. We've added features such as threaded comments,                 notifications, protocol favoriting, and a new chat system called ProtoChat in this                 years verions of ProtoCat. Now users can communicate through commenting and chatting                 to make improvements on existing protocols or favorite one they like to quickly relocate                 it. ProtoCat also recieved a password recover system, notifications, and a better search                 algorithm to search more fields of a protocol. In addition, users can now create drafts                 of a protocol which allows them to start and finish a new protocol at their convienience.                 These are are all"
Danzi_Kesh_8,2015,Team:Danzi Kesh 8#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," beginning our group of Team members explained to the students the subject of activity.
Presenting the topic included explaining the disease and its symptoms. As activities progressed the students played the ""Treasure Hunt"" with the pupils, the game included, a questionnaire on gluten and celiac disease, writing the word ""Scouts"" with wheat, the invention of songs containing words related to the topic and more.
After each task the students received an ingredient to prepare gluten-free brownies which were prepared at the end of the game (food in a celiac patient's diet), after they prepared the brownies, the pupils ate and enjoyed the gluten-free dish which was prepared with their own hands. The Alergln group of students finished the day with a feeling of satisfaction.
Public Opinion Survey
In order to learn better about public opinion regarding celiac disease, how much the community understands and knows the details of the illness, we held an extensive survey among local residents and high school students where we learn. As part of the survey we visited crowded places, such as malls, shopping centers, parks, markets and more.
It turns out that most of the audience knows about the disease, however, they are unaware of the difficulties it has on celiac disease sufferers.
The survey also included questions about the feasibility of our product being developed in our laboratory. The answers were diverse and varied, but one thing was clear and complete, our product will help the quality of life of celiac patients.
Public and parliamentary action to change the existing situation
In Israel, like other developed countries in the world, policy change requires thorough field work and intense parliamentary activity. Reality change will take place in an orderly fashion only after it will be anchored in Israeli law, and therefore there is a need to propose a bill.
The bill seeks to compare the rights of celiac patients to similar rights in comparison to those with health disabilities. To reach the stage of proposing the enactment of the ""Celiac Law” we must take a number of preliminary steps:
Public Parliamentary activity to advance the rights of celiac patients in the Israeli parliament
At the request of Member of Parliament Dr. Yifat Biton Shasha, chairman of the Committee for Children's Rights, we organized a day of activities to promote legislation on behalf of celiac patients in the State of Israel and increase public and parliamentary awareness. With the understanding that there is a need for social justice and equality for this group of consumers, we decided beyond doing local community activity in our town, Kiryat Shmona, and social networks, there is place to begin activities that encourage the topic at large through the all channels in"

This will be repeated five times to make sure the VOCs are enough concentrated. The examination will take a few minutes and when it is finished the filter containing the VOCs will be sent to a laboratory facility for analysis.
Figure 1. The prototype with the filter removed.
When the filter arrives to the laboratory, the VOCs will be released from the filter and incubated with the yeast biosensor. The yeast will then be plated and incubated in 30°C for a few days to study the possible red colour change. The patient will be informed of the result and if the yeast had no colour change, the patient will be continuously be called for screening examinations every two years. If the yeast cells would turn red and thereby indicate that the patient has lung cancer, further examinations will be needed. The patient would therefore do a CT scan to examine the position and size of the tumor to determine continued treatment.
To ensure that the method is suitable for a screening program, the goal with the biosensor is to have a high detection rate, so as not to overlook any patients with lung cancer, as well as a low number of false positives. However, a number of experiments and statistical analyses will be needed to assure this. Currently, the biosensor is in the “proof of concept”-stage and therefore it would be hard to fulfill the screening condition “the diagnostic test should with high probability classify truly diseased people as diseased and truly healthy people as healthy” today, even if it aims to fulfill the condition in the future.
Economical model
When instituting a lung cancer screening program, cost efficiency is of great importance. Medical personnel costs will be roughly the same regardless of which method that is used. However, use of the biosensor in a screening program would result in a reduction of the cost compared to the use of a CT scan where a single examination costs 15 000 to 20 000 SEK (around 1 900-2 500 USD) [9]. Besides medical personnel, the use of the biosensor would result in additional costs confined to laboratory personnel and culturing of the yeast which is regarded relatively cheap. For the device itself, the filter would be considered the highest cost, with around 4 300 SEK (around 530 USD) per filter [10].
The survey brought up economical aspects to include the general public’s view on how the program should be financed and how much they themselves would"

同源建模
我们通过同源建模模拟了含肽支架(从金黄色葡萄球菌提取出的 G 蛋白的 B1 区域) 的三维结构。我们使用了Modeller Library(建模库)这个软件去完成这项工作。因为 这个多肽链是由 20~25 个氨基酸链接而成的,它可以在 B1 区域支架内成环。而这个 B1 区域的支架 3D 模型能在蛋白数据库中找到。
图释:描述了同源建模的过程。所有的多肽都在骨架(金黄色葡萄球菌提取出的 G 蛋 白的 B1 区域)内被克隆。这些肽链足够短以至于他们能够通过循环优化的方法对这些 内部环进行建模。令人遗憾的是因为我们没有直接的晶体学数据所以它们仅仅能被看做 工作模型。 通过该链接可以查看具体的过程。

Project Description
Introduction
For years, researchers have used recombinase proteins to genetically modify organisms. However, we noticed that                 the potential of these proteins in genetic engineering is not fully realised. Scientists can often only use                 a handful of recombinases within a cell, and they may also cause unwanted side-effects. This limits how experiments                 can be designed. To address these issues, we have developed the Site-specific, MOdular REcombination (SMORE)                 toolkit. The biobricks in the SMORE toolkit are all thoroughly tested and documented. They can be expressed                 in the same cell, which allows for the creation of more complex constructs in synthetic biology.
What is site-specific recombination and why does it matter?
Site-specific recombination (SSR), found mostly in bacteria, viruses and transposons (so-called parasitic DNA                 elements), is one of the many mechanisms which life utilises to perform genetic recombination [1]. SSR generally                 consists of a recombinase protein that mediates recombination, and two DNA elements, called target sites,                 that are similar or identical to each other that the recombinase recognises [2]. Depending on the orientation                 and the location of the target sites, SSR can perform DNA integration, excision, and exchange. While bacteria                 use SSR to regulate gene expression and separate two chromosomes during cell division, viruses and transposons                 use it to mediate chromosomal integration into the bacterial chromosome, hijacking the cellular machinery                 to replicate themselves. For a more clear picture on how recombination occurs in three-dimensions, see our video below where we extensively explain how SSR occurs, using the popular Cre/Lox system as an example.
Click here for an animated view of how SSR occurs in three dimensions!
With the ability to modify DNA in a precise manner, SSR has been used in various fields of research and industrial                 applications where genetic engineering is required. Click to see the applications of SSR:
1. Genetic Engineering
a. Conditional gene knockout
Site-specific recombinases are highly efficient in excising DNA segments flanked with target                                     sites; this property has been widely adopted by neuroscientists and developmental biologists                                     to perform conditional gene knockout,"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Measurement#Main_-_-_TEXT.html," kinetics of both dxCas9 binding to target and Tn5 integration. Another improvement of the method should include the design of optimal adapters compatible with ONT library preparation. This could be done by interacting with sequencing experts from ONT because the specific adapter sequences are not known due to corporate secrets. For our prospective collaboration with Oxford Nanopore technologies, please visit our Entrepreneurship page .
This method was designed and developed while searching for a solution in detection methods for gene doping, but the application scope is much broader than that. By simply interchanging the sgRNA with one of your own interest the target can be changed unlimitedly. The ability to enrich samples for specific DNA molecules prior to sequencing can be used in research areas that require highly detailed information of DNA mutations. Such studies could include single point mutations to large structural variations or copy number alterations, detection of viral infections, fetal DNA screening and food safety maintenance ( Gabrieli, Sharim, Michaeli & Ebanstein, 2017 ).

Heat inactivate at 65°C for 10 minutes.
Chill on ice and transform 1-5 μl of the reaction into 50 μl competent cells
Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix(M0492S)
We recommend assembling all reaction components on ice and quickly transferring the reactions to a thermocycler preheated to the denaturation temperature (98°C). All components should be mixed prior to use.
Notes: Gently mix the reaction. Collect all liquid to the bottom of the tube by a quick spin if necessary. Overlay the sample with mineral oil if using a PCR machine without a heated lid.
Transfer PCR tubes to a PCR machine and begin thermocycling.
Thermocycling Conditions for a Routine PCR:
NOTE: Template: Use of high quality, purified DNA templates greatly enhances the success of PCR. Recommended amounts of DNA template for a 50 µl reaction are as follows:
DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment(M0210S)
KOD DNA Polymerase(Merck Millipore@Novagen, TB320)
Repeat steps 2-3 is wrong!  It should be ‘repeat steps 1-3’.
Quick Ligation™ Kit (M2200S)
Set up the following reaction in a microcentrifuge tube on ice. (T7 DNA Ligase should be added last. Note that the table shows a ligation using a molar ratio of 1:3 vector to insert for the indicated DNA sizes.)
Use NEBiocalculator to calculate molar ratios.
The Quick Ligase Reaction Buffer should be thawed and resuspended at room temperature.
Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly.
Incubate at room temperature (25°C) for 5 minutes.
Chill on ice and transform 1-5 µl of the reaction into 50 µl competent cells. Alternatively, Store at -20°C.
Do not heat inactivate – heat inactivation dramatically reduces transformation efficiency

Figure 1 丨 The results show that all the promoters work.
Galactose Dose Response of Gal1 Promoter
Plasmid carrying the device containing Gal1 promoter was transformed into competent S.cerevisiae cells. Transformed cells were plated on 2% agar in media A (yeast nitrogen base, MET, LYS, HIS, URA), complemented with 2% glucose and cultured at 30℃ for 48h. The colonies were then inoculated in the liquid media A complemented with 2% glucose and were grown at 30℃. Culture was stopped and glucose was removed from media with washing cells by PBS till they reached the exponential phase. Cells were then pelleted and diluted and cultured on liquid medium containing galactose concentrations between 0.25% and 2% w/v overnight. Samples were taken out for quantification.
In quantification process, concentrations of liquid media containing cells were measured at λ600nm and then liquid media were removed and cells were washed twice and refolded to a OD600 = 1.0 concentration by Buffer ( 0.05 M NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M Imidazole ) for ELIASA analysis. Fluorescence intensity of the refolded cells were then measured by ELIASA (Tecan, Infinite M200 and i-Control)) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm (the suggested one is 501 nm), and an emission filter of 520 nm (the suggested one is 511nm) to quantify fluorescence intensities. The result is shown below.
Figure 2 丨 Dose responsiveness of the Gal1 promoter to galactose induction
The graph above summarises the ELIASA data, and shows that the intensity of GFP expressing cells induced by low or high dose of galactose are higher then those induced by the middle doses. This is similar to the result given by iGEM 2010 team, Aberdeen_Scotland. We therefore plan to set more experiment groups between these doses to figure out what happened.
Leading Peptides for Future Plan
What we plan to do next is to find the other pathways in the yeast and make it highly effective by taking advantages of the micro environments. But frist of all, how to make the protein import into"

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"22 to encapsulate the Dreissena spp. specific toxin from P. fluorescens strain CL145A, the active agent in Zequanox® (4). We have designed our PNCs to be uptaken by zebra and quagga mussels to emulate the uptake method of Zequanox® which is taken up through the mussels’ filtration system and is degraded in their digestive tracts releasing the toxin (5; see our Design page for more details).
Our system would be a safe solution to deploy into the environment because of the high specificity for zebra and quagga mussels and that our PNCs are non-replicating. FitD has been shown to be highly toxic to Dreissena spp. (5) but not the native freshwater mussel species (6). Due to the fact that PNCs only contain protein capsids, they are unable to self-replicate and must be produced in a lab environment prior to release. Our system would not be deployed into open-water bodies, but would instead be used as a preventative measure by keeping it contained to isolated regions.

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"less lactis vaccine to be utilised by the country seems very promising.
However, even with such benefits in place, we learned that a system like this does impose some challenges. Because the regulatory system is so irregular, there is almost no concern present there among the local healthcare authority for the quality, safety and efficacy of these systems.
Regulation is particularly important in medicines as inadequate regulation may put lives at risk. Because of this, we believe that us scientists and developers in the developed world who produce vaccines such as this have an ethical responsibility to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine before bringing it to the market in countries such as Honduras. The poor populations of the world are not lab rats, they are human beings, just like us, who require just as high a standard of healthcare as we do.
Choluteca, Honduras
Having investigated the issue of leishmaniasis with some of the main stakeholders in the country, our next focus centred on what is it really like in an epidemic area ? This question set us off to Choluteca, a province in the south west of the country, where leishmaniasis is prevalent. It was here where we encountered Fyffes who were a major employer in the area. Fyffes have demonstrated loyalty to the community by building a school and a hospital for the local populace. While in choluteca, we gathered information on the prevalence of the disease, the number of patients who seek treatment and factors that are thought to be involved in the spread of the disease.
Above: Hospital in Choluteca region.
The local doctor was very aware of the disease and provided us with information with regard to ways in which the disease could be prevented. He also highlighted issues such as the lack of education as a factor which has led to the spread of the disease in previous years. Another issue which was emphasised and which we have seen previously through interaction with Dr Alvaro Acosta and Dr Cristian Valladeres was that there is poor patient compliance with the current treatment. This series of twenty painful intramuscular injections deters patients from seeking treatment and the parasite is then allowed to spread.
Above: Yensi speaks to the Ernesto Caceres (Fyffes Medical doctor) about the prevalence of the disease.
Having informed the doctor of our aim to produce a vaccine against leishmaniasis, he was quite interested. He emphasized that the vaccine would need to be cost-effective, we therefore decided to concentrate on developing a vaccine that could be orally administered. Our strain as previously mentioned has the hylA gene integrated in it"

Experimental approach
In the framework of recombinant phage gene design we decided to fuse the adenovirus 5 penton base to the D protein of the Lambda phage. The protein D extraction from Lambda phage genome has been lead by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with several couple of primers. The same  strategy has been applied for the adenovirus 5 penton base extraction which has been extracted from a plasmid coding for the virus offered by Dr. Karim Benihoud (UMR8121, CNRS/IGR, Villejuif, France).
After the fusion protein formation, this one is introduced in a BioBrick plasmid. This plasmid contains a resistance against an antibiotic to confirm the transfection of the recombined phage into bacteria and a reporter gene, like GFP, with eukaryotic promoter, the CMV of the Simian virus 40 (SV40), to confirm the transfection in eukaryotic cells. This strategy permits us to prove that the bacteriophage is able to infect eukaryotic cells.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to build the fusion protein in time. However, scientific literature show that the cell vector , a Lambda phage type, confection is possible by fusion of the penton base with the D protein (Stefania Piersanti et al. 2004). The central sequence of the penton base , amino -acids 1 to 571, fused with the bacteriophage offers a transfection in eukaryotic cells, like the use of the RGD fragment responsible for the entry of the virus and the exit of the endosome, fragment 286 to 393.

Design of the fusion protein
For the fusion protein design, we decided to extract separately the adenovirus 5 penton base and the D protein of the Lambda phage thanks to primers containing a BalI restriction site on the protein D reverse primer and the penton base forward primer. Moreover the finale fusion protein contains specific BioBricks fragments to its prefix and suffix.
For these 2 genes extraction we used the following primers:
First and second pair for genes extraction:
D protein of the Lambda phage:
Forward : 5' ATG-ACG-AGC-AAA-GAA-ACC-TT 3';
Reverse : 5' AAA-AAA-ATC-CCG-TAA-AAA-AAG-C 3'.

Figure 1: Random and biased walks.  Left:  A random walk in isotropic environments.  When the cell's motors rotate CCW, the flagellar filaments form a trailing bundle that pushes the cell forward.  When one or more of the flagellar motors reverses to CW rotation, that filament undergoes a shape change (owing to the torque reversal) that disrupts the bundle.  Until all motors once again turn in the CCW direction, the filaments act independently to push and pull the cell in a chaotic tumbling motion.  Tumbling episodes enable the cell to try new, randomly-determined swimming directions.  Right  A biased walk In a chemoeffector gradient.  Sensory information suppresses tumbling whenever the cell happens to head in a favorable direction.  The cells cannot head directly up-gradient because they are frequently knocked off course by Brownian motion..
The chemotaxis signaling pathway of E.coli
E. coli senses chemoeffector gradients in temporal fashion by comparing current concentrations to those encountered over the past few seconds of travel.  E. coli has four transmembrane chemoreceptors, known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), that have periplasmic ligand binding sites and conserved cytoplasmic signaling domains (Fig. 4).  MCPs record the cell's recent chemical past in the form of reversible methylation of specific glutamic acid residues in the cytoplasmic signaling domain (open and filled circles in Fig. 4).  Whenever current ligand occupancy state fails to coincide with the methylation record, the MCP initiates a motor control response and a feedback circuit that updates the methylation record to achieve sensory adaptation and cessation of the motor response. A fifth MCP-like protein, Aer, mediates aerotactic responses by monitoring redox changes in the electron transport chain.  Aer undergoes sensory adaptation through a poorly-understood, methylation-independent mechanism. The five MCP-family receptors in E. coli utilize a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to control flagellar rotation and sensory adaptation (Fig. 4).  CheW and CheA generate receptor signals; CheY and CheZ control motor responses; CheR and CheB regulate MCP methylation state.

Lanzhou,2017,Team:Lanzhou#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," we were able to notice his unparalleled passion in continuously figuring out novel methods to several certain obstacles.
In addition, lectures given by other scholars also drew our attentions, hence we had several talks with these scholars on the basis of contents of their lectures as well.
At that time, our project was coincidently facing a difficulty, and even started to doubt whether our design of these Bio-devices could actually work because of the uncertainty over the reliability of certain essential target gene. Thus, we were going to consult Professor Yamazaki so as to seek the possibility that he could shed a light for our harsh course of polishing our project. And through the discussion betwwen Professor Yamazaki and three team members of LLanzhou iGEM team, we mainly focused on four primary questions.
1. In that our team’s aim was to make a trial with utilizing the mechanism of RNA interference which is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), considering the situation that we hadn’t yet extracted relatively pure dsRNA, professor Yamazaki suggested that we could contact several corporations to discover the opportunity to have the direct access to synthesized dsRNA so that we could demonstrate its function immediately thought it might be a cost of money.
2. Assuming that we had already figured out the first difficulty, we were going to face the next hard circumstance that we needed to prove that our method had successfully functioned and the expression of the target gene was turned down or even silenced in host plants (Arabidopsis thaliana). Therefore, professor Yamazaki advised us to obtain seeds of transgenic seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana forming a reporting system for our project.
3. Since we aimed to produce large amount of dsRNA through our engineered E.coli, we needed to think about a proper approach to extract dsRNA from relatively large amount of nucleotides in the bacteria. Although professor Yamazaki reminded us this method of great risk of failure, he still recommended us pluck out other non-relevantly influential factors, dsRNA.
4. Last but not least, one of delivery system of target gene was on the basis of  higher plants’ ability to absorb dsRNA form the roots, so we are going to use synthesized dsRNA to inject or spread into target plants. Because the mechanism of absorption was unclarified, Professor Yamazaki suggested that we might need to find and collect large amount of literature relating to dsRNA.
Lastly both Lanzhou iGEM team and I were greatly grateful to professor Yamazaki's suggestions that genuinely provided us reliable strategy for the main part and downstream part. To further our"

TLC was carried out on silica-gel as immobile phase and Dichloromethane as mobile phase. For the procedure a 50 ml beaker was filled with ~15 ml Dichloromethane and let stand for about 10 minutes (in order to let the Dichloromethane-vapor fill the beaker). The TLC plate, coated with silica-gel was spotted with sample 0.5 to 1 cm above the lower edge and placed in the beaker. TLC was run until the solvent front was at two thirds of the TLC plate. As Indigoidine is light-sensitive, the beaker was covered with aluminium foil in order to prevent direct light irradiation.

The DTU Biobuilders' proposal for solving this task is a stand-alone application that is based completely on species specific tAI calculation and is bundled with a simplistic Graphic User Interface (GUI) compatible with many platforms. We hope that this software will contribute to faster and easier to production of biotechnological results and become a high-end optimizing method with its unique theory implementation.

The TaiCO Interface
Theory
As mentioned, the central issue in codon optimization is to determine which codons are most efficiently translated for each amino acid. The quantity needed for this task is called 'translatability' and is denoted \(W_i\) for the \(i\)'th codon.
To accomplish this, we have chosen to use a tRNA Adaptation Index-based method (tAI). The fundamental assumption behind this method is that highly expressed proteins have their genes encoded with a set of codons that is overall more susceptible to tRNA-binding and translation compared to proteins that are not highly expressed. Hence, this optimization method estimates the codon preferences in such a way that the correlation between protein level and tAI is maximized.
The formulas for calculating individual \(W_i\)'s were stated by dosReis 1 . All 64 \(W_i\)'s can be calculated in one matrix multiplication, by letting \(G\) be the 4\(\times\)16 matrix consisting of the tGCN's (in TaiCO referred to as 'gcn') and letting \(S\) be the 4\( \times\)4 matrix containing the (1 \(-s_{ij}\)) values. Hence,
$$W = SG$$
The computed \(W_i\)'s are then normalized by putting \(w_i = W_i/W_{\text{max}}\), and those normalized translatabilities, \(w_i\) do then form the basis for codon selection. Higher \(w_i\)-values are simply selected over lower values.
The \(G\) Matrix
\(G\) consists of 64 tGCN values, which are the gene copy number of tRNA's recognizing specific codons. Normally, available gcn-files list the tGCN's in terms of the reversed anticodon corresponding to the recognized codon, hence, the tricodons in the raw gcn-files are reversed and have their bases replaced by the complementary ones. For instance, in S. cerevisiae the gcn of tRNA's recognizing TTC (encoding glutamic acid) is 10, so in the raw file, this information"

Team:Tokyo-Nokogen
From 2009.igem.org
We belong to the Department of Biotechnology at Tokyo University of  Agriculture and Technology (TUAT) in Japan. Our team comprises ten  undergraduate students, four instructors and an advisor. This is the  first time for us to take participate in iGEM. Prof. Sode informed us  about iGEM competition, and we girded up our loins to build  'Tokyo-NokoGen'. All the members have a great deal of interest in  synthetic biology although we don't major in synthetic biology.Trying  to achieve the goal of our project, we would like to realize how  wonderful synthetic biology is. It is attractive for us because  synthetic biology is capable of unrestricted design and construction of  a novel biological system by bottom-up approach starting from almost  nothing, different from ""genetic engineering"" that is our major. We  think it is essential to unify biotechnology with other research fields  such as system engineering, mathematics and bioinformatics because the  biological system is so complicated. This correlation of different  fields of study is what we aim to do in our department of Biotechnology  in TUAT.We are glad to have a precious experience to learn how to  develop our project. In this year, we will corporate with NYMU-Taipei  at National Yang Ming University in Taiwan. We have already had a first  live meeting and gotten to know each other. From now on, we would like  to compete with each other and construct attractive genetically  engineered machine.With renewed dreams and hope, we have started our  projects !

Thanks to Christopher Dye of World Health Organization (WHO) for his wise advice about tuberculosis. Last but not least, thanks to Christopher Anderson for the discussion about our project and about health and synthetic biology.
Specially, we like to thank Nicola Bertoldi. Nicola did the master with many of us, and coming from a philosophy background he has a great interest in Synthetic Biology. We wanted for him to be in the team, but due to differences in calendar it was not possible. However, during the brief time we got together resulted in the ""Technology Transfer"" essay.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," degraded bacteria in your urine, so you also have a lot of the mDAP, the target in your urine. So [the test] would always show up positive. With conjunctiva swabs you shouldn’t have bacteria there, except you have an infection.
Kai:
But it’s also not […] species specific. You can detect chlamydia but [the test] doesn’t say if it’s Chlamydia trachomatis or any other [type of chlamydia].
Daniel C.:
It’s not limited to the serotype.
Prof. Kalua:
The issue is that a lot of the chlamydia react to Azithromycine. So for us it’s not an issue what sort of subspecies or serotype, because the treatment is actually the same. […] How expensive would the test be?
Daniel C.:
You mean, all in all?
Prof. Kalua:
Yes
Daniel C.:
If we would go into big production and have automated robots for 80.000 € in the clean lab, the device would not cost more than 0.10 €.
Prof. Kalua:
Okay. Because the current PCR that we are doing, one sample costs around 1 $ to process. Has this been tried elsewhere?
Daniel C.:
You mean this kind of system? No, it’s really new. It’s a new idea.
Prof. Kalua:
Why do you think it has not been tried?
Daniel C.:
Because it is a really new field. […] Also using GMOs for medical applications. And usually research groups have to publish everytime, so they can’t take any big risks. But we are students. We do this one year and don’t have any pressure to publish.
Prof. Kalua:
I suppose that’s true. I’m going to ask you one question […]: Do you know Mark Zuckerberg?
Everyone:
Yes.
Prof. Kalua:
Do you know the lawsuit involving him?
Everyone:
Yes.
Prof. Kalua:
So do I see a lawsuit in the future, saying: „I started this, I started this“?
Daniel C., Kai:
No, because it’s not a patentable idea. If we publish it at the MIT it has no licence. It’s free. […] We have no rights whatsoever on that design. No one has. Everyone can use it. It’s a big part of the competition, to make it open source.
Prof. Kalua:
[…] So as long as we are very clear on that. Because people…they may not do exactly the way you want"

After three cycles of degassing, 10 mL of degassed water were added. The tube was then sealed under N2 protection and heated up to 95 1C to dissolve agar in a water bath, forming a transparent precursor solution. Then, the solution was injected into a glass mold with a 1 mm thick PTFE spacer and gradually cooled down to room temperature. During the cooling process, agar formed the first physically crosslinked network via physically-associated agar helical bundles. Once the first agar network was formed, the agar gel and other unreacted species in the same pot were photo-polymerized for B1 hour using UV light (wavelength: 365 nm, intensity: 8 W, UVP,CA)to form the second chemically cross-linked network of PAM that interpenetrates with the first agar network. Gels were removed from the molds afterwards and sealed with a plastic wrap to keep moisture before tensile testing. Unlike the conventional two or multiple-step methods, this one-pot process takes only 1–2 hours to complete DN gels. Agar single network (SN) hydrogels and PAM SN hydrogels were prepared using the modified one-pot method. Agar SN gels were synthesized using the heating up-and-cooling down process without involving photo-polymerization, while PAM SN hydrogels were directly synthesized using the photo-polymerization method. We also prepared the Agar/PAM DN and SN parent gels at different concentrations of AM, agar, initiator, and crosslinker to examine their effects on the mechanical and antifouling properties.

Insole 1
Insole 1 has a resin based skeleton with Polyurethane sponge crammed in the hole of it. The resin skeleton support most of the weight of the feet. While the Polyurethane sponge acts as the mix solid-liquid culture media of the engineered E.coli. When force is applied on the insole, the skeleton will deform slightly , therefore the solution containing the cecropin XJ will be squeezed out to kill the bacteria on people’s feet, which is efficient for mass transferring.

Substantial progress was made towards the understanding of fundamental approaches to mathematical modelling. Dr. David Swailes from the Department of Mechanical Engineering has kindly agreed to help us with our task. It was thought sensible to divide the project into three parts. First model the growth of the vesicle which is not limited by anything, then model the process of growth in a confined environment from the time just after the vesicle grows to touch the sides of the chamber, followed by a model of the transition between the two phases.

Parts
The parts were taken from the Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 genome by finding a regulator on RegPrecise. Then the consensus sequence was located at the appropriate distance from a gene and DNA upstream from the gene was taken, which included the consensus sequence.  This ensured that the ribosomal binding site would be in the sequence we took as well as any other necessary machinery for the following gene to be regulated by the promoter that we extracted.  All of the promoters were then amplified using PCR and inserted into the prL814 plasmid in place of the T7A1 promoter.
Each part that the MSU iGEM team constructed, was taken from the Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 genome by finding a regulator for each desired part on http://regprecise.lbl.gov/RegPrecise/. These parts were all built to detect contaminants. A provided consensus sequence was then taken at the appropriate distance from a gene and included with the DNA that is upstream from that gene. This selection process ensured that the ribosomal binding site would be in the sequence taken, as well as any other necessary machinery for the following gene to be regulated by the promoter that was extracted. All of the promoters were then amplified using PCR and inserted into the prL814 plasmid in place of the T7A1 promoter. From the nine parts created ( part numbers listed below) Paraquat was the main part that the MSU team chose to pursue for GFP experiments, and proof of concept, due to no metabolic relevance to the cell.

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#diary_-_-_TEXT.html," and more). At Norwich, we were able to interact with other iGEM team members and were given advice by various professors that had volunteered their time to answer our questions. Overall, it was a rewarding experience!
Day 3:
We spent the morning discussing our time in Norwich, the lessons learnt and their possible applications in relation to our project.  In Norwich, there was a specific speech on Human Practices that caused us to pause and reevaluate our original debate idea.  We agreed that supplementing this project with reflective essays would benefit our chances of receiving a gold medal, while staying true to the real meaning of what a Human Practices project should be: introspective.
Day 4:
The team had a morning meeting with the advisors being present. Charlie wrote up a summary of the team’s achievement in the last week. Sam re-contacted the head of the World Schools Debate Championship to confirm our place in the program.
Day 5:
The team made plans for the debate and focused on planning the experiments for our Drug Delivery Proof and checking the viability of conjugation based on our available time and team size. A lot of research was also done into conjugation functionality in vitro.
Week 4 - 1/08/11
Day 1:
The team had a morning meeting with the advisors present.  Meanwhile, Charlie met with Dr. Peter Coote, a resident molecular biologist who had written several papers on antimicrobial peptides, for advice on the project and the feasibility of intracellular antimicrobial peptide production as a viable kill switch.
We brainstormed some more on our human practices project focusing the the idea of a review of past iGEM teams, rather than simply their HP projects. We came up with a number of variables, including projected budget and budget at time of registration, number of biobricks submitted, number of advisors and advisor/student ratio, and many more, in order to eventually find correlations between the data that would reveal what it takes to get gold in iGEM, or even whether iGEM is truly a fair competition.  and began extracting data from the wikis of previous iGEM teams.
Day 2:
The team focused mainly on the working to gather data for the iGEM review.  We all spent time researching online to find various figures.
Day 3:
Ogaga, Lamya and Sam continued updating the spreadsheet. The team also agreed to collaborate with the University of Dundee’s iGEM team concerning the debate and made plans to set up a meeting to discuss the details of the debate in person.

HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou,2017,Team:HFLS H2Z Hangzhou#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,". So we settled down with fusion protein.
Background
There are currently four methods of fusion protein assembly:
1
End-to end fusion.
This method works by directly add the gene for the second enzyme to the end of gene for the first enzyme (the stop codon of the first gene is removed). The N-terminus of one domain is linked to the C-terminus of the other domain. However, the error rate of this method is relatively high, due to the uncontrollable interactions of amino acid residues and errors during the folding of polypeptides.
2
End-to-end fusion with a linker.
This is an improvement on the previous method, as the linker protein separates the domains of a bifunctional fusion protein, preventing the domains from interacting and interfering with each other. This method has been successfully applied in many researches.
3
Insertional fusion.
In this method, one domain is inserted in-frame into the middle of the other parent domain. Since a double connection allows fewer degrees of freedom than any single connection, insertional fusion proteins are expected to form more rigid and stable structures than end to end fusion proteins. However, the construction is much more complicated because it requires precise information on the parent domain structure to identify a suitable insertion site.
4
Branched fusion.
Instead of fusion at gene level, branched fusion works by directly fusion at protein level usually using enzymes. This method avoids problems of gene expression and folding of protein, but there are many limitations about the design of the linker.
Fig 1. Four strategies for fusion enzyme design. (A) Direct end-to-end fusion. (B) End-to-end fusion with a linker. (C) Insertional fusion. (D) Branched fusion (N and C denote the N-terminus and C-terminus of the protein, respectively). [1]
We take the advantages and disadvantages of each method into serious consideration. Since we currently do not have the knowledge and ability to analyze the domains of proteins, and complicated intersectional fusion is beyond our level, we choose the second method, end-to-end fusion with linkers.
Linker Selection
Our fusion protein NzFE (nitrite reducing fusion enzyme) is constructed using GGGGS x2 linker and EAAAK x2 linker. The reason for this selection is simple: these two linkers are best characterized. GGGGS x2 linker is a flexible linker with advantages like improving protein solubility, providing enzyme flexibility for catalysis, domain separation. EAAAK x2 linker is an α-helix forming linker, has advantages of improving protein solubility, providing"

Purdue iGEM hosted a booth at the Wabash River Enhancement Corporation’s (WREC) annual Wabash River Fest. It was great fun for all parties involved as passersby learned about DNA, built (and ate) their own licorice and marshmallow double helix models, and asked questions about synthetic biology and the phosphorus cycle. Young scientists tried their hands at pipetting, mixing colored water in eppendorf tubes.
Week 8
MONDAY, JULY 11
After a successful weekend participating in the Wabash River Fest, the team jumped back into lab work, plating a new culture of Shewie, miniprepping a promoter for use with digestion the next day, and preparing glycerol stock cultures of successfully transformed parts. A bioreactor brainstorming session with USDA-NSERL staff Dr. Ashley Hammac, Stan Livingston, and Scott McAfee left team members enthused about the prototype to come later in the week. Additionally, the team met with representatives of the Purdue Foundry regarding the possibility of developing a business model for the phosphorus removal system. If lab work continues to go well, this may be something to pursue in the fall.
TUESDAY, JULY 12
Wet lab work consisted of the digestion and ligation of all three remaining phosphorus genes in preparation for transformations into E. coli. Mental effort for the day was directed toward understanding E. coli‘s Pho regulon, the system of genes that control phosphorus within the organism, in an effort to determine which specific sequences of DNA may be helpful to up-regulate in the synthetic microbes to greater improve their efficiency.
WEDNESDAY, JULY 13
The bioreactor prototype was complete! Many thanks to the staff of the NSERL (National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory) for making it possible.
The prototype consists of two 5-gallon buckets, an aquarium pump and outflow tube to maintain constant water level and flow, and three separate ports around the base to channel water from the main reservoir into water filters that will eventually contain modified E. coli cartridges. Phosphorus is to be collected in these chambers, and effluent is controlled by the valves at the point where water flows from the filters. Further testing of the prototype will include the determination of the proper substrate to contain E. coli, optimum temperature and pH, and best water flow rate.

We invited Mingdao High school iGEM team to exchange ideas with us. We also held a pizza party to enhance more fun in this event.
We asked Mingdao high school to give a brief introduction to their project－Odor Let It Die. It’s really an interesting and creative idea. Although they are just high school students, their English presenters clearly explained what problems they want to solve. In the discussion section, we gave them several feedback and suggestions to perfect their project.
As for our presenting section, we successfully caught their eyes with our creative project－Operation Debug, which is to attract pests in the farm with PBAN.  After our amazing presentation, we believed they not only learned more knowledge about synthetic biology but also impressed by the future development potential of this field.
Because some high school students are pretty curious about our laboratory, so we guided them to pay a visit to lab at the end of this event. We introduce the equipment we usually use in the process of DNA synthesis.
Video conferencing with Xiamen University
We had a video conferencing with the iGEM team of Xiamen University, China, in May. As both teams just started their own research projects at that time, the main topics of this video conferencing only consisted of a brief description or introduction of the protocols for each other’s project, how the research team was established and organized. According to this short conferencing, we knew the Xiamen team mainly consists of sophomores or juniors, whereas they were surprised to learn that almost 90% of our team members are freshmen.

The quarterly income statement helps us track our expenditures and income throughout the year.  From this sheet we are able to determine our given spending patterns and when in our development we will need required investment.  Additionally it can tell us how to strategically align grant and funding programs and where we can appropriately place government assistance programs such as the Industry Research Assistance Program (IRAP).  As we move forward we can input our monthly cash flow and income statements to compare with our projects.  This can be used to help ensure future projections are on par with expectation based on past experience.   We are planning on using a staged investment strategy where continued investment is based on the team achieving previously set milestones with the investor.  These projections have outlined a breakeven point in our third year following commercialization.

Further, according to the theory of order of reaction, transcription rate can be convert into reaction rate constant.
$$ {K_r} = { v \over { {{[AraC]}_T} } } = {k_3} · { {[AraB]} \over { {k_m} + [AraB] } } $$
2) Empirical Formula
To determine the reaction rate constant of mRNA cleavage by RNase E, we chose the empirical formula, obtained from document literature.
After transcription, RNaseE, an enzyme, recognized specific site and then split mRNA into two sections. The process could be described as an reaction as follow:
$$ [mRNA] \xrightarrow {{k}_{d_1}} {{[mRNA]}_1} + {{[mRNA]}_2} $$
The reaction rate constant was obtained from document literature[2] as follow:
$$ {K_{d_1}} = { {{[H^+]}{K_{E1}}{k_0}} \over { {{K_{E1}}·{K_{E2}}} + { {[H^+]}{K_{E1}} } + {{[H^+]}^2} } } (2.1)$$
where ${K_{E1}}$ and ${K_{E2}}$ were acid dissociation constants of the free enzyme. $k_0$ is the maximal rate constant of the catalytically competent form of the enzyme. ${K_{d_1}}$ is the rate constant at a given pH.
The experimental data showed the pH data in the table below:

Summary
Today we discovered that only 5 of 7 of our bricks had been transformed. Biobricks C0178 and C0062 had not worked. We decided to plate out 400ul of the remaining culture that we had left from yesterday onto a appropriate plates for both of these bricks in hope of getting some growth for miniprep. Today we also set up 3ml overnights for the remaining 5 bricks that worked (R0062; R0079; C0161; C0179; J44000). We did these in plain LB, later realising that we should maintain the selection for the Amp resistance plasmid by setting up the overnights in LB+antibiotic.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"
Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html,"Taction can reliably recognize for our purposes is 4x4cm, which should be small enough. In the afternoon, we started working on a new app (expanding on the one we made last week), to introduce a more varied range of interaction with the widgets, for example clicking on a widget to expand and display information about it. We also got some basic functionality in terms of widgets recognizing when they’re tapped on with three markers and changing their state appropriately. Overall, despite the slight frustration (and a lot of cutting out paper squares) of the morning, today was a successful day in terms of functionality and design. We’re really moving forward with your prototype!
6/11/2015: Day 9
Today was a productive day. We worked on different marker functionality, so that each combination of four markers tapped on a bacteria creates a distinct plasmid combination for that bacteria. We also made infoboxes, both on top of the screen (visible at all times), and next to the bacteria (when it’s pulled up close). We also spent some time talking about the physical token that could be part of the exhibit, thinking about how to make markers fit nicely with each other in a single device.
6/12/2015: Day 10
We spent the morning developing another application to explore simulating wetlab actions, such as dragging things into flasks and petri dishes. We decided to just stick with a basic “pick a fruit flavor and ‘extract’ that gene” metaphor that lets users choose one of four fruits into a flask, then drag the flask to a petri dish, which would display an overlay letting the user know what DNA piece they need to insert into the physical plasmid token to get that gene. Of course, this is still very abstract high-level functionality that is just with testing purposes, but it was also nice to see how much quicker we’re getting in using the surface and the Cornerstone API after a couple of weeks. In the afternoon, we had another call with Anja and Romie (before they come visit on Monday!), just to show them the couple of prototypes we’ve developed since Tuesday. Since we decided we’re in a good place in terms of working with the MultiTaction, we spent the rest of the day brainstorming more concrete ideas about the exhibit and getting a more realistic and fleshed-out prototype.
6/15/2015: Day 11
Today was a busy day! Anja and Romie from the Tech Museum are visiting us for two days, and we’re spending most of those two days brainstorming ideas for the"

We participated in this initiative and created our own postcard. We have really enjoyed receiving the postcards of the other teams and learning about their interesting iGEM projects.
iGEM MANCHESTER (SCIENCE)
The iGEM Manchester team worked on a model to predict promoter strength and needed new promoter sequences to test it. Since we were characterising a new promoter, pAimX, we happily contributed the sequence of this promoter.
iGEM METU HS ANKARA (SCIENCE)
Beyond the collaboration, we also brought our help to teams which simply needed it. At the beginning of their project, the iGEM METU HS Ankara team contacted us asking a number of questions about setting up and running an iGEM project. We encouraged them to use the 20 kb of free DNA gBlocks provided by IDT, we explained to them how to perform a cloning with Golden Gate Assembly and gave them advice for the design of their parts, especially on introducing appropriate restriction sites into them.
iGEM BIELEFELD CeBiTec (SCIENCE)
We met the iGEM Bielefeld CeBiTec team at the European Meetup, which was organised by iGEM Munich, and we learnt that they were using siRNAs to induce a temporary knockdown in a cell. They argued that they wanted to find an alternative to CRISPR-Cas9 which introduces permanent knockouts and has a high off-target activity. To simplify their project, we proposed to them to perform a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) using the dead Cas9 enzyme (dCas9). This kind of transcriptional regulation is more efficient than RNA interference (siRNA), it is inducible and reversible, and it minimises the toxic effects of off-target cleavage by Cas9."

Human Practice Start-up Kit
Start-up Kit is the first comprehensive and handy tool that aims to help iGEM teams - particularly the new iGEMers, in initiating new human practice projects. Not only it gives iGEMers a quick guide to begin with, but also provides them with a preliminary concept of human practice and analyzed data regarding the past projects, which will give teams a jumpstart to flexibly come up with their own novel human practice project.
HKUST iGEM 2014 team spent nearly the whole summer to collect informations from all human practice projects done in the past. This large set of data was used as a base for the handbook, report, interview and the search engine. The serves exist to interpret and use the database in a different way. For instance, the database is condensed into simple numbers in the handbook to represent frequency of types of projects done in the past. Report, on the other hand, report incorporate the data to observe the general trend regarding human practice projects throughout the iGEM history. Interview questions were formed to show iGEM judges’ view on the previously done projects. Last but not least, search engine helps to find the desired information from the mass database more easily. However, due to the complexity and high level of computer coding knowledge required to build the search engine, we decided to reach out for help.  Kevin Christian Wongso, a graduate of the HKUST class 2014, who has a bachelor degree in computer science has lent us a helping hand. Thanks to his help, now users are able to search for information they want by simply typing a few keywords.
Handbook
This book provides advices from past human practice projects, past iGEM members as well as the judges.
