University of Toronto Modeling Collaboration
The British_Columbia team collaborated with the University of Toronto iGEM team to test the CRISPR guide model our team developed. The University of Toronto desired to choose guides to target the AraC gene with CRISPR/dCas9 (catalytically inactive Cas9) in E.coli K12 MG1655 genome. Model execution determined their original guides sequences, AAACGAGTATCCCGGCAGCA and AACGAGTATCCCGGCAGCAG had a relatively low partition functions of 47.276 and 35.326 respectively, indicating that there would be many off target CRISPR/dCas9 matches on the genome. We provided their team the full list of guides sequences available for the AraC, ranked based on the partition function, and specified two guides that would be good choices for their project. Due to the use of CRISPR/dCas9, guides targeting near the beginning of the gene are desirable. The guides our model suggested were: TGGGCGTTAAACGAGTATCC, appearing on the bottom strand (with a PAM site at the 33rd nucleotide from the start), which has a partition function of 75.957; and TTAACGCCGATTGAGGCCAA appearing on the top strand (with a PAM site at the 86th nucleotide from the start), and has a partition function of 72.671. These guides should provide a more precise target for CRISPR/dCas9 while retaining the desired function of dCas9.
University of Calgary Newsletter Collaboration
This year, the University of Calgary’s iGEM team founded the first ever Canadian iGEM newsletter. Nine universities and two high schools from all across Canada became a part of this inaugural project, which shared the progress, challenges, and successes of the 2017 iGEM competition. The newsletter provides the opportunity to reach out for collaboration from fellow Canadian teams, and it led to our modelling collaboration with the University of Toronto. The Canadian iGEM Newsletter exemplifies iGEM’s promotion of inter-team and multidisciplinary collaboration, and we are honoured to have been a part of it.

Ligation
Summary
Ligation is a commonly used protocol in synthetic biology. In molecular cloning ligation is the process by which external DNA is inserted into a vector DNA, often a plasmid, using the enzyme DNA ligase. The newly formed DNA, or recombinant DNA, can then be analyzed or transformed.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform ligation. T4 DNA Ligase Buffer, vector DNA, insert DNA, water, and T4 DNA Ligase are metered on the chip and are then mixed together. The solution then undergoes incubation, after which the recombinant DNA solution can pipetted out from the chip and used in further molecular cloning procedures

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant"
TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html," to new risks and risk perceptions. This has been observed for genetic engineering, nuclear energy, cars, etc. Modern research on the newest technology may also come with unforeseen risks or possible mistakes. When these potential errors are noticed, it is too late to prevent them from occurring. BioErrors may occur when e.g. a deliberate release into the environment does not work out the way it was predicted, e.g. new pathogens or toxins are released. In that instance, the problems that NGOs like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth warn for, will turn out to be real problems. Therefore, caution in using new technology like transgenetics or creating more artificial biological systems is always advised. Regulation on genetic engineering techniques like used in synthetic biology is already in place , but BioErrors may not always be foreseen.
Besides unforeseen consequences on a technological level, also new ethical considerations appear in synthetic biology. Creating more artificial systems makes one wonder what “life” actually is and to what extent the autonomy or quintessence of an organism is more important than technological progress. From a biological point, something lives when it has its own energy metabolism and it can reproduce all by itself. From a moral point of view, this may be different, especially with increasing levels of artificialness of “biological” or “natural” systems. That is why in synthetic biology, artificial life is an issue to consider: what is the boundary between “organism” and “machine”?
3.2.3 Synthetic biology and open source databases
Besides issues related to errors in research or application of synthetic biology and issues related to artificial life definitions, ethical considerations on synthetic biology related to the open source character of the technology also need to be examined. The proposed BioBrick approach of the constructing part of synthetic biology gives rise to a number of ethical considerations. One of these is related to the intellectual property issues described below : the relation between open source technology and commercialization of ideas, patent laws, etc. need to be considered.
But besides these IP related issues, one also must deliberate on the deliberate (mis)use of the open source BioBrick database. Some applications or “devices” made out of BioBricks from a publicly available database may have a “dual use” character. This concept can be related to e.g. the sharp edge technology of a knife: a knife-like object can be used to cut a sandwich into peaces or to kill someone. But everyone who has tried to slice bread with a samurai sword knows that’s not really the purpose of this particular device. From the BioBrick database also metaphoric sam"

Reaction Mix:
- 500 ng – Template
- 5 µl – 10x Buffer
- 1 µl – NEB Enzyme 1 (10 Units/µl) = 10 Units in 50 µl reaction
- 1 µl – NEB Enzyme 2 (10 Units/µl) = 10 Units in 50 µl reaction
- dH2O to 50 µl
- TOTAL – 50 µl
Procedure:
1. Calculate how much template is needed for digestion. Then calculate how much water needs to be added to make a 50 µl reaction.
2. Pipette appropriate amounts of dH20, template, and 10x Buffer in that order into a PCR tube (200 µl). Mix reagents together by vortexing and then tapping tube on desk to keep reagents on the bottom of the PCR tube.
3. Add appropriate amounts of Enzyme 1 and Enzyme 2. Once added gently swirl around reaction mix with pipette tip.
4. Incubate at 37o C for 1 – 2 hours
5. Incubate at 80 oC for 20 minutes to deactivate the restriction enzymes
6. Run a gel of your digestions on a gel with low temperature melting agarose. Run at 100V for 1 hr. 30 min.

1 Phenylketonuria
1.1 Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Detail
1.1.1 How it was modified
1.1.2 Useful Links
Phenylketonuria
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder where the body is unable to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. This is because of a deficiency of an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. Absence of PAH causes phenylalanine to break down into phenylketone instead. A chronically high level of phenylalanine, called hyperphenylalaninemia will result. Phenylalanine then accumulates in blood and tissues and results in characteristic symptoms of PKU.  Left untreated, PKU can lead to problems with brain development resulting in progressive mental retardation and brain damage.
PKU is usually detected at birth, and all new born babies are tested for the disease using a heel prick test. However, there is currently no cure for the condition. Current treatments are centred around following a very strict low-protein diet. By engineering the E.ncapsulator to manufacture PAH, we hope that our cells can be taken as a dietary supplement to replace the missing PAH. This will break down phenylalanine from the diet in the gut, before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.
Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Detail
Phenylalanine Hydroxylase is an enzyme that catalyses the converstion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. This is conversion is by the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon ring of phenylalanine, to form tyrosine.
Since PAH is usually found in the liver, it unsurprisingly lacks any natural resistance to proteases found in the intestine. In order to overcome this problem we introduced a mutation into the structure of PAH to increase its resistance to proteolytic degradation. The delivery of PAH by The Encapsulator is particularly relevant on two accounts. Firstly, it represents a landmark in metabolic subcontraction and secondly, it offers a treatment for a genetic disease.
We have also modified the PAH sequence on two accounts, in order to remove restriction enzyme recognition sites that would otherwise not"

Supervisors
Prof. Dr. Sebastian Maerkl and Dr. Barbara Grisoni, our two     supervisors, stood by our side throughout the whole     competition. They helped us with valuable advice, questioned and corrected our protocols     and experiment designs when we didn't know what to do anymore. Sebastian Maerkl allowed the team to use all the equipment of the Laboratory of Biological Network characterization (LBNC)     located at EPFL, which was crucial for our daily routine.
A huge thanks to our PhD advisors from Maerkl's lab, Ekaterina Petrova for all her advices on how to perform microfluidic assays, data analysis and on how to present our scientific data, Zoe Swank for helping us plot the graphs, providing counsel on MATLAB scripts and helping us manufacture the wafers we used for microfluidics assays, Ivan Istomin for his teaching of scientific rigorousness and how to make MITOMI chips, Barbora Lavickova for her vaste knowledge on cell-free expression systems, and Gregoire Michielin for all the help he provided on beads assays. They helped us with the countless problems we had in the lab along with a big support during the Wiki Freeze.
We'd also like to thank the TAs for their generosity since we ended up using so much of their personal stashes that they have probably spent the last nine months eating plain pasta and 1 potato on special occasions.

UChicago,2014,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", and it appears we have MAJOR issues with mislabelling. While we do have IPTG+GFP confirmed, aroF and TyrR are not in anything The plasmid mcherry is not even in anything. What was labeled as aroF+mCherry actually contains the general promoter, and one labeled promoter+TyrR is actually IPTG but without GFP!!! Are our mCherry and promoter plasmids mislabeled?! Or was it just the ligation products? The struggle is five real. We made overnight cultures of all the ligation products that looked promising based on the amount of colonies (our colony PCR did not work and this will allow us to keep moving forward while troubleshooting colony PCR): 4x IGMD (IPTG---GFP---MutD), 4x IGMH (IPTG---GFP---MutH). 4x IGMT (IPTG---GFP---MutT). 4x IGDam/IGD (IPTG---GFP---Dam). 4x IGUC (IPTG---GFP---Umu’C), 4x IGER (IPTG---GFP---EmrR).

This week we’re continuing lots of cloning. We were planning to make competent cells, but messed up the OD (which should be about 0.6) :(. Sadness. PCR’d out the AroF promoter and the TyrR gene and fragment isolated them.
Tuesday
Re-inoculated new cells to retry making competent cells again. Hopefully they work this time. Did appropriate digestions on paroF, TyrR, the mCherry plasmid, and the IPTG-GFP mutator plasmid as we continue to clone all three different constructs (mutators, general promoter-TyrR, and paroF-mCherry). Did PCR’s using VF and VR2 primers to confirm the identity of the mCherry and constitutive promoter plasmids. However, mCherry looks possibly bad, so we ended up going ahead with cloning of only TyrR into the constitutive promoter plasmid. We got back sequencing results for three previous attempted ligations of Dam, EmrR, and MutT into IPTG-GFP, all of which look good. Yay, first real biob"

We have developed the Youtube video explaining the biosafety levels, and encouraged people in lab environment to watch it. Finally, in an effort to promote the spirit of cooperation, sharing and mutual contribution of iGEM, we have reached out to other teams joining the iGEM Jamboree, and hosted regional meet-up. Even before and after the regional meet-up, we held discussions and mentorship with Korea University team on lab works and iGEM experiences. We also met with HAFS team and provided assistance on parts submission and using BioBricks and other materials included in the Kit.  We have shared with them our failure and misunderstanding we had experienced last year which, we hope, would be entertaining if not informative.

Threat of Antibiotics-Resistance and Countermeasures: Korea and US
The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a global health problem that affects nations across borders and boundaries and rapidly spreads throughout the world.  These nightmare bacteria pose catastrophic threat to people everywhere in the world.
Our project is Early Detection of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria using Quorum Sensing. It is closed related to the surveillance and containment of the pathogens. With the understanding, we have conducted case study of Korea and the US on the current status of antibiotic resistant bacteria infection and the countermeasures.  We have gathered data on the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and countermeasures taken as well as contemplated in Korea and the US.  For this, we have relied on various materials and documentations, and some of them  are translated from Korean.
Introduction
On November 11, 1945, Alexander Fleming delivered his Nobel Prize speech. This great man who discovered penicillin warned that bacteria could become resistant to these remarkable drugs. Indeed, the development of each new antibacterial drug has been followed by the detection of resistance to it. The development of resistance is a normal evolutionary process for microorganisms, but it is accelerated by the selective pressure exerted by widespread use of antibacterial drugs. Resistant strains are able to propagate and spread where there is non-compliance with infection prevention and control measures.
Even considering regional discrepancy in the data quality as  well as quantity, resistance patterns for the bacteria of public health importance is sufficient to alarm the world. For example, the proportion resistant of S.aureus to commonly used specific antibiotic drugs exceeded 50% in many countries. Furthermore, there are limitations in effective oral treatment options for some common community-acquired"
UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," would entail that the synthetic biology community would be endowed with an operational framework in which it can voluntarily regulate itself to avoid misuse. Individual scientists are then able to work with codes of conduct that have been developed by the community itself and not by government. The main argument for this is that this would prevent a governmental overregulation that, per definition, is external to the community. Nevertheless, a complete disconnect would also imply that the importance of democratic engagement in the matter would be poorly recognised at the time when societal implications are pertinent (Selgelid 2009). Nonetheless, there have been some concerns with selfregulatory initiatives in the sense that they have been thought of as a form of “closed-shop” governance by NGOs like the ETC Group, denoting that regulatory self-reliance would never develop into meaningful action (Campos 2010; ETC Group 2009; Pollack 2010). Team member Georgia agreed that self-reliance or self-regulation would not be beneficial for scientists:
“It is clearly not unjustified to be cautious, I mean if we were incautious that would be bad because if scientists, as much as we have our safeguards, I feel if we didn’t have as much pressure from the outside world, the safeguards would be like less stringent, I’m not sure because I don’t know to what extent other people, other scientists, I don’t know how they feel but like, I think it’s always important to have societal pressure so that everybody is constantly checking back on themselves. But, yeah, I don’t think cautiousness is unjustified but maybe just blind fear is unjustified. They like hear something and then they don’t attempt to actually look into it further and then they just absorb all the information from bad sources and then that is unjustified because they are not making any effort to understand just to regurgitate the things they have heard from the Daily Mail”.
At the same time, however, there was general agreement in the team that if the public were involved through the workings of government, science could not afford to wait for policy-makers to get a handle on innovation that they see as being essential for society’s development.

[Georgia] “As long as policy keeps up”.

To demonstrate our pathogen blood testing system on a real adult mosquito, we collaborated with NCHU_Taichung iGEM Team 2018 from Taiwan and conducted an experiment of DNA microinjection into adult female mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
In addition to this experiment, we also visited the Mosquito Lab of Prof. Wu-Chun Tu in National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan. We presented our idea and got the valuable feedback from him. Moreover, we learned the physiology and behavior of mosquitoes when sucking and attracted by human blood from Dr. Hau-you Tzeng. The knowledge we learned was turned into our prototype design.
EXPERIMENT at NCHU
↓ Make microinjection needles by pulling glass capillary tubes
↓ Anesthetize the adult mosquitoes on ice
↓ Fill the needle with the DNAs in Cellfectin II reagent with E. coli or not
↓ Inject the DNA by inserting into the thorax of the mosquito.
↓ Recover the mosquito for 2 days
RESULT
The mosquito injected with DNA plus E. coli showed fluorescence signal in Gel Imaging System and Blue LED Box after 2 days of DNA microinjection. This result further proved our concept into a reality.
To make GE mosquito GFP reporter system come to the world, some may be considered: product packaging, result reading device and protocol, safety, as well as product marketing.
We developed two products as one set for our reporter and reading system:
1. KISSING BOXTM: GE mosquitoes kept in the box for sucking blood
2. BLUE LED BOX: a scanner box equipped with blue led for observing the green fluorescence signal.
We made a matchbox-size KISSING BOXTM with a clear acrylic sheet (as a transparent window) on the top and a cover of fine metal mesh"

With help from Henrike, Douglas checked the mistakes in the K112808 (lysis cassette) sequence. On the entire sequence, only 7 errors occurred in several reactions, and are therefore likely to be actual errors in the DNA. They occur in positions (with regard to the original sequence in the registry):
70: CTC codon substituded for CTA. Both code for leu, so that position is still valid
The following are missing bases:
677 and 684: lie in the junction between sub-bricks K112805 and K112806. Still valid.
1199: lies in the junction between K112806 and B0010. Still valid.
1387: second base of K112807, in the non-coding region. Still valid.
1698: lies in the junction between K112807 and B0010. Still valid.
1701: beginning of B0010, in the non-coding region. Still valid.
In conclusion, there is one codon substitution, and six missing bases that all lie within the junction between two bricks or the non-coding region of a brick. Experimentally, the brick does lyse cells in culture. Therefore, the sequence appears valid.

We practised MITOMI with TetR linear template and random DNA sequence + target DNA sequence. We performed ITT (in vitro transcription/translation) on TetR linear template before adding it to the chip. However, the results are disappointing: we have more DNA binding for the random sequence (1000 RFU change) than for the target sequence (500 RFU)...
Images: Green fluorescence comes from TetR (labeled Lysines) and red fluorescence comes from DNA (cy-5 labeled). We can clearly see that the protein amount seems to be the same, whereas the DNA fluorescence is decreased.
Perhaps the ITT doesn't yield a functional TetR, or we didn't have the optimal concentration of binding DNA"

When the team was invited to give a talk to the JIC researchers we were extremely excited. At the talk we gave an overview of what iGEM is, our project, how it developed over the summer and informing them about aspects of human practice. The team showed them a clip of the futuristic applications film. We enjoyed presenting our work and results, as well as having an opportunity to improve our presentation skills before the European jamboree. There seemed to be a real interest by the researchers in to our project, and the advice given was encouraging giving encouraging advice. The researchers also seemed very interested to hear more about our human practices elements of iGEM, wanting to know what we had discovered about the public's opinion our research. More than anything, researchers at the John Innes Centre couldn't believe that we were undergraduate students who had been working together for 10 weeks!
The NRP iGEM teams are helping to foster collaborations between scientists across the NRP and have begun to create a sense of community amongst NRP synthetic biologists.
SGM microbiology synthetic biology (September 3rd -5th)
The society of general microbiology held a 3 day synthetic biology conference at the University of Warwick. Three members of the UEA NRP iGEM team were lucky enough to go and enjoy talks on Streptococcus, molecular motors, and the dynamics of the genome and designer microbes. The event also gave the team member the opportunity to meet other synthetic biology scientists as well as informing them of the current advances in the field and inspiring them with the future possibilities.  The event also allowed the team members to present a poster and therefore engage with the scientific community, both informing them more about the iGEM competition and our project . The team believed it was important for the scientists in the synthetic biology world to have the opportunity to meet undergraduate iGEM members, allowing them to express the skills it has allowed them to develop and to encourage further interest in to lab groups forming teams, and funding iGEM projects.
The Biochemical Society kindly mentioned us in their blog post
Not only did the Biochemical Society generously fund our project, they also were kind enough to feature our teams efforts in an encouraging ethical debate around the subject of synthetic biology (via our Quanticare video) in their blog.

Part of the project was also to share experiences with other teams from all over the world. These experiences were partly active and partly just participation. Collaborations helped us create a network of interacting students and teams that taught us what is the meaning of an active scientific community. After all, what makes a discovery or an experience beautiful is being able to share it.
BioBrick Tutorial DTU
DTU Biobuilders, DTU University, Denmark
In April, DTU Biobuilders, iGEM team from the Technical University of Denmark, invited us and other teams from Sweden, Norway and Denmark to participate to a BioBrick tutorial: a three day event in which we learnt how to build a BioBrick both in theory and in the lab and we also had the opportunity to exchange opinions about other topics. In particular:
We worked in the lab with the BioBricks, we combined three genes into a plasmid by digestion, ligation and transformation in E.coli.
We had talks about the iGEM Interlab Study: the largest international biology research project, by three alumni who talked about their experiences in iGEM, and one about Human Practices.
We had a workshop on how to pitch our iGEM project.
We had a talk with Abigail from iGEM HQ about after iGEM.
Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund
iGEM Lund, Lund University, Sweden
The Nordic iGEM Conference is hosted annually and serves as a meeting point for all the Nordic iGEM teams. It is important as teams get to meet other iGEM competitors to exchange ideas, knowledge, and discuss potential collaborations. It is hosted by the previous year's winners of the conference. iGEM Lund, being the 2017 winners, have received the honor of hosting the 2018 event. The NiC serves the purpose of gathering and preparing the Nordic teams for The Giant Jamboree event in Boston. In the conference, we had the opportunity to present our project and we also had a poster session.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," while designing the Marburg Collection, we realized that a toolbox with maximum flexibility can easily be used in more than one bacterial species. Because alternative bacterial chassis, apart from E. coli, are gaining increasing importance (Kim et al. 2016. )  , a toolbox that is compatible with more than one bacterial species enables scientists to work with organisms that have the exact properties needed for specific applications. Our vision is to establish the Marburg Collection as the first broad-host range golden-gate-based cloning toolbox.
Figure 1:  Hierarchical cloning is facilitated by subsequent Golden Gate reactions.
Basic building blocks like promoters or terminators are stored in LVL0 plasmids. Parts from each category of our collection can be chosen to built LVL 1 plasmids harboring a single transcription unit. Up to five transcription units can be assembled into a LVL2 plasmid.
We investigated existing bacterial toolboxes like EcoFlex (Moore et al. 2016.) and iGEMs PhytoBrick system, which is closely related to the GoldenBraid cloning (Sarrion-Perdigones et al. 2011.) . All these toolboxes are based on predefined vectors that preset the origin of replication and the antibiotic resistance cassette thus preventing their use in organisms that are not compatible with either feature. We wanted to give scientists the freedom of choice to select oris and resistance cassettes that suit their organisms and applications best. This flexibility is possible because our toolbox does not rely on classical “backbones” but instead functions by the complete de novo assembly of at least eight basic genetic parts.
All basic parts like promoters or resistance parts are stored in LVL0 plasmids. The assembly of a plasmid comprising a single transcription unit is done by assembling at least eight parts resulting in one LVL1 plasmid. One to five LVL1 plasmids can then be used for a subsequent round of assembly to obtain a multigene LVL2 plasmid which could already harbor a full synthetic metabolic pathway consisting of up to five enzymes. Our toolbox even allows more rounds of assembly, each combining up to five constructs of the previous level. This enormous cloning capacity results theoretically in an  infinite number of transcription units that can be assembled in a small amount of time.

Then, we introduced our project—how to effectively decompose the kitchen waste with low osmotic pressure (high salinity) osmotic pressure. We basically talked about the factors which can affect the efficiency or the ability of yeasts which are used to decompose the kitchen waste, and our own solution.
Sponsor
Face-to-face raising fund
Our team members also introduced our project in the real life: they visited some companies which are related to biology and explained our project to them.We got the funding from Nanjing Zhengbeicehui Equipment Inc., Hunan Tianxingjian Project Management Inc., Shanghai Songyuan Cork Foam Inc., Beijing Shiyuan Business Inc., Kanglihua Company and Beijing Huaxiafengxing Advertisement Inc, etc. Through this practice, we not only challenged ourselves in negotiating with adults, especially the managers of some enterprises, but also expanded our influence in the society such as the marketplace.
Online funding
We wrote an article on the internet to describe what synthetic biology and iGEM are, and what we were doing in our own research. The article attracted more than 100 net citizens to read. They browsed our webpage and got to know some details about our project. Many of them are really interested in our project; they not only donate money to support us, but also gave us many inspiring comments, which encouraged us a lot for further study.
Propaganda in Families and communities
Most of our family and community have no idea about the synthetic biology. We gave lectures to our parents and our neighbors. Most of people are confused with or held some wrong opinions about synthetic biology. Through our introduction and explanation, they realized that synthetic biology is not as horrible or scary as what they used to think. We changed their opinions, also taught them some basic knowledge of the synthetic biology that they have never thought of.  We also helped many children understand that biology is really useful and interesting. We not only introduced our project, we also spread the influence of the synthetic biology and iGEM.
Impact
Environmental impact
Our product can help the environment in three ways. First of all, with our modified yeast, food waste decomposition rate will be greatly increased, and then we no longer need to worry about the soil pollution which is brought by traditional kitchen waste digestion-landfill. As the amount of kitchen waste that is digested by landfill decline, salt and other toxicant will gradually stop entering into the soil. Secondly, after decomposition by our genetically modified yeast,, some of the useless kitchen waste might be efficiently changed"

Overview
Background
Background - The era of cellular memory
Biological memory has currently been defined as a sustained cellular response to a transient stimulus1. Cellular memory devices with cell or cell population have been developed in recent years. Some of them are based on transcriptional level, like toggle switch2, the others are based on DNA level by employing various recombinases3, 4 or CRISPR5, 6. Although existing devices may have different functioning mechanisms, they all share the same ability to store the past and retrieve it whenever we need. Here, we will introduce some existing memory devices and the potential usage of cellular memory before introducing our project.
Memory devices based on transcriptional level
There are two types of devices in this category, toggle switches and positive-feedback loops. They all store the information by staying in a certain transcriptional state. Most of the devices here are mimics of circuits that have already existed in various organisms.
After the bacteriophage lambda switch was found in 2000, a genetic toggle switch was firstly constructed in Escherichia coli2 as a memory device(Fig.1). With this repression loop, the transcriptional system switches between two stable states. As shown, the repression loop mainly consists of two components, promoters and repressors(known as transcriptional factor). Repressor 1 inhibits Promoter 1 from expressing Represser 2, while Repressor 2 inhibits Promoter 2 from expressing Represser 1. In other words, Represser 1 and Represser 2 are mutual antagonists, which means only one of them can be highly expressed. Without inducers, both of the states are possible. However, after the induction, things may change. For example, when Repressor 1 is highly expressed, Inducer 1 can stop the inhibition of Repressor 1 and starts transcribing Repressor 2. After that, Repressor 2 represses Promoter 2, thus reducing the concentration of Represser 1 and switching to another state. Furthermore, even if Inducer 1 disappears after the transient induction, this state is stable. By adding a reporter following either"

Nico is a PhD student at Wageningen UR in the Microbiology department. Troubleshooting sessions with Nico is just about the most effective way to overcome stagnation. Due to Nico’s talent to make the most complex things seem easy as pie he became the go-to-person for all wet lab students. This went so far that his colleagues, who share his office put a “Nico is not here”-sign on their door to keep us from entering. It goes without saying that this was of course without success.
How will we remember Nico:
“I grew them overnight, so about 8 hours.”
“You mean 16 hours?”
“Do I? Oh right, I guess.”
“So I guess you learned something today! There’s 24 hours in a day.”
Robert Smith
Rob is the postdoc in the department of Systems and Synthetic biology. He is in charge of the day to day supervision of the iGEM team. Rob is a mathematician by trade, hailing from the shores of Britain. Usually the first person to arrive in the morning, he is the early bird of the department. If he is not working you can probably find him playing field hockey or doing some form of exercise. An unconventional Brit that does not enjoy a cup of tea, he has adapted to the Dutch way of dairy filled sandwiches for lunch and a cup of coffee in the morning. If you see him at the Jamboree feel free to say hello.
How will we remember Rob:
“What do you mean Bob, be more specific.”
Ruben van Heck
Ruben is a PhD student at Wageningen UR in the department of Systems and Synthetic Biology. He was part of the iGEM team of 2011 himself, a supervisor of the 2013 team and he was also a judge in the iGEM competition 2013 (Regional jamboree Lyon). Always friendly and patient to a degree that makes you question his sanity, is he the one that will let us use his car so we can make it on time"

A ligation mix containing just B0015 was also made, marked as NI (no insert) in the freezer. Transformations with the 50, 51, 52 and B0015 ligation mixes were carried out. Because yields of DNA from the gel extraction were so low, 1.5ul of DNA were used in the transformations.

Protein Cages
Higher order self assembling protein assemblies are a commonplace in nature, one common example being ferritin, which carries iron in many single-celled organisms. Due to their encapsulating function and box-like structure, such assemblies are often called protein “cages.” Inspired by these natural sources, much research has been done into creating synthetic cages with new properties such as stability, size, and subunit types. Furthermore, in many cases applications of cages have been suggested, but many have not been tested experimentally.
One such application is targeted drug delivery. By specifying the region to which drugs should be delivered, effect can be limited to the areas desired and avoid damaging or affecting other parts of the body. Moreover it ensures the drugs actually affect their desired targets with ideally high efficiency. Since these drugs would likely be inserted into the bloodstream, a function directly connected to that method would be a first step into drug delivery.
Thrombosis, when a clot forms inside the blood stream, is associated with widespread diseases including stroke and many heart conditions. Anticoagulants prevent clot formation by interfering with clotting factors and allow a smoother blood flow, restoring normal circulation. However these drugs can have side effects, a main one being problems stopping bleeding from wounds. By localizing and minimizing the amount of drug used, issues such as these would become less serious. A protein cage containing an anticoagulant is well-suited to this. To specify the clot as a target, an associated enzyme or byproduct of clotting could be used. Thrombin is one such enzyme, promoting clotting in most cases. It does, however, cleave a certain amino acid sequence. This sequence, if properly inserted into a protein cage containing the anticoagulant, would result in disassembly of the cage, release of the drug molecule to the targeted area,and destruction of the clot.
The goal of our project is to modify a protein cage that can be disassembled using a thrombin protease and to use this protein cage to deliver a drug molecule. We are using two previously created synthetic cages, one composed of 12 subunits forming a tetrahedron cage while the other composed of  24 subunits forming an octahedron cage. For each of these protein cages, we have designed mutants with inserted thrombin cleavage sites and hope"

In addition, we also assisted H14Z1_hangzhou to complete the design of the first level menu and the second level menu in the navigation bar, so that their results can be better displayed in front of the judges.
Second, XMU-China and H14Z1_hangzhou assumed the task of the experimental representation each other. H14Z1_hangzhou helped XMU-China measure the fluorescence characterization data of BBa_K2623025. XMU-China helped H14Z1_hangzhou complete the experimental curve of the number of engineering bacteria in the process of fermenting yoghurt with the change of time.
The experimental steps and results are as following:
Experimental steps:
1. The first day, Lactobacillus NZ9000 and GMCA respectively were inoculated into 50ml GM17 medium, fermented at 30 ℃ overnight (about 12h). (Place them in a 30 ℃ incubator, no shaker shocks required).
2. Next day, fresh milk was heated to about 55-60 degrees Celsius, and then adding some white sugar, 3000rpm stirring for 10 minutes mixing. Divided them into 250ml shaker, and the volume of liquid in every shaker is 100ml.
3. Sterilize the above solution at 90 ℃ for 5min, then cool it to 30 degrees Celsius to prepare for inoculation and fermentation. Then collect Lactobacillus acidophilus in shaker and clean them 1 times with sterile water. Add Lactobacillus acidophilus to the sample making the initial OD is 0.1 (600nm). Then let them ferment statically in the 250ml shaker at 30 ℃ (Place them in the 30 ℃ incubator, without shaker vibration)
4. Measure the OD value every two hours and count the corresponding number of cells to draw the curve. Simultaneously, test the pH of the solution (Measure for 14 hours)

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice"

The average hue and luminance are utilized to calculate the standard deviation of the triplicate. By looking at the standard deviation, it was determined that the hue values were most consistent in the triplicate. These values can then be used to compare relative levels of degradation between the different constructs (tsPurple, tsPurpleDAS, and tsPurpleLAA). Chrome-Q system methodology can be found in the Model page.

The hue values of tsPurple at different levels of IPTG induction
Important Note: Hues values range from 0 to 360 degrees. The hue values in the samples begin at around 270 degrees (purple) and increase through 360 degrees. The hues value 0 uL IPTG concentration wraps around to a low hue value of around 40 degrees. To process these hues, 360 degrees were added to values less than 180 degrees, which is why some values are greater than 360.

Thursday 17th June: On Tigers and Small Disasters
A discussion on designing from our local, personal perspective as opposed to global was an interesting precursor to our visit to the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS).
We presented along with Zack Denfeld to the NCBS scientists, Srishti staff and an interesting mix of academics and NGO's. The team had the mixed pleasure of hearing the talks again (sorry!) but in a new context: inside the scientific establishment. Did we change the way we spoke? What kinds of critique did we encounter from the NCBS scientists? The discourse continued in the NCBS garden with the scientists, amongst spice plants curated as part of an exhibition on historical bioprospecting, Such Treasure and Rich Merchandize .
In the afternoon, with a view over NCBS, we discussed as a group. How do we feel about technology and what happens when it fails? After these last few weeks, how does everyone feel about synthetic biology? Some interesting points about the social constructs around science were raised in the morning presentations, like the example of a GM wheat introduced into India that failed - women were uncomfortable kneading it as the ground grain texture wasn't right to make local foods.
Should we just accept it and move forward? Can we deny progress? An interesting idea was raised - that we can only learn about how to handle a technology by a failure, perhaps even a small one, effectively 'inoculating' society against future grand disaster. So what is a small disaster? Deepwater Horizon is a certainly a grand oil disaster, despite countless previous spills.
Zach got controversial: tigers! With just 1444 left, could a bacteria be engineered to specifically target these national treasures? So rare, their loss wouldn't have much impact on the ecosystem, but it would raise huge debate about what we want from a technology. 'Cute megafauna' touched our hearts more than the extinguishing of the sun.

Aalto-Helsinki,2017,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," show that although Propionibacterium acnes can be found on the skin of acne patients, it is more likely a result than a cause for inflammation that is the main reason for acne. Therefore, we should stress that anti-inflammatory treatment might be the key to actual acne treatment, while our product would focus more on the cosmetic side, and therefore self-esteem, by preventing some of the new pimples from forming. This is the reason why, for example, isotretinoin and the antibiotic tetracycline with anti-inflammatory properties are effective as a treatment and we should recommend using also other products while using Porify.
It is to be noted that at least in Finland antibiotics and topicals are still prescribed more often than the harsher treatment isotretinoin, because a lot of patients with acne are treated by general practitioners, who cannot prescribe isotretinoin. In some countries isotretinoin is not available or is even banned, so there might be demand for new acne treatments and products.
Both options, wound care and acne, had several pros and cons and the decicion was not an easy one. Nevertheless, even if Dermcidin might have some wound care applications in the future, we felt that acne seemed more promising and matched our team's expertise better. It is also an ideal application to help spread information about synthetic biology since almost everyone experiences acne at some point of their life and therefore the familiarity of the subject might encourage them to have an actual dialog with us, despite their possible negative attitudes against GMOs in general.
Focus on Acne
In order to gain more insight on how acne affects the mental well-being of adolescents, we contacted psychotherapist Pepita Hänninen, who is specialized in working with young people. She has been interviewed for newspapers about acne and how parents should react if their kids are suffering from acne. She thinks that the problem should not be belittled since it can have a major impact on young people. Hänninen thinks that acne can worsen a person’s mental state if they are already feeling insecure or depressed, but the skin condition itself is rarely the main cause of mental health problems. Still, acne can be a major problem for young people, since adolescents form their identity during puberty and pimples often go hand in hand with the increased sex hormone levels. Appearance might have a bigger role in a young person’s life and sometimes it is difficult for adults to understand that. Then again, in some cases, parents might make a problem out of acne when it was not bothering the adolescent in the first place. It takes some discretion to find the right way to deal with"

After washing the column with 10 CV Ni-NTA-elution buffer the elution process was started. At a process volume of 670 mL to 750 mL the chromatogram shows a remarkable widespread peak (UV-detection signal 189 mAU) caused by the elution of a high amount of proteins. The run of the curve show a fronting. This can be explained by the elution of weakly bound proteins, which elutes at low imidazol concentrations. A better result could be achieved with a step elution strategy ( see purification of the 3 L Fermentation above ). To detect ECOL the corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#ANDGate_-_-_TEXT.html," errors outside of the coding region of the parts appear to have rendered them inert. With a few more weeks of lab work, it may have been possible to resurrect both final AND-gate constructs by using PCR mutagenesis to correct the sequence errors in each respective module.
Conclusion
During this subproject, we sought to create and characterise two different forms of genetic AND-gate. It was planned that one of these forms of AND-gate would serve as the logic controller of our Campylobacter biosensor, where two systems developed by other subprojects such as mtlR , araC , or AI-2 would act as the transcriptional controllers for AND-gate modules. Due to DNA sequence errors, we were not able to measure a response from either the split-GFP or split T7-RNAP AND gates. However, all the basic parts described have been submitted to the BioBrick registry and should be available for use by future teams.

Former Method
Goal:
    Design a system to achieve the re-use of carbon dioxide in the spacecraft. The system, in other words, will convert carbon dioxide into the sugar compounds offering heat supply, so as to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft and ensure the astronauts' long-term space travel or space presence.
Former Method:
    Since the photosynthesis efficiency of plant is only about 1%[1] , it is clearly not a practical way to use the green leaves to maintain the carbon cycle of the spacecraft where the space is narrow while the demand for energy is huge.
    Last year, the iGEM team from Aachen University of Technology in Germany[2] designed a synthetic pathway for Glycogen with the methanol from E.coli and finally won the Best manufacture prize. They got the methanol,which is the raw material, through the electric conversion. And then, they combined Methanol Condensation Cycle with Glycogen Metabolism, and they succeeded to synthesize the glycogen. However, in this synthetic pathway, an obvious defect lies on the additional requirement of a five-carbon sugar used together with methanol and then to form glycogen. Since the five carbon compound must be obtained in other glycolytic pathways by E.coli, which will consume at least one molecule of six carbon sugar to synthesize a glycogen hexose sugar monomer.
Figue 1, Synthesis pathway diagram of AACHEN2015.
    This route aforementioned cannot be used to synthesize Glycogen only with one carbon compound as the carbon source, so as to be deficient for the closed-loop system of spacecraft. But this idea about utilizing the Methanol Condensation Cycle and Glycogen Metabolism into the synthesis of glycogen has stimulated us greatly.
Direction:
To synthesize Glycogen in the presence of one-carbon compound as the sole carbon source, we need to find or even design a new pathway for the synthesis of five carbon saccharide from formaldehyde.
A simple and effective method for the complex reaction involved with so many enzymes should be found to enhance the interaction and cooperation within each enzyme and improve the efficiency of the overall reaction.
The toxicity of the formaldehyde is high and unstable"

Camps, Class and Lectures
1.Hands-on experience summer camp with Qingdao No.2 High School.
This summer, we held a camp with 28 high school students in our university. Our goal was to motivate their interest of bioscience by doing experiments and teach them how to learn by oneself (Internet is a good choice). In this camp, we prepared many experiments about molecular biology, such as miniprep and PCR.
*Why we held this meeting?
We want to let more people know about synthetic biology and pay attention to biosafety. Now, synthetic biology still is a developing subject in China. Many students even haven’t heard about it. As the hard core of developing bioscience and the future of the world, the more knowledge they get, the better the world is. Besides, by sharing our knowledge with them, we trained our skills of talking and understood the concept of synthetic biology with deeper expression.
*What we did in this camp?
In this camp, we gave many classes to participants, such as the principle of PCR, introduction of synthetic biology and iGEM. During the class, we shared the concept of iGEM and standard and let more students have interests on synthetic biology. In addition to classes, we also teach them to do molecular experiments, such as miniprep and PCR. By this means, we trained our experiment and communication skills. We also stressed the importance of safety, including researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety. At the end of this camp, we gave out a questionnaire and analyzed their answers.

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though TRE-EBFP2N + CMV-EBFP2C leads to poor fold change, the transfer curve is significantly steeper when the dimerization process is reversible. This means better switch-like properties. With the presence of intein, the effect is weaker but still visible.
Normalize transfer curves to the range of 0 to 1, we can find that the shapes are different. Lines representing split proteins are later to rise and steeper.
If we normalize the initial EBFP2 level to 1, split EBFP2 with intein displays better properties than the other two settings. From fig. we can clearly see that it has the highest multiple among the three, even significantly higher than that of the intact EBFP2. The result shows that split proteins, with high binding affinity, can defeat original undivided proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.
How well do circuits perform as evaluated by channel capacity?
I Seven circuits are evaluated in our experiment. Calculated channel capacities are displayed in fig.
Come on, this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.
More information is transmitted when both parts of the split protein are inducible.
When both promotors are TREs, both split parts are inducible, and channel capacity is relatively higher than that of channels with un-inducible CMVs. In the absence of intein, the two peptides find it hard to dimerize, giving rise to low channel capacity.
Upon addition of intein sequence, the binding process becomes irreversible since the two halves assemble into one intact protein through splicing. As a consequence, channel capacity greatly increases. Double-inducible group with two TRE promotors still win the competition speaking of channel capacity.
Comparing three inducible groups leads to the conclusion, that splitting leads to decrease in channel capacity, but adding intein sequence to peptides rescue the effect, elevating the channel capacity to even higher level.
What can the result teach us?
Inspirations for Synthetic Biology Engineering:
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-p"

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," effective to its target plant if subsequent plant generations inhibit its uptake, overproduce the sensitive antigen protein so that normal cellular function persists, reduce the ability of this protein to bind to the pesticide or metabolically inactivates the herbicide. Similar mechanisms contribute to antibiotic resistance. Any resistant organisms will inevitably prevail in subsequent generations. Recombination sites could potentially be incorporated into the subsequent project design to circumvent some of the difficulties with traditional fusion proteins as a result of host resistance. However, recombination sites may interrupt the functional fusion protein from forming. Ribozyme segments at the RNA regulation level can potentially remove disrupting sequence after such shuffling occurs. Therefore, the intervening sequence maintains its DNA level functionality but is removed when no longer needed at the RNA level. Fusion protein design focused on the DNA level does not have this dynamic regulation.
1.4 The Cre-Lox System
In bacteriophage P1 exists the cre enzyme and recognition sites called lox P sites. This viral recombination system functions to excise a particular DNA sequence by flanking lox P sites and introduce the cre enzyme when the target is to be excised. The cre enzyme both cuts at the lox P site and ligates the remaining sequences together. The excised DNA is then degraded. This is similar to our project design; however, instead of requiring the addition of an enzyme at the desired excision time, the self-excising nature of ribozymes automatically functions during the normal process of gene expression (RNA level).
2.0 PROJECT IN DETAILS
2.1 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Our protocol will involves the insertion of a functional protein, split by the self-removing elements, between CUCUUAGU and AAUAAGAG in the P6 region of twort.ORF143. GFP (green fluorescent protein) is split into two parts, which will be referred to as GFP1 and GFP2. With a constitutive promoter, GFP1 and GFP2 will be separated by a class 1 A2 intron split into two (for now, IN1 and IN2) sequences that flank another sequence inserted into the P6 loop, which was chosen because anything attached to this region will remain outside the protein. Note that this experimental design also contains an in frame stop codon, which is expected to be spliced out of the sequence with IN1 and IN2 and will utilize the RFC53 convention. Following GFP2 is a transcriptional terminator (TT). The method of making this construct is detailed in RFC53. Below is Figure 1 through Figure 3.

Introduction
We were approached by the Lethbridge Fire Department and EMS to investigate the microbiome of their vehicles and to provide a direct assessment of their cleaning protocols. Currently, the vehicles are cleaned on a daily basis or as needed, and undergo a more extensive deep clean once a month. Areas of the vehicle where blood, vomit and other bodily fluids are visible are cleaned thoroughly, but what about areas where there is no obvious contamination?
Another issue brought to our attention by the EMS was that some of their disinfectant products kill only a fraction of the pathogenic material, while the remaining viable pathogens spread to other areas and possibly transfer to hospitals or the community. Therefore, EMS vehicles may be potential reservoirs of pathogens, associated with an increased risk of infection for immune-compromised patients. Using this information, as well as what we learned from the literature (link to lit review), interviews (link to interview), and ride-alongs (link to ride-alongs), we designed a two-pronged approach to evaluate these concerns. Specifically, we needed to design a system that would: 1) determine what pathogens are present in the vehicles and 2) verify the vehicle is decontaminated. This issue brought to our attention by our local Fire Department and EMS has the potential to be a national case study with regards to cleaning standards. Additionally, countries around the world may experience similar issues and could benefit from our study.
Therefore, our engineered solution must satisfy the following design principles: 1) comprehensive; provide a complete picture of the vehicle microbiome, 2) portable; a detection tool that could be transferred to different vehicles, while the overall solution could be implemented around the globe, 3) easy"

We have come across the Eukaryotic promoter Database!! They     have the ALDH isoforms which we are using in our project. Further investigation     has revealed that the promoter sequences on the site have been tested. This is     encouraging news. Analysis of our own selected sequences and that of EPD show     that ALDH1A1, ALDH2 and ALDH1A3 have significant overlap. We have designed new     primers for ALDH1A1 avoid the restriction site. Also, ALDH3A1 has multiple     promoter regions. We have therefore selected one of the EPD promoter sequences     and designed new primers. Work continues on designing primers for plug-n-play.

He therefore suggested three changes: extension of the “ear-like” structure, where the bolts go, in the frames as well, besides the shells, so that the frames are better centered; remodeling of the channel that the fluid flows through so that better mixing is induced; and elimination of the “lips” in both the frames and the shells so that the silicone sealing works better and fluid leakage is prevented. Dr. Weaver also helped with the 3D printer that works with UV light, located in 60 Oxford Street, part of Harvard's School John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).
Prof. Derek Lovley: Prof. Derek Lovely is one of the leading experts of microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology and has conducted numerous lectures on the economic viability of MFCs. We had a conversation over the phone with Prof. Lovley. on June 21. He suggested looking at specific literature for the building of a microbial fuel cell. SInce platinum is expensive, he thought that the use of ferricyanide as a catalyzer would work as well. He advised to make the chamber anaerobic, because the organisms would otherwise transfer electrons to oxygen instead of the anode itself. He suggested to start off with finding an existing anaerobic digester, such that engineering one might not be necessary. Prof. Lovley noted that Geobacter and Shewanella are usually used in microbial fuel cells but that we may need to use another species if we want our bacteria to metabolize terephthalic acid.”
Buz Barstow, Ph.D.: Professor Joshi also directed us towards Dr. Barstow because he has worked closely with MFCs and could help us with the technical aspects of assembling a cell. We consulted Dr. Barstow regarding the use Bacillus and Arthrobacter in a microbial fuel cell, the efficiency of a MFC, and its potential uses. He also provided us with some insightful questions, ranging from fields as diverse as economics to safety. What follows is a message Barstow addressed to our team:
“That’s a really good question. I’m not too sure about Arthrobacter or Bacillus sp. Protocatechuate, and my guess is as good as yours on whether or not they can be used in a microbial fuel cell.
Also, my guess is as good as yours on whether E. coli can degrade (or be engineered to degrade) terephthalic acid. I would do some"
Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Bioabsorbenthome_-_-_TEXT.html," There are natural proteins, which can immobilize heavy metals to reduce the toxicity, exist in eukaryote and prokaryote. Most of them are metallothioneins[4] with cysteines acting as the binding sites. MerR family transcription factors are among of them. As was discussed, MerR family is a group of transcriptional activators that can bind different metal (or drug) specifically at extremely low concentration. The overall structure of the family is a combination of the N-terminal DNA binding domain and C-terminal metal binding domain; and homodimer is their active form[5]. It should be noticed that MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at the C-terminal metal binding domain (Fig. 1), which indicates a similar metal recognition mechanism and metal-protein complex structure.
Figure 1. Structure based sequence similarity of various metal responsive regulators of MerR family. CadR: cadmium, CueR: copper, ZntR: zinc, MerR: mercury, PbrR:lead. Those amino acids showed in bold are metal binding sites according to solved crystal structures [6] or mutagenesis analysis [7]. The metal binding site of CadR or PbrR can be speculated based on the high similarity of MerR family and the geometry of ligand field of metal ions.
    Grounded on this concept, we conducted a 3D structure modeling for MerR according the structure data of CueR, a homolog of MerR (Fig.2). Results demonstrated that the metal binding domain and DNA binding domain were probably modular for each other, which means that metal binding was independent of DNA binding. We directly tandemed two metal binding domain of MerR including dimerization helix and metal binding loop together, to make a mercury metal binding peptide ( MBP ) (fig. 3).
Figure 2. The results of 3D structure modeling for MerR based on data of CueR. (A) Crystal structure of CueR[ ], which represent the overall structure of the MerR family. The ribbon diagram depicts one monomer in color and the other in gray, with DNA-binding domain in blue, the dimerization helix in red, the metal binding domain in purple and the metal ion in cyan.

UESTC-Software,2018,Team:UESTC-Software#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," constructed a convolutional neural network to predict promoter. Through the movement of the convolution kernel on the input data, it will extract the most basic features.
The DNA sequence converted by the One-Hot Encoding input to the convolutional layer for feature extraction. After the internal weight calculation, the final result will be presented in the last two neurons, corresponding to the promoter and the non-promoter
Fig.7.Use CNN to identify promoter in DNA sequence.
Multi-Classifier System
The feature of the promoter region is very different from other genomic regions such as exons, introns, 3'UTR and internal regions of the gene [5]. Therefore, when identifying eukaryotic promoters, we established three classifiers (promoter and exon, intron, 3UTR) to classify promoters at the same time.
Fig.8.The nature of promoter is different from exon, intron, 3utr.
We put three CNN classifiers together by majority voting rules. A gene sequence \(x\) is simultaneously transferred into three classifiers to obtain the outputs of the three classifiers: \(f^{r} (x),\ r=1,\ 2,\ 3\). In order to determine if \(x\) is a promoter, we need to combine these outputs together and use majority voting rules [6].
\(y=\begin{cases} +1,\ if\displaystyle\sum_{r=1}^{3} \frac{f^{r} (x^r)+1}{2}\geq2\\ -1,\quad Otherwise\\ \end{cases} \)(8)
Where \(y\) is the simulated value of \(x\). If \(y=x+1\), then \(x\) is a promoter, otherwise \(x\) is a non-promoter.
Fig.9.Multiple Classifier System
Global Search
We use a sliding window approach to identify promoter regions in large genome sequences. By moving a fixed-length window in a long sequence, every short sequence is identified to whether it is a promoter sequence. The window length of prokaryotes is 81 bp, and the window length of eukaryotes is 251 bp.
Fig.10.Slide window is used for identify promoter in large scale sequence.
Due to the small difference between adjacent sequences, adjacent windows are likely to have the same classification result. Therefore, we put the region with more than 10 consecutive hits into the candidate set \(G={\{g_1,\ g_2,\ g_3,\ ...,\ g_n\}}\), and select only one window with the highest score to report as the"

Improve the project of WHU-China in2014
Experiment background:
iGEM encourages  us to communicate and cooperate with other teams. We found that the project  conducted by Wuhan University (click here to see more details about  WHU-China 2014 Project) last year was meaningful and of significance to  environment and human health. Unfortunately, they didn’t finish their project  successfully. Therefore, we analyze Wuhan University’s last project and make  some improvements this year. They are also willing to collaborate with us and have already sent us their pSB1C3 vector in their detection system (click here to see more details about  WHU-China 2015 Collaborations). We start our  project based on this part. 
Purpose:
After our confirming experiment, we found that the reason for their  failure is mainly because the hxlR promoter’s starting ability is too weak and  their system will do harm to the bacteria’s metabolic system. So we decided to  change the promoter in their cleaning system and we add T7 RNA polymerase gene  in the detection system. By doing this, we are  able to reduce the unnecessary expression in the cells and make the whole  system work well.

We provided E. coli strains, IPTG and plasmids for NYU-Shanghai to support their experiment. two kinds of functional plasmids were synthesized by us. One was the plasmid of FwYellow chromoprotein, noted for BBa _K1033910. The other was that of Aeblue chromoprotein, noted for BBa_K864401. We also supplied 5ml of BL21 competent cell for them to create new type of E. coli. For inducing the expression of chromoproteins, we gave them IPTG as inducer. All these biology materials were packaged hermetically and Victor Zhou sent them to teammates in NYU-Shanghai in person in order to prevent any separation during the transport. They wanted to use arabinose to induce transcription but no colors showed up, we suggested them that use different concentration of arabinose to find the best concentration to show the color. Because they used arabinose to stimulate transcription, we suggested that IPTG might be a better choice. At that time, we were using IPTG inducible plasmid pET21a respectively with blue chrom"

Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Basic Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Basic parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock
I) Purpose
Determine the concentration of the 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock to give an estimate for starting mutagenesis
II) Expected Outcome
As the dilution series increases, the number of plaques on the plates should decrease
III) Reagants Used
E5.3 T7 new phage stock; LB; BL21 E. coli from 5.14 overnight
IV) Actual Procedure
Performed dilution series with 5.3 T7 stock; went down to -8
Add 0.5 mL of BL21 to 4 test tubes, labelled 5, 6, 7, 8
Add 20 uL of T7 new to each test tube. Phage concentration should correspond to the number on the test tube. Incubate at room temp for 20 minutes.
In a 50mL centrifuge tube, combine 10mL of LB with 10mL of x2 top agar.
Add 5mL of the combined solution to each of the four test tubes. Plate each tube and incubate at 37 C for 24 hours
V) Results
Lots of contamination - from the plates -> this batch of LB plates have been completely disposed of.
-8 plate had 7 plaques: This gives a phage concentration estimate of approximately 7E8 particle/20uL
-5, -6, and -7 had overlapping plaques

The America's Regional Competition
The University of Calgary iGEM Team had great success at the Regional Jamborree held in Indianapolis, Indiana this year, winning the Best Wiki and Best Measurement special prizes, obtaining a gold medal, and advancing as a finalist to the world's Jamborree at MIT.  In the few weeks between competitions, our team has been hard at work to clarify, optimize, and rework aspects of our project.  Here is a list of our major accomplishments in the last three weeks:
Prototype - Click Here For More
Developed a prototype system composed of a portable potentiostat capable of making readings using our lacZ system
Produced a composite part Bba_K640006 composed of a response element we identified from the fad-2 gene in Pseudomonas fluorescens, the lacZ part, oriT, and ori1600, making it potentially a completely functional circuit which could be used to measure naphthenic acids in solution. (Further characterization is required, however, and is being pursued by the team up until the competition)
Biotinylation - Click Here For More
Successfully biotinylated two new naphthenic acids (cyclohexanebutyric acid and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid) identifying the ability of our biotinylation method to be used with compounds of varying hydrophobicity.
Characterized the binding of our biotin linker to a variety of bead types and determined a protocol by which biotinylated hydroph"

Week 1 4.07-8.07
At the start of the week, team members completed a safety induction for the lab. The first experiment used the iGEM standard RFP BioBrick (BBa_J04450) to transform E. coli. For our planned outreach activity, seven coloured BioBricks from the iGEM 2016 distribution kit were identified. E. coli was transformed with these BioBricks, and then plated to determine which cells had been transformed successfully.
Week 2 11.07-15.07
Successful transformants were selected and used to inoculate LB media, these samples were to be used for the children's Summer School. Consequently, they were mini prepped to obtain the plasmid DNA. Alongside this, the PCR protocol was optimised by experimenting with annealing temperatures. The HydC/Fdh, HydA, HydB C- and N-terminus genes and RFP BioBricks (Bba_J04450) were digested with EcoR1 and Pst1. Samples were run on a gel to observe complete digestion and then extracted and purified.
Week 3 18.07-22.07
For the Summer School: Blue, Pink, RFP (Red Fluorescent Protein) and GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) colonies were inoculated. Various drawing utensils were tested on plates to determine which one would be best for the children to use. After speaking to the student leader of UCC ( iGEM Cork ) it was decided to go with cotton buds. For our main project, the cleaned-up PCR products were run on a gel to check the PCR amplification was successful. 2.5µL DMSO was added to the HyaC N- and C-terminus DNA to minimise non-specific amplification, but did not make any difference. The FeFe gene inserts were digested along with RFP to obtain the BioBrick vector. Gel extraction and purification of the gene inserts yielded low concentrations, these were repeated.

The COSHH form for toluene is checked and ready, so some labwork involving both toluene and a much safer xylene can go ahead. A few more companies are phoned or emailed for sponsorship. Things are starting to pick up again.
(12:30 pm) An email has been sent to one of the staff in the genetics lab to gain access into an office for the card to book the hotel. Hopefully this can be done today and our place is ready in Amsterdam.
More research is being done on the next step of the process to isolate and remove the gene that degrades polystyrene so we can insert multiple copies into new host bacteria.

(09:30 am) A university open day, so rather than lab work in the morning the team offered to help out giving tours, had a cake sale and advertised the team and the project.
(14:30 pm) After the open day no-one could be bothered to do any work, and as it was quite late all the technicians said to leave it for the next morning.
(15:00 pm) Instead of wasting the rest of the day, the group doing tours decided to carry on filming for the rockethub video and produced quite a few out-takes as a thank you for people who sponsor the team.

The Tale of Ghost and Elf: Chapter five
To detect an unknown substance is not an easy job and there always comes along with lots of accidents. Now, the most pressing issue Summer had to deal with was how to determine the ingredients of the yellow powder. Secondly, for the convenience of future work, she must make some things which would help to detect the unknown. She was most knowledgeable in the realm of biology. Naturally, she turned to it to find a solution. From recent research, she noticed something called aptamer. Her intuition convinced her that it would be a powerful substance. However, up to now there was no method to make use of this tiny thing. It was able to combine with many substances specially. Well, Specific combination! Yeah, that was the case! Summer succeeded to find the solution. The following thing she needed to do was to come up with the applications in details. Meanwhile, an apparent phenomenon was that the size of substances was variable thus questions arose. Take Atrazine molecules as an example, if something is too small, accurately detecting it will be considerably challenging. While things are too big such as complex proteins, aptamer will fail to sustain them considering its own size. If this was the case, what to do? Well, just let it be. Take a good first step is better, which meant finishing the small molecules examination"

Audiences
The Royal Society
Team members Glen Gowers and Philipp Lorenz attended the 2014 London Biochemistry Alumni Event hosted at the Royal Society. The occasion attracted alumni from across a period of more than 50 years – bringing together those who completed their PhDs in the 1950s, with students graduating last year. Following an introduction by Head of Department Mark Sansom and talks from two Royal Institution Christmas Lecturers, our iGEM team members entertained guests with their presentation.
Sponsors
Conveying our enthusiasm and ambition for the competition was crucial here, as well as appearing professional and organised. We avoided going into too much technical detail but concentrated on sharing our overall vision and the potential of our project. Many of our sponsors are keen to keep updated on our progress and we plan to produce a report for them after the jamboree. We received a great response and would like to thank all our sponsors for their support!
Sheffield iGEM Meet Up
In July Oliver, Corinna, Fran, and Emily attended the Sheffield iGEM meet up and presented our project to other teams there. Corinna had this to say:  ""For the presentation of our project at the University of Sheffield meet-up, we were expected to remain under a time limit of 5 minutes. This was the main factor in determining the extent of detail we included in the presentation. We were also encouraged to have a PPT slide to accompany our presentation, which we kept very simple: a slide with the animated DCMation logo, and another slide with a team picture. We had four team members attend the meeting, and all of us"

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," people at your institution, or the general public could arise from your use of this organism/part?
No safety risks
No potential safety/health risks of the part itself. Composite parts containing this signal sequence could be possibly dangerous when the signal sequence is fused to a dangerous protein. However, we are not using the part in combination with possibly dangerous other parts.
The protein produced by the part is not dangerous [ Thermo Scientific ]. However, S. aureus nuclease production could contribute to disease pathogenesis in vivo
What measures do you intend to take to ensure that your project is safe for team members, other people at your institution, and the general public?
We have all completed a biosafety course and we handle everything in the lab with the necessary precaution. We will not distribute any parts or organisms outside the lab, we are using moss that is not able to sporulate and have implemented a kill switch (see basic safety form)
Explain why you believe the part iself is not dangerous
The part is human-derived and should thus not be dangerous
It is a eukaryotic secretion signal which enables secretion of proteins that carry this signal sequence in mammals and other eukaryotes. Therefore the part itself is not dangerous
S. aureus nuclease production contributes to disease pathogenesis in vivo so it could possibly enhance pathogenesis in other microorganisms as well [ Berends et al., 2010 ]. It is therefore important to ensure that no genetic material of our moss gets into the environment
Why do you need to use this organism/part? Is there an organism/part from a less dangerous Risk Group that would accomplish the same purpose?
Part is needed to filter the dangerous cyanotoxin microcystin from the water. Since proteinphosphatase binds microcystin with a very high affinity it is the best choice.
Part is needed to be able to secrete our effector proteins. Since we are using Physcomitrella patens as a chassis, we have to use a eukaryotic secretion signal. The use of the Ig-kappa secretion signal from mouse (BSL 1) is widely established and does not pose any safety risks
Part is needed in our kill switch to ensure that the moss completely killed and that all genetic material is destroyed.
Is the organism/part listed under the Australia Group guidelines, or otherwise restricted for transport?
No
Please describe the BioSafety Level of the lab in which the team works
The lab we work in has BioSafety Level 1 and we are not using organisms with a BSL level greater than 1

On this first video we have the introduction given by Pedro Medeiros and the presentation of the USP team:
The second part had the presentations of the teams from Pernanbuco and Manaus. Detail for the ""meta hangout"" that we needed to create to communicate with Ph.D Deborah Zanforlin - it actually worked out!
After the event, we asked some participants to share their experience, what they found interesting and what the encounter can add to their team and project. The answers left us extremely satisfied and motivated to promote a new meeting next year!
”The meeting was super constructive; all the projects were very interesting. It was a relief to know that all teams also have the same difficulties in day-to-day lab and _ the best advantage of the meeting was being able to overcome these barriers by exchanging tips, suggestions and even protocols. Another very interesting part of the Jamboré was listen different opinions about each project and see that each team had a bit to add in another's one, resolving small failures of projects . Anyway, the meeting was very relaxed and constructive, just the iGEM way to finish with a golden key, the meeting ended with many games, beer and fries. :) “ - Luna Barroco de Lacerda (UFAM – Brasil)
""The meeting of teams ""Jamboré"" was a very rewarding experience for my team and for other teams from Brazil that will participate in the iGEM competition. On this occasion we could present the scope of work of each team, share information and some tips about how such studies could be improved and evolved according to the experience of each team. It was also a very cool moment of exchange of knowledge and networking among teams. Every one left a great impression and get excited for the Giant Jamboré."" - Marcelo Nunes (LIKA-CESAR-Brasil)
Meetings like Jamboré fortify a network of ideas, collaborations, exchange of protocols and improve on the resolution of lab problems. We hope that in future this kind o initiative may lead to a more strong iGEM initiative on Brazil, aiming to spread the approach on genetic engineering that Synthetic Biology propose on our future national biotechnology research and biotech entrepreneurship.
Hours after Jamboré ended, we still had these amazing people discussing about projetcs, iGEM and synthetic biology on the auditorium. :)

Team biotin: this week, we performed a PCR on BirA and we digested the pPIC after its amplification in E. coli Stellar cells. This allowed us to do our first cloning with BirA in the pETDuet. We checked the clones by digestion and they were OK. It was necessary to sequence these clones before doing the next cloning in  pETDuet. We obtained a different pPIC from a previous year's supplies, and we checked it.
Team coli: this week, it was the first In-fusion cloning with our Cerberus in the pET28. We used two differents construction for Cerberus, one with a monomeric streptavidin and another with a  tetrameric streptavidin. Then, we checked the constructs by digestion before sending them for sequencing. In the same time we checked our plasmid pEVOL-AzF which allows the unnatural amino acid incorporation in E. coli.
Team pastoris: this week, we clone Cerberus-streptavidin though In-fusion  into the pGAP with the material prepared the week before. So we had to check some clones by digestion before sequencing. Fortunately, they were good. It was also this week that we received the Pichia pastoris GS200 strains cell.
09/07 - 13/07:
Team biotin: on monday we sent our pETDuet BirA clones obtained last week to sequencing and we were happy that our clones were validated. In the same time, we carried on the PCRs with the parts that will be used to functionalize our Cerberus after biotinylation by BirA.
Team coli: This week, we received the sequencing results for Cerberus and it was again a success for the Toulouse iGEM team. We cloned Sirius (CBM3-RFP) in the pET28 with the In-fusion kit. For this, we performed PCR on the gBlocks then we used the In-fusion kit. After verification, Sirius was OK.
Team pastoris: we checked the pREAV and found out the plasmid map didn’t match with our digestion results. We needed to find a different pREAV...
Team callulose: we decided to focus the production with G. hansenii because it produces more cellulose than K. rhaeticus. We also started production in 2L Erlenmeyers.

This influence is especially obvious in the first few hours, but the two curves would finally be closer to each other. From 8th to 10th hour, the data curve rose much more rapidly because this is the exponential growth phase of E.coli. In this period, the lost of bacteria caused by measurement can be neglected. As there were fewer bacterium in the earlier period, the resources and space made it possible for bacterium to grow more rapidly.
Dry-lab Testing
We did some tests, including installability test and running test, on Windows and MacOS X, to supplement the installability test on Linux that have been kindly done by judges.
MacOS X
1. Environment:                       MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) with OS X Yosemite (Version 10.10.4)                       Safari (Version 8.0.7 (10600.7.12))
2. Procedure:
The compression package is about 142 MB on the disk, and when the package is uncompressed, all the files are 415 MB on the disk
Then begins the setup process. Double click the file “setup.command”, and the terminal opens. The software automatically configure the environment needed to run CORE.
After about 4 minutes (depends on the Internet), the process successfully completed (if the connection to internet.
Then double click the file “runserver.command”, and after a few seconds, the process completed.
Then open Safari, and navigate to “localhost:8888”. Now comes the CORE. Run smoothly.
User Studies

Due to limited time period for software development, we could only do user studies covering only a limited number of people. It is a great honor for us to invite Yu Zhou (team leader of 2015 NJU-China), Jiyong Ma (bioinformatics graduates in Ren’s lab), Jinyu Li (team member of 2013 and 2014 SYSU-Software, and now PhD at Yale University), and Haoquan Zhao (team member of 2013 SYSU-Software, and now Master at Harvard University) to help us find out the user experience of CORE.
Our user studies invited them to try out our software (with the help of the easy user guide or some guidance given by us). Then give some feedbacks on the three modules (i.e., CORE Bank"
