Retention and Preservation System
Short Summary
We started by validating the basic requirements for the in vivo experiments with unnatural base pairs. A two-plasmid system for retention of unnatural base pairs was developed and characterized. In our in vivo experiment, we were able to detect unnatural base pairs in the specified target sequence using our adapted Oxford Nanopore Sequencing after 48 hours. Furhter experiments need to be conducted for quantification of unnatural base retention efficiency.
Pretests
Due to the high costs of our unnatural base pair (UBP) we had to carefully plan the experiments involving these bases.      Therefore, we carried out cultivation experiments of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in micro well plates, because performing       experiments in a microscale would significantly reduce the cost of the experiments. To cultivate at the ideal growth       conditions for our purposes, we performed pretests. In our ex-periments, we tested for the ideal culture volume, surface size and       shaking frequency.    The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the plasmid pSB3C5. We use psB"

From 2012.igem.org
AutoPlasmid
AutoPlasmid was developed to take the process of annotating a plasmid to a whole new level. Firstly, we wanted to create a centralized depot of many thousands of well-known features and their associated sequences. We chose what we thought were some of the more popular features, and relied on databases such as SGD, PlasMapper, and the University of Wisconsin Madison's E. Coli Database.
But we knew this database would grow as large as it did. To address this concern, we implemented Cloud Computing , what we feel is one of the most impressive aspects of our software application. A plasmid such as puc18 normally takes 39 minutes on a slow computer to annotate and search through all our features. But in the cloud, with 30 parallel processes running at once, we can split up the algorithm and divvy up the work, resulting in a run of just 68 seconds, a dramatic decrease in time by 34-fold!
But we added many, many more features on top of this architectural backend. In particular, we gave users the ability to annotate their plasmid using imperfect matches selecting any threshold they want (e.g. 95% match). While this significantly increases the time a particular annotation takes, it still results in rapidly fast annotations when the Cloud is used. In addition, users may select particular features they want to search for, such as Genes, Promoters, Terminators, and more. Lastly, users may translate DNA into amino acid in all 6 reading frames.
Once a plasmid is fully annotated, the user can do even more. They can look inside the plasmid, view details about each feature that was annotated, and manipulate the plasmid even more. They can add custom annotations, view where a particular segment of DNA is, and even isolate out features to later design with. Users can view oligo matches, and amino acid translation of particular DNA segments. One of the most useful features of the AutoPlasmid's plasmid view window is that a user can find exactly why a annotation was identified as an imperfect match. In puc18, it is well known that the origin has a 1 base pair mutation, for example. This can be easily located by viewing the details of the alignment.
Lastly, a user may export their annotated plasmid in any format they'd like: genbank, fasta, or"

The tool supports frame-independent translation, PAM identification on both strands and varying gRNA lengths. It currently does not support PAM sequences of more than 1 specific nucleotide or direct input of amino acid sequences. The programming language we used for this tool, R, is an open-source programming language that can be augmented with packages that are convenient for working with genomic data ( R core team, 2015 ). Packages used are seqinR ( Charif and Lobry, 2007 ), Biostrings ( Pages et. al. ) and Magicfor ( K. Makiyama, 2016 ).
We used this tool to generate all possible gRNA’s at exon-exon junctions in EPO, taking into account all codon substitutions possible. The tool is far more versatile, however. It can easily generate gRNA’s at a position of choice for all possible codon substitutions. This can also be useful for other applications that deal with high amounts of synonymous mutations in the gene they want to sequence.

Design of microarray
Microarray is a solid substrate based 2 dimensinoal array, which can be utilized to detect large sum of bio-substance. After decade of developing, various kinds of microarrays have been invented, such as DNA microarray, protein microarray, tissue microarray and so on. Different microarrays can be used to detect different components based on different substrates. Our project belongs to cellular microarray, aiming to select different kinds of antibodies based on the interaction between different proteins displayed on bacteria membrane. This part of our project aims to attach CBD-expressing bacteria to the surface of microarray coated with cellulose. Weizmannn Institute has developed zephyrin-based microarray, in which the microarray plate is dotted with cellulose. Thus, this innovation provides potential for application in our project.
Strategy 2 ToxR-based Transmembrane Signaling Pathway Method
Propose of This Step
In order to select a specific antibody from a large number of antibodies, we studied the formation of mammalian antibodies. In the process of antibody production in mammals, mediated Annexin antibodies-mediated antibody activation play an important role. This section hopes to use a membrane receptor of E. coli to simulate this process, to achieve the purpose of screening.
Principle and Background
To achieve this, a ToxR-based two-hybrid system was introduced into E.coli cells. The Vibrio cholerae transcriptional regulator ToxR is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by a single transmembrane segment, its C-terminal domain facing the periplasm. Most of its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain shares sequence similarity with the winged helix–turn–helix (wHTH) motif of OmpR-like transcriptional regulators. The ToxR protein of Vibrio cholerae regulates the expression of several virulence factors that play important roles in the pathogenesis of cholera.
ToxR stimulates transcription from the cholera toxin gene promoter ctx by direct binding to DNA element ITITTGAT present in different isolates of Vcholerae in three to eight tandemly repeated copies upstream of the ctxAB structural genes.
Transcription activation is thought to be initiated by environmental stimuli which cause the periplasmic ToxR domain to form a homodimer. This, in turn, tethers together the two cytoplasmic ToxR domains, which can now bind to the control region of the ctx promoter. A second membraneassociated protein, ToxS (Mr 19 000), is"

This year our team attaches more importance to whether the engineered bacteria we constructed can work well in real environment to obtain our anticipated target.
Compared with the common measurement method—HPLC, which  is regarded as time-consuming, labor-consuming and with a high cost. The bioprocess we designed is of great convenience and effectiveness, it can sense and detect the Tc concentrations in the water sample. What’s more, the approach we designed is equipped with a relatively high sensitivity of 0.01μg/mL which is a remarkable progress in our project.
From other aspect, we collaborated with NKU_China team this year who assisted us in measuring data—MIC. According to the datas we got, there is no denying that we have triumphantly cultured bacteria of significant tetracycline tolerance.

Additionally, we successfully synthesized two engineering plasmids, they are responsible for Tc detection and degradation respectively. Hence, we can sensitively detect the existing Tc concentration in realistic conditions and degrade it for preventing hazardous antibiotics pollution spread widely.

For example, for a hash array with a few elements in the buckets almost get the same manipulating time with a big hash with millions of elements. This feature improves the speed of rule based modeling remarkably.
Dealing with regular expressions is also Perl's cup of tea. So the software can spend more running time saved by perl on providing a better user's interface, making it more convenient for users.
Our approach first realized by Liaochen and 2010igemers emphasize on the structure of the species.
Here is a detailed explanation to the input file of the rule based modeling approach  There are four blocks, respectively lists the definition of parameters, the definition of compartments, seed species and events.
The definition of parameters consists of two items. The left side term is the name of the variable, to the right is the expression of that parameter. Note that variables in that expression must be defined by the user. But it makes no difference whether they are defined before the expression. This is to avoid redundant definition and no definition.
The compartments definition is in this way:
[name ][outside][ruletable]{volume}{population}, where terms in the square brackets are mandatory, while terms in the curly braces are optional.
The default value of the volume is 1. The outside term means the compartment outside the compartment, which is usually the medium that held the compartment like the ecoli.
Ruletable is used to associate a rule in the data base with the compartment.
The third block, reads [compartment][name][structure][init_concentration]{const}, structure is the definition of the complex structure, const is optional since it's in the curly brace.  If the substance has a const property, then after the substance, write a const. if not, leave it blank.
The last block is the events definition. The formats are [name][trigger_condition][event_assignments...] The name of the event is usr defined, trigger_condition is a bool expression, all the variables inside this bool expression must have been defined in one of the above three blocks. Event_assignments is a list of assignments, something like assignment1 assignment2 assignment3, with white space separated. There is"

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#MSDS_-_-_TEXT.html," by an aerosol attack. This stems from many of our modern products having plastic built into them, this is from phone casings to table finishes to carpets. However, for optimum growth a very moist environment would be a necessity, these conditions are not usually found within a human environment where it is generally very dry. This said, at the equator and South East Asia, to name a few, the environment is naturally highly humid.
By individual countries, a bioweapons attack would potentially have collateral side effects on their own states and would be inefficient. Also most countries follow strict legislations regarding using GMO (genetically modified organisms) both inside and outside laboratories. For example, the UK has a list of legislations and regulations regarding biosafety and biosecurity. For a terrorist group however, it would be very hard to detect their means, which would cause chaos, under the right conditions.
5. If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise?
E. coli K-12 strains are poor colonisers and infectors of human and animal bodies, and they are not likely to habit natural environment such as soil and river. Also, only when the environmental conditions are appropriate, our engineered bacteria will degrade plastics, which is causing global waste problems. Hence, the risks are kept at a very low level,  even if our project is developed in large-scale.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks?
We have come up with a few strategies to prevent release of our bacteria into the environment. Firstly, the bioreactor containing bacteria will have a kill switch that kills bacteria if the bioreactor is opened when operating. Secondly, we lyse the cells at the end of reactions to harvest our product. This also ensures living bacteria will not be released unexpectedly. The team is also considering to establish symbiosis between bacteria with different plastic-degrading enzymes, so that the bacteria only live when two or more strains are present.
7. What safety training have you received?
We have received safety training regarding general safety issues, first aid and emergency arrangements, incident reporting, experimental procedures and waste procedures.
For more specific safety information please see our module pages
Module1: Resource-full Waste
Module 2: Bioplastic Recycling Module

These parts were then ligated to a Kanamycin vector that was digested with EcoRI and PstI. This created two intermediate parts that were selectively grown on Kanamycin plates.
Step 2: The same process was used for the second intermediate part in which the PO Promoter (BBa_I746361) was the upstream part and the GFP plasmid (BBa_I13401) was the downstream part. However, these digested fragments were transferred to a Chloramphenicol vector. This produced one intermediate that was selectively grown on a Chloramphenicol plate.
Step 3: The final construct was made in the same process where the intermediates of step 1 became upstream parts and the intermediate of step 2 became the downstream part. These parts were then mixed and ligated to the provided, linearized pSB1C3 plasmid. The resulting colonies were tested for responsive GFP production from the addition of cadmium. Modeling of the process is shown below.
Note: The same methods were used for constructing a sensor with a delta activator instead of an ogr activator. The images below also models that part.
The Experiments
We tested out detectors (protocol can be found here ) and measured the sensitivity using a spectrophotometer. We measured in Fluor./OD which is the amount of fluorescence per OD (at 600nm). At first, we encountered many problems. We noticed that all of our dilutions, including the control were approximately the same. We realized that LB (Luria Broth, our growth medium) fluoresces naturally; hence, it masked the effects of the GFP. To solve this problem, we grew our bacteria in LB, centrifuged it, then resuspended in PBS (phosphate buffer solution). Lastly, our spectrophotometer still continued to show the same fluorescence reading for most samples except the control. We then realized that the readings had maxed. Serial dilutions were used to determine accurate measurements.
Results
The mutagenesis of the Cadmium Sensor and promoter gave us multiple samples, but nearly all of the samples had either the same level of sensitivity or lower. Those that showed increased sensitivity in preliminary tests revealed only slightly increased GFP output that was not stable.
The graph shown below represents our results (in Fluorescence per OD600) for the detector with the delta activator (K1042002) and the detector with"

IISc-Bangalore,2018,Team:IISc-Bangalore#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," urea were used to dialyse the protein sample and refold it from an initial urea concentration of 8M. For Mcp-1, 8M urea solubilization needed to be done because of the tendency of Mcp-1 to form inclusion bodies when expressed in E. coli.
For the actual assay, we used Ibidi's µ-Slide designed for chemotaxis experiments. The slides were filled with the blank buffer on one side and buffer containing 75ng/ml of the protein on the other (final concentration). Following this, weakly adherent THP-1 cells were loaded in the middle of the slide and their movement was tracked over a span of 12 hrs.
Lambda Red recombination
The Lambda red recombination system is a combination of three enzymes (recombinases) isolated from the Lambda phage that together increase the basal DNA recombination efficiency in the cell by around four orders of magnitude. These recombinases - called Beta, Exo and Gam - can be expressed from a plasmid and ensure efficient recombination of a dsDNA carrier inside the cell to its homologous regions in either the bacterial genome or another target strand inside the cell. We added a T7 promoter to ZJU-China's 2014 Part BBa_K1433005 to convert it into a Lambda red generator ( BBa_K2609026 ).
For PAIR, the Mcp-1 CDS fused to a signal peptide was to be recombined into the T4 genome in place of the native endolysin gene with the use of 50bp homology on both sides of the construct and in the presence of the lambda red proteins. We were unable to do so because of our inability to electroporate the ~169 kbp T4 genome in multiple trials.
APES
Phage MIC Calculation
One of the few overlooked problems during the administration of phages for therapeutics is the decision of the dosage that a person will require to treat the infection successfully. We felt that a simple correspondence between antibiotics and phages would prove to be extremely useful in this case.
Using multiple dilutions of both phages and antibiotics, we quantified the percentage survival of bacteria over a wide range of concentrations and created curves that could effectively be used to choose the amount of phage that should be administered to create the same effect as a corresponding amount of antibiotic. Different initial concentrations of cells were incubated with varying concentrations of the agent and the percentage survival after 2 hrs was quantified using a resazurin-based viability dye.

ProtoCat 3.0 - Proof of Concept
Unit Testing
We used the built-in unittest module to verify the functionality of our software, as is recommended in the Django documentation. In particular, we ran tests on:
Protocol upload and retrieval
Category upload and retrieval
Reagent upload and retrieval
Viewing standard pages as both anonymous and logged-in users
User creation
Our software passed these preliminary tests, and so we took to user testing to continue with the verification.
User Testing
Once ProtoCat 3.0 went live, we began by testing the interface. Our team swiftly located a numerous number of bugs and issues with ProtoCat. Once we felt certain that the majority of issues were behind us, we began working with other groups so that ProtoCat could be tested by non team member users. These groups included, but not limited to, Michigan iGEM team, Rice University iGEM team, and University of Michigan's biology lab staff. These users not only found more bugs that were previously overlooked, but also provided valuable insight on how an outsider who has never seen the software uses it. In turn we cleaned up our interface and improved labeling in order to bring attention to new features that were being missed.
One of the main goals of ProtoCat is for the software to be used in order to crowd source protocols. During our testing period our team uploaded a protocol , an improvement was suggested in the comments by a member of the University of Michigan biology lab staff. Thus a new branch of the protocol was created with the correction, demonstrating the power that collaboration has in creating the best protocol."

2012 - Project Title: Synthetic ecology
Abstract: We aimed to create a stable community of microorganisms that could be used as a standard tool. Our system would allow the co-culture of several genetically engineered machines in tunable proportions. Hence the engineered organism would be a standard part! This defines a new level of modularity allowing the increase of the complexity of the system by moving to the community level. We´ve come up with several plausible circuits designs and in silico predictions and decided to build a “crossfeeding” system in which each strain produces and secretes an aminoacid the other strains need to grow. We characterized two auxotrophic yeast strains (for tryptophan and histidine) and designed novel biobricks that regulate the export of Trp and His rich peptides. In the future this would allow for other modules to control the proportions of each strain, thus allowing dynamic and stimulus dependent changes in the abundances of each strain.

Ideally, a fast screen of the population with a diagnostic test would allow distinguishing between infected people and non-infected people. If a patient refuses to be diagnosed while not showing any relevant symptoms, they retain their right to refuse such diagnostic. However, if the patient has been in contact with pathogens or people infected with pathogens present on a recognized list of severely dangerous infectious agents ( e.g. the 'Federal Isolation and Quarantine Laws' made by the Center for Disease Control [1]), the local government is within its right to put the person in quarantine (for example, people were quarantined during the SARS coronavirus epidemic, but not during the Zika virus outbreak). To start a quarantine situation, the necessary government bodies need to issue the proper warrant after analyzing the situation. If the disease is not present on this list, then the freedom of the individual cannot be impeded and the patients keep their right to autonomy.

Conclusions:
Decisions should always be made by patients, even though there currently is a system where the health authorities decide due to the lack of resources to ensure an autonomic decision by the patients.
In normal conditions, there is no need to inform the patient about the technology behind the diagnostic, but we should inform about the GMO nature of Mantis when this is a sensitive topic in the region.
In case of a deadly epidemic emergency, diagnostics cannot be imposed. Patients are put in quarantine and only when they accept to take the diagnostic they can be released from the quarantine (If the result of the diagnostic is negative).

During our conversations with Mr. Christiansen, we reached the topic of what to do in case of a breach. Should the container against all expectations be damaged, the environment will be exposed to the GMO inside. The solution we came up with was the possible implementation of a kill-switch in the inner compartment, making it vulnerable to sunlight. Should the bacteria of said unit be exposed to sunlight, they would perish. As the outer compartment would be dependent on the continued coexistence of the two units, the entire GMO system would be purged in case of a breach . To implement this feature, the inner chamber would be covered with Carbon Black, which has the ability to absorb sunlight, thus leaving the compartment itself in darkness.
The process of constructing our device would be through an extensive use of Injection Moulding, which is considered pricey equipment. The material is expensive at 4-5.5 USD per kg at orders above 1 metric ton, according to Mr. Christiansen, but its longevity and durability means it would not need to be replaced for a long time. Lastly, we discussed the reusability of Polycarbonate, which he assured us was of no concern, as the material could be reused and recycled with ease.

Detailed Prototype
This prototype was designed with Flemming Christiansens advice in mind.
The first compartment will have a dome shaped top, thus allowing sunlight to enter, while eliminating as many refractions as possible. A nourishment and wastes system will be implemented along the sides of the leafs as well as through the bottom.

Workshop with Business Developer Ann Zahle Andersen
For the purpose of getting a business perspective on our project, we met with Business Developer Ann Zahle Andersen. She arranged two workshops for us based on a business model canvas. She encouraged us to view our project, as if we meant to make startup business. These workshops gave us a better comprehension of society’s pull and pushes on a project like ours. This forced us as a team to get to the bottom of what we found important about our project.

Who’s your pABA ?
We build a biological UV warning system in E.coli. The bacteria are able to detect UV light and can integrate the duration of their exposure to it.
UV-light exposure induces the production of para-Aminobenzoic acid (pABA), a common ingredient of sunscreen, as a protection against UV radiation damage. If the system is exposed to UV light for a duration sufficiently long or intense to be harmful to human skin, the cells produce a warning signal. As to our knowledge there is no specific UV light receptor in E.coli, we model and implement a spectral filter system out of different light receptors that responds only to UV light.
Our system could be integrated into bacteria living on human skin and therefore serve as an adaptive, intelligent sunscreen that protects the skin upon UV light exposure and also tells when it is time to avoid the sun.
We're about to fill our Wiki and to provide all the required pages. Stay tuned for updates.

Overview
Biosafety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher, public safety or environmental safety?
Our project proposes the utilization of protein-based micro compartments as a new in vitro technology for science. The idea is going to be developed at the laboratory with the proper biosafety conditions of handle and disposal of reagents and biological material. For those reasons it does not represent any public and/or environmental biohazard.
In addition, our project involves the use of microorganisms with a biosafety level 1 (Top10, BL21, and Dh5α strains that are E. Coli K12 derivatives) according to the Risk Group Table and the World Health Organization Laboratory Biosafety Manual (1,2) . Also, the BioBricks or genes used in this chassis do not show any potential biological hazard. The utilization of antibiotic resistance as selection markers could be the only potential bio risk.
Our laboratory has a well documented and stabilized protocols to dispose any biological material and to discard different reagents with environmental toxicity. The reagents and others are discarded after a particular number of decontamination processes as autoclaving, chemical disinfection, and incineration (3) . Therefore, the environment should not be affected by our work. This guideline of biohazard disposal is  part of the regulation from the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT) in Chile.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
As we described above, the  biobricks and/or genes used in this project do not represent any potential biological hazard.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there is. The Committee of Bioethics and Biosafety of the Biological Sciences part of the Faculty of Pontificia Universidad Católica of Chile. This committee is responsible for ensuring good practices in the laboratories in our university and also, this is achieved through"

KK March 27th, 2013
Dr. Grose has distributed the phage requests we sent her to send to professors in China, India, Switzerland, and Harvard. It would be wonderful to obtain CTXtheta phage, which is a cholera-specific phage whose genome has been well studied and inclusively its joint evolution with cholera has been studied. However, we when arrived at class and began discussing, Dr. Grose presented a better idea. We can use a lysogenic phage specific to E.Coli, rather than a cholera specific phage. We’ll engineer this phage with EPS depolymerases on its tail proteins, and then we will infect our E.Coli with the phage and grow E. Coli with copies of the virus prophage incorporated in its genome. If we can then engineer our bacteria so that the prophage DNA will be excised and expressed when E.Coli detects cholera, lysing the E.Coli and attacking the biofilm, then that will be an incredible iGEM project.   Clarice, Kelton and I transformed plasmid IG78 into E.Coli and plated on about 10 plates of LB Amp. During the transformation of our first 50 microliters of E.Coli, we think the hot water bath failed to achieve 42 degrees Celsius, and it’s likely the transformation didn’t work. For that reason, we did the transformation again (using only 1 microliter of plasmid instead of 2 microliters because we’re very low). We shocked the DH5alpha with the hot water bath in Dr. Griffitts lab instead of the one in ours. We hope to harvest the pl"
Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#pages#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," designed two LOV mutants with split mRFP. In the case of mRFP, we decided for split position 168/169, since this position was already successfully demonstrated in bimolecular fluorescence complementation [12] . The split position is located between β – barrel 8 and 9, which provides enough space for larger insertions.
Cloning strategy
The three LOV mutants, namely LOV-12 SspDnaX-sfGFP, LOV-12SspDnaX-mRFP and LOV-6SspDnaX-mRFP, were created via a fast track cloning strategy using CPEC. Employing the same method, constructs were generated that do not contain the LOV domain. Both, controls that should be able to conduct the splicing reaction and controls that contain mutated intein residues at the splicing side preventing the splicing reaction were produced. Subsequently the C - terminal SspDnaX containing the LOV domain and the N-terminal construct were cloned in bisctronic expression backbone using standard biobrick cloning.
Measurement of reconstituted fluorescent protein
We transformed all constructs in BL21(DE3) to allow expression under the T7 promoter. 5ml cultures were inoculated with 500 µl of an overnight culture and induced with 1mM as soon as the cultures reached the OD600 of 0.8. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for further 1-2 hours. Subsequently, the cultures were left on room temperature as it is described in the paper that originally describes the S11 inteins [11]. Simultaneously all cultures were portioned and distributed on a 24 well plate and either illuminated with blue light of 470 nm for 30 min to 12 hours or kept in the dark for the same period of time. All samples were irradiated to either allow the conformational change of the LOV domain or prove the invulnerability against phototoxicity. The fluorescence was measured with the FACS using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission spectra of 497 to 522 nm for sfGFP and excitation wavelength 561 nm with an emission spectra of 602 to 662 nm for mRFP. The samples were diluted 1:1000 and every FACS run analyzed 100000 events. To validate our results we conducted several assays with a series of biological replicates following the same experimental layout. For the Western Blot, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 8000 rpm at 4 °"

1. Communicating with experts
In order to determine the focus of iGEM 2016, we decided to present our project to the professionals with experience in research. So with this spirit, we wrote several articles about ourselves and our project and then  communicated with Professor Ma, a master tutor. He gave us some good suggestions that broaden our minds after we exchanged our ideas with him. We also communicated with Professor Liu, who gladly helped check our project documents and the experimental procedures by pointing our mistakes and giving some advice with patience.
While it is certainly very satisfying to work in a laboratory, such communications that are very rewarding as well.
2.Video conferences
At 3pm on the afternoon of September 16th, 2016, we arranged a video conference with UESTC-Software team in order to further our understanding of each others’ projects and cooperate with each other. After getting the basic knowledge of each others’ project, we reached an agreement that the DNA data storage technology of UESTC can offer a lot help to us in terms of storing the efficient information of pathways, which is an indispensable part in navigation systems. Subsequently, at 7 pm in the evening, we had another video conference with NAU Team,  which also accomplished successfully. Through raising questions and giving advice, we have made the first step in our collaboration period.

LA_Biohackers,2014,Team:LA Biohackers#Practice and Policy_-_-_TEXT.html,"501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code an organization’s purpose  must be charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national  or international amateur sports competition, and preventing cruelty to children or animals. Here,  charitable includes the advancement of education or science.20 Thus, a group that seeks to follow the model of the LA Biohackers, which prides itself in  serving its community as a learning tool, may do well to aspire to these purposes. Groups that do not  want or are unable to function in this manner are just as relevant, but are likely unable to achieve tax  exempt status. These groups should still be mindful of the various organizational entity classifications  promulgated by their state.
Typically, a community laboratory will not need to give much thought to potential international  regulatory issues. There are, however, certain research subjects that would warrant international  concern. For example, the World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of  Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including  research on identifiable human material and data.21 Most aspiring community laboratories will be unlikely to venture into this research area as it is mostly aimed at clinical application of medical  research.
Arguably more relevant, however, are the international implications under the Convention on  Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol (NP), which the United States has yet to ratify.  The CBD aims to conserve biological diversity, promote sustainable use, and provide fair access to any  benefits that may arise from genetic sources.22 Biological diversity is represented by the multitude of  plants, animals, microorganisms, genetic differences between species and the wide variety of  ecosystems that occur on Earth. The combinations of these factors has made the planet uniquely  suitable to flourishing life.23
The Nagoya Protocol servers to further develop the third main goal of the CBD: fair access to  any benefits that may arise from genetic sources.24 It is an international agreement which aims at  sharing the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources in a fair and equitable way,  including by appropriate access to genetic resources and by appropriate transfer of relevant  technologies, taking into account all rights over those resources and to technologies, and by appropriate  funding, thereby contributing to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its  components.25 In the international context, the CBD and NP provide meaningful progress for third-world countries who would greatly benefit from new and innovative genetic research and would  generally lack the resources on their own to conduct the same research.

I am Chen Honglin and I am a junior student in the school of life science. Glad to meet everyone in this specific way. In iGEM, my job was to design the project. It was not easy to come up a great achievable idea. After years of reading paper and experimenting, I finally can handle the whole program. Me myself is a huge fun of board game, especially The killer of Three Kingdoms. If any iGEMer has interest, I can teach you in person!

I am a junior majoring in life science with special interest in epigenetic and my name is Jin Fei. In the past 10 month I put most of my time on the IGEM and was response to the cell group. My main work consisted of cell direct conversion from MEF to neuron with two other team members. Talking about hobbies, some computer game and sports are good ways to relax. Most importantly killing cells in a variety ways is my biggest interest now.

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#debate#debate_-_-_TEXT.html,"senic sensor that was produced by another iGEM team would inherently need to be released into the field to realize their application.  The fear here is that the potential exists during tests for bacteria to become endemic to the environment, colonizing rapidly and making eradication of the bacteria all but impossible.  After colonization, similar problems to the “escape the lab” scenario occur, including environmental damage or infection of animals or humans.
We also introduced the ethical dilemmas faced with respect to the field of synthetic biology, particularly with regard to what moral value should be placed on GEMs.  We discussed the idea of the minimum genome project and how this could redefine what we think of as life.  We asked whether it was for scientists alone to decide on what constitutes 'life' or whether this is a matter for much wider debate, hence engagement schemes like this one.  We also talked about the fears of us 'playing god' by engaging in synthetic biology and the possible ill-effects of humans tampering with complicated biological systems which we do not fully understand.  We finished by talking about the concept of a 'dual-use' dilemma being created, and used nuclear fission experiments in the 20th Century as an example of what this means.
While these issues seem worrying, they were introduced alongside how best they could be prevented, in order to show the audience that while there are dangers associated with synthetic biology, the protection of the public at large is paramount in the minds of scientists worldwide.  The threat of bioterrorism is greatly reduced upon the realization of the resources required to synthesize and grow a bacteria or virus are vast, and not easily obtainable.  These range from chemicals used to retain the virus’ virulence during storage, to a dispersal mechanism for pathogen release, and finally, serious financial backing and access to a full biomolecular laboratory.  The risk of colonization by released synthetic organisms is not as daunting a fear after the understanding that genetically-engineered microorganisms are usually less evolutionarily fit than their naturally-occurring counterparts.  Strict laboratory protocols, transportation procedures, and even cell-level safeguards, such as the kill switch St Andrews iGEM has built, can be utilized to help reduce the chance of widespread colonization.

3/20/13-Keltzie Smith Today we learned about phage titering. pfu's are plaque forming units. We tried to see how competent our phage was, unfortunately we ran into quite a few problems. Much of it due to our lack of experience. We put 10 microliters of phage with 90 microliters of LB and did a 1:10 dilution series. we put 20 microliters of each of the dilution series with .5mLs of E.coli. After we let a twenty minute incubation period pass we added 5 mLs of top agar and plated the phage. With the way everything went, I would imagine there will be a lot of contamination, but I certainly learned quite a bit about the process. Hopefully we see some good growth!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the"

Because Lambert iGEM presented the 2018 project in front of education experts, the team decided to focus how a lack of clean drinking water could lead to decreased literacy levels. Individuals living in developing nations walk, on average, 3.75 miles to fetch water. Women and children between the ages of 8 and 13 are often responsible for the task of collecting water. Due to the thousands of hours they have to spend annually hauling water, women are unable to get jobs or contribute financially to their households. In addition, children are unable to attend school or get an education.

Negative and Positive results
Boehringer Ingelheim presentation reflection
At the presentation at Boehringer Ingelheim, it was brought to our attention that we need to determine the threshold level, sensitivity, and specificity for our biosensor. To answer these questions, we had a meeting with Dr. Dana Boyd Barr from Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. She said that we should find our threshold level based on the infectivity rate of Cholera. She recommended that we lower the threshold from the infectivity rate because of how much water the average person drinks per day and that the Cholera cells will accumulate in the body. To add, she explained sensitivity and specificity to the team and how it is important because those values convey to the public the accuracy of our test. Dr. Barr described that we should compare our biosensor’s results to a reliable detection method’s results. She also recommended that we have a higher sensitivity to specificity in order to be health protective, but our specificity cannot be too low because we do not want to cause a false panic. Overall, Dr. Barr was helpful with outlining aspects of epidemiology that we were not familiar with.

The line perpendicular to and running away from cholera grew, while the streak adjacent to cholera did not! See the photo. Now – we need to verify that the cells don’t grew because lambda is killing them, and not because cholera secretes some toxin that does that.
This opens a new avenue of possibilities.  We need to discuss things with Dr. Grose, but probably we will abandon the idea of transforming a plasmid into TT9907.
It took about 4 hours, but today I set up the experiment to test whether any of the post electroporation colonies retains the ability to be lysed by lambda.  We grew up overnights from 40 colonies!  The overnights were ready today, so prepared 40 top agar lawns and added a drop of H202 in the middle to stress lambda to lyse, should lambda still be a dormant lysogen in our host cell.   We should see the results of the test tomorrow.
We ran the digested RecA and pIG12 backbone vector on a low-melt gel.  Under UV light we cut out a distinct band for RecA.  It is ready for ligation. The plasmid, however, was smeared.  Clarice is going to re-digest and re-run pIG12.

Cholera was patched next to our E.coli strain that contained the basic quorom sensing genes from cholera (LuxO/U/CqsS) and a reporter gene's promoter Qrr4 reading into RFP. There was no RFP seen to be produced. Very disappointing. We don't know what is wrong with our construct.

I can hardly believe it, but not a single plate among the 40 shows plaques! We didn’t get lucky.  We really are at a stalemate with this goal to transform a plasmid into these cells.  The other option is to transform a plasmid into cells, and later infect them with lambda bacteriophage.  It looks like that’s what we’re going to have to do.
We transformed pIG90 (RecA with a pIG12 backbone) into chemically competent cells via heat shock transformation.  Dr. Grose thinks it would be best if at this point, the two cholera sub-groups united into one project"

iGEM High School 2012
As part of our Human Approach, we took on the task to promote the iGEM High School competition on our university’s high school campuses. Back in February, we sent e-mails to the Science Division directors informing them about iGEM and offering to help them should they want to participate. Although three of the five schools expressed interest, only Silvia Bernat Sarret, science director from Eugenio Garza Sada High School Campus (PEGS), decided to go ahead with the project. The others were concerned about the lack of time and some thought that their student’s level was not up to the task.
Chemistry teacher Nelly Margarita Martínez (who also teaches an Introduction to Biotechnology class) was selected as the head instructor. The project was offered through announcements in all relevant classes. We had the fortune that PEGS has an advanced biology program (aimed as a sort of pre-med high school) and that some of those students became involved, forming the core of the group. Ironically, no one from the Introduction to Biotechnology class chose to join.
After the round of announcements, the first meeting with the students was held on a Friday, March 16th. Fourteen showed up, nearly half of them from 6th semester. With the project description deadline looming near, the first order of business was to give them an introduction to iGEM and synthetic biology in order for them to brainstorm ideas for their goal. Some came up with anti-freeze proteins, others with microbial electrogeneration; there was enthusiasm about those ideas, but time and difficulty had to be taken into consideration. We proposed to them that a simple enzymatic process could be doable with both temporal and technical constraints. After some candidates were discussed, the final selection was the dye Tyrian purple.
The team went on to research the enzymatic pathway of the production of Tyrian purple in the mollusk from where it is extracted, the importance of the dye and the availability of an organic synthesis process. Through the next couple of weeks we helped them sort out the information they were getting and to structure a plan. The result can be found in their website (https://2012hs.igem.org/Team:PrepaTec_GarzaSadaMx).
Unfortunately, they weren’t able to get in touch with the researchers to obtain the genetic constructs they"

Figure 3-1 We envision using E. coli biofilms (green) to trap nanoparticles of different sizes and composition (pink).
Most wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) already use microbes to break down and remove organic components in wastewater (Sehar & Naz 2016). The recent increase in NP contaminants entering WWTPs, however, poses a threat to these microbes and the treatment process. For example, AgNPs have antimicrobial effects and other metal oxide NPs can inhibit microbes from performing important processes such as nitrification (Yun & Lee 2017; Walden & Zhang 2016). Compared to planktonic bacteria, biofilms are nearly four times more resistant to NPs, increasing their tolerance to NPs in wastewater (Choi et al. 2010).
Can Biofilms Trap Nanoparticles?
The first step of this approach is to test if an E. coli biofilm can effectively trap NPs. E. coli liquid cultures grown in LB broth were transferred to petri dishes, with each containing glass coverslips to provide a surface for adherence. The dishes were incubated at 37˚C for 7 to 14 days, with 2 mL of LB added every two days to prevent the media from drying out. Viscous, film-like substances began to develop, indicating the production of EPS and biofilm (figure 3-2). At this point, we could extract and wash the biofilm.
Figure 3-2 Growing E. coli biofilms. A,B) Liquid cultures were plated with glass coverslips and incubated for up to 2 weeks. C) Biofilm can be washed and used. Experiment: Yvonne W.
Hoping to image the structure of biofilms up close using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we tried different SEM sample fixation and preparation methods (figure 3-3 & table 1) (Fischer et al. 2012): A) freeze drying with a critical point dryer (CPD), B) fixation with glutaraldehyde (GA), and C) fixation with a combination of Alcian Blue, GA, and K4Fe(CN)6. We further improved image quality by taking multiple images of a field of view and stacking the images together"

Thursday
We had issues with SOC contamination today - We had to make a new batch for more transformations. We also tried transformation with the efficiency kit again, making sure we were following each step as it was written on our protocol. Friday Transformation of our 3A assembly colonies didn’t work, but the transformation of mcherry plasmids worked! This means that there’s nothing wrong with our transformation protocol. We will look into our digestion and ligation steps. We <3 troubleshooting! All part of the scientific process XD! Here’s a joke XD: What do you call it when McDonald sells cherries? mCherry! HAHAHA XD!
We made more chloramphenicol plates again! Yay!

Monday
We resuspended and transformed the promoter+RBS plasmids from the distribution kit. They turn red when resuspended! Such a pretty color!
Tuesday
A lot of our reagents came in today! WOOOOOOOOo! Since we’re having problems with transformation right now, we are troubleshooting our procedures to see if there’s anything wrong with our technique or protocols. We followed the iGEM standard transformation protocol and transformed our promoter+RBS plasmids again. Let’s hope they work!

Rare codons
When overexpressing genes from other organisms. Initially we won't be very worried about this, however there might be lower expression of the protein from the bacteria we will use. If this becomes a bigger problem we might use bacteria strains that already contains tRNA for different rare codons.
Neglect, synthesize the gene, overexpress rare tRNA or use a strain that already overexpress the tRNA

Lethbridge_HS,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmid into a bacterium the same concept, or is it separate in classification?  To answer this, we must look at the fact that bacteria rarely complete the duty we are attempting to task them and secondly are we making any changes to life at all or for pointless reasons. Whether or not changes are made is an important factor because we are not adjusting the organism’s genome but instead simply placing a plasmid inside, much like an organ transplant which has no criticism within the church. We asked Father Wilbert, the Canmore parish priest, what he thought about our area of work and his main concern was the involvement of human life and how critical the idea of working to better society is.
A person’s contribution to the evolvement of mankind is important when participating in work that is not always deemed right. A historic philosopher named Kant theorized that right or wrong is based off of one’s actions to fulfil a duty, and that good will is the ultimate virtue because it cannot be turned to selfish reasoning. (3) The Catholic belief coincides with Kant’s ideas on good will. This also includes the importance of bettering mankind when participating in synthetic biology, rather than using it to accomplish immoral ends. A similar topic related to ethics is a person’s conscience for the vatican says that “science without conscience can only lead to a mans ruin” (1) We must be aware of the complications that can arise and know personally what is right from wrong. “That everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion” Pope Leo XIII. Understanding that the Catholic Church completely supports scientific advancements for the improvement of our race is important, but to do it properly and ethically is vital.
The line between religion and science is not black and white, allowing room for varying perspectives. Therefore, outlining the rights and wrongs within a project is difficult to do without including bias. The position of this and any other project on the spectrum of right and wrong should rely on the well considered and fully informed decisions of many diverse perspectives if any conscientious progress is to be made.
Thank you to the OLS Canmore team for giving us their ethical review of our project"

DNA Cloning
To express the various components of our scaffold for self-assembly experiments, our DNA constructs were cloned into plasmid vectors using Gibson assembly cloning methods. The products of the reaction were transformed into competent cells and colonies were screened for recombinant plasmids. 8 constructs were successfully cloned into corresponding pETDuet-1 and pRSFDuet-1 plasmids, while 6 constructs were cloned into pET-19b plasmids.
Protein Production
Components of the protein-enzyme scaffold must be expressed and purified for self-assembly and enzyme activity tests. Sequence-verified plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli cells and expressed for recombinant protein production. 9 proteins were successfully expressed and purified, enabling the construction of our scaffold-enzyme complex.
Assembly
To create the enzyme-scaffold complex, the alpha and beta prefoldin hexamer are to be covalently attached to the enzymes through SpyTag/SpyCatcher or SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher reactions. These assembly stages were characterised successfully, and we were able to demonstrate the formation of alpha and beta prefoldin hexamers, covalently attach the IaaH-SpyTag protein to alpha prefoldin and gamma prefoldin scaffolds and visualise filaments of gamma prefoldin attached to enzymes with Transmission Electron Microscopy.
FRET
By performing FRET, we aimed to investigate the distance between two fluorescent proteins, mCerulean3 and mVenus, attached to our Assemblase scaffold. This would allow us to gain an understanding of the proximity of enzymes in our Assemblase system and therefore help us perform more accurate modelling of reaction kinetics.
Enzyme Assays
The Salkowski assay and HPLC were used to determine the presence of tryptophan, Indole Acetamide and Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) in the IAA production pathway. The Salkowski assay is a simple, fast and inexpensive method of"

Naringenin pathway modelling influenced design
Results of the naringenin pathway modelling demonstrated that weaker expression of the first two genes and 10-fold stronger expression of the last two genes would reduce the build-up of malonyl CoA, a pathway intermediate, and optimise naringenin synthesis. As a result of this, two synthetic promoters (BG28 and BG51) (Figure 7) were selected and an additional E. coli his operon terminator was placed after the first two genes (Figure 6 and Figure 8). These changes to the operon design could allow enhanced naringenin production in future experiments. More information about the pathway can be found here.

Primers were designed for amplification of the backbone and the 4 gBlocks (Table 1). These were designed in Benchling. The primers were used to both amplify the gBlock templates (synthesised by IDT) for use in Gibson assemblies, and to detect the specific genes from the operon that could be present in transformed cells.

Design 1
Initially we had two bioreactors, one for removing perchlorate from water on Earth and another for producing oxygen on Mars. They were to be identical other than an attachment for Mars which would allow the input of regolith rather than water.
We wanted to improve upon the bioreactor designed by previous iGEM team, Leiden 2016 , so this was where our bioreactor started. It was very simple with mobilised bacteria being mixed with perchlorate in a single chamber.
Design 2
We decided to try and have the two reactions (perchlorate to chlorite, and chlorite to chloride and oxygen) taking place in separate areas of the bioreactor. Because the operons involved the whole process is so long, we were hoping that this would allow us to insert less DNA into E. coli, making expression more likely.
However, this idea didn’t last long enough for us to come up with a design, as we discovered that chlorite is toxic to E. coli and so it would all have to take place in one chamber and with one operon.
Design 3
After reading Biotechnological Applications of Microbial (Per)chlorate Reduction (Ouwei Wang and John D. Coates, 2017) we considered the idea of growing E. coli on a cathode in order to provide it with more electrons and speed up the reaction by up to 12%. The paper proposed a bioreactor in which DPRB (disparate perchlorate reducing bacteria) grew on a cathode, supplying ions that seemed to be a limiting factor in the reaction. Hydrogens would pass from the anode to the cathode through  a cation selective membrane, aiding the reaction in the diagram (left). This would speed up the first half of the process, converting perchlorate to chlorite, as this is the slower half. We would simply replace the DPRB with modified E. coli.

Bacterial Ghost: Design
We put Gram-negative bacteria lysis gene protein E under the control of pBAD promoter because of its short inducing time and L-arabinose concentration dependent trait. By making tunnels through inner and outer membrane of E.coli, we solve the conundrum that large molecules cannot enter the cells. At the same time, the periplasmic space remains intact, renders us the chance to utilize it as reaction site.
(Protein E is a dual-domain protein cloned from bacteriophage ψX-174. The two domains of protein E help to fuse inner- and outer-membrane, keeping the periplasmic space intact.)
