Fig. 20 illustrated that the measured RFP fluorescence value increased from ATc concentration of 10 ng/ml to 80 ng/ml. The red fluorescence at different ATc concentrations can be visually observed, and it is concluded that the expression of red fluorescent protein was indeed controlled by the PLtetO1 promoter as the ATc concentration was less than 80 ng/ml. At a ATc concentration of 120 ng/ml to 150 ng/ml, the fluorescence intensity value was significantly weakened. We speculated that higher ATc concentrations (more than 120 ng/ml) had an adverse effect on cell growth.
    In further experiments, we set up a control group (CMV promoter initiation) and found that excessive addition of ATc would affect the expression of fluorescent protein and inhibit the growth of the strain. We are looking for the most suitable addition to ATc, which will guide our product design.
     2. In the suicide mode, safety is ensured by expressing the toxin protein mazF. The arabinose was added, PBAD initiated the expression of the downstream product, and the green fluorescent expression effect was observed under a fluorescence microscope.
Figure 21. Fluorescence images at different arabinose concentrations
    We set 3 level arabinose concentration (higher=50%, medium=25%, none=0%) Fig. 21 illustrated that the measured GFP fluorescence value increased by the addition of arabinose. The green fluorescence at different level arabinose concentration can be visually observed, and it is concluded that the expression of green fluorescent protein was indeed controlled by the PBAD promoter .
     3. Using bacteriostatic experiments, we obtained more accurate experimental data
Figure 22. Reflects the lethal state of the toxin protein
    Fig. 21 Under the condition of adding arabinose concentration of 50% and reaction time of 150 min, we can achieve the best lethal efficiency.     According to our human practice, the most comfortable concentration sets at 5 mM. (more details on our human practice) We try to control the amount of substrate at 32.5 mM.     However, the substrate of PLA is the same as 2-PE. To produce both of them, we have to add excess substrate. We came up with another idea, changing the RBS to increase the production of 2-PE. After we changed it to a strong RBS, the"

We got two plasmids from the Fussenegger group at the ETH Zurich containing a codon optimized version of bpsA
(pMM64) and svp (pMM65), respectively, for expression in HEK 297-3 cells [Muller 2012]. The first goal is to
transform the plasmids into competent E. coli (Rosetta) and check functionality of the plasmids in our cells.
Indigoidine production with pMM-plasmids I (Ilia)
After Transformation cells are grown first on Amp medium and thereafter on Kan medium.
transform competent Rosetta with 225 ng pMM065 and 253.5 ng pMM064
plate on Amp plate
pick colonies from Amp plate, make liquid cultures in LB + Kan + IPTG(1 mM)
Evening: no growth in liquid culture => prepare ON culture in LB+Amp
Put ON culture in incubator
prepare competent Rosetta-pMM064 from ON culture
transform with 225 ng pMM065
plate on Kan+IPTG plate
no growth on Kan plate
Results and Discussion
There were no blue colonies. Transformation will be repeated and medium will be provided with both antibiotics.

It has many attractive qualities: the color is visible in normal lighting; no special supplements are necessary for the color to develop; the coding sequence for the protein is short (as compared to other pigment generating proteins); finally, the protein itself generates the color, which hopefully will result in faster image development than a protein which catalyzes a reaction that generates color.
Engineering Problems
        We have identified five major engineering problems with Etch-a-Sketch that we have called: Light, Sensitivity, Selectivity, Speed, and Noise.
Light - In order to draw on bacteria with a laser pointer, we need the bacteria to respond to light.
Sensitivity - In order to draw naturally, we need the bacteria to respond to extremely quick pulses of light; otherwise, we would have to make very slow strokes.
Selectivity - In order to use the bacteria in ambient lighting, we need to the bacteria to be able to selectively respond to just the laser pointer.
Speed - After we make our strokes with the laser pointer, we would like to see color quickly.
Noise - We do not want random spots to appear on our canvas.
        We have prioritized Light and Sensitivity. This hopefully would result in something that works like an old camera; instant image capture but overnight image development.
Circuit
Overview
We have broken down the circuit into four states: Deactivated, Activation 1, Activation 2, and Activated. To recap the parts of our circuit: LovTAP represses ptrp in the light; trpR represses ptrp; cI434 repressed pRM; cI activates pRM; T7 polymerase (T7 P) transcribes at the T7 promoter; and mRFP1 generates a red color.
Deactivated
In the dark, LovTAP is inactive; transcription levels from ptrp should be high, creating a lot of cI434 which should shut down transcription from pRM.
Activation 1
        After light is applied, LovTAP is activated, repressing transcription from ptrp. cI434 levels should begin to fall.
Activation 2
        Once cI434 levels have dropped enough so that transcription from pRM can begin, the circuit enters an irreversible positive feedback loop. trpR levels will begin to increase, preventing the creation of cI434. cI levels will increase, further increasing transcription from pRM. Finally, T7 polymerase levels will increase, allowing the creation of mRFP1.
Activated

There exist different auxins but the auxin which is mainly produced is Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).
IAA is known to be synthesized de novo using tryptophan (Trp) as a precursor or using a Trp-independent pathway [3].The Trp-dependent pathway is shown in the figure below[4]. The catalysing enzymes for the first step is IAAM and for the second step it is IAAH [5]. These are the two enzymes we were working with to approach metabolic channeling.

While the PCR worked properly, ligation of the linearized new plasmid was not successful and no transformed colonies could be found in two attempts. A reason for this could be insufficient phosphorylation of the PCR product. Because already Freiburg pre- and suffix primers for the CBDs were at hand the order of the fusion proteins could easily been changed, when a Freiburg suffix primer for the GFP would be available, so it was ordered.

When changing the fusing proteins to GFP N-terminal and CBD C-terminal an additional single GFP was cloned in a plasmid behind a J61101 RBS to see the expression of the J23100/J61101 promoter/RBS and to have a corresponding protein for the assay as a negative control. The result was the same as before, no green colonies. The colony PCRs and digestions showed the right bands, but no construct and even the single GFP was expressed correctly. Sequencing later showed that a deletion of one of the first few bases of the ORF caused a frame shift. At this point in time it seemed as if the promoter/RBS did not work properly. So in spite of continuing working as planed on the linker between GFP and the CBDs, the efforts now focused on the usage of promoter and RBS. In the last week of lab work it was tried to assemble GFP with a CBD behind the strong B0034 RBS, followed by cutting this piece out with XbaI and PstI and ligate this insert via a standard suffix insertion with the J23100 promoter. After some unsuccessful attempts AgeI ran empty and could not be ordered in time. A last quick-shot with a PCR product of an old (but correct) assembly (CBDcex-GFP) and a single GFP_Freiburg went well in adding it to the RBS but did not show green glowing colonies when fused to the promoter.

We also wished to try to incorporate the concept of Responsible Innovation into our project as much as possible and we believed that the stage gating process allowed for the consideration of wider moral responsibilities and for maximum engagement with members of the public.
The Stage Gate approach consists of both stages and gates. The stages involve data gathering and acting whereas the gates allow for an opportunity to reflect over the data gathered and to see if anything needs to be altered.
Gate 1 - The Idea
Idea – Integrase switch for controllable gas vesicle production
Anticipate
Switch applications – How will it help the wider synthetic biology community?
Will it be replacing an existing technology?
What problems might we encounter? GM opposition
Lab safety:
GM risk assessment must be completed in compliance with the University’s policies
iGEM safety form to be completed
Dry lab risk assessments for measuring procedures completed
COSHH forms also completed
Stage 1 – Developing the Basic Technology and Assessing Needs
Act The Switch
Create a working switch, identifiable with RFP/ GFP
Flipping in the presence of arabinose as proof of concept
The Vesicles
Identify the minimum proteins required for gas vesicle production
Use modelling to see if flagella knock-out is required
Characterise for future users – critical pressure, floatation speed etc.
Switch Controlled Vesicle Production
Get switch to flip upon given stimulus to turn on gas vesicle production
Engage
Talk to the public gauge reactions to GM products at Science Centre events
Open communications with synthetic biologists and people in the industry from each of the further parts of stage 3 [e.g. for biodesalination – Scottish Water and charities such as Water Aid].
Can they see any potential in our product?
Are there features to be added or removed for it to be useful?
Gate 2 – Choosing an Application for the Switch
Reflect
Based on the data from communications, reflect on the benefits and perception of each potential application.
Did one in particular illicit a more favourable response?
Lab Safety
Receive and update the GM and general lab risk assessments to include the new organisms and parts
Stage 2A – Focusing on Biodesalination: “Testing the Water”
Anticipate
Preform a more in-depth analysis of the impaction of our desalination method to include other countries
Conduct a thorough investigation of the laws encompassing the products

Il a ainsi étudié puis désigné les gènes comportant des mutations avant de mener l' étude de l’un d’eux en laboratoire.
Une fois la molécule de ciblage et les mutations définies, il a fallu construire notre vecteur cellulaire .
David CHAROY, étudiant en 5ème année spécialisé en R&D en biotechnologie et Cyprien VERSEUX, étudiant en 1ère année ont, dans un premier temps, fait un état de l’art du phage afin d’en comprendre son fonctionnement.
Ils ont ensuite décidé de le « BioBricker » entièrement afin de le rendre modulable.
Connaissant parfaitement le phage, ils ont choisi l’emplacement optimal pour la protéine de ciblage identifiée par Damien. Cependant un problème subsistait, le vecteur cellulaire naturellement non infectieux pour les cellules eucaryotes, pourrait-il pénétrer notre cible ?
David eut alors l’idée d’ajouter une seconde protéine de ciblage à notre vecteur. Une protéine issue de l’adénovirus, servant à l’échappement de l’endosome. Il l’a ainsi BioBrickée et ajoutée à notre vecteur .
Pour son étude en laboratoire , le phage a été étudié par David, Nassrine LABLACK et Aurélie NEGREL, toutes deux étudiantes en 5ème année spécialisées en R&D en biotechnologie. Ces dernières ainsi que David ont une forte expérience en laboratoire. David et Aurélie ont suivi une formation technique avant d’intégrer Sup’Biotech.

Our first collaboration was with the Georgia State iGEM team.  In 2014, the goal of Georgia State University’s iGEM team was to produce mambalgin-1 via a synthetic biological system. Mambalgin-1 is a peptide found in an extremely harmful venom native to black mambas. The task of milking these snakes is not only labor intensive, but dangerous, prompting research into alternative methods of producing this substance. Mambalgin-1 plays a critical role in the world of medicine as it mediates symptoms of and sometimes treats diseases such as epilepsy, cancer, and severe chronic pain.
To improve the part created by GSU, we decided to express mambalgin-1 in A. baylyi, and once it is purified, we will further characterize it by performing mass spectroscopy.
For more information on the work done by GSU, click here.
Our second collaboration was with the Imperial College iGEM team on their A.L.I.C.E. software. We submitted monoculture data from our A. baylyi experiments into their software program."

Cloning of Lignin Peroxidase - BBa_K500000
Lignin peroxidase is known to have dye-decolorising activity, being particularly effective when the substrates are sulphonated azo-dyes. This led us to investigate whether we could incorporate the Lignin Peroxidase (BBa_K500000) BioBrick submitted by Tianjin iGEM 2010 into our project and provide further characterisation; there was no available data in the Registry regarding to the functionality or viability of this fungal part in E. coli.
The sequence for this part, found here (insert link), was codon-optimized for E. coli K12 and synthesis was requested along with the BioBrick prefix and suffix. While we were able to get this fragment synthesised and sent to us, the toxicity of the DNA fragment in E.coli prevented us from obtaining any decolourisation data. However, we were still able to further characterise the experimental issues of (BBa_K500000) in E.coli.
The gene synthesis was carried out by GeneOracle, who provided us with data for the toxicity issues that they encountered. In summary, in-vitro synthesis presented no particular problems, but when the sequence was cloned into the destination strain, the sequence was modified with a number of mutations, deletions, and modifications, that made it impossible to recover the original gene. Cloning was attempted on a pGOv4 plasmid; detailed information about this plasmid can be found in the files below.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Ethic_-_-_TEXT.html,"ium avium is sometimes responsible for serious infections in humans. But, as noted by Willy Rozenbaum, ""it is a bacterium that is ubiquitous, it is found in tap water, we are almost all contaminated"" but this contamination has rarely consequential effects. The cases reported involved immunodepressed patients, for example. We also planned to analyze the effects of infection on tumors. Anyway, Willy Rozenbaum believes that ""all that is not very annoying”. In addition to numerous tests and simulations that have to be conducted before the use of our treatment, this statement is justified by the fact that bacteria are lysed when there is a release of the phage, it does not persist in the body.
Francois Le Fevre has legitimately questioned about the possibility that the phage infect other bacteria already present in the organism. We have therefore explained to him that our cell vector encapsidate only the therapeutic plasmid, not its genome. If it infects bacteria of the commensal flora of the organism (which may be limited by changes in protein internalization), the bacteria will receive just the therapeutic plasmid, and the phage will not be able to multiply We can also worry about the drifts, and abuses of the transgene integration, as the risk of homologous recombination or risky integration. Lluis M. Mir supported us about this idea, that our phage is a prokaryote, but cells of human body are eukaryotes. It can therefore be no risk of homologous recombination or integration between its genome and our cells genome, as they do not belong to the same ""world"": ""there is no possible integration. That's the real advantage of being at the crossroads between eukaryotic and prokaryotic.
Furthermore, Willy Rozenbaum reminded ""this type of subject is very well controlled today in terms of security"": the product would obviously not be marketed until being subjected to numerous tests to check its innocuousness. Organizations as Afssaps, in France manage the safety of  health products. If we consider that the risk is not negligible, we must ask whether it is worthwhile to be taken into account. Thierry Magnin gave a translation of the principle of responsibility made by Hans Jonas: ""Before trying to estimate the risk, I'll try to work up on the most serious risk."" Does the targeted disease justify it? According to Bernard Baertschi, ""Cancer is an extremely serious disease, for which we accept to take risks even now.""

More than 50 iGEM teams in China attend the meeting, and we had heated discussion about synthetic biology with each other. During the meeting, we demonstrated our project, from the design to the preliminary results. iGEMers from other teams put forward some constructive suggestions, and we also gained some collaborations opportunities from them. We were happy to make friends with some iGEMers and we stayed in contact with each other even after the meeting, which contributes to integrated collaboration. CCiC is really a big event for iGEMers in China. see more
3. OUC-China
In this year’s collaboration, the OUC-China team offered us a comic book about synthetic biology. The book exhibited the complex biology model and principle with funny comics, making it more easier for students to read and understand. So when we went to the Wuhan NO.20 high school classes to communicate with them, we brought the comic book with us, and hoped to bring the young students together to appreciate the fun of biological knowledge. Firstly we introduced in the form of comics, and brought them into the world of biology. We also used this comic book for attracting and recruiting new members for our next year’s competition.
During our voluntary project and introductory courses this comic book greatly assisted us to introduce synthetic biology to the public. In turn, we helped to make a detailed investigation and collect the reader’s opinions about this book, we really hope to make this comic book better to help more people appreciate the charm of synthetic biology.
4. HUBU-Wuhan
We established a close relationship with HUBU-Wuhan. It is the first time for them to participate in the iGEM competition. We have two formal meetings with HUBU, the first one on December 1, 2017, and the second one on July 13th, 2018. Besides, there are continuous communication along with the whole process of our iGEM project. In the second meeting, we went to their the conference room, listening to their weekly report. In addition, our PI, Jun Dai also gave valuable suggestions about how to improve their project. Our latest meeting was on 31th Aug, during the 5th CCiC in Shanghaitech University, we shared our latest process of the project, also appreciated each other’s posters as well.

Violacein Pigments
Background Design Characterisation Reference
Design
The Vio operon had numerous forbidden restriction sites, far too many to remove by PCR.  We thus decided to synthesize it. This allowes us too remove these restriction sites and optimize codon usage for E. coli, to create the following biobrick:
As DNA2.0 very generously agreed to synthesize the entire operon for us, we designed it to include all the five genes, each preceded by a ribosome binding site, and flanked by the prefix and suffix. The final plan for the inserted operon is shown below:
This will be held under a repressible promoter on the pJexpress cloning cassette from DNA2.0. We codon optimised the operon for both E. coli and B. subtilis, and designed it to include restriction sites with complementary sticky ends around vioD and vioC. This allowed us to remove both genes easily to create more colours from the vio operon.
Creating colours
Once the violacein biobrick arrived we expressed in in TOP10 E. coli to create the purple pigment. We then carried out two more digests to see if we could create further colours:
BamHI and BglII = removed vioC and produced a dark green pigment
BglII and BclI = removed vioD and produced a light green pigment
With more time, we would have been able to use this system to create colour logic gates; where different inputs would create a mix of different coloured outputs. This is discussed further on the | Future page, where we explore the different potentials and implications of our project.
Both of these new pigments were entered into the registry, along with the whole violacein operon for the purple pigment.

Ointment against MRSA ( Top )
Purified or partially purified bacteriocins hold great promise in treating an unhealthy bacterial flora by targeting pathogenic bacteria. They may be employed as pharmabiotics or novel alternatives to existing antibiotics. Promising results have been shown in fighting MRSA with purified bacteriocins Dobson, A., et al. (2012). ""Bacteriocins Bacteriocin production: a probiotic trait?"" Appl Environ Microbiol, 78, 1-6. . Hans Jørn Kolmos suggested that we could use pure bacteriocins in a ointment, which can be applied at the nostrils to avoid MRSA that typically niches here. Applying the bacteriocins at the nose will make their effect most effective on carriers.
Bacteriocins for medical equipment ( Top )
It has been proven that surgical suture coating with antimicrobial peptides incorporated is more effective than the Vicryl Plus Antimicrobial Suture against S. aureus in time-kill experiments Li, Y., et al. (2012). ""New bactericidal surgical suture coating"" Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids., 28(33), pp. 12134–9. . There lies therefore great potential in using bacteriocins for medical equipment.
Spider Silk
Recombinant spider silk can be used for many purposes. Today’s goal for wound treatment is a patch that can provide protection, care and minimize the amount of pain, the patient might experience. During our project with creating Bacto-Aid, we found out that the silk’s potential is great. Here is some of the ideas for its future application.
Creation of skin cell culture ( Top )
It has been a goal for many years to get a material that is as close to human skin as possible, because skin grafting from other parts of the body or donors is often limited. There has also been tentatives of combining it with keratinocytes and fibroblasts to create a skin cell culturing. It was also shown that spider silk could guide the proliferation of the cells in the proper directions (staying in the frame) Wendt, H., et al. (2011).

Overview
The final step in our detection method consists on measuring and analyzing DNA molecules that have been selectively tagged for sequencing. We have succeeded in developing such a method based on the use of our own designed fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5 ( Picelli, et al, 2014., Hu, et al, 2018 ). This page is dedicated to describe how we designed this novel approach, how this was tested and what applications this method can be extended to.
Targeted DNA enrichment during library preparation
We focused on the Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing platform as the core technology to measure and obtain DNA sequences from samples. In this sequencing platform, DNA molecules diffuse through a protein pore embedded on a silica membrane. Changes in electrical signal due to this DNA diffusion are measured. The specific changes in voltage are sequence dependent, and software tools from ONT can convert this signal into DNA sequences. On one sequencing device (Flow-Cell), more than 2000 active pores can generate data at the same time. The amount of data produced from this type of sequencing is truly gigantic, and efficient data analysis of these measurements is crucial to filter and compare data ( Jain, Oslen, Paten & Akeson, 2016 ).
To control this molecule diffusion through the pore and facilitate the determination of specific sequences, the DNA molecules to be sequenced are attached to a so called motor-protein. This protein regulates the rate of diffusion through the nanopore and is indispensable for this type of sequencing. During library preparation with ONT an enzyme called transposase is used to randomly fragment DNA sequences and add DNA adapters. These DNA adapters are ligated to another DNA molecule attached to the motor protein in a subsequent step ( Jain, Oslen, Paten & Akeson, 2016 ). We aimed to change the fragmentation step of this reaction with a newly designed fusion protein that will make this adapter integration sequence specific. Thus, during library preparation, specific DNA sequences will be favourably adapted and enriched for sequencing, as shown in figure 1.
Figure 1. Differences between random library preparation with transposase from ONT library preparation (left) and targeted library preparation with our fusion protein (right). The principle behind targeted library preparation is to enrich certain DNA targets before the sequencing run.
Enrichment for specific DNA sequences allows more detailed studies and processing of higher number of samples with lower data generation. To make multiplexing easier, we developed a software tool that generates specific DNA adapter sequences needed for ONT sequencing. Each sequence generated can be directly linked to the sample identification"

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," sugar intake and changes on weight found on children. That may be owing to the children’s ignorance on the advice for diet we gave. Nonetheless, if we just focus on their consumption of sugary beverages, there’s some relation be found. Their habit of having sugary beverages significantly influences their weight, leading to obesity. The research discovered that the obesity rate of children who took in the most sugary beverage exceeded those took in the fewest by 50%.
   
However, in Taiwan, the prevailing of handmade drinks has made it easy for us to find shops selling them everywhere. It is relatively hard for people to resist the temptation of sugar. If we are to solve the problem of obesity, the most direct approach is to avoid our intestine from absorbing sugar. With such aspiration, 2017 Mingdao IGEM team has designed a kind of bacteria which boost a higher efficiency of sugar absorbing. It can survive in the intestine and absorb excessive sugar before the villus have done it. This is how we take biological means to tackle the detriments sugar may cause. The bacteria is designed with a suicide system, which it will be brought to death if the concentration of sugar is lower than a standard amount we regulate. It will be discharged from our body with excretes. 
   If the product is successfully commercialized, do you agree with the way we solve the problem? Or is there an alternative? And, in your opinion, what impact may be brought to the world?
The bellows are viewpoints from the students in The Mingdao Voice. 
Jenny Yeh :
I don't approve of the way to solve the problem of sugar. I think it cures the symptoms, not the disease. Although it seems that this way can fast deal with the threat which sugar poses to health, the problem of high sugar foods flooding is still unsolved.Perhaps this can receive the result in a short time ,but this can't be a longterm solution. Those who use this product may think it's okay to increase the intake of sugar, so they won't control their own desire or resist the temptation of sugar. Instead, the uncontrolled intake of sugar attributes to the serious sugar flooding. As for the influence on health condition, I think users may reduce the consumption of nutrition and ignore the balanced diet because of the more intake of sugar foods. What's more, the harmful substances in high sugar foods are not only sugar but also much chemical addition or a large amount of oil. As a result, the product can merely solve the problem of sugar content, but it still makes users ingest even more harmful substances by"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," entirely synthetic NRPS modules composed of user-defined domains.  As model system, we used the unimodular indigoidine synthetase NRPS from P. luminescens subsp. Laumondii TT01. We predicted the modular composition and domain borders of IndC using our own NRPS-Designer software.  We then started by replacing the native IndC T-domain with T-domains derived from different NRPS pathways from different bacterial strains, among those the T-domain from the BpsA indigoidine synthetase from S. lavendulae ATCC11924. Constructs were transformed into E. coli alongside with an PPTase expression cassette in order to screen for functional IndC variants. As hoped, a subset of the natural T-domains were functioning in context of the IndC scaffold module, leading to indigoidine production and thereby blue coloring of colonies and corresponding liquid cultures. We then engineered a variety of synthetic T-domains derived from consensus sequences of different natural T-domains. Again, a subset of these T-domains successfully maintained indigoidine production ( Fig. 9 ).  Notably, one of our engineered IndC construcats showed an indigoidine production even higher compared to the wild-type IndC (T-domain Plu2642; Figure 3 ).  This is particularly remarkably as our results contradict to previous studies of NRPS domains that reported the native T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase BpsA to be absolutely essential for protein function (and therefore not replaceable by other T-domains).  ([Owen2012]).  However, to our surprise, the BpsA T-domain-containing IndC construct did not yield any detectable indigoidine production, although BpsA shares strong sequence homology with IndC. We hypothesized, that the selection of the exact border could be critical for maintaining domain functionality when introduced into a novel NRPS module scaffold. Therefore, we amplified different BpsA T-domain variants differing in their domain border and introduced them into the IndC scaffold. Remarkably, a subset of the resulting IndC variants showed successful indigoidine production.  We thus revaluated all native and synthetic T-domains in light of this finding and performed a second screening round in which we were able to rescue even more functional IndC variants, proofing our abovementioned hypothesis.  We also co-transformed all engineered IndC construct bearing different natural and synthetic T-domains with four different PPTase expression constructs. To our surprise, the T-domains"

Periplasmic and Outer Membrane-Localisation of Fluorescent Proteins
In addition to our analysis of candidate hypervesiculating strains, another aspect of our project was the directing of fluorescent proteins (GFP or RFP) to the periplasmic space or the outer membrane. We aimed to localise RFP to the periplasm through the attachment of a Sec-signal tag from the pelB leader sequence. This should export RFP to the periplasm via the Sec pathway [7]. Meanwhile, GFP was fused to the C-terminus of the Ice Nucleation Protein, N- and C- termi (INPNC). This is a well characterised outer membrane anchor, and thus fusion of GFP to this protein should result in outer membrane localisation.
We hope the results of this project will serve future teams well, enabling them to utilise OMVs as a platform technology for the application of synthetic biology projects.
Our Instruments
Given that OMVs are nanoscale, on the order of 10-20nm in diameter, we needed two really sensitive machines to see them.
The Zeiss LSM 880 is a state-of-the-art, high-resolution microscope of the confocal variety. We chose to use it as it possesses a few properties that are key to best imaging our project. For starters, it can take fluorescent images, and detect signals from GFP and RFP. More importantly, though, the images it takes are slices. This means, for example, instead of looking at the top of a cell, it can look inside and see its cross-section. This is critical for one of our aims, which was to see fluorescence localised in either the periplasm or bound to the membrane, as that can only be distinguished from cytoplasmic fluorescence via a cross-sectional view. Further, its ability to take videos of live cells was tempting, but ultimately passed aside. The only downside was perhaps its inability to reach the resolution required to see most OMVs, which often have diameters of 10-20nm. We would like to thank the staff at UNSW’s Biomedical Imaging Facility for training us in the use of this expensive instrument, and equipping us with the skillsets to use it independently.
The NanoSight LM20 was used to quantify and characterise samples of OMVs we harvested from E. coli. The LM20 uses a laser light source to illuminate nano-scale particles. Particles appear individually as point-scatterers, moving under Brownian motion which is recorded as a video which can be analysed by the provided software (Nan"

Thanks to Synbiome we had the chance to involve scientists originally unrelated to the field of synthetic biology as our instructors. They believed so much our project that we’re not only working at Synbiome  in a competitive optical but mostly looking forward  to reach a publication at the end of the year.
These rows have been written only to give you all the feelings that this experience has meant for us, we really hope that you will enjoy Synbiome.
Looking for Boston
During the Regional Jamboree in Amsterdam we focused our attention in collecting any kind of feedbacks from everybody: judges, instructors, advisors and other igemmers.
This has been really useful also to plan our work during this supplementary month.
Looking for Boston we decided to change the genetic circuit inside the bacterial strain A.
At the beginning of this experience we believed that forcing a strong mutualism between the two bacterial strains would represent the best way to build a stable consortium. Following this purpose we designed for Amsterdam a bacterial strain A, which in response to OXOC8 produces OXOC12 and glucosidase and a bacterial strain B, which produces OXOC8 and glucosidase in presence of OXOC12. Both A and B are not sensible to their own language and so A needs B and vice versa. This kind of circuit guarantees a strong mutualism but will also generate a kind of useless redundancy in which both A and B produce the same  reward for the whole system.
Moreover this genetic circuit needs an initial external injection of or OXOC8 or OXOC12 to start the system.
Our feelings suggested us to keep Symbiome simple and more effective associating to each characters a specific and unique task.
On these new evidences we decided to give to cell A the role of starting up the system by constitutively producing OC12, leaving to cells B and C the production of the rewards, respectively the beta-glucosidase and the secreted beta-lactamase.

Figure 2: 4th Water Research Horizon Conference “Water Scarcity and Global change” in Berlin
The main goal of the participation on the 4th Water Research Horizon Conference “Water Scarcity and Global change”  in Berlin on the 25th of June 2013 was to inform ourselves about worldwide water scarcity and global change. We hoped to get inspirations for our outreach and human practice effort. Moreover we were interested in the worldwide practical realization of minimizing “the water problem”. Especially the diverse ways of approach in different countries and the existing solutions were of interest (see Figure 2) to see how our project fits into this scope. In addition to the main speeches of ambassadors from different communities and companies we participated on a workshop session with speeches and discussion called “Water and Soils for Food and Energy - A Question of Technological Development?”.
We realized that it is quite difficult to give a straight answer to this question. J. Bouma (formerly Wageningen University, The Netherlands) answered with “No, not alone, but start with existing technology and go from there”. Whereas R. Ardakanian (United Nations University, Dresden) just said “yes” after his speech. But not only the answers on the topic question differed, also the point of view concerning to the worldwide water problem, scarcity and the definition of common water diverged. In his speech, R"

As we experienced some minor differences between the sequencing information and the theoretical sequence provided by the Uppsala team, we discussed these results with the iGEM Wageningen Team.
In later experiments the colonies did not develop as much color in Wageningen as they used to do in our lab. We discussed this fact with the Wageningen team and gave them some hints to optimal culture conditions and color development based on our own experiments and experience.

iGEM Team Uppsala
While working on our iGEM project we constantly tried to improve our system. Therefore we contacted the Uppsala 2013 iGEM team to obtain the chromoproteins they designed. They sent us four different chromoproteins, whereof we integrated  eforRed BBa_K592012,  aeBlue BBa_K864401 and amilGFP BBa_K592010 in our construct for a better visualization and easier detection of our different strains.

iGEM Team Norwich
The iGEM Team Norwich asked us to support their project with soil samples from Braunschweig. Therefore Jan and Kerstin spread out to find suitable soil from different locations. The soil was taken from 2 cm below the surface and was transferred into 15 ml falcon tubes with specific labels. Five samples were taken in total from a meadow, a flowerbed, a riverbank, a walkway and a tree root environment. The tubes were sealed with parafilm and sent to Norwich. Click here to see what they did with the samples!

The PCR is designed to generate a linear fragment containing both the transporter, the KanMX selection marker, and 50 bp long regions homologous to the intended site of recombination in the genome. (During this PCR, 50 bp long homology will be added to the 3’ end to enable genome integration. 5’ homology is designed already in the ordered insert.) This linear cassette can be then transformed into our lab strain, where it will integrate into the location of original transporter. The planned integration is illustrated in figure 8.
Figure 8. Integration of the VL3 QDR2 transporter into the genome of SS328.
For the same reason as in the case of stress promoters, these inserts aren’t compatible with Biobrick assembly standard 10.
“ For the final product, we will need to have both the VL3 transporter and the stress promoter in yeast cells ”
Degradation
Background
The second part of our project is the degradation of microcystin, a cyanobacterial toxin, and more specifically the degradation of microcystin-LR. A naturally occurring enzyme called microcystinase (MlrA) is capable of degrading different microcystins. Our goal is to introduce this enzyme into yeast cells and optimize its expression and purification so that it can be obtained in an active form.
Microcystinase
Microcystinase, or MlrA, is a member of a set of enzymes that degrade microcystins. These enzymes - MlrA, MlrB, MlrC and MlrD - are found naturally in some gram-negative bacteria, for example Sphingomonas sp. They each have a different function in the overall process of microcystin degradation. MlrA is first in the sequence to act. It hydrolyzes the peptide bond between the Adda and arginine amino acids in microcystin-LR (MC-LR). The breakage of this bond linearizes the toxin (figure 9). Following this, MlrB (a serine protease) and MlrC (a metalloprotease) are able to further degrade the linearized product into individual amino acids, which are then used in the cell’s metabolism. Therefore, the toxin is likely used as a carbon source. MlrD’s function is not fully understood at this point, but it may have a role in importing the toxins. (Bourne et al., 2001)

Carotenoid Pathway
Methods
Figure 3. The compositions of the Carotenoid pathway circuit. The upper strand is BBa_K539151 and the down strand is BBa_K539281 .
The upper strand of the Carotenoid pathway circuit BBa_K539151 is composed of (1) crtEBI BBa_K346090 that can produce Lycopene, (2) 37℃induced RBS BBa_K115002 , (3) crtY BBa_K118008 that can produce beta-Carotene, and (4) Terminator BBa_J61048 . When we assembled the upper strand, we found a point mutation of BBa_K118008 (iGEM08_Edinburgh) at SpeI site and we corrected it successfully.(ACCTAGT->ACTAGT). This corrected part is numbered as BBa_K539119 .
The down stand BBa_K539281 is composed of (1) Heat sensitive cI promoter with repressor BBa_K098995 , (2) crtZ BBa_I742158 that can produce Zeaxanthin, and (3) Terminator BBa_J61048 .
After both of the strands were constructed, we transferred the assembled insert BBa_K539151 from originally backbone(psb1k3) to psb3T5. The reason why we change the backbone is that the psb3T5 with low-copy-numbers is better for E.coli to express proteins. For the same reason, we transferred the complete insert BBa_K539281 from originally backbone (psb1k3) to psb4A5. (We chose different antibiotic backbone from the upper strand in order to cotransform.) Finally, we cotransformed BBa_K539151 on psb3T5 and BBa_K539281 on psb4A5 into DH5α.
To test the circuit whether it can work or not, we incubate the modified"

KIT-Kyoto,2010,Team:KIT-Kyoto#Project#Abstract_-_-_TEXT.html,"A operon and SufA protein acts as an assembly scaffold. Since levels of SufA protein are maximized quite rapidly, the activity of the sufA promoter was increased and sustained for at least 80 min. We think that the concentration-dependent activation of the sufA promoter also reflects the levels of SufA protein.
<Discussion>
Our results seem quite reasonable and suggest a possibility that we can adjust the expression levels of fluorescent genes by H2O2 concentration and by time. Therefore, we expect that lots of colors can be created using this system. Our expression system must be a powerful tool for the construction of the E.coli Pen.

4-1. Making inks with various colors.
Fig.8 Autofluorescence of LB medium and PBS.(A) PBS without UV light, (B) LB medium without UV light, (C) PBS under UV light, (D) LB medium under UV light.
Although we initially used the LB medium as a solvent, the colors of inks were not so clear because LB medium has high levels of background fluorescence (autofluorescence). To find the proper solvent for BioArt, we tried out various solutions. Fig.8 shows the comparison of autofluorescence between PBS buffer and LB medium. As shown in Figs. 8C and 8D, PBS buffer has lower levels of autofluorescence than LB medium. As far as we tried out, PBS buffer was one of the best solvent of E.coli cells and we adopted PBS buffer as the solvent for the E.coli Pen.
We succeeded to make several ink colors such as Red ink, Orange ink, Yellow ink, and Green ink. Additionally, we succeeded to develop various colors by mixing the Green ink and Red ink.
Fig.9  Yellow is made by mixing Red ink and Green ink.(A)Red ink by RFP expression under UV light, (B) Green ink by GFP expression under UV light, (C) Yellow ink by mixing RFP:GFP=1:2 under UV light.
To make Green ink and Red ink, we used K362001 on pSB6A1, a GFP expression vector,  and J04450 on pSB1C3, RFP expression vector, respectively.
Furthermore, we mixed Green ink and Red ink to make other colors such as Orange ink and Yellow ink. Fig.9C shows one"

Abstract of our project
     In synthetic biology, one of the main issues scientists and engineers must tackle is biochemical pathways optimization.  In fact, it is often difficult to predict in which positions the genes of the pathway must be assembled in order to efficiently  produce the desired molecule.
     In this project, we are going to develop an exceptional natural tool that could be used to optimize bio-production pathways:   the integron. Integrons are genetic platforms which contain (re)movable gene cassettes. These integrons are mostly known to carry  resistances to antibiotics. They are flanked with recombination sites which allow gene shuffling inside the integron thanks to a  specific enzyme: the integrase.
     As a proof of concept, we are going to produce two antibiotics: Microcin C7 and Microcin B17. The first one inhibits a tRNA synthetase,  the second a gyrase. These two antibiotic operons encompass respectively 6 and 7 genes.
     Two bacteria possessing the integron containing the antibiotics production gene cassettes, the integrase and a low resistance to the  opposite antibiotic will be put in competition. With the integrase, we could change the natural order of the genes in order to optimize  production. In parallel, this competition experiment will be modeled.

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Red_-_-_TEXT.html," have formulated a vision and a list of arguments for human ambition in space as part of our Integrated Human Practices and defending them is also the responsibility of the Red Lab.
The Aspect of Sustainability
Sustainability is an important theme to have in mind when doing absolutely anything this day and age. The term changes identity somewhat when it comes to space however, because there we have even worse circumstances for recycling and being smart with our resources.
One must be capable of
growing
things in space, and one
must
be able to remove the tracks of that action. To that end, no less than biodegradable materials secreted from sporulating bacteria will do; so that very little mass can be brought out, cultured to become a lot of mars, and then degraded to become lactate (a possible fertilizer) - thus closing the ""cradle to cradle""-loop. This is the innovative idea of which our project is based, and the Red Lab has taken on the task of mapping out its weaknesses and prepare a system for strengthening them - making it a viable solution."
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," biomarkers is not far off.
All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable
Smoking cessation is the most effective primary prevention for NSCLC [6] , as smoking is responsible for 90% of cases. [7] In the UK, the government has implemented numerous policies to reduce rates of smoking. These include heavily taxing tobacco, banning TV advertising and requiring cigarette packets to have “smoking kills” branding.
Rates of smoking are declining [8] , although they are still sufficiently high for lung cancer to remain as prevalent it is. Primary prevention to secondhand smoke has also been implemented as far as impossible - with smoking banned in enclosed workplaces, public buildings and on public transport. [9] However, no further measures can be taken to avoid exposure by going outside.
The other risk factors for cancer are less well known - as there are a myriad of carcinogens in the world we live in - the food standards agency works to minimize carcinogens in food, drugs and cosmetics, [10] while NICE ensures that medical radiation exposure is minimized.
The screening test should be simple, safe, precise and validated
As we are using a cell free system, our test is safe. Our test would comprise a blood test, followed by miRNA purification and fluorescence measurements which are all relatively simple. These steps do not require the expertise of radiologists that are needed for CT scans. However, for our test to be shown to be precise and validated, further characterisation is required with the miRNA biomarkers and validation with a large data set of patients.
There should be evidence that intervention at a pre-symptomatic stage leads to better outcomes
NSCLC is far easier to treat in its earlier stages. The same is true for almost all cancers, as once a cancer has metastasized it can only be treated palliatively. Early stage tumors can be surgically excised and treated adjuvantly with curative intent.
The test should be acceptable to the target population
From a patient’s perspective, our sensor would just be a blood test. As such there should not be any issues with it. We are using a cell free systems which is sterile and abiotic - there are no bacteria involved which could potentially give rise to objections.
There should be a policy on further diagnostic investigation of those with a positive test result.
There should be agreed policies covering which individuals should be offered interventions and what the the appropriate intervention offered is assurance standards
We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", or the colony thrives. Every year the beehave model checks the population after winter. If the population is below 4000 worker bees the colony is presumed dead and the population is set to zero. To differentiate between the scenarios we looked at the mean population of worker bees after winter averaged over 10 years. Included in this average are the years where the bee population is zero. If the average is below 3000, we assume that the colony dies within a few years and consider this colony death. If the mean population after winter is between 3000 and 5000, the colony survives but its population is reduced due to Varroa mite pressure. Above 5000 worker bees, the colony is thriving and the initial infestation of Varroa mites rapidly dies off. Each parameter combination for sugar water and bee bread falls within one of these three scenarios. For both treatments we chose a parameter set which is representative for a certain scenario. From this we divide parameter sets in three categories: death, survival, and thriving. As can be seen in Table 4, the spring period is more effective for both sugar water and bee bread. Using bee bread is advisable when BeeT has a limited effect on mite mortality. If BeeT has a large impact on mite mortality it is more beneficial to use sugar water. This is because beekeepers are already comfortable applying sugar water to hives which reduces the risk of mistakes.
Table 4: Parameter sets are divided into three categories: colony death, survival, and thriving. If colonies can survive and thrive with higher degradation of BeeT (in-hive and outside the hive) and a lower effect of BeeT on Varroa mite mortality, it indicates a more effective treatment.

In the case of sugar water a far lower fraction of BeeT ends up at larvae, and most is consumed by worker bees. This is likely the main reason for the difference in effectiveness for sugar water and bee bread.
For sugar water, parameter sets were chosen which fall in the categories survival, and thriving. These are further analysed by examining the population dynamics of worker bees and Varroa mites over time. In Figure 20B and Figure "

Funding
The most crucial part of our product development and entrepreneurship journey is funding. We have so far collected around 80,000 euros for the initial RnD and product design. But we would be applying for an initial seed funding round to carry out further activities in research and development and product improvement. We continuously seek to improve the product based on interviews and consultation with people from the industry. We have currently pitched our product idea in front of experts from the Pharma and Bio Industries. We are yet to have investors pitch round which would be done only after the seed funding rounds are over.
Regulatory Approval and Safety Testing
A big part of working with genetically modified organisms is safety and this is why there are several laws and regulations concerning them. If our product is considered to be a GMO, which without the cellulose binding module is not exactly certain since despite the production method, the end product is basically identical to the natural dermcidin, we also have to consider these as part of the launching plan. It is to be noted that since our product would most likely fall under cosmetics, where the regulations are less strict than with the medical or agricultural fields. The time to get the actual product to the market should also be significantly shorter. To confirm these assumptions, we would need significantly more legal expertise and would therefore consult a very specialized lawyer before applying for permission to use our dermcidin-hydrogel as a cosmetic product.
In general, there are international treaties on safety in biotechnology like NIH Guidelines , The Codex Alimentarius , OECD's Recombinant DNA Safety Considerations , also known as the Blue Book, The Cartagena Protocol of Biosafety and WHO's Biosafety Programme . Based on these, there are several EU directives and regulations, which have also been implemented into Finnish national legislation in the form of e.g. The Gene Technology Act (Geenitekniikkalaki 377/1995) and lower level national regulations [2] .
If we have understood correctly and there hasn't been any recent changes, placing on the market of non-food and nonfeed GMO-products is done according to DIRECTIVE 2001/18/EC in Finland. First, the notifier contacts the competent authority in Finland who contacts the European Commission. Then, if the other member states won't object, the application proceeds to the European Committee and can be approved with a qualified majority or move forward to the European Council and Parliament, but the execution decision will be made by the Committee. GTLK (Geenitekniikan lautakunta) is the Finnish national competent authority in issues related"

Modelling the gene regulatory network
The GRN is too complicated to conducted biological experiments. Thus dynamic simulation of the GRN by mathematical modelling is particularly important. Before the wet experiments were conducted, mathematical models were built to predict the behavior of our heat regulating engine. Such bottom-up design of synthetic gene circuit will not only speed up the biology research, but provide us a valuable insight into the system as well. We want to know:
In a particular state which genes were expressed?
What’s the influence of the gene product on cell physiological activities?
To provide a guidance on the design of experiments by further analysis of the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks.
Noise in the cell
The cellular environment is abuzz with noise. A key source of this “intrinsic” noise is the randomness that characterizes the motion of cellular constituents at the molecular level. Cellular noise not only results in random ﬂuctuations (over time) within individual cells, but it is also a source of phenotypic variability among clonal cellular populations. Researchers are just now beginning to understand that the richness of stochastic phenomena in biology depends directly upon the interactions of dynamics and noise and upon the mechanisms through which these interactions occur.
Quorum Control system
The quorum control system was composed of 3 device.
Goals:
We want a better understanding of the process of gene regulation by analyzing the dynamical properties of the gene regulatory networks.
Assumption:
In this project, the simulation was performed in only a single cell.

Manchester,2016,Team:Manchester#Description#mechanism2_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence intensity.  The stable fluorescence intensity recorded in CP3 plasmid could be explained by the slow protein unfolding kinetics of mRFP1, as reported in a previous study [6].  Based on this, we assumed that mRFP1 was not degraded across an incubation period of 24 hours and this should be the similar case in CP1. On the other hand, CP1 showed a more marked increase in promoter activity at ~T10, during the early stationary phase.  However, the fluorescence intensity fell significantly at ~T 15 with no supporting explanations to why mRFP1 was degraded as the expression of mRFP1 should be stable within the 24 hours experimental period.[2] Similar to Fig. 8, there was no observable differences in the curve patterns between KV(u) and KV(i), probably due to the same reason - aTc could have been degraded due to the incubation temperature (37°C) . Results from both of these experiments led us to proceed with our cloning procedures, using CP3 as the main constitutive promoter for our BioBricks : CP3+amilCP (BBa_K2092006) and CP3+alcR (BBa_K2092008) .  Both of these BioBrick constructs form the very fundamental framework of our project, specifically in the Inducible Gene Switch mechanism.  To verify our proof of concept for Inducible Gene Switch , the CP3+amilCP BioBrick (BBa_K2092006) was used as a positive control for our co-transformed plasmids, which included two BioBricks: CP3+alcR (BBa_K2092008) and PalcA(var)+amilCP .
However, for future implications, it is recommended that both of these experiments should be repeated using the same parameters due to several reasons:
Growth is not comparable between all samples (CP1, CP3 and KV) as CP3 had higher growth rate.
No supporting explanation could be provided to why mRFP1 was degraded in CP1 but remained stable in CP3 as mRFP1 has low protein unfolding kinetics in nature.
Chromoprotein Characterization
The aim of chromoprotein characterization is to show that under the control of the same promoter, both of our chosen chromoproteins: amilCP with RBS (BBa_K1033930) and spisPink with RBS (BBa_K1033925) , are clearly visible at the same time point.

This year, Queen’s iGEM Outreach Team directed a three-part interview series to complement our project's focus on novel methods for Arctic oil remediation. These interviews touch on topics of pollution treatment, bioremediation, toxicity of bitumen, and antifreeze proteins, as discussed with experts in chemical engineering, environmental sciences, and molecular biology (Dr. Ramsay, Dr. Hodson, and Dr. Walker respectively). This interview series aims to spark conversations about whether we are taking the right steps towards a future less dependent on oil.
Dr. Juliana Ramsay
Dr. Ramsay is a professor of Chemical Engineering at Queen’s University. Her research projects focus on fermentation and product recovery, pollution treatment, and bioremediation. Thus, QGEM interviewed Dr. Ramsay for her expertise on bioremediation, asking for her thoughts on our project about arctic oil remediation. Dr. Ramsay has contributed to multiple encyclopedias, including the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology.
Background: B.Sc. (Hons), Bacteriology and Immunology, Western University (1979), M.Sc., University of Texas at El Paso (1981),
Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering, McGill University (1987); Supervisors: Dr. Cooper and Dr. Neufeld.
Dr. Peter Hodson
Dr. Hodson is an emeritus professor for the School of Environmental Sciences and the Department of Biology at Queen’s University. Dr. Hodson’s work in environmental studies has impacted industrial regulations. Thus, leading to his status as an invited member of a Royal Society Expert Panel on the behaviour and environmental impacts of crude oil released into aqueous environments.
Background: B.Sc., Physiology, McGill University (1968), M.Sc., Biology, University of New Brunswick  (1970), Ph.D., Zoology, University of Guelph (1974).
Dr. Virginia Walker
Dr. Walker is a professor of the Biology Department at Queen’s University. She is known for both her teaching style and her research, as she has won the Best Lecturer Award (2010) and the Prize for Excellence in Research (2016). Dr. Walker is part of the Towards a Sustainable Fishery for Nunavummuit project,"

The aim of our conferences was to spread awareness of HLB and our solution, plus opening the young minds to the huge possibilities that arise with synthetic biology. Thus, we showed them the basics of transformation, biobricks and how we are applying this information to the real world, with a real issue. The children were surprisingly responsive, understanding the biobricks analogies with Lego, and all of the subjects we talked about.

Public Engagement
Introducing Synthetic Biology to someone can be a tough task, even more in the case of a non-academic public. We’ve accepted to face this challenge at the 21ª Semana Temática de Biologia (21st Biology thematic week)
Biology thematic week is  an annual biology event that takes place at Institute of Biosciences of University of São Paulo. The event’s main goal is complementing the academic formation of Biology students and promote the interaction of students with teachers and the community through courses and workshops.
We’ve been invited to present iGEM and synthetic biology. The initial plan was to make a  simple presentation about our experience in the competition and our project which is simple to do for a biology students public. But the main obstacle was teaching Synthetic Biology in a quick and efficient manner to the general public. For that, we brought two synthetic biology games developed by other teams in the past years: Biotech and Game of genes.
Biomech is a board game that prompts the players to make creative solutions to diverse situations with a synthetic biology approach. Given a specific situation (like creating energy in a desert or sealing a toxic gas leak), the players must use molecular biology concepts to create the best solution. For that, each player receives random cards representing biobrick parts, which will be used to design a plasmid that will be put in a E coli  in order to resolve the problem. The winner is the player that comes with the most creative and convincing solution. This game had been developed by the University of Exeter team by 2016 and the portuguese version was created by the USP-Brazil team at 2017. This game approach combined with a conversation about the mais topics in synthetic biology showed to be a lot more effective than a more expositive lecture approach.
Based on our experience last year , we hoped it would be a fun activity that would be able to communicate the basic about synthetic biology. It was incredible to see how fast a public with no molecular biology background could readily learn about some fundamentals mechanisms in Synthetic Biology.

CFD – Large Intestine (Colon) Model
Overview – Goals
Let's imagine that the classifier plasmids are ready to be used in vivo, thus, in clinical trials.
How can we predict the path, which the genetically engineered bacteria will follow inside the large intestine?
How can we be certain that our bacteria will eventually reach the area around the cancerous tissue?
Will our bacteria attach to the carcinoma or will the Colon Chyme wash them out?
The purpose of our Colon Fluid Dynamics model is to give an answer to those questions and to further explore the unknown and chaotic world of the human large intestine.
The Large Intestine
In our project, the RNAi-based apoptotic circuit is to be eventually distributed via the gastrointestinal system towards the tumor inside the large intestine. Thus, it is essential that we examined carefully the properties of the colon's environment.
The large intestine is the last section of the gastrointestinal tract that is responsible for absorbing water and nutrients and concurrently converting digested food into feces. (Even though the length of the colon is considerably smaller than the small intestine's, the thickness of the walls as well as its diameter are bigger.) The length of the colon approaches the mean value of 1.5m and 6-7cm in diameter in most humans.
The Chyme (intestinal fluid containing the digested food) is transported from the small intestine towards the large intestine via the ileocecal sphincter. Chyme “settles” in the cecum, after its entrance into the large bowel, where it is mixed with bacteria which naturally reside in it constituting the gut's flora and contribute to much of the large intestine's functionality. The chyme is transferred consequently from one haustra to another by slow peristaltic waves. Those waves can be either mass movements,"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS
Watch our VIDEO!
Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Colegio_EmelinaU, San_Andres and Liceo_Eugenio_Hostos iGEM Teams from Santiago, Chile
We were visited by Ana Sifuentes, Manager of iGEM’s Teams for Latin America. Her visit was very enriching because permitted us to meet with other Chilean iGEM Teams (High School) and we could know what facts are important to have a good iGEM experience. She talked about her experience in iGEM like manager and as a past member of a team. Her contribution for our team was clear and effective; it allowed us having a know how for each activity in iGEM Jamboree and Boston. Also, it allowed improving our project image face to institutional sponsors.
Also, the High School teams visited the laboratory installation of CeBiB to work a week in their projects.
UAndes iGEM Team from Bogotá, Colombia
We visited iGEM UAndes Team. It was a valuable opportunity to extend our project toward other countries. In that occasion, we presented them our project, the difficulties we had to face and how we solved them.
Korea_U_Seoul iGEM Team from Seul, Korea
This team invited us to participate in a survey as a part of his human practice. They developed an online software that allows synthetic biologists to design their own biological device or path. They usually based their work in wet laboratory, but this year participated under the ‘Software tract’ being a huge challenge. Team Korea U Seoul believes that open data, open source software, and open access will definitely help researchers in the fields of biological sciences and we think it too.
TecCEM_HS iGEM Team from Monterrey, Mexico
We want to really thank to TECCEM-HS iGEM team for its collaboration in our crowdfunding campaing we made on Jun-Jul. Your donation contribute us to fund our total team costs to achieve the attendance of 9 of 11 team members to iGEM Jamboree at Boston . Thanks!

We have built a proof of concept system, where we could demonstrate that our system is working under real world conditions. We could show that the formation of Ddx4 droplets is possible not only in mammalian cells (HeLa cells1) but also in yeast cells (S. cerevisiae). This finding provides the basis for our experiments to achieve metabolic channeling.
The experiment was then conducted with the following steps: First, Ddx4-YFP was synthesized by IDT with overhangs to the vector. In a next step Ddx4-YFP was cloned into the vector using TAR. This lead to the following final construct in the yeast cells, as depicted in figure 1.
Figure 2: Final construct of Ddx4-YFP in pYES2-CT.
It was then tested, if droplet formation due to the Ddx4-YFP was possible in the yeast cells. For that, fluorescence intensity images and bright field images were taken from yeast cells expressing the Ddx4-YFP and wild type yeast cells (YPH500 strain). The results are shown in figure 2. In the fluorescence intensity image of the yeast cells expressing Ddx4-YFP (induction of protein expression with galactose) bright dots can be seen, indicating the formation of fluorescing droplets. A comparison to the corresponding bright field image shows, that those droplets formed in the cytoplasm of the yeast cells. The wild type yeast cells show a small amount of background fluorescence, but no significant droplet like structures could be seen. It was therefore shown, that droplets do form in the yeast cells in which the Ddx4-YFP gene was inserted via TAR.

We did data analysis in the lab and Identified the species on our data statistics have great help on our data analysis .we can get a conclusion of that Environmental pollution does great harm to the biological diversity.
The data analysis is very important about our Biological diversity statistics. We did Biological acquisition by the help of Prof. liu in Huiquan Bay.
Practice
The investigation of biological products transport
There are several problems in the transportation of biological products at home and in international. The censor procedure takes much time in the international transport for the sake of the safety of the public. However, it is inevitable to bring barriers to the teams taking part in the iGEM competition. Even, some teams did not deliver the PARTS in time due to the transportation protocols. Therefore, we perform a series of research and surveys about the transportation of biological products and then provide solutions.
Part1:
During the delivering of the PARTS this time, we consulted most of the express companies. They all rejected due to the powder form of the biological products. Under the condition that the specimen was innocuousness, we concealed the fact. And fortunately, the officials received the PARTS we submitted.
After the successful submittal of the PARTS, we thoroughly considered the problems of the international transportation of biological products. We had no idea of the related restrictions due to our first time of the delivery of biological products. Hence, we inquired the Qingdao Customs through the phone. By the introduction of the Qingdao Customs, we consulted the Director Wang of Qingdao Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau through the phone, knowing that biological products belong to Special Articles. We should make an application to the inspection and quarantine administrations under the direct control of SIQSAQ, after getting the permission for the inspection of 20 working days, can we deliver the specimen with the approval.
After knowing the basic information, we found the Regulations for Administration of Entry and Exit Health Quarantine on Special Goods on the official website.
http://wsjyjgs.aqsiq.gov.cn/flfg/bmgz/201207/t20120717_225659.htm
Under this circumstance, the longtime of approval as well as the instability of the external environment may damage the PARTS submitted to iGEM officials.  The most important is we may lose the competition due to the delay of the PARTS. We did not know the protocols in other countries, most teams in our country confronted with the same difficulties however. We figured out a solution to the problem.
Solution: IGEM could authorize the biotech"

The MIT team had some interesting suggestions, including integrating Google Calendar or some other online system for scheduling, and providing some chat functionality, since they had labs in two different buildings and communication between the two consisted of calls and texts.  These are ideas that we will try to incorporate into our designs before we begin to program the notebook.

Presentation
We presented over the last two weeks to the rest of the CS, math, and astro students who are doing science center research this summer.  It was interesting to take our work out of the context of synthetic biology and defend it as computer science research; there are lots of things that are very important to the synthetic biology community, but that are counterproductive to traditional computer science research.  It's interesting to think of that as a problem with our research model, and to consider alternatives for the future.

Writing Workshop
Kathy and I went to a science writing workshop this week that I think will help me organize my thoughts on what we've done this summer.  We had to write a page-long description of our work for non-scientists, and it helped me figure out what parts of our work this summer would be important to the public.  I'm glad that there are things that I think will be interesting to the rest of the world.
August 5
End of Summer Wrap-up
This week, I've done lots of work related to the funding I get from Wellesley.  On Thursday, we had a poster session where we presented all of the work we've done this summer, so we had to prepare posters to explain our iGEM work to a broad audience and practice explaining our work to a variety of people, from social science researchers who are afraid that E. coli will kill them in their sleep, to biology professors who already understand all of the background science and want to see how our work could fit in to their own research and teaching needs.  The poster session went very well, and it was great to hear feedback from the people who walked by.  We had a Surface with Gnome Surfer Pro in front of our iGEM posters, so we could actually show people what we were talking about.  Hopefully, the posters we made will be a good jumping-off point for the work we'll do for the iGEM jamboree.

Development of CALM model through integration of ideas from experts in the field
Presentation at Tech Square
Receiving feedback from artificial intelligence experts
Developing connections with machine learning model experts and public health professionals
The AI Day One Challenge is a high school state competition sponsored by Tech Square Atlanta to encourage innovative thinking and to determine the future of technology such as Artificial Intelligence.
High school teams from across the state of Georgia were encouraged to propose a solution to the challenge question: “How do you propose we use artificial intelligence by 2030 to fundamentally alter how we address one of these societal needs: education, health, or sustainability?”
Lambert iGEM’s software committee proposed our machine learning model “CALM” (Cholera Artificial Learning Model). CALM predicts cholera outbreaks a month in advance and informs healthcare organizations and civilians in developing nations to allocate resources in advance to provide a timely solution to an incoming outbreak.
Our CALM team won the overall grand prize, top public vote, and runner-up in best pitch video bringing $2000 in awards.
On May 5th, our CALM team was invited to the AI Day One Summit in Tech Square Atlanta where we presented our idea to a panel of technology experts, who gave us feedback on our model. They introduced us to public health professionals and machine learning model experts. This challenge has allowed Lambert iGEM to connect both the scientific and technology communities in order to make solution for the ongoing cholera outbreaks.
Experts in the fields of epidemiology, finance, and public relations provided highly valuable insight to the CALM team. The specific data flow between the SMS bot and the model itself were clarified during extensive discussion. Additionally, several experts pointed out that locals in many countries may not find answering health and sanitation surveys a practical use of their time, that not all data is necessarily accurate, that the knowledge of the project will require time to spread, and that there needs to be concrete, real-world actors for implementing CALM in health practices.

NEFU_China,2016,Team:NEFU China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"lamide gel mixture (the common role of glycerol in SDS gels is to increase the density of solutions and to facilitate gel casting; it has no obvious effect on protein separation). Introducing a 10% ‘spacer gel’ between 4% stacking and 16% separating gels considerably sharpens the bands for proteins and peptides of 1–5 kDa.
3. Adjust protein concentrations so that a suitable amount of protein can be loaded onto the gel. Concentrate samples, preferentially by techniques that do not increase the salt concentration (such as ultrafiltration). Roughly 0.2–1 μg of protein for each protein band (in 0.7 × 5 mm gel strips) is sufficient for Coomassie staining. Accordingly, the desired protein concentration in the sample is 0.1 mg/ml–1 for each protein band. For silver staining, 100-fold less protein may be sufficient. Depending on the requirements of protein detection and analysis, concentration of the sample may be necessary.The maximal protein load can be limited by large amounts of neutral detergent in the sample and by high concentrations of lipid when solubilizing biological membranes. SDS must always be in large excess over neutral detergents and/or lipids. For isolated mitochondrial membranes (70% protein, 30% lipid), for example, the optimized maximal protein load of sample wells 0.7 × 5 mm is 20 μg. Increasing the applied amount of protein to 40 μg, for example, may cause the individual protein bands to disappear in a diffuse background. Around 0.4% neutral detergent in the sample can be tolerated for direct mixing with SDS-containing sample incubation buffers and application to SDS gels. The incubation buffers and volumes described in Step 4 set a tenfold excess of SDS over the neutral detergent. Setting the SDS/neutral detergent ratio to <10 may result in a surprising result after staining: normally separated, large proteins may be detected in the upper gel areas, but the lower gel areas may be completely clear with no small proteins detectable.
4. Mix samples with SDS-containing sample buffers. The volume and buffer to be used depend on the origins of the samples. For low-density samples such as elution fractions from chromatographic columns, add 5 μl of reducing or nonreducing sample incubation buffer A or B (see REAGENTS) to 15 μl of sample. For high-density samples such as fractions from sucrose density gradients, add 5 μl of sample buffer C or D to 15 μl of sample."

Meeting and Academic Communication
1/Meeting with Peking iGEM Team
As a new born iGEM team,questions below puzzled us for a very long time. However,Peking Univerisity iGEM team helped us a lot by giving us directions willingly.
*How about biosafety issues?
“Biosafety is not a far-reaching issue for us,in fact,”Said Robin Chen,”biological weapons is within reach by means of synthetic biology.The reproducible nature of life will be the most horrible aspect as a weapon.”
*What’s our role in the synbio globalization progress?
It’s really a good idea to ultilize the creativity and passion of youngmen all over the world to explore new ideas.”It is like a high throughput machine, putting many novel ideas into practice without paying a single dollar.”Said Zhang Peiran,a modeller of OUC. It is really a brillant idea,after all.
*What the item synthetic biology actually mean?
“Synthetic biology is based on previous works of molecular biology actually,under the guidance of system biology,quantitatively understand and construct a part,a device,even a system.”Said Zhang Haoqian,who had participated in iGEM as long as four years,now the leader of Institue of Synthetic and System Biology in Peking University,”What it(synbio) matters is that the part or device you made on your project really works.”
2/A Visit to Institute of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Science
*What’s the relationship bewteen microbiology and synthetic biology?
2011 Winter, we visited Institure of Microbiology CAS,which made us more clear on the relationship between Synbio and Microbiology.We realized that microbes are the most wonderful things in the world in terms of Synbio,microbes are a wonderful gene library for deriving bi"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#TShirts_-_-_TEXT.html,", the students took some time out of the lab to visit t-shirt printing companies. The first company which we visited was located in Newcastle city centre, just across Haymarket from the University itself. This company was a backup plan.
The main part of our trip was to an industrial estate across the River Tyne in Team Valley, Gateshead. We looked around various shops for t-shirts and materials, before going to a company called The Print House. They were willing to supply both the t-shirts and the professional printing facilities. The final design has been developed, and sent for printing.

This week we started characterization of pCERI. To proof expression of the regulatory proteins as well as our genes of interest, fermentations were conducted. Overnight cultures were grown with single cell colonies of E.coli BL21 pCERI (due to a limited amount of space in our incubator, fermentation is only performed with E.coli BL21 pCERI, while E.coli Nissle 1917 will be cultivated next week). 300 ml of LB – Amp were inoculated to a starting OD600 of 0.05 and incubated at 37°C and 100 rpm. As positive controls recombinant E.coli BL 21 pSB3C5_J04421 and pSB3C5_J04450 are cultivated under the same conditions. As negative controls wildtyp E.coli BL21 as well as a sterile control containing only LB-Amp without any inoculum, are used. Cultivation was stopped after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours and cultures stored on ice till the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes.
Cell disruption was performed by sonication . An insoluble protein fraction was separated by centrifugation. Protein concentration of each sample was estimated by Nanodrop spectrometry (Tab. 1). Proteins of each sample, normalized to an OD600 of 0.7 were separated by SDS-poly-acrylamid gel electrophoresis. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue(Fig. 1). As the negative control ( E.coli BL 21 (-))showed very poor growth during fermentation, this sample is still missing on the gel and thus the SDS-PAGE should be repeated next week. Furthermore, three SDS-gels of other research groups were conducted simultaneously to ours and resulted in a poor quality. Thus, the SDS-PAGE should be repeated anyways. However, we already see that our CFP positive control ( E.coli BL 21 pSB3C5_J04421 ) seems to show no expression of CFP at all, as no band can be seen at 26.8 kDa as opposed to the strong band of mRFP at 25.4 kDa. This confirms an old user review of BBa_J04421 ) , that this part might not work properly.

Microfluidic chip
We chose the microfluidic chip because it has three significant advantages in the application:
  1.The tiny volume of the microfluidic chip allows the liquid reaction system to be miniaturized and integrated. It can use a small amount of liquid and space to achieve complex biochemical reactions;
  2.Reactions on the microfluidic chip can be quantitative analysis and detection;
  3. Microfluidic chip can be combined with external devices to make biochemical reactions become automated and intelligent.
  Based on the characteristics of microfluidic chip, more and more people use microfluidic chip as the platform of biochemical detection and POCT [1]. For example, there has been a microfluidic platform which can detect C-reactive protein in 2008,and the limit of detection is 2.6 ng/ml.Besides,it can be produced in large quantities[2].Similarly, in the case of hepatotoxicity assessment, a POCT method based on microfluidic systems overcomes the shortcomings of long processing times and high levels of personnel in traditional methods[3].It is worth mentioning that there already have mature POCT equipments based on microfluidic platform in the market.It can be seen that the microfluidic platform not only has irreplaceable performance advantages, but also has marketization potential.
Ⅰ.Design
  An important feature of microfluidic chips is that they are capable of artificially designing liquid lines and reaction chambers. Our project involves three reaction processes: the separation of the aptamer and the complementary strand on the magnetic beads, the separation of the complementary strand from the small molecule, and the biochemical reaction of the small molecule and the engineered bacteria. According to the needs of the project, we designed the two reaction chambers as shown in Figure 1.1, and used the peristaltic pump, the magnet plate and the heating plate as supporting auxiliary equipment.
  As can be seen from Figure 1.2, our chip consists of two chambers: Chamber 1 is oval(long axis length:18mm, short axis length:6mm). In our design, the function of the chamber is to hold our magnetic beads (fixed with magnets) with the aptamer and provide a place for the sample to bind to the aptamer so that the the complementary strands with lysine can get detached . Our intention to design the chamber as an oval is that the elongated structure can reduce the bubble generated by the"

The cell suspension was plated on Cam-plates (inclusive rescue plate) and incubated over night at 37 °C.
additional plating of untransformated XL1-blue on Tet-, Cam-, Amp- and Kan-plates
Result:
After 12 hous of incubation there were some (~20) colonies on the 50µl-plate transformed with Cam-resistence-plasmids. The transformation has been succesful, though cells grow slow.
There were no colonies on the kan-, amp- and cam- plates with the untransformed E.Coli. Hence we can assume that there are no other plasmids with resistences  against kan, amp or cam in our batch of competent cells.
There are cells on the tet-plate. This was expected.

The beads were then collected in 5 ml gravity-flow columns and washed five times with one column volume of PBS each. The His-affinity gel was subsequently washed with PBS, 25 mM Imidazole to remove unspecifically bound proteins. Elution was performed in an second step with PBS, 500 mM Imidazole to elute the His-tagged viral vectors. The genomic titer of the purified viral vectors was detected via q-PCR. In an ELISA, viral vectors were captured employing the monoclonal antibody A20 (kindly provided by PD Dr. J. Kleinschmidt, DKFZ, Heidelberg) that exclusively recognizes assembled AAV capsids. His-Tags present in assembled viral capsids were subsequently detected with an HRP-tagged secondary anti-His-Tag antibody (1:2000 diluted, A7058, Sigma). HRP presence was detected using the peroxidase substrate ABTS. Generation of blue-green color (absorption at 405 nm) was measured in a Tecan Sunrise plate reader. Sample data were blanked with the average of the non-template controls (NTC).
Results and Discussion
Presence of the His-affinity tag in the viral capsid was detected and the ELISA enabled quantification of the purification procedure efficiency. The absorbance measured for the elution fractions of the 1/10 diluted samples sums up to 2.3 for the DMEM- and 0.5 for the Free Style 293-grown cells, assigning the DMEM-grown cells a five times higher production efficiency. Comparison between the cell pellet and the supernatant fractions revealed that 70 - 80% of the viral particles can be found inside the producer cells.
According to these results, producer cells should be grown in complex media for in vitro and cell culture experiments. Use of serum-free produced viral vectors is recommended for mouse or other animal experiments and possible therapeutical applications where even the presence of traces amounts of fetal calf serum should be avoided. Combination with different purification approaches such as gel filtration chromatography using i.e. Superdex 200 columns (GE Healthcare) enables the production of highly purified viral vectors for several different applications.

2. Researcher Dai Junxi is also a special guest of CCIC. Dr. Dai is a leading scientist in the                         field of                         genomics in                         China, obtaining outstanding achievements in the design and synthesis of Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae                         genomes. Dr. Dai                         shared with us his frustrating experience in the research of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes,                         which                         were quite                         similar to those of ours in the past few months when we had to solve various unforeseeable                         problems                         every day. This                         sort of empathy gave us a deeper understanding that genomic design and synthesis is very tough,                         yet                         Dr.                         Dai's role                         model has prodigiously inspired us to continue our exploration.
3. Dr. Dai also comprehensively introduced us to the development of gene synthesis technology,                         showing                         us the great                         process of scientists’ synthesizing from thousands of bp of viral genes to the realization of                         millions                         of bp of                         yeast chromosome, which, to a larger extent, has equipped us with a more systematic grasp of                         the                         gene                         synthesis                         technology, bolstering the layout of our “Bigger Picture”.
4. After the speech of Dr. Dai, we exchanged and discussed with him. He held a very optimistic                         attitude                         towards the                         innovation and application prospects of our project. He also reminded us with his own                         experience of                         that the                         challenge of what we are doing remains enormous. The difficulty of the project might accrue as                         our                         experiments                         proceed. He suggested that we speed up the experiment process and finish the experiment before                         Giant                         Jamboree,                         indeed giving us a sense of urgency but inspiring us to strive for better solutions.
Project execution:
Before we partook in CCiC, we encountered a very serious problem in the experiment. The genome                         assembled in yeast                         was difficult to extract enough concentration of genes needed for sequencing verification due                         to                         the                         low copy                         number                         of the plasmids.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," The BioBricks Foundation provides the material and management support of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (a collaborative registry initiated and managed by MIT, making publicly and freely available access to DNA sequences and characteristics of BioBrick™). A BioBrick™ is a « is a standard for interchangeable parts, developed with a view to building biological systems in living cells ».
The standardization process is in the restriction enzymes used : the only accepted enzymes are EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI. The collaborative form we are about to point out is not present in the choice of these norms, these enzymes have been chosen by the Tom Knight and other laboratories are using different enzymes.. The local and university initiative of the conception of the standard BioBrick™ show that the strategy of development and establishment of BioBrick™ as norms is not a centralized strategy, embodied in international organizations and decided in large meetings of engineers. US researchers have developed a strategy of aleatory proliferation by the use of BioBrick™ and, in that aim, had to make choices with social consequences. Thus, the Registry is based on the model of opensource template, deeply collaborative, it relies on the principle “get some, give some”. Everyone can get, everyone can give and, most of all, the database is enriched by users. We don’t have to forget that this “get some, give some” is only an academic privilege, if we remember the Steve Kurtz case, the safety issues are often used to prohibit access to non scientists.
This collaborative and participative model refers to development models of free and opensource software. Indeed, the main characteristic of information is that it is a “uncompetitive good” : consumption is not making the good disappear or lose its value but, on the contrary, the more the good is consumed, the more value it gets. This model is essential in free software development, contribution of users often permitting to keep the software free and increasing the possibilities of amelioration.
The BioBrick™/Registry initiative relies on the largest use to make its standard established. In order to fulfill this goal, IGEM is a strategic operation. In 2009, 110 teams and about 1200 participants are involved in the competition and are constrained, by the rule of the competition, to respect the BioBrick™ norms : encouraged to use existing BioBrick™, committed to use the four enzymes of restriction to build systems with it and encourage to make most of it available on the Registry.

Sensitivity Analysis:
In Table 1, there are three values that say they are estimated in the calculated column. This is due to the lack of comprehensive material on them, and that these values create realistic behavior of the system. There is a small range in each value where the system remains stable and biologically relevant, so these values were pulled from that range. The behavior of the system throughout the range is consistent with only slight variation on amounts.

Gel to verify 10/10 results and ocimene gBlock
Purpose: To check on the most recent pSB1C3 backbone digests and the ocimene gBlock from IDT.
Protocol:
LTM Ed. 2 Gel and Gel Extraction A 1% agarose gel was run at 130 V for ~45 minutes:
10/11 Gel

10/10 D2
2
10/10 D1
3
10 μL 2-log purple DNA ladder
4
10/10 D3
5
Ocimene gBlock
The bands that showed up in the gel were cut out and gel extractions were performed using the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin kit, eluting with 30 μL buffer.

Notes:
G2 did not dissolve fully in the first step and is probably not a viable product.
Next: NanoDrop for concentrations, then set up appropriate ligations with the ocimene from the gBlock itself and this gel extraction product.
