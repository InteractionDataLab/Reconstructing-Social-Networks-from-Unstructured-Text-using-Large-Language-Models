Qi He
I’m Qi He, a year-11 student in Hun School Of Princeton. school. When I was taking biology in year-10, the knowledge of this subject amazed me. One of the topics that impressed me the most was the fact that gene is passed from generations to generations, which inspired me so much. As a member of the human practice group, my job was to interview as much as organizations which are related to our project. As a designer, I would like to use my art skill to design a symbol to show the spirit of our team.
Skye Chen
I am Skye Chen, a junior. My interest in Biology first started on observing animals and pets. Later on, with a deeper understanding in biology, I found this subject is fascinating on molecular level. In our project, I am the human practice leader and I am also responsible for web design and Logo design. I often check in with group leaders and assign work to my team members to ensure that the human practice projectse are processing smoothly.
Scott Yeheng Zong
I am Scott Yeheng Zong，a junior from Beijing 101 High School. Because of my deep interest in biology, I joined this team, becoming a member of the human practice group. I really enjoyed the process of discovering knowledge and doing social activities which are related to our topic. I participated in sample collections and interviews, which greatly improved my social communication skills.
Xiyue Ding
I am Xiyue Ding, a senior from IB program. My interest in genetics started when I knew that my grandfather received lung cancer. All through the treatment to his death, I learned a lot about current development in curing cancer and noticed great limitations of chemo therapies. I have also realized that gene therapies have huge potentials and hope to study more in this field in the future. In this team, I am mainly in charge of conducting experiments and designing the wiki."
UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," following describes a realistic application of our project:
Using XL-1 Red cells, 1 in 1,000,000 bases is mutated at every cell division.1 We grow a colony of XL-1 Red cells for 30 generations, and are investigating a plasmid region that’s 20 bases large.
Therefore 0.06% of plasmids will have a selectable mutation at the end of the mutagenesis operation
At the end of 30 divisions, 1 cell will have become over half a billion. By implementing Cas9 screening on our globally mutagenized cells, we will transform a mixture of only 300,000 genetically unique circularized plasmids. Each of these plasmids has mutations in the region of interest.
Furthermore, finding the partial derivatives of our expression for M gives us a better idea of how this technique works. The following equations demonstrate the relative importance of each variable.
where M is the potentially-useful-mutant density, p is the mutation rate, d is the number of divisions, and r is the target region size.
Since p is usually on the order of one one-millionth; d is usually on the order of twenty or thirty; and r is usually twenty, we can see the typical contribution of changing each term. For coarse adjustment of the M value, the mutation rate should be altered. For fine adjustment of the M value, the generation number d should be altered. This foresight is useful for synthetic biologists who want to plan their lab work around the results of the mutagenesis operation.
Thus, our concise mathematical model and its derivatives are a guide for how to use the project. They inform the synthetic biologist about the variables that will impact their success with the technique, and they tell the synthetic biologist how to change those variables in order to ensure a better outcome.

Patients interview
Q：Hi, how are you Mrs. Zhou?
A: Good, good. I’m feeling much better now.
Q: If it’s possible, can you briefly explain to us what exactly are you suffering from?
A: Ahh. It’s not a problem. Well, I’ve been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis for several years now.                         And I’ve been constantly taking medicine to treat it. It costs a lot of money. Too                         expensive!
Q: What is this medicine that you are taking now that is this expensive?
A: I don’t really know the exact name, but you can have a look at it. It’s a medicine produced in                         America.
Q: Oh? America? Why aren’t you taking any of the medicine produced locally.
A: That’s a long story to tell. This medicine I’m taking is supposed to be composed of UDCA. From                         what the doctors told me, this medicine is designed to treat diseases like what I have here. But                         it seems like only the America version works on my. The locally produced version of this                         medicine is chemically synthesized so I guess it’s not really a good thing. And I can feel it                         too. Because my stomach often hurts from taking the medicine.
Q: Wait… Are you sure of it? Are you sure that your pain comes from taking the chemically                         synthesized medicine?
A: Well yes. The pain usually starts an hour or half after taking the medicine. And the doctors                         confirmed my theory as well. They say this chemically synthesized version of the medicine would                         usually have gastrointestinal discomfort as a side effect.
Q: Well that’s not good! So have you considered any other choices? Or have the doctors                         recommended anything else?
A: Yes. And that’s actually why I’m telling you how expansive the medicine is. The chemically                         synthesized version of this medicine is not that expensive. Although it cannot be covered by                         medical insurance. It’s definitely affordable. The medicine I’m taking now is indeed very good.                         It doesn’t have any side effects. I guess the only side effects is that it is too expensive. I                         can’t really afford it now. I really want an alternative. But it sees like the only alternative                         is bear bile powder.
Q: What do you know about bear bile powder?
A: I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Precaution Studies_-_-_TEXT.html,", L. 2012. Precaution and solar radiation management. Ethics, Policy & Environment, 15, 158-171. and states: “Appropriate precautionary measures should be taken against threats of catastrophe” with definitions and restrictions to follow. Some of his requirements are very similar to the parts of the Precautionary Principle that we have already defined: e.g. “A precise probability of a threat of harm is not needed to warrant taking precautionary measures so long as the mechanism by which the threat would be realized is well understood and the conditions for the function of the mechanism are accumulating”. The requirement meets the demand imposed by the Meta-Precautionary Principle, which stated that one should not be paralyzed from taking action by lacking scientific evidence. The demand about consistency is also present in one of his requirements.
The Catastrophic Precautionary Principle then compiles fine with the Precautionary Principle we already have defined and it then seems to be a version of the Precautionary Principle. A version because the damage and epistemological conditions, that are parts of the Tripod, are specified. The damage condition is set to be only “catastrophe” and the epistemological condition to be “the mechanism by which the threat would be realized is well understood and the conditions for the function of the mechanism are accumulating”. As a positive effect, the Catastrophic Precautionary Principle is more well-defined and easier to apply but it is also more limited, where the Precautionary Principle normally is thought of as having a broader range than catastrophes - e.g. genetically modified organisms (GMO’s).
The maximin rule comes from a different background than the Precautionary Principle, i.e. political philosophy rather than bioethics. It has then been transformed for a use in bioethics. The maximin rule is an expression for choosing the action that has the smallest chances of resulting in ‘worst case’ scenarios. It is almost always very restricted and one of the most central restrictions is ‘pure uncertainty’ STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. . By pure uncertainty is meant “a total lack of information about the probabilities of the relevant possible scenarios” - then the maximin rule is applied to make sure that one assures the highest minimum of good. The proposal for which conditions has to be satisfied before recommending precaution are STEEL, D. 2014. Philosophy and the precautionary principle, Cambridge University Press. :

There is no possible scenario wherein catastrophe occurs"

Cloning of Cph8
We successfully cloned and sequenced the PCB generator ( K909001 ). Furthermore we achieved to isolate the Cph8 coding region from pJT122 by PCR and removed an illegal PstI-Restrictionsite using Site-directed-mutagenesis ( K909002 ).
Plans
As the next steps we will finish the construction of the Reporter and Sensing Plasmids and will test our constructs under different light conditions. After the characterization of this part we want to integrate the Cph8-system in our Decoder and test it under different light sources.

III. Make plans for the whole term.
25th, Feb
Place: Room 363, Life Science building
Instructor: Mr.Hong, Yinghong Lan
Recordist: Xingwen Chen
Continue brainstorming.
I.Three ideas we have put forward before:
1.Bacterio-SNS (Social Networking Services )
problem1.The signal molecules may exist for too long.
solution：Add a degradation tag to the signal protein for the cell to degrade it quickly.
problem2.How to construct a memory system?
There are several ways but which is the most suitable?     problem3.Does CDK exist in bacteria?
We can't get it until we find a paper about that.
problem4.We should consider what kinds of result we will achieve.
2.Solve graph coloring problem with DNA and visualize the result with E.coli.
problem1.How to construct the complex DNA structure?
We can ask a professor who are studying this.
problem2.Bacteria are much bigger than DNA,thus the visualization may be impossible.
3.E.coli mimic specific stimulation fatigue
problem1.The idea will actually be quite boring if our purpose is only to mimic.
Think of something new which can apply the system.
problem2.The signal molecules may exist for too long and signals may influence each other.
Change the signal and consider some physical signals such as temperature and light.
II.New Ideas
Zhou Shan says:
1.Bacteriaphage therapy
2.Synthetic biology moving into the clinic
3.improve bacteria tolerance：
a)efflux pump
b)heat shock proteins
c)membrane modification
d)general stress respond
These are mostly achieved by scientists.It is wrong to repeat others unless we can come up with something new.
4.Some thoughts about nucleic acid aptamer
a) Aptamer itself can be substrate.
b) Two aptamers cna be combined on a single bead.
III.Professor Liu suggest we could do something on the basis of our work of iGEM 2011.
Luo Siwei, a team member of iGEM2011,says that if we must do as this,the only thing we can do is to make it more specific,which seems a little boring.And he indicates that the work last year is too complicated and lacking in aesthetics.
IV.About aptamer
We have the technology and we can start the SELEX now.But we have to work out a good application of it.
V.Tasks of the next two weeks

BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#HPGold_-_-_TEXT.html," features of sweetness?
Through these two questions our questionary got the information about the market demand. We knew that people might be more acceptable to natural sweeteners, and comparing with aftertaste, coolness and mellowness, sweetness is more important.
Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd
As soon as we completed the initial plan, we visited the Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd, the most outstanding company in the area of producing concentrated fruit juice in China. We regarded the chance of discussing with the the chief engineer Mr. Wang as an honor and he was so friendly and warm-hearted to answer all questions asked by us and introduced the plight and prospect of sweeteners. For instance, saccharin is extremely sweet and low calories, but it has some certain potential risks to human beings, while the international standard of food health was never ignored by anyone. Thus our project has a really great future of the application through the two aspects including market prospect and policies.
COFCO
When several constructions of genes had been finished and tests had been carried out, the COFCO which is the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food supplier in China became our next interviewee. Some of the managers showed up to welcome us and  they are the principal of innovating new product—Mrs. Zhao, the one of vice chairmen of the company—Mr. Huang and the doctor who is responsible for the manipulating of electronic tongue technique—Mr. Liu. We had a long but meaningful chat about the current device used by most of the food producing companies, which made us realize that the generally used machine’s range is so limited that it is hard to measure the sweetness conveniently as well as some devices like electronic tongue technique would only be efficient after the association with the assessment given by workers, which results in the humongous uncertainty. Therefore, an innovative bio-system which relies on Synthetic Biology to observe and select new types of sweeteners will have a non-negligible contribution to the society. Finally, we accepted the advice which came from COFCO and what they suggest is to let us start with some classical and conventional sweeteners like stevia rebaudiana，liquorice and Momordica grosvenori.
COFCO AGAIN

As iGEM teams introduce new chassis, standard safety information can be made a requirement for future iGEM teams wishing to work with these chassis. This information can be provided on the parts registry and be linked from each part design for this chassis.
For example, past iGEM teams have worked with toxic materials in the characterization of heavy metal binding [1]. Currently warnings are listed on the part’s page. An iGEM team would most likely be aware of this when they are working on expression and characterization of the part. By standardizing this information, safety concerns can be communicated and referenced clearly and easily.

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

UChicago,2014,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," funsies :D We did a few other things to start things up like making SOB, CCMB80 competent cell buffer, and antibiotic plates.
Wednesday
MOAR BUFFERS! Qiagen buffers are expensive so we spent the day making bootleg Qiagen miniprep buffers (sorry Qiagen, you had your chance ). Then, we contemplated life for the rest of the day. *take depressing pictures here*
take pictures of buffers*
Thursday
Made competent cells. Stuck hands in liquid nitrogen. Burnt our hands off (no pics because you need hands to use a camera, duh). EVEN MOAR BUFFERS We also went to a biotech company exhibit and grabbed a lot of free samples! (and food of course) We also extracted gDNA from DH5a to PCR out our mutator genes. We also learned not to use the free 1.5mL centrifuge tubes from last year, and to not smell our microcentrifuge anymore. Stock strains MG1655 and delta-tyrR came in from the Yale E Coli Stock Center. Yay! So exciting! Kevin was so excited that he burnt his hair trying to plate them. XD
We made competent cells (MY CRYSTAL BALL SAYS:  THEY WILL FAIL). Kevin BS’d the gDNA and got some somehow but also made the centrifuge stink like chloroform/phenol. Fun XD
This company (name concealed) gave us some cool centrifuge tubes last year that warp when we spin them down. XD So we’re buying new ones. $$$ They’re wrong- money DOES grows on trees! AND we have lots of trees around here! Even better! We ran overnight PCRs, one with more and one with less cycles.
Friday
PCR-ed out 9/12 mutators. The lengths of almost all of them were verified to be correct!!! So much happy!!! Yes!!!! Yay!!!! The PCR with less cycles (bottom half of the gel) worked better so we’ll stick with that in the future. We also digested backbones that have the RBS we will use and ligate to all the mutators. What a good day!
Week 2 6/23 - 6/27
Monday
We tested our competent cells using the transformation efficiency kit. They didn’t work XD But that’s okay, we like making competent cells. It’s strangely exciting to pipette things lots of times :D
Also, we fragment isolated the mutations and then did the restriction digests on the PCR products. The concentrations of the genes are fairly alright"
NCKU_Tainan,2018,Team:NCKU Tainan#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"lyan composed of straw.                                          Finally, through derivation, we can get 0.0348 kg xylose from 1 kg straw.                                          The detail progress of calculation was listed below.
Sample ：20ml, positive control and 0.3g corn straw was added,                                          Abs600 was not certain because we had added straw.
Ferulic acid by GC ： 0.53 mg / L
Ferulic acid in straw：0.3 g * 1.15% = 0.345 mg
Ferulic acid degradation rate：(0.53 * 20*10-3)/0.345 = 10.6%
Xylose in 1kg straw ： 1kg * 30% * 10.6% = 0.0348 kg
With NCKU system, E. coli consumed xylose to uptake CO2.                                          The xylose consumption was 23.864 kg to uptake 1kg of CO2.                                          In conclusion, every 685 kg straw can be used to capture 1 kg CO2.                                          In other words, capturing 1% annual CO2 emission of                                          small and medium enterprise, which is 20 tons CO2 require 16 tons straw.
Straw was a biowaste in agriculture while it wasn't easy to decompose.                                         UESTC-China solved this problem with synthetic biology successfully.                                         Through our collaboration, they can not only produce bioenergy, but have                                         another powerful application in CO2 emission problem. NCKU-Tainan provided them                                         a valuable and also applicable way and helped them design a draft of device.                                          The xylose source from straw was really important to E. coli CO2 utilization system                                          which changed the positive carbon footprint into negative carbon footprint.                                         CO2 emission problems is a big issue in the world. The main solution can be                                         separated into two part, CO2 downstream processing and Alternative Energy. Both                                         NCKU-Tainan and UESTC-China contribute to this serious issue and our                                         collaboration could solve both the energy problem and environment problem.

Restriction Digest&&DNA Ligation The restriction digest technique can be used for cleaving DNA molecules at specific sites, ensuring that all DNA fragments that contain a particular sequence have the same size; furthermore, each fragment that contains the desired sequence has the sequence located at exactly the same position within the fragment. The cleavage method makes use of an important class of DNA-cleaving enzymes isolated primarily from bacteria. These enzymes are called restriction endonucleases or restriction enzymes, and they are able to cleave DNA molecules at the positions at which particular short sequences of bases are present. DNA ligation is the process of joining together two DNA molecule ends (either from the same or different molecules). Specifically, it involves creating aphosphodiester bond bond between the 3' hydroxyl of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate of another. This reaction is usually catalyzed by a DNA ligase enzyme. This enzyme will ligate DNA fragments having blunt or overhanging, complementary, 'sticky' ends. Typically, it is easier to ligate molecules with complementary sticky ends than blunt ends. T4 DNA ligase is the most commonly used DNA ligase for molecular biology techniques and can ligate 'sticky' or blunt ends.
DNA sequencing
DNA sequencing is determining the order of the nucleotide bases in a molecule of DNA. Synthetic biologists make use of DNA sequencing in their work in several ways. First, large-scale genome sequencing efforts continue to provide a wealth of information on naturally occurring organisms. This information provides a rich substrate from which synthetic biologists can construct parts and devices. Second, synthetic biologists use sequencing to verify that they fabricated their engineered system as intended. Third, fast, cheap and reliable sequencing can also facilitate rapid detection and identification of synthetic systems and organisms.
PCR
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a biochemical technology in molecular biology to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence.
Transgenesis
Transgenesis is the process of introducing an exogenous gene – called a transgene – into a living organism so that the organism will exhibit a new property and transmit that property to its offspring. Transgenesis can be facilitated by liposomes, plasmid vectors, viral vectors, pronuclear injection, protoplast fusion, and ballistic DNA injection.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," toxic to produce, any cell which is producing less or no protein will grow faster than a cell which is producing the toxic protein. This means a mutated, non-functional promoter will have a proliferative advantage during transformation. So, as we were sending our BioBricks for registry for submission, we decided to sequence the minipreps of KillerRed and KillerOrange as well with the registry standard pSB1C3 sequencing primer VF2, to check for any mutations. The results are shown below in screenshots of a plasmid editor software called ApE.
Both plasmids had the BioBrick prefix, and the correct sequence for both KillerRed and KillerOrange open reading frame, according to the papers cited on the Exeter 2016 iGEM wiki. The sequence between the prefix and the ATG start codon, we checked against lac-repressible promoters in the iGEM registry. We found a match to R0184, which is a T7 lac-repressible promoter. T7 promoters require T7 polymerase to be transcribed, as they are not recognised by E. coli polymerases. This results confirms the result of the fluorescence measurements. No KillerRed or KillerOrange protein was observed by fluorescence, as neither gene was being transcribed by either DH5α or DH5α.Z1 as neither strain produces the required T7 polymerase. A protein overexpression E. coli strain such as BL21
which has the T7 polymerase gene inserted into its genome is designed to use T7 promoters would have been able to express these KillerRed and KillerOrange constructs.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". Parts from each category of our collection can be chosen to built LVL1 plasmids harboring a single transcription unit. Up to five transcription units can be assembled into a LVL2 plasmid.
An additional layer of flexibility in the construction of LVL2 plasmids is added to our toolbox by our 5’- and 3’- Connectors which flank the transcription units in LVL1 plasmids. These connectors provide the fusion sites for the assembly of LVL2 plasmids. By selecting the correct connectors, the user can define the order as well as the orientation of each transcription unit. The ability to assign an orientation to a transcription unit is supposed to reduce the influence of neighboring unit on each other caused by transcriptional read through and DNA supercoiling. Moreover, our connectors are designed to function as genetic insulators. They consist of 300 bp “neutral DNA” flanked by strong transcriptional terminators to separate each transcription unit in a LVL2 plasmid. We believe that this novel feature is an important step towards building genetic constructs in a rational and predictable manner.
Construction of novel part entry vectors
All LVL0 parts have to be stored in plasmids to allow for amplification and long term storage. To create new LVL0 parts, a
PCR
product or annealed oligos are cloned into a part entry vector. This vector harbours the resistance and ori that are required for selection and propagation. Furthermore, part entry vectors can be designed in a way that they contain a dropout. This dropout can be a transcription unit for a marker that generates a visible output. The first golden-gate-based toolbox MoClo (Weber et al. 2011.) used a LacZ alpha transcription unit which can be used for blue white screening in many E. colii> cloning strains. This concept was also adapted by iGEMs PhytoBrick system.  During the cloning of LVL0 parts, this dropout is replaced by the desired part. When the cloning reaction is transformed into a suitable E. coli strain and the cells are plated on agar plates with supplemented
IPTG
and
X-Gal
. Colonies transformed with the religated entry plasmid appear blue while white colonies most probably contain the correctly assembled plasmid. The LVL0 part entry vector in iGEMs PhytoBrick system  has been designed as described and can be used for blue-white screening.

Then, one of the iGEM team members answered: “Bacteria are little organisms which grow, eat and die like every living being. These bacteria are not always pathogenic and scientists can improve their qualities with the introduction of DNA fragments containing genes.”
So the objective is reached: we aroused the surprise, the questioning and the amazement of people. In this respect, we pointed out the usefulness of SynBio. We decided to focus on medical application of BABS (Bacteria Improved by SynBio) such as insulin, growth hormones, and artemisinin production, and also on the food industry application with food coloring or artificial flavor production that already work.
Of course, we have also presented our project as an innovative solution to kill and disperse biofilm in all pipelines or tanks and to prevent any colonization of bacteria.
Special thanks to our faculty advisor O. Brette for his advice and for his working late to help us and to the UBC team for sharing its poll results with ours.

But don’t give it to them too much, because they would turn off. So, think more about the story, if they want to know more then they will ask you. So give them just enough to say, this is what we do, and this is how it works. Now, you just did a pretty good description of what you do, but I had to fill in the story about the context, because I know about ethanol fuels and I know a lot about alternative fuel technology, but a lot of people don’t. So before you even get into what you’re doing, set the stage. And then talk about why you do it, what are you interested in? People want to know about people. Why are you doing it, why are you interested in it? Angela: We are the only team in Atlantic Canada, so we do try to cater our project towards what’s relevant to the province… Bob: No no, that’s not what I asked. That’s your corporate line, that’s your official university line. What about you personally, why are you interested in it? Angela: Well I guess it’s a team, so it’s not just about my personal interest, but you can say that we do have a zoo around here, it’s called the Shubenacadie Wild Life Park. So we actually visited the zoo and saw a bunch of porcupines, and then they are pretty cute. Bob: Great great, that’s pretty great, that’s perfect. You just humanized it for me. So you’re looking at porcupines, and you realized that they metabolize cellulose. We have a lot of cellulose in Canada, and cellulose can be turned into ethanol. Hey, let’s take a lesson from porcupines, let’s see if we can do this in the lab. Now, you get to your science. Right? You see what I’m getting at? You set the stage. It’s ok to make it personal. It’s ok to include yourself. So how about your partner? Why did you get into it?

Figure 3: Mass spectrum of the gas chromatograph peak at 12.25 min. This spectra suggests that the PetroBrick is selectively producing a C15 alkane, which resembles the results from the Washington 2011 iGEM team.
With the PetroBrick able to successfully produce alkanes, we next wanted to test the PetroBrick on NAs to see if they could be selectively converted into alkanes!  This experiment used commercial NA fractions, which included a large number of different complex NA compounds.
Successful conversion of NAs into hydrocarbons!
Figure 4: The relative intensity of alkane production from NAs as measured with a GC-MS in E. coli with and without the PetroBrick. A concentrated NA standard was included for comparison of peaks.
Figure 5: Mass spectra of alkanes and alkenes produced from NAs with E. coli containing the PetroBrick as in Figure 2. Relative intensity of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) was compared.
Results from Figure 4 and 5 indicate that hydrocarbons were successfully produced from E. coli that contained the PetroBrick construct, as analysed by GC-MS. In Figure 2, E. coli containing the PetroBrick had larger hydrocarbon peaks than the E. coli without the PetroBrick. Not only was the PetroBrick able to degrade NAs into alkanes, the PetroBrick could produce alkenes (Figure 3), indicating that the PetroBrick worked as expected!
Nocardia Carboxylic Acid Reductase (CAR)- Can we do better?
Although we successfully used the PetroBrick to remove carboxyl groups from NAs, we wanted to improve on our results to get a higher yield and/or possibly target other compounds. One of our original concerns in using the PetroBrick to decarboyxlate NAs was that the first enzyme AAR only targeted fatty acids bound to ACP, and non-compatibility with NAs. Therefore, we searched for another enzyme carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) from N. iowensis known to perform a similar task as AAR - converting fatty acids to aldehydes, but with much lower specificity (He et al. 2004). Unlike AAR, CAR does not require covalent attachment to ACP, and likely to have broader substrate specificity.   The use of CAR did require a second gene from N."

With all our discussions and explanations we did not only teach others about DIY biology, but also learned a lot about the principles of openly shared knowledge and the opportunities this generates. We got useful tipps and ""how to's"" about laser cutting, 3D printing, edging and many other standard DIY tools.  Asking the question ""what would you add to the bioreactor?"", the most common answer was: ""microbes"".  However, there was also some feedback on the technical aspects of our reactor system, which influenced our next design process, for example the demand to use bioreactors of different volumes.

First encounter with the Technik Garage

Apart from demonstrating our bioreactor, we had a look at all the amazing projects made by the other makers. It happended that we came across one the very few German Community Labs, the “Technik Garage”. Among other things, they built a pH-value system that automatically corrects the pH of a measured solution by pumping vinegar or diluted drain cleaner into the solution. Such as we do, they use rotation pumps. However, they used to buy pumps from the internet. That is why, they were really interested in our low-cost DIY pump design.
During the discussions about open hardware and open biology, we came to know that one of their projects is perfectly matching our strategy. To be more precise, the Technik Garage  developed a DIY system to extract CO2 from thin air. Together with the next generation electrolysis cells of Sunfire which can convert CO2 to methanol, this would be the perfect method to exploit an alternative sustainable carbon source. Since we had so many overlapping interests, we agreed to meet again. All of this inspired us to have a deeper look into the German Community Lab scene.

I LOVE challenges and iGEM gives me the chance to experience the thrills of trying different ideas in the field of synthetic biology by means of molecular biology and microbiology. The most exciting thing to me , is when results are not what we thought to be, and the team brainstorms to come up with possible explanations and new experimental designs. Being in iGEM team is my first time to complete a project from scratch and it feels awesome. This is the third year my school takes part in iGEM and not long ago our team had our own lab. We have every reason to believe that with experience accumulated, our iGEM team will be better"

Light Emitting Cell
The first concern was what kind of light emitting cell we should choose. It has to meet several requirements:
1) The emission spectrum of the light should have a maximum intensity at approximately 480nm, which is the maximum absorption wavelength of the Luminesensor.
2) The cell must require no excitation to emit light.
3) The cell must be able to emit light at 30oC, which is the functional temperature of our light sensitive repressor.
4) The light needs to be strong enough to be detected by Luminesensor.
After browsing through scientific literature, we chose the bacterial luciferase (lux system), which originated from Vibrio fischeri. It is expected to emit blue-green light with a maximum intensity at 490nm. The light emitting reaction only requires bacteria metabolic substrates like FMNH2, O2 and fatty aldehyde, which means we would not have to add exogenous substrates into the system. Also, it was reported that the best temperature for E. coli transformed with lux genes to emit light is 30oC.
Fortunately, we found an already existing biobrick in the Parts Registry constructed by Cambridge 2010 iGEM team – luxbrick (BBa_K325909) . They have successfully optimized the codon for expression and transformed the lux system into E. coli. In this biobirck, the light emitting related genes are placed under the pBAD promoter, and the cells are able to produce relatively strong blue-green light under the induction"

Communicating our Project
What do you know what happens to your rubbish? Is your rubbish a resource?
Our outreach work has been very important to us. We were really keen to discuss our project with members of the public to hear their thoughts about whether this system could be used in the real world. We were delighted to feature on BBC Radio 4's Inside Science show and to present at the Kensington and Chelsea Council's Celebration of Science event. To grab the attention of the public, we have also founded an art movement, called BioNouveau.
What would you 3D print?
From our research into waste management, it has been suggested that 'local solutions' and small scale schemes could have a great impact on how waste is dealt with in the future. Could people be empowered to use the waste they generate directly as a resource? With this notion in mind we designed the futuristic company M.A.P.L.E. , which sells a range of appliances that turn domestic rubbish into new 3D printed, bioplastic objects.
Although M.A.P.L.E. is (currently) fictional, we really wanted to know whether people"

kmlacI is the transcription rate of MlacI (a measure of promoter strength) and dmlacI is the degradation rate.  At steady state <math>\frac{d[M_{lacI}]}{dt}  = 0 </math> so <math>M_{lacI} =\frac{k_{mlacI}}{d_{mlacI}}</math>

Equations 3 and 4 describe the transcription and translation of the protein of interest Pout.
Equation 3: Transcription of Pout Unlike in the previous case, the output promoter is inducible. In the absence of further information, we model the effect of LacI on transcription/ POPS activity with a Hill function, which represses when amounts are above the threshold K, and activates when PlacI amounts fall below threshold. Such assumption can be revised in the light of contradicting experimental data.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," set it up, Patrick said he would like to be part of it again.
Yassen asked what the term ""synthetic biology"" brings to mind.
Patrick said for most people it sounded like a term from science-fiction, and perhaps a bit scary. He said people would have some fears that are valid and some that are not valid. If people learn more about it, initial anxieties will be replaced by a deeper understanding.
He sees ""synthetic biology"" as an umbrella term for a range of scientific disciplines and techniques. Therefore, it gives rise to a very wide range of questions about the impact it will have on society, the environment, the economy, and people's lives. There is a wide range of potential applications, and the impacts will be both positive and negative.
Allan asked what role biotechnology would play in the future.
Patrick said it seems undeniable that biotechnology, and all the techniques biotechnology implies, will play a profound role in humanity's future. But it's unclear whether the net effect will be positive or negative. There will be both positive and negative aspects. Therefore, first we should minimise the risk of any negative consequences, and then think about the positive things that can be brought about.
He said if these technologies were the tools of very wealthy countries, and used at the expense of poorer developing countries, then this would cause a huge amount of concern. Likewise if they are the tools of powerful and wealth corporations. However, if the technologies can be part of the common good of humanity, and the ownership and control of them can be exercised for the common good of humanity, then there's much greater opportunity and lower risk.
Yassen explained our project, the degradation of cellulose, and the creation of a biorefinery to convert waste to food or fuel.
Patrick said the broad concept was exciting, and could have a role to play in the resource challenges that humanity is facing. He said he was frustrated that some politicians have been talking about these resource issues for many years, and proposing a more sustainable use of resources, but this hasn't been seen as a positive or exciting agenda.
Now we've reached the point where technical challenges have to be overcome. While he'd like to see technical developments taken forward that could make better use of ""waste"", he has a profound wish to see a more sustainable use of resources. For example, talking about waste, we must not create industries that are dependent on an ever-growing waste stream. We must reduce the amount of waste in our society.
He said this has a lot to do with regulation of industry and economics.

To build an optimal biobrick, we came up with 3 different arrangements using the T7 promoter, the osmY tag, the His tag, a single or double terminator, and a GFP reporting system and assembled the parts together using a Gibson Assembly, to then transform in test tubes. The parts chosen were selected on the basis of part literature, taking into account factors such as secretion efficiency and ease of purification.  We used the osmY based on its success in past iGEM projects. The his tag was used because it was recommended to us when we went to the Tokyo Tech meetup, part of our integrated human practices, as we learned that the tag optimizes secretion and makes purification easier. For each of the 3 arrangements, we inserted the genetic sequence for the mutated, unmutated, and CRISPR edited SERPINA1 gene.
Promoter-reporter constructs A through C use a double osmY secretion tag and a double terminator system. D through F use a double osmY secretion tag and a single terminator system. G through I use a His and osmY secretion tag with a single terminator system. To test the efficacy of the CRISPR, we used the unmutated SERPINA1 constructs as our positive control, and the point mutated SERPINA1 E342K constructs as our negative control.

I´m a third year student of pharmaceutics, so most of the time I have to deal with chemistry. iGEM gave me a great opportunity to gain experience on the subject of synthetic biology and, of course, it was a lot of fun.
Leo Scheller
I studied molecular medicine in Freiburg and I just moved to Edinburgh for Systems and Synthetic Biology. I hope to integrate Systems and Synthetic Biology into medical research and iGEM has been a great opportunity for gathering practical skills, for being creative, and for getting to know very cool people. Also I'm happy that we have a very promising project and I look forward to our presentation in Amsterdam.
Dennis Grishin
I study molecular medicine and microelectromechanical systems. With this choice of fields of study my goal is to bring life sciences and engineering together. When I heard about iGEM I realized that for me it would be the perfect opportunity to pursue this objective. I am fascinated by synthetic biology and believe in the great potential of biological engineering approaches. freiGEM 2012 gave me the opportunity to take part in an exciting project and to further develop my lab skills. It was a lot of fun and I have very much enjoyed the work in our team.
Verena Waehle
During the time of my bachelor studies in molecular medicine, I learned a lot about the function of cells as well as of whole organisms. Nevertheless, the field of synthetic biology remained something impalpable for me. When I first heard about iGEM, I was intrigued by the concept, that a group of students should plan and realize a whole project in the context of synthetic biology almost on their own. Considering this a challenge and a great opportunity to broaden my horizon by emerging into a research area that differs profoundly from everything I have done before, I joined in on the team. During the whole iGEM year, I was able to learn a lot about almost any aspect of research life, which is what makes the time with freiGEM such an invaluable experience.  I really enjoy the opportunity to be part of such a fabulous project and of an even more fabulous team!

Figure 1 showed the result of PCR. Hyphothetically, sgRNA would steer the fusion protein to the target EPO (~600bp), specifically to the area close to the 160th bp. When specific integration occurs, target EPO will be split into two fragments of around  280 and 480. PCR reactions were done with primer sets that would amplify these fragments seperately. Lane 2 shows the PCR of the first fragment. A very intense band were indeed present around 230bp, confirming the presence of this integration product. Lane 3 shows the PCR of second fragment. An intense band were also present around 480bp, which also confirmed the presence of the second integration product. On the negative control lanes (without sgRNA or with Tn5), random bands were present, and none of these intense bands shown on lane 2 and 3 were observed here . This confirmed further that targeted integration indeed occur due to our fusion protein that is loaded with sgRNA. The absence of amplification bands on the other negative controls confirmed our result further.
Results of the longer incubation time shows similar result. However, it seems like the specific bands loses intensity with increasing time, suggesting perhaps re-integration events done by excess fusion protein. The higher intensity of unspecific lower bands over time strengthen this analysis further. Figure 2,3 and 4 displays the result of PCR after 4, 8, and overnight incubation time

Surface Display and Targeting
While engineering bacteria as a light-activated drug delivery system is novel and useful by itself, the targeting potential of our light-activated bacterial therapeutic would be greatly improved if the bacteria also could target specific cells. The goal of the second module of our system is to allow bacterial targeting to cancer cells.  We sought to achieve this by displaying an engineered cancer cell binding protein on the surface of our E. coli. We successfully displayed DARPin H10-2-G3, an antibody-mimetic protein rationally evolved to picomolar affinity with HER2, a breast cancer biomarker. We verified that bacteria displaying this protein can selectively bind to breast cancer cells in vitro. This class of protein has not been displayed before on the surface of bacteria. Along the way, we developed a generalized BioBrick surface display system which allows future iGEM teams to display proteins of their choosing on the surface of bacteria.
Objectives
Our goals were twofold:
Achieve the first display of DARPin H10-2-G3 on the surface of E. coli and verify that the system targets cancer cells.
Create a generalized BioBrick surface display platform for other labs and iGEM teams.
Ice Nucleation Protein
We chose to use the Ice Nucleation Protein (Figure 1) as our surface display carrier protein. Ice nucleation protein (INP) is a protein found in Xanthomonas campestris pc. campestris BCRC 12846. Its function is to provide a surface for ice nucleation, which results in the formation of ice crystals. However, recent studies have utilized INP for its surface display properties. In nature, the protein is anchored in the membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, a relatively rare occurrence in prok"

Science can no longer isolate itself in the ivory tower. Especially synthetic biology, that due to its multi properties and high social impact, needs to maintain constant communication with other scientific communities as well as general public. Thus throughout the stages of our iGEM project, we involved related scientific fields, other iGEM teams, as well as junior high school students with the basic biology course. Social interactions in human practice have been a cornerstone of our scientific methods from the very beginning.  Our human practice can be divided into three main parts:
Engagement and education
We held a mini symposium with Prof. Zhihao Li, an expert in cognitive science and brain imaging, to promote interdisciplinary communication to other disciplinary of biomedical sciences not normally exposed to synthetic biology. We also taught the junior high school students from Sichuan Province on synthetic biology and the past and present iGEM projects of our University.

The rate of open complex formation (parameter II) was slower for most variant promoters than for the wild-type promoter, except for the 34G (consensus) and the 33G promoters. Promoters containing altered bases at position —31 were less affected.
-10 Region:
Similar to -35 region of a promoter, -10 region is another conserved region. Generally, it is involved in DNA melting efficiency—the rate of open promoter complex formation.
The distance between the -35 and -10 regions:
For about 92% of promoters had inter-region spacing of 17bp, plus or minis 1bp. The length of it also plays a role in promoter activity and strength.
Application in our project
pTet: tccctatcagtgatagaga ttgaca tccctatcagtgatagagatactgagcac
In our basic circuit, we aim to find out the relationship between plasmid numbers and inhibitor concentration. However, when plasmids lost, inhibitor drops to a threshold, and resulted in the in-promoter is enough to express killer gene. So what if we want to kill the “slacker” by using different thresholds after well-constructing our circuits? Then we come to devote us to mutation in-promoters context.
Alteration or removal of -35 region sequences of the tet promoter can greatly affect in vivo promoter activity，by targeting the cause, we choose to mutate pTet to set promoters with varying strength. Amongst all the base pairs, the natural promoter was coincident with Darwinist survival of the fittest, it’s because of homological regions.
Promoter mutations construction described shows the function of each base, especially those in conserved regions and played roles in gene expression. On the other hand, promoters like pTac have been widely discussed, pTac and pTet DNA sequences are bending to RNA polymerase with same sigma factor. For our goal of mutating pTet, we decide to mutate it site-directed firstly refers to the results of pTac mutations.
Secondly, we will create new regions to attempt at changing the strength, adjacent to -35 region and -10 region, or altering the spacing length.
However, these two steps are based on our rational design, in fact, we also need to use error-prone pcr to explore if there is somewhere new could affect the gene expression.

KIT-Kyoto,2010,Team:KIT-Kyoto#Project#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," do not want to buy GM foods or want to avoid buying medicines made by recombinant DNA. Moreover, they totally have a negative image on gene manipulation techniques.
Discussion
It seems that lots of Japanese people have a vague sense of repulsion against gene recombination. On the other hand, a certain proportion of people answered that we should continue to research about gene manipulation, and they think that we can apply the gene manipulation techniques to global food problem or the medical progress. This result indicates that a certain amount of people have knowledge about gene manipulation techniques. But, lots of people have bad impression against it because of the effects of mass media. As a result, Japanese people have mixture of contradictory feelings between acceptance and repulsion against gene manipulation techniques. It is likely that such a situation was caused by the vagueness about gene manipulation techniques.
Help to other new Japanese teams in the future
We decided to make not only English Lab notes but also more detailed Lab notes in Japanese, and to show them in wiki this time. The reason why we present the Lab notes in Japanese in slightly more detail is because we think that the Lab notes must be precise. In fact, it is very well established that Lab notes must be accurate, and must bear a high degree of detail so that it can enable the reproduction of an experiment. This is a very important requirement for Lab notes. However, previous iGEM teams, particularly non-English teams, show lack of important entries or errors in the expressions of Lab notes. It is a fact that even in our group there are few members complying with these pre-established rules. So, we judged convenient to write the Lab note in our native language “Japanese” in pursuit of the accomplishment of the rules and comply with the highest accuracy possible. Moreover, we have uploaded not only the English protocol but also the Japanese one, e.g., our mother tongue version. This is the common protocol with some improvements after we translated it into Japanese. Publishing the Japanese protocol in will be of help to other new Japanese teams in the future. We believe that these notes and protcol will be not only of help to Japanese teams participating in future iGEM's but will constitute standards leading to exact reproducibility of the experiments.

Will the scientific community ever be able to reveal the principles of life completely, or will there always be things we cannot understand? Supposedly time will tell. Or not, depends on what you believe. Although research has given us indication that life is purely physical and can be explained materialistically, until it is actually explained as such the chance is there that mankind will never figure out life.
Researchers and the public
General interest in the reasons for people to work in synthetic biology leads to the first of the following question. Insight in the goals of synthetic biology can help in defining the fields were possibly more regulation is needed. One of the problems in science in general is the way to communicate research to the public. It gets even more difficult when controversial subjects raise ethical issues that might be hard to understand without any scientific background knowledge. Should the scientific community inform the public about every detail, or is the material to complex to communicate? Should ethical questions be dealt with together, or should the scientific community self-regulate and decide on dilemmas without informing the public?

For this question multiple answers could be chosen, which means that when summing up the scores for the individual answers it will exceed the 100%. The pie-graph shows the recalculated scores that sum up to 100%.
The most popular reasons to work in synthetic biology that has been voted for by a majority of the group is both gaining and sharing knowledge of fundamental processes in biology (52%) and the social objectives, using synthetic biology for applications in medicine and the bio-fuel industry (53%). Sharing knowledge is one of the main goals of iGEM, including the extension of the openly accessible PartsRegistry. One of the issues that arise from sharing all this information concern safety (is there a chance that the information falls into wrong hands?) and legal issues (patenting rights, who owns what and who is responsible when something goes wrong?). Although great for fundamental research, there are some drawbacks to sharing knowledge openly. Social objectives were expected"

Competitor Analysis Criteria
Affordability
How cheap is the technology? How much does shipping cost?
User-friendly
How easy is the technology to use?
Completeness
Is it an all-in-one solution?
Convenience
Does the company ship internationally? Is it pre-manufactured or does it require assembly?
Brand strength
How easy is the product to find? How much does it push the market forwards? How reliable is the reputation?
Marketing Plan
When evaluating stakeholder outreach and product promotion routes, we identified two different groups - existing market groups and new markets - and separate strategies for each.
Existing market groups
Schools: science education networks (STEM and PsiComm), educational funding bodies (BBSRC)
University Students: university representatives, advertise via iGEM teams, word of mouth
DIYbio: existing DIYbio spaces, mailing lists, Makerfaires, social media
iGEM HS: directly via iGEM HQ, including discount or promotion for registered iGEM teams
Field Researchers: targeted via specific case studies, academic journal advertising
New markets: mainstream citizen scientists
Initially, we aim to target technophilic people, e.g. parents who want to do science with their children.
Kickstarter
Media, e.g. Wired
Sponsored citizen science projects
TV advertisement (e.g. during BBC Horizon, New Cosmos, etc.)
Distribution
Darwin Toolbox would be sold directly via the company’s online platform, and could also be distributed to online merchants (Amazon, Ebay, etc.)

uOttawa,2014,Team:uOttawa#policy_-_-_TEXT.html," school outreach in some way. Thus, in order to stand out from other teams, it was suggested that Policy projects should be linked to the application of the wet lab project. This would help iGEM teams have a more integrated and collaborative team effort since the wet lab and Policy projects would be tightly linked.
Another major area of discussion involved the development of an undergraduate-level, ""Introduction to Synthetic Biology"" or even iGEM-specific course. The course would potentially teach students the basics of synthetic biology and related lab techniques, as well as crucial aspects of the iGEM competition and how to give an effective presentation. The overarching idea is that it would be a preparatory course for students wishing to pursue careers in synthetic biology, thus opening up a career pathway which does not exist as of yet.
The course would also address two very common problems that iGEM teams face: spending valuable months training new students and lacking developed ideas at the beginning of summer. If the course were implemented, the iGEM teams would potentially have students who know all the basic lab techniques they need to hit the ground running. Also, if these students were to begin working on a project throughout the duration of the course or simply have had the opportunity to develop ideas, they would have a project that they could begin working on immediately once the iGEM season starts.
Furthermore, one of the most promising ideas raised at the conference was to link iGEM teams with industry. After all, iGEM teams are trying to solve real-world problems using synthetic biology and industries have the knowledge of what problems exist and need to be solved. It was discussed that Dennis, the coordinator of oGEM, will work on establishing contacts with industries and will subsequently match these industries with iGEM teams at a conference that would take take place in January of 2015. This conference would allow both industries and iGEM teams to communicate what it is that they can provide in this partnership. This would give the iGEM teams several months to develop their ideas and would allow Policy teams to brainstorm ideas for projects related to the wet lab, since the wet lab project would be already known by the beginning of summer.
In addition to serving as a liaison between industry and individual iGEM teams, Dennis will also be able to provide assistance to iGEM teams by connecting them to services they might require such as an up-to-date database of bacterial strains that can be viewed by all iGEM teams. In an effort to establish and maintain a strategic and long-term industry partnership, each team will assign an oGEM Delegate who will be the contact point for Dennis to"

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," stronger adhesive on mycelium, and provides evidence that by adding the chitin binding domain to csgA we were able to successfully make the protein a mycelium-specific glue. CBD4x, while still performing better on cardboard, did not decrease in efficiency as much as Elmer’s glue or fp151 which shows, albeit less dramatically, that chitin binding domains can be functionalized as mycelium specific bioadhesives.
Once we identified csgA-CBD as our best mycelium specific bioadhesive, we collaborated with the DTU-Denmark iGEM Team to test our glue on their mycelium grown from a different fungus. The DTU-Denmark Team’s mycelium was grown from the fungus Aspergillus oryzae while ours was grown from Ganoderma lucidum. When we performed a lap shear test using our csgA-CBD glue on DTU’s mycelium samples that were shipped to us in the mail, the maximum adhesive strength reached was 6.7 kPa. While this was still significant adhesion, it was lower than the 28.2 kPa reached with Ganoderma lucidum. The difference in adhesive strength, however, provided useful information about the variability in surface composition of mycelium grown from different species of fungus.
Conclusion
In total, from the lap shear testing data it can be concluded that the fusion proteins that were designed for this project, CBD4x and csgA-CBD, successfully act as biological adhesives for mycelium materials. By outperforming fp151, which has been reported to be an extremely strong bioadhesive[9], and almost reaching the adhesive strength of Elmer’s glue both csgA-CBD and CBD4x show promise in future use as structural binders of mycotecture in Mars or other extraplanetary colonization efforts. As Elmer’s glue requires raw materials like natural gas and petroleum that are plentiful on Earth but are often rare to non-existent on other planets, the slight adhesive advantage it shows in comparison is greatly outweighed by the mass producibility of our bacterially synthesized bioadhesives[13]. In further research, the characterization of alternate csgA-CBD fusion proteins implementing different spatial conformations and/or multiples of csgA of CBD polypeptides could yield even better mycelium-specific bioadhesives. The inclusion of a third type of polypeptide in the fusion protein could theoretically create multipurpose mycelium-specific glue proteins, able to bind mycelium together while also performing some"

Nikolas Rakebrandt
Hallo, mein Name ist Nikolas Rakebrandt und ich studiere momentan im zweiten Semester des MSc “Microbiology and Biochemistry” in Göttingen. Vor meiner Karriere als Wissenschaftler habe ich einen kleinen Umweg gemacht und mir dabei einen BSc in Wirtschaftswissenschaften abgeholt. Danach habe ich im Biologie Bachelor an der Uni Göttingen studiert und meine Abschlussarbeit über Effektor-Proteine von pflanzenpathogenen Pilzen geschrieben. Ich freue mich sehr auf iGEM, weil wir unser eigenes Projekt erarbeitet haben an dem wir selbstständig planen und arbeiten können. Diese Erfahrung wird mit Sicherheit sehr herausfordernd sein aber auch viel Spaß machen – und natürlich werden wir eine ganze Menge dabei lernen!
Wenn ich keine PCRs ansetzte, kloniere oder lernen muss kann ich mich sehr für Sport, wie z.B. Football, Surfen oder Basketball, begeistern. Und natürlich reise ich gerne, wenn die nötige Zeit und vor allem Geld zur Verfügung steht.

Why are landmines still a problem?
Since the end of the Cold War and the implementation of the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, the use of land mines has sharply declined. Also, the production (in almost every country) and trade in land mines has come to a standstill. However, land mines still pose a large humanitarian problem. There are two main reasons for this. First, In some conflicts, land mines are still used in several conflicts. Secondly and eEvven more importantly, large areas of former war zones are contaminated with unexploded land mines, which continue to cause (civilian) casualties on a daily basis [7].
Ongoing use and production of landmines
Due to the Ottawa Convention, most countries have stopped the production and use of landmines. However, there are still eleven countries who continue to produce mines or reserve the right to do so. These countries are: China, Cuba, India, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, South Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, and Vietnam. Of those, four were actively manufacturing antipersonnel mines in 2012: India, Myanmar, Pakistan, and South Korea. The United States have recently (27 June 2014) declared a change of Mine Ban stance, announcing that they are planning to join the Mine Ban Treaty in the future and that they will not produce antipersonnel mines[7].
New antipersonnel landmines have been laid in recent years in Yemen (a State Party of the Mine Ban Treaty), apparently by government forces. There are also allegations that State Parties South Sudan, Sudan and Turkey have used antipersonnel mines. From the countries who have not signed the treaty, the governments of Syria and Myanmar have made use of landmines in 2012 and 2013. Mines are also placed by non-state armed groups (rebel armies, terrorists) in Afghanistan, Colombia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, and Yemen. In this case, the used devices are usually not “real” landmines, but victim-activated improvised explosive devices [8].
Old landmines and explosive remnants of war
Mines emplaced during a conflict can still kill or injure civilians decades later. Next to that, after a conflict, areas remain contaminated with explosive remnants of war (ERW). These are explosive weapons that somehow failed to detonate and are left behind. They pose dangers similar to landmines. These weapons continue to cause"

(*)In Japan, classification of arts and science is important. Most Japanese students study different subjects since high school due to the classification, because it is a big factor to decide the subjects required in the entrance examination for universities or colleges. This is the reason we predicted that there might be some differences between arts and science.

Ontario iGEM (oGEM)
Seven iGEM teams from Ontario (uOttawa, McMaster , Toronto , Queen's , Western, Guelph , and Waterloo ) continued an initiative to create a larger Canadian presence in synthetic biology and iGEM. This initiative, Ontario iGEM (or oGEM), helps each team to solidify their projects throughout the summer. oGEM also has crucial connections with all of its affiliated universities, industry, and the Ontario Genomics Institute, which helps with finding resources to fund each team. Through oGEM we were able to give and receive assistance with regards to the design of our sgRNA networks from other senior teams. Furthermore, we collaborated with the University of Toronto by participating in their synthetic biology podcast.
Canadian iGEM Newsletter
We collaborated along iGEM teams across Canada in an initiative led by iGEM Calgary to create a Canadian iGEM Newsletter. This newsletter allows various iGEM teams to stay connected with what their fellow teams in Canada are up to, fostering a national synbio community while increasing public awareness.

It can be explained from the following points:
Concentration:
Bacteria can tolerate the increase of CO2 concentration.                                                      However, there is limit in the input, and our team is targeting this system.
A shunt is designed to slow down the rate of input to enter the bacteria rapidly.
Temperature:
In this system, 42 degrees Celsius is our limit,                                                      and we need to overcome by technology in the high temperature.
The problem is that our team will lower the temperature through other devices.
Waste:
Our team solves the problem of waste by recycling and filtering out.
CSC ：From the perspective of the company,                                                  how much additional benefit can it bring to the output value of the products in their downstream of system?
At present, the product of downstream in our system is glutamine, and the reason                                                 why we choose is because glutamine is accessible and easy to operate for us.                                                  Its additional benefit refers to the different application.                                                  Take the market value of glutamine as an example, the additional benefit can reach 10 times larger of the E. coli culture cost, ignoring the fixed cost of the whole system.
Besides, E. coli was regarded as high potential species to produce all kinds of protein.                                                  Including essential amino acid that cannot be synthesized by organism, or forage for stock farmer.                                                  Therefore, our system has high potential output value to bring great additional benefit.
CSC：China Steel is one of the largest carbon consumer in our country. In your presentation, you mentioned that two-thirds of Taiwan's area was required to balance one-tenth of the current emissions.                                                  In practice, it is still too far away.                                                  Is it possible to match the materials with 3D layout?
We want to save the space and culture in high density concentration:
Reduce the volume of culture material
Stacking the bioreactors
CSC： How to deal with the waste of this system? Is there a problem with super Cryptococcus neoformans?
The protein needs to be separated before produced.                                                  At the same time, this process will produce the bio-waste.                                                  The special process is high temperature and high pressure.                                                  It can be used in the factory's original waste system under the high temperature and high pressure environment.
We use the general strains, and there is no possibility of mutations.                                                  In addition, with the monitoring of environmental, the probability of mutation is greatly reduced to reach biosafety.

Abstract
In order for synthetic biologists to be able to use automation technologies, we need a well-characterized library of basic biological components that can then be used to design more complex systems. MoClo is a one-pot digestion-ligation assembly technique developed by (Weber et al., 2011) , which enables faster and more efficient construction of genetic circuits compared to BioBricks, the current iGEM standard. With our project, we are proposing that iGEM teams replace the inefficient BioBricks cloning method with MoClo. We have expanded our library of basic MoClo DNA Parts and characterized devices using various promoter-5' Untranslated Region combinations via flow cytometry. We also are designing and implementing a standardized data sheet using Java and JavaScript in order to easily share our library and data with the community. Our MoClo library, characterization data, and data sheet tool fill an essential role in the implementation of automated synthetic biology protocols.
Project Overview
Synthetic biology exists more as a form of art than a reproducible, well-defined production chain. From laboratory to laboratory, the experiments vary in procedure, characterization, and yield. The main product of synthetic biology — engineered organisms, are available only to the highly-experienced researcher and are not without the costs of timely preparation and low product yield. Consequently, the lack of standardization across the field has impeded the product from ever reaching a wide industry audience. More recent engineering efforts in the assembly of gene circuits has provided a pathway to a modular view of genetic parts. Termed the Modular Cloning Assembly Method (MoClo), this novel single-pot reaction protocol is a time-efficient, two-enzyme system for DNA assembly (Weber et al., 2011) . Before MoClo can reach its full potential across research and industry interests, the synthetic biology community needs a standardized and well-characterized library of MoClo parts for Escherichia coli to enable protocol automation and"

A project with the essence of ours would not be possible without the validation and feedback of expert researchers, beekeepers, and governmental organizations. The problem against which we are fighting has a global presence and for us, it was indispensable to listen also affected persons of outside our country. Making us stronger in the entrepreneurship part was also essential; the selling of a product of this nature implicates different marketing strategies and taking courses about this was crucial for the development of the business model.
We believe that for synthetic biology projects to catch the attention of the community and be considered, it is necessary for people to get informed, get involved and participate. We made different Public Engagement activities for pursuing this objective, covering from our principal concern, beekeepers, up to students from middle school till college. As mentioned before our local community is just a tiny part of the society so we got involved in national and international events.
The the project evolved got better and fitted in thanks to all the different events mentioned in this timeline. We present here a general overview of what we did in each event; when entering each section at the end of the page we detail how each experience molded our project.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM, I am also actively involved in the community with numerous volunteer activities. In my spare time, I love reading, camping, biking, travelling, and most importantly, shopping! I’m looking forward to working with the team and learning about synthetic biology!
Sung Yong (Kevin) Shin
I am majoring in Biomechanics of Kinesiology. As part of the wetlab section of the team, I am responsible for carrying out biological lab procedures and communicating with both the wetlab and computer modeling groups. I joined because I am interested in the concept of engineering bacteria as well as application of physics and biology. I have always liked playing with legos, which is quite similar to synthetic biology, with some background biology and nerdiness. I am interested in putting parts together in order to make one big system work, such as legos and electrical circuits. Outside of iGEM, my hobbies include hiking, fiddling with electronics, and playing sports. I am quite excited to be working with the iGEM team as it will be my first real opportunity to do research in the biology field.
Katie Ovens
I have just completed my first year of Health Sciences in the Bioinformatics stream. I became interested in iGEM because I saw it as a chance to learn about the emerging field of synthetic biology. Being part of a team environment was also desirable due to this project being my first research experience at the university level. I am interested in working on the implementation of technology in science, and developing my own skills as my educational career progresses. I am working with the Second Life team to construct educational tools to further promote science by using technology. The goal will be to provide a high quality service to a large audience that has the potential to be more personal and effective than traditional teaching methods. It will give me the chance to apply my current computer programming skills as well as learn from the other team members and experience the difference between computational problem solving and traditional laboratory investigation.

Purdue,2012,Team:Purdue#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," what went wrong with our procedures. Tarun's transformation procedure can be found on the here . We performed these test transformations with BBa_I13602 (CFP).
Upon closer inspection of the AIDA-1 biobrick (BBa_K257018), we have found the following problems
the sequencing is bad
there are large gaps from the sequencing as compared to what was documented. Specifically, the sequenced biobrick was missing approximately 500bp
the sequence was supposed to be 1326bp long. We have decided that it would cost too much to have the biobrick sequenced ourselves
the gel is bad
For the above reasons, we have decided to not use AIDA-1. After reevaluating the other adhesion options, we have decided to use Curli (BBa_342003). Due to its inconsistant sequencing, we have decided to have the part found in the kit sequenced ourselves.

This year, we decided early on to try and reach out to other iGEM teams who we might be able to help, or could help us. Of particular interest to us was a BioBrick and iGEM-internal system for non-canonical amino acid incorporation, because even until now our pEVOL AzoPhe incorporation plasmid remains something of a black box to us.
We ended up reaching out to and collaborating with Bielefeld-CiBiTec, whose project focused on the development of new non-canonical base pairs to try and expand the genetic code. While we were not ultimately able to test out their new system, we did provide them with some of our ncAA (AzoPhe) and the incorporation plasmid so that they could test it against their own system for ncAA incorporation. We also sent them a number of plasmids from our own project, which they graciously validated in their own lab as working as intended, and also provided us with some beautiful imaging data you can see below.

Project Abstract
Project Overview
Introduction : To know more about the basis of synthetic biology and bacterial reporters.
Genetic Frame : The core of our project and our main proposal.
Parts : BioBricks we developed during the project.
Future Research : Our considerations on what will be the next steps to follow and the applications that our project holds for the future.
Bacterial reporters or whole-cell bacterial sensors have always been an area of application for genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago, although these early tests didn't use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the area of genetic engineering has resulted in newer and more sophisticated bacterial sensors, capable of detecting the presence of contaminants, sugars and amino acids in different media such as soil and water. However, most bacterial sensors can only detect the presence of a compound at a certain concentration and currently there are few documented bacterial sensors that can detect and report different concentrations of the compound of interest. Our objective was to develop a genetic frame, compatible with the BioBrick standard, for the creation of a concentration-sensitive bacterial sensor. In the process we also developed and characterized BioBricks for two new families of phage activators.
Development of a genetic frame for the creation of concentration-sensitive bacterial sensors
Bacterial reporters or whole-cell bacterial sensors have always been an area of application for genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. As a matter of fact, constructing a bioreporter bacteria that has the ability to detect toxic chemicals is considered one of the first accomplishments in the discipline of synthetic biology (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) . There are several advantages to using a bacterial bioreporter instead of a traditional physical or chemical sensor, for example, bacteria can offer the same specificity and sensitivity that traditional sensors offer, but they are much more portable"

what Bernardo et al have done before: predicted open reading frames with geneious (see mRNA fasta file), translated into amino acids, fed the sequences into Blast to get their names (see XML excel file)
from looking at the ORF predictions: there are too many reading ORFs of which half are 100 aa long, so Gos suggested setting 300 aa as the min length for a gene. It seems like all the ORFs start in frame 1.
still according to the mRNA file, there also seems to be, for the same frame and the same ORF: how is ths possible? Seems strange...

Ran a PCR with all of our chromoprotein genes and the plasmid backbone. The PCR products were separated on a gel. After screening, the N7 localisation sequence, attached to some of the chromoprotein constructs, was not successfully amplified. The PCR with this fragment was then repeated (Guy). In addition, I prepared a large batch of electrocompetent Agrobacteria, hopefully to suffice for the rest of the project (if it worked). The GFPLti and RFPLti AgroB transformant O/N cultures were discarded as they would likely become non-viable until Monday. This step will be repeated on Monday.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," it also has a section to store umbilical cord blood.
Motivation 
During our last time’s meet-up with NCTU, we told them our plan to consult FDA about Lactobacillus manufacturing. Professor Chen, the leading professor of NCTU IGEM team, said that FDA is an institute offering expertise related to regulations and examination processes. He suggested that we may get what we need from FIRDI (Food Industry Research and Development Institute). After doing some researches and preparations, we successfully reached Dr. Chu in FIRDI. 
Highlight :
The above are some advice he gave us:
You would do well to use E. coli without a plasmid.
Make sure whether E. coli is able to survive in the intestine.
Remain balanced nutrients when growing lactobacillus instead of just adding sugar. 
Conclusion 
After Doctor Zhu’s detailed introduction, we found that it seems too late for us to know what FIRDI is. We solved the difficulties we faced in our experiment in the end, but if we had discussed with Doctor Zhu earlier, the progress of our experiment might have been faster and more efficient. Thanks to this interview, we realized our insufficient, knowing we still have a lot to improve as well. Here, we appreciate all the instructions Doctor Zhu gave us and professor Chen for recommending us visit FIRDI.    
FDA - Record
Records 
We: We want to know the current situation of the obesity problem in Taiwan.
FDA: I suppose the question could be more probably answered by the Health Promotion Administration. The point is that the public shall be more aware of the negative effects of consuming too much sugar. Therefore, we have started to take notice of the amount of refined sugar consist in health supplements six years ago. In order to avoid people who aim to have a healthy life from consuming too much sugar, we have required more than 30 manufacturers to reduce the amount of sugar added to their products. 
We: So, what’s the point of regulating calorie from refined to 10% of daily sugar intake?
FDA: The institution is based on the reference from WHO. For we normally eat many other kinds of food every day, we regulate that refined sugar added in items that can be called “heath food” should not exceed 50 grams, which is half of daily sugar intake for adults. Also, if a product contains over 1/3 of the limited amount mentioned, it should be labeled. 
We: What examination do we need to go through if we are to commercialize our product?

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Collagen_-_-_TEXT.html," relavant enzyme is not even necessary; as is shown in the PQQ aptamer purification project, it might soon be enough to purchase a cofactor supplement at a local drug store and add copper sulfate. To explore this, another set of constructs was created with this cross-linking domain at the N-terminus. These are the relevant bricks: BBa_K2027003 , BBa_K2027004 , BBa_K2027005 , and BBa_K2027006 . These constructs need to be studied to evaluate the effect of the addition on trimerization and the potential for cross-linking. Even if cross-linking is successful, these would still be the short, blunt fibers shown in Figure 2, but governance of their assembly by formation of a heterotrimer opens the door to sticky end use.
Parts BBa_K2027002 and BBa_K2027045 are the conjugations of the three heterotrimer parts (with and without cross-linking domains, respectively). Part BBa_K2027002 is represented in both detailed and simplified schematics in Figure 3. Due to the directionality and specificity of trimer formation, the preferred assembly has sticky ends leaving the possibility of substantially longer fibers such as that shown in simplified form in Figure 4.
Figure 2: A symbolic representation of the short blunt-ended assemblies referenced, with the bacterial collagen portion much shorter than scale.
Figure 3: Simple head-to-tail assembly of the three components allows for specific assembly of sticky-ended triple helices, which is easier to visualize with the much-reduced representation shown at the bottom.
Figure 4: Staggered assembly of the full construct allows for the formation of potentially infinitely long fibers.
Results
We took the collagen constructs (mentioned in the previous section) and transformed them into E. coli. We picked successfully transformed colonies and ran colony polymerase chain reaction (CPCR) using the primers VF2 and VR. We ran these PCR products on agarose gels to examine whether the plasmids contained appropriately sized DNA. After successfully sequencing them to confirm that they indeed had the correct domain constructs, we wanted to induce the cells to produce the collagen proteins in order to characterize them. In addition, we wanted to also produce constructs without the elastin cross-linking domain. We removed this domain through Sap1 digestion of the DNA constructs and further transformed them into cells. We once again confirmed the success of the transformation with the digested constructs through gel electrophoresis and sequence verification. Although our sequence verifications were impressively similar to our desired constructs, it actually took "
UNAM-CU,2015,Team:UNAM-CU#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," values of this function are contained in the range [0, ym] which makes sense as both are logical limits to the insulin in the organism. The relation between the quantity of glucose present in the body and the insulin that is produced by the sensing system should be dependent on the glucose levels at a certain time.
We have two principal scenarios, when there’s no glucose, we can see that the expression x xM gets a zero value, resulting in no production of insulin, on the other hand, if x equals its maximum value xM, the same fraction would result in a value of 1 resulting in a production rate of aM multiplied by rb + (x − xb).
Union
Once the different parts that composed the model were developed and studied separately, simulations on the whole model were run using python programming, based on previous studies [7] [6] [4] that showed the relation between glucose and insulin, our results were similar to the expected. Some parts of our model could not be considered as there are some technical issues that need to be attended before generating the pulses on feeding, it is expected that the complete model should work as a generalization of the one presented in these simulations, but we require to build a complete simulation to emphasize this point. We developed a mathematical model that regulates glucose levels of diabetic people to 80mg/dL, an optimum value according to Normoglycemia definitions. Normoglycemia is defined as blood glucose concentration in the range of 70–100 mg/dl. [5].
In order to test our glucose sensor, we measured fluorescence intensity of RFP in our bacteria populations. Experimental results showed that under a 154 mg/dL glucose concentration, the system reaches its highest expression peak of the gene promoter. We included experimental data in our computational simulations and provided the theoretical framework of Glucose-Insulin dynamics in our system. Previous iGEM teams found similar results, Missouri Miners iGEM Team developed a glucose sensor with specific dose responses with different glucose concentrations than the concentrations we obtained, they found a positive and down regulation dynamic of the system by measuring fluorescence intensity due to the production of eYfp [8]. Our mathematical approach help us to understand the dynamic of the system and the parameters involved using experimental data.
Figure 5: A comparison is made between the glucose levels (up) which begins at a level of 170 mg/dL and the insulin levels (down), it is possible to appreciate that the glucose levels are expected to be regulated to a 80 mg/dL level, generating a feedback on the insulin levels, which tends to"

From Figure 9, the final values of the sfGFP concentration for each copy                     number in the steady state, in the presence of LacI, are constantly                     increasing and the repressor cannot hold the same fold change for different                     copy number. Also, the deviation from the balancing of sfGFP shown in the                     TALE system is two orders of magnitude larger and the control of its                     quantity with LacI cannot satisfy the desired adjustment levels around the                     steady state.
Figure 9: The blue line shows the sfGFP expression under regulation of                         LacI tuning, while the red one shows the sfGFP without the regulation                         effect of LacI.
For a low copy number over time, it is observed that although the amount of                     TALE produced is the same, it cannot repress with the same power as its                     absence, since the affinity is kx times larger than natural binding.

The red line shows the TALE system, while the blue one presents                         the LacI regulated sfGFP. The system reaches a steady state and remains                         stable at a low concentration of sfGFP.

They provide general advice throughout the duration of the project including on CAS agar plate preparation. They also provided the use of a plate reader for us to complete the interlab study and -80 C freezer to store glycerol stock of our transformed BL21 cells for later gene expression experiments.
We sent our cell samples after IPTG induction to them and they performed a rust test indicating siderophore production and could also use our cells producing vibrioferrin for their own experiments.
After our successful CAS agar plate tests we provided some of our batch to iGEM ECUST for them to test their own project designs.

Characterization of our biobricks is a chance for us to prove that our design works as intended. These next two pages will slowly guide you through our results, but keep in mind that not everything is presented below. For all the details, consult our protocol page where you will find a comprehensive picture of our project.
The question of design and therefore of function is two-fold: How do we - and can we - control the expression of our system? And do the expressed proteins work as intended? These are the questions this page sets out to answer. Specifically, we have characterized our regulable biobricks (LacI/Plac and AraC/Para)

Our user studies invited them to try out our software (with the help of the easy user guide or some guidance given by us).
Then give some feedbacks on the three parts (i.e., CRAFT Designer, CRAFT Square and plug-in Satellite) of CRAFT.
Yu Zhou, team instructor of 2016 NJU-China
Background Information: 2016 NJU-China is doing a project on building a transplantable drug system targeting a specific
molecule to treat cancer.
Feedbacks:
“We’re doing the project on shRNA this year, but the system designed in CRAFT dose not contain parts of shRNA. To make
it universal, is it possible to add shRNA in your graph and your system can be regulated by ncRNAs?”
“CRAFT Square should allow other users to duplicate other design and modify to suit for their own demands.”
“Satellite is a creative design, and relatively easy to use.”
Inspiration:
In wet-lab teams, it seems that more and more teams have included ncRNAs into their synthetic system, but few of our
software have taken this into consideration. This year, however, even though the original data contained ncRNA regulation
data, we failed to find reference models for evaluating these regulations, so we eliminate these in CRAFT at last to ensure our
accuracy.
Most of users in CRAFT Square won’t design their system from scratch, but refer to other design and modify them, so it is

Some Feedbacks:
“The concept in generating protocols is really cool! And it really work! I just wonder what will the protocol like if I have input
hundreds of targets in the first step of CRAFT Designer?”
“Satellite? This name is appropriate and it is easy to use it. But how can I ask others to help me calculate my design?”
Inspiration:
We are delight to find the protocol generated in this way can correctly guide users’ experiment, but we can not ensure what
will happen if the number of targets have raised to hundred. So we develop a channel of feedback and made the protocol
scalable. Users who have found more effective protocols can contact us and we will add them into our system. Of course, it must be
very kind for those who really make an experiment with hundreds species of bacteria.

Figure 1. Plant breeding techniques known by                             the surveyed.
It is interesting to notice that only the 33.9% of                         people consider that induced mutagenesis is normally                         used. However, this is actually one of the most common                         techniques for plant breeding, together with                         hybridization and artificial selection. One of the main                         conclusions that we can get from this analysis is that                         genome editing techniques have the most significate                         difference between what is known and what people think                         it is used.
People were asked about which plant breeding technique                         they think is the best and the worse from a                         nutritional, health and economical point of view. As                         seen in figure 2, the 44.3% chose artificial selection                         followed by the 23.5% that think that genetic editing                         is the best one. On the other hand, 68.7% consider that                         induced mutagenesis is not the best option to improve                         fruits’ quality. It is remarkable that only the 3.5% of                         the interviewed chose the genetic editing as the worse                         plant breeding technique. This is an encouraging                         result, as it seems that plant editing is not seen as                         bad as transgenics.

As we can see in the Figure 3, there are many people                         who affirms to know about transgenic products. The                         interesting point is that just half of them are aware                         of the difference between transgenics and genome edited                         plants. This fact means that this new technology has to                         be diffused and communicated to society.
It is also noticeable how society claims about                         preferring artificial selection over the other                         techniques. 85% of people who voted against consuming                         genome editing or transgenics said that they would                         rather eat “natural products”. For most of this same                         surveyed, induced mutagenesis was the worst technique                         to be used for plant breeding. It is possible that they                         do not know that it is a common technique. For that                         reasons, our team found as necessary science                         communication with society. It is important to know the                         difference between what we eat and what we think we                         eat.

If we scientists are able to explain why all plant                         breeding techniques are equal on its outcomes, it is                         possible that people will accept gene editing and                         transgenics, allowing and even helping"
