The things that we have accomplished as a scientific community are just terrifically unbelievable and to think what we can accomplish in a few years, just thrills me. I think that both GenetiX and iGem are a great opportunity to start that change. Also, I participate in Models of United Nations (MUNs) . I was primary founder of the Debate Club in Tecnologico de Monterrey and we are going to participate next November on “Panamericanos”. Everything that I do is focused on achieving that change, because I want that every time someone mentions the word “future” they don’t think about a mass of gray polluted injustice, but as a bright community full of opportunities and hope.

High School Student
Coordinator mathematical models
I am the mathematical models coordinator and lab member currently at my senior year of IB high school. I'm currently 18 years old and really interested in natural sciences, cooking, science fiction, videogames and travel. I joined GenetiX whilst on my third semester and decided to participate in the IGem project mostly because of chemistry but also to learn bio-engineering, which I ended up enjoying quite a lot, and I decided to take up the task of creating and coordinating the mathematical model. This project has given lots of abilities and knowledge, as not only have I learned the basics of bio-engineering and biology in general, but I have also become very adept at chemistry and lab practices , even taking a course on the subject. It helped a lot with teamwork, because it is taken to a whole new level when working on such a big, multidisciplinary project and it widened my perception of the world and the possible routes for my academic future.
I am very eager and excited to participate on a competition of such magnitude and international recognition. It is an amazing opportunity to learn more about the world and the different cultures by meeting people from around the world with a similar way of thinking. Such a multicultural event is one in a lifetime chance, and doing it together with a group that has become a second family to me is more than I could ask for.

Asaf presented his idea for experiments:
- Use a yeast vector with a promotor called ""gal1-gal10"" that can provide for two genes at the same time.
- When we introduce it to the yeast, we can merge different yeasts with different promotors (they merge their genetic information) and so we can get more enzymes in 1 yeast.
- If we could find an assay for the products that is quick and cheap, we might use a total random reactions and collect the best yeasts.
We presented another product of a reaction that is pyrocatechol which is toxic for human. We need to check if we can work with it, it has good assays.We concluded that every assay for potential products or byproducts of the system is worth doing.
We discussed the second enzymatic pathway:
- We concluded that we might get from TCDD to catechol which every plant can degrade.
- It seems that we can use TCDD as a carbon source, which is easy to check.
- Any way we need a reductase for NADH/NADPH (depends on the enzyme).
- Cyp1 might help this enzymatic pathway as a Cl ridder.
We discussed the forth enzymatic pathway:
- With a dioxin without the Cl`s atoms being degraded by two enzymes to catechol.
- There are more enzymes that might be easier to use then the second enzymatic pathway. (we should combine the pathways).
- We should send a mail to the Chinese research team, and maybe even try their sequence ourselves.
We discussed the third enzymatic pathway.
We concluded that all 4 enzymatic pathways are viable solution.
- We need to optimize the sequences we found for yeasts.
- Because we want to use plants in the future, we want to use codons that are good for plants and yeasts.
- if it takes too much time (more than an hour) we should go for yeasts optimization alone.
- We should be able to do that in sequencing company's sites.
- Enzyme names are not Absolut! We should use the exertion numbers of each gene.
- We should check if there are splices to each gene.
- When we have those sequences we should check with IDT and twist to get price tag and supply timeline.
- We need to contact twist and IDT and see if we can get the sequences.
- We have a notebook of the yeast vectors to read and understand how to work with.
We found out that there are 2 options to insert the genes to the yeasts:

Constructs
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Simultaneous knock-out and insertion Knock-out Escherechia coli Bacillus subtilis Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yarrowia lipolytica References
All the constructs used in our project are summarized on this page. The DNA fragments of each construct were assembled with Gibson assembly after addition of overlapping sequences through PCR with primers containing overhangs to the adjacent DNA fragment (20-25 base pairs). Design of constructs and primers were performed in Snapgene with the aid of the web tools NEBuilder and Tm calculator . DNA sequences were obtained using Genbank, KEGG and Addgene.
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
The constructs for Synechocystis are based on three different knock-outs: argininosuccinate lyase (argH) , glutamine synthetase (glnA) and acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs) . ArgH is knocked out when Synechocystis is going to be used in a consortium with E. coli or B. subtilis, while glnA is knocked out when Y. lipolytica or S. cerevisiae is the producing organism. However, Synechocystis can still synthesise glutamine even if glnA is knocked out due to existence of a different type of glutamine synthetase in the genome (glnN) [1]. Due to limits in available antibiotics and time limits for marker recycling [2], the expression of glnN was repressed by growing the cyanobacteria with NH4+ as the nitrogen source [1].
In addition to constructing an auxotrophic cyanobacterium, ackA and pta are overexpressed in Synechocystis, along with knock-out of acs , to increase the metabolic flux towards acetate through the pta-AckA pathway [3]. As a starting point, the mutant JA06 received by the Paul Hudson group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology was used as it already excreted some amounts"

Food fermentation (food waste conversion/increasing shelf life)
- Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum can be used to convert food waste into hydrogen (1) However, I could not find information on the genes responsible for this and they may not have been identified yet.
- Lactic acid bacteria can be used in food fermentation as ""starter cultures"". They produce several compounds and help extend the shelf life of the product (2).
- Lactic acid bacteria can produce a compound that fights Staph aureus, increasing food safety (3)

WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#St Louis_-_-_TEXT.html," to natural sunlight with large window panes and others are grown in the basement with custom LED bulbs that emit limited wavelengths of light to optimize growth for each specific type of plant. These methods maximize plant yield and freshness and minimize growth time.
We spoke to Venkat Papolu, the founder of SLIP and developer of most of their infrastructure and equipment about the goal of the company and advantages and disadvantages of hydroponics. They aim to bring fresh and organic produce to food desert communities year-round. From their small facility downtown, their aim to expand to a large-scale warehouse to increase crop yields.
He also brought up many common advantages and drawbacks of novel agricultural technologies. Indoor hydroponics allows for a highly controlled environment, so the plants will be purely pesticide-free and can be grown year-round. There are no disadvantages due to the lack of soil because the proper nutrients are all delivered through water. However, although hydroponics is cheaper than conventional agriculture at scale, the higher startup costs increases the initial prices of their products, making it hard for the local community to purchase the goods. While high-income communities love to purchase the food and are willing to pay more for it, this prevents it from going to those who need fresh food the most. In addition, indoor agriculture lacks some of the benefits of outdoor agriculture. All pollination must be artificial, a time-consuming process. Most indoor plants do not receive natural light, so artificial lights must be installed, which are expensive and energy-intensive. However, the growth in use and scale of these technologies will allow for these drawbacks to be minimized, such as through the use of renewable energy and decreasing costs per unit.
Danforth Plant Science Center
We toured the Danforth Plant Science Center on July 24th and were able to visit numerous labs and learn more about individual projects. After corresponding with Dr. Bart over email, visited the Bart Lab in detail and saw the plant death room where their experiments are carried out after the plants are grown in the greenhouses. While visiting the greenhouses, we learned about the growth process of cassava, which is used for research purposes by the Bart Lab. The greenhouse facility houses their Conviron phenotyping machine. We saw the process happening as each plant was barcode-scanned and imaged to collect valuable information for fast and reliable phenotyping. We also saw a model of a larger scale image-based phenotyping technology used in farms in Arizona.
After visiting the research wing of the center, we saw the education and community outreach area where they hold many events year-round for all members of the community to learn more about biotechnology and research methods.

Amazonas
As a team based in the United Kingdom, we did not have first hand knowledge about Chagas disease. The Amazonas iGEM team put us in contact with Professor Jaila Borges who was able to inform us about how South American governments address the disease. They also translated a survey we sent them (into Portuguese) and disseminated it to the public in Brazil, a country affected by Chagas disease. This was instrumental in improving our understanding of the type of diagnostic that populations in Chagas-endemic regions prefer. The survey results can be found here .
AQA Unesp
The team at AQA Unesp also translated (into Portuguese) and conducted our survey in Brazil. The survey results can be found here . In return, we were able to give them information about how type I diabetes is addressed and treated in the UK.
TEC CEM
Many countries in the Americas including Mexico are affected by Chagas disease even though it is most widespread in Bolivia and Brazil. The team at TEC CEM translated (into Spanish) our survey and distributed it amongst the Mexican public. This gave us essential insight into public awareness of Chagas disease as well as the Mexican public’s views towards potential diagnostic tools for the disease. The survey results can be found here .

When agglutination occurs, antibodies will bind to their matching antigen pairs, creating a mat on the bottom of the well. This is the case because each antibody has two antigen binding sites, meaning it can bind to more than one antigen and form an interwoven antigen-antibody complex. No agglutination, on the other hand, would manifest as a small dot at the bottom of the well, because no interwoven antigen-antibody complexes were formed and the cells just clumped to the bottom due to gravity. A schematic showing the differences between a positive agglutination and a negative agglutination result can be seen below.
Figure 5: Agglutination Schematic-  An unmatching antibody on top and a matching antibody below that; with the final results on the bottom.  The final results are a top view of the containing wells.
The actual results of our assay can be seen below in Figure 6. It can be seen that the wells with cellular surface expression of GFP (the bottom two rows) were positive (a mat) as expected while the controls (the top two rows) were not agglutinated and had a dot of cells in the bottom of the well. This proves that it is possible to see a visual confirmation of agglutination.

1The Natural Host

4Comparable Systems in Nature
The Natural Host
Bordetella is the natural host of the BPP-1 bacteriophage. It expresses a protein on its surface, pertactin, that BPP-1 binds to in the first step of the infection process. However, Bordetella does not always express pertactin. It cycles between two phases: Bvg+ and Bvg-. Pertactin is only expressed in the Bvg+ phase, while in the Bvg- phase, pertactin expression is inhibited. Infection by BPP-1 during this phase is much less common, but it still occurs (Liu). This indicates that the BPP-1 virus has a mechanism for changing its host specificity, and thus, the binding properties of the proteins on its tail fibers.
Cryo-ET scan of the BPP-1 phage (Dai)
The Virus
The BPP-1 virus is a bacteriophage belonging to the Podoviridae family. It has an icosahedral head with T=7 symmetry, and a short, noncontractile tail with six tail “spikes” attached to tail fibers. At the end of these tail fibers are major tropism determinant (Mtd) proteins, which bind to the pertactin proteins expressed on the surface of Bordetella. The Mtd protein does not display high affinity for pertactin, but the multiple Mtd proteins possessed by each phage particle coupled with the flexibility of the tail fibers allow BPP-1 as a whole to have high avidity for its host (Liu). Following infection, the virus is lytic, and destroys the bacterial host to release more copies of itself (ViralZone).
Diversity Generation
The genomic DGR system in BPP-1 and other phages (Medhekar)
The BPP-1 phage contains a diversity generating retroelement (DGR) for diversifying its Mtd protein. DGRs generate variability in the viral receptor protein that specifies tropism for ligand molecules, and encode polypeptides that are designed to tolerate sequence variation."

However, if the engineering bacteria or the enzymes used in the production are proved to be poisonous, they will definitely be controlled in the future. If the bacteria or enzymes are not considered dangerous, we don't necessarily look into or control them.
Q: Are there different examining procedures for different bacteria?
A: Yes.
Q: I heard that there is new molecular approach to detect certain bacteria remaining in the samples by extracting and sequencing the entire DNA presented in the samples. The method has been approved by government but doesn't seem to prevail for the time being.
A: Such way of detection is still under research and investigation currently. It's because if we are going to make something one of the standard ways of detection or regulation, we want to be extremely cautious about that and do the best we can to have a thorough understanding of that. Also, such approach requires specific technology and equipments, which may not be popularized yet. Many institutions basically lack the requirements for such method.
Q: With the increasing dominance of biopharming in the drug production field, more and more drugs produced by genetically engineered bacteria are entering our daily life. However, unlike genetically modified food, which is usually clearly labeled, it's hard to tell the way a drug is produced. Do you see a significant concern among citizens in terms of whether the drug is chemically or biologically produced?
A: Well, it is actually not a specific concern among the citizens. Usually our customers pay more attention to the toxicity of the drugs, which is proved to be under controlled by our previous trials on animals and humans. Customers also concern about the effectiveness of the drug, for example, the durability and the stability. But people don't pay that much attention to the means of production of drugs. But the situation takes a nasty turn when speaking of genetically modified food. People stress the safety of genetically modified food since it accounts for a significant portion of our daily intake, while drugs are more like emergency needs when being ill and are often taken in subtle amounts.
Q: What is the official attitude towards GMOs?
A: It is still a controversial topic indeed and both sides have their own theories and strong reasons. We generally do not hold any distinct disapproval by now as drug administration department.
Q: There are some projects now that focus on engineering bacteria that can be inject in certain part in the human body in order to detect certain pathogens or diagnose a disease. It's currently a cutting edge field and hotspot of research, though it might still take a long time for a well-rounded and standardized system for practical use. Do you think it's worth spreading"

If you want, you can add EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM (as advised by New England Biolabs) and heat activate the samples at 75 C for 20 minutes. We decided that it was not necessary in our case.
For the K1 backbone, the recipe was slightly different due to the higher concentration of blunted DNA we wanted to achieve:
H20 - 4.4 uL
NEBuffer2 (10X, found in enzyme ice box) - 4 uL (needs to be at a final concentration of 1X)
dNTP (10 mM) - 0.4 (needs to be at a final concentration of 100 uM)
template - 30 uL (for 1.5 ug of DNA, assuming the T7 + Lysis was at a concentration of 100 ng/uL)
T4 Polymerase - 1.2 uL (it comes at a ""concentration"" of 3000 units/mL and we want 1.5 units)
for a total of 40 uL.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,", within the framework of the Environmental Code and its ordinances and regulations [10].
The EU is currently reviewing the water regulations to unify them. In 5-10 years time, they are expected to show some changes and give more visibility to this topic (Personal communication M Ryen 7 Sept 2018).
The EU’s Water Policy considers the environmental pollution with pharmaceutical residues to be an emerging problem [17].
According to the Swedish Environmental Code, “wastewater shall be diverted and purified or treated in some other way to avoid detriment to human health or the environment” [18].
According to the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD), “all wastewater entering the collecting system must before discharge be subject to at least secondary treatment”. Therefore, WWTPs are not legally required to treat water from pharmaceuticals [10].
The UWWTD is under evaluation. There is an Open Public Consultation on this directive opened until 19/10/2018 [19].
The Swedish EPA’s report in 2016 emphasizes the need for advanced treatment motivated by the risk of long-term effects due to the release of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment [10].
WWTPs have a special law which specifies they cannot have additional costs that are not required (Study visit S Andersson 10 Jul 2018). The Swedish EPA’s regulations have specific requirements for removal of nitrogen and biochemically degradable organic matter (BOD) whereas the WWTPs’ permits determine the requirements for phosphorus removal [10].
The Industrial Emissions Directive requires private WWTPs to use the Best Available Technology (BAT) (Email P Gruvstedt 5 Oct 2018).
The implementation of an environmental program during the next four years (2019-2022) will be presented this year by the Uppsala University Hospital to the Swedish politicians. After a thorough investigation of pharmaceuticals’ presence in water and their effects, the goal of this program is to solve the legal gap (Study visit S Svebrant 15 Aug 2018).
Environmental
Municipal WWTPs obtain their permits from the Environmental Assessment Ordinance depending on their environmental footprint (amount of connected communities) (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018), the water status and the environmental quality standards [10]. These environmental permits and the Swedish EPA regulate discharges from WWTPs [10].
Private industries have operational permits considered by the Environmental Courts and issued by the Government [18]. In the permit application, a description of the activities must be provided as well as the environmental impact that might occur and the protection measures to"

Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," because the enzyme kinetics and catalysis are not part of this particular analysis (flux balance analysis), and there is only one major constrain added to the non-native compound catalysis reaction, namely the uptake of available oxygen. This model could be further improved by combining constraint-based analysis with enzyme kinetics. This would then give levels and rates of L-DOPA and Dopamine that would have more realistic relevance.
Furthermore, the model is largely limited to any activities occurring in the extracellular and intracellular regions of the bacteria and fails to capture any external factors outside the model, which could have an adverse effect on the synthesis of the compound. Since the existing model used for analysis just takes into account the effect of what is already present in the model, it fails to capture any components that might have a potential effect on our pathway. For example, there are other energy sources that are absent to the model and therefore any effects of those components could not be captured.
The stoichiometric model used is largely static and more complex multi-species models (combination of human and bacteria model) would be required, using dynamic flux balance analysis [8] in order to achieve results that are predictive for the in vivo behaviour of our system. Furthermore, this model could be further improvised by knocking out specific reactions to further optimise compound synthesis. This could be achieved by running a pre-existing OptKnock script that can determine optimal mutant probiotics strain [9].

Meetups
Meetup held by ITCCC
On July 24th, we were invited to take part a meeting upheld by International                         Teenager                         Competition and Communication Center on campus of USTB, during which 4 teams shared the                         experimental process about their project and feelings of iGEM. We made a brief introduction to                         our project and answered questions asked by experts and journalist, in which we gained a better                         insight into our project.
Meetup held by team Peking
We participated in an exchange meeting organized by team Peking. The other teams are team                         Tsinghua, UCAS, BNU, THU, OUC. Every team had a presentation on their projects, including the                         idea, the process, and their superiority. We received a lot of pertinent suggestions from other                         teams, which helped a lot to our project. Especially, team Peking gave us plenty of suggestions                         and we had a pleasant discussion. Due to these, we set a collaboration with team Peking.
CCIC
By the end of August, we had preliminarily completed all parts of experimental verification,                         constructed the relevant proteins, and verified the strength of each promoter. In order to                         further improve our project and make progress with other teams from communication, we                         participated in CCIC. CCIC (Central China iGEM Consortium) is a national iGEM exchange meeting                         held by domestic universities, which provides an important pre-competition exchange and                         learning platform for teams from China. It not only promotes the exchange and cooperation                         between the national iGEM teams, but also further promote synthetic biology to domestic                         universities. Taking part in CCIC allowed us to have a more profound understanding of our own                         project, so as to find some improving thoughts, and a few other teams reached a friendly cooperation on the project design with our team. Through the expert's reports and several                         predecessors experience exchange, we had solved many confusion in our laboratory, and had a                         deeper understanding of synthetic biology.

Generation of datasets for GO-term classification
Filtered the Swissprot file and rewrote it to a .csv containing: name, seq, EC_nr, GO-terms
Then GO-term specific .csv files were generated. The GO-DAG (directed acyclic graph) was completed for each GO annotation in each protein, and the respective protein was then added to all GO-term specific files, that it has GO-annotations for.
Extremely generic GO-labels like: GO:0003674 molecular function, or GO:0005488 binding were excluded.

However, once she warms up, she has a pretty silly side too. Her responses to extreme stress can be pretty unpredictable and often hilarious (she'd once thrown her shoe at somebody). Her behaviour changes to suit the situation and people around her. Despite acting like a big sister most of the time, with some people, she can be childish and playful too.

Transformation plating results
We got no growth on any of the plated transformed bacteria for either the ElectroComp or ChemComp bacteria.  To check whether the isothermal assembly itself was the problem, we ran a junction PCR using our previous protocol on the isothermal assembly mix, along with a positive control (Myc981):
No bands visible for the isothermal assembly
As observed, there were no bands in the isothermal mix lanes while the positive control worked.  Thus, we can conclude that our isothermal assembly did not work, and we will need to repeat it again (currently waiting for more isothermal mix to arrive from Wyss).
Amplification and purification of practice plate oligos
In preparation for our swap reactions (switching the oligo F1s into our expression plasmid), we mapped out the following two experiments that we will need to perform:
Testing the selection system by preparing our expression plasmids in parallel (i.e. creating 18 plasmids in separate reactions), and then combining them all at the end and transforming them into the selection strains.  This will allow us to cut and ligate the plasmids without much concern, but test whether we will be able to pick out the binder amongst the rest of the non-binders.

Genetic Circuit
As described in the introductory section, the genetic circuit contains four components. When the target metal is present, a metal-specific DNAzyme is activated, resulting in cleavage of a second DNA strand:
To bypass inefficient sequestration of the substrate strand by the catalytic strand, we developed hairpin DNAzymes as illustrated above. Read more about the DNAzymes below .
The cleaved DNA strand activates a toehold switch. which mediates expression of T3 RNA polymerase (""Ribo"" is a ribosome):
Toehold switches are generally RNA sequences that hide the ribosome binding site in a hairpin loop, thus preventing translation. Read more about the toehold switch below .
The T3 RNA polymerase transcribes two genes. The expression of lacZ results in a color change, which alerts the user that the target metal is present.
In our system, LacZ converts the yellow substrate chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside into the purple β-galactosidase. Read more about the reporter below .
The expression of T3 RNA polymerase serves to amplify the original signal from the DNAzyme activity.
The concentration of metal ion can be quite low, so an amplification system will ensure a visible signal from minimal DNAzyme cleavage. Read more about the amplification system below .
Back to Top
DNAzyme
DNAzymes, or deoxyribozymes, are short DNA strands which perform a specific chemical reaction, generally catalytic. They are analogous to protein enzymes or ribozymes. DNAzymes contain a catalytic domain and binding domains, and commonly require metal cofactors to be activated. This activation could either be a matter of directly facilitating the reaction, or being a part of the proper structural integrity of the DNAzyme. Most available DNAzymes catalyze the cleavage of strands containing RNA bases at the active site. No DNAzymes are known to exist in nature, and are therefore a fully synthetic construction ( Silverman ). We worked with two DNAzymes. The thallium-specific DNAzyme was based off the work of Huang, Vazin, and Liu . The lead-specific DNAzyme was based off the work of Lan, Furuya, and"

""Lange Nacht der Forschung""
On April 29 we were able to present the iGEM-competition, synthetic biology, as well as, the general idea of our project at “Lange Nacht der Forschung”. This is an event organized by the Austrian broadcast to show the general public what we are doing in research including chances and visions.  Together with the institute of molecular biotechnology and ACIB we facilitated the visitors to get a first glance at microbiology, enzymes, and the field of genetic engineering, as well as, synthetic biology. For example we did an isolation of DNA from strawberries with ordinary consumables. Especially the DNA isolation was our task, together with the Austrian part of the last year’s iGEM Team “Manchester-Graz”. All over the event we extracted DNA together with hundreds of visitors, while a few of us gave an introduction to DNA and the general construction of a cell. Furthermore, we created a poster about our project and answered different questions about it and about the topic in general. The range of asked questions was enormous. There were some easy ones like:
Q: What is the difference between DNA and DNS?
A: DNS is the German expression for DNA. The A stands for acid. In German it would is S for “Säure”. In the course of time DNS was replaced by DNA also here in Austria.
Q: Why do we need genetic engineering? We did not need it for decades! Why now?
A: Our modern world would not work without genetic engineering anymore. Many things in our daily life are made by microorganisms; E.g. citric acid and insulin, just to name 2 very popular examples.  The next thing is that it is true that we had no need for genetic engineering in the past. But what we can see is that the mankind wants to spend less and less money for food and other commodities. Without plants and genetic engineering it would not be possible to provide 1kg of pork meat for less than €2,-  Even our forefathers did kind of genetic engineering. For sure they did not use our methods, but they always cultivated the best and biggest plants"

Collaboration with University of Calgary iGEM - Wet Lab Collaboration
Overview
This summer, Calgary iGEM reached out to us expressing interest over our project and about beginning a collaboration between our teams. Their goal is to develop a process for bioplastic production on a Mars settlement. This is a novel method that couples waste management in space with the high cost of shipping materials to a Mars mission crew. Calgary iGEM has been working hard in engineering E. coli to produce bioplastics from human waste feedstock. The bioplastic of interest is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), which can be synthesized with their engineered bacteria using volatile fatty acids (VFA), compounds that are present in human waste. Calgary’s interest in our team stemmed from the need for a fast and effective E. coli detector to incorporate into their bioplastics synthesis system on a Mars colony. Our DNAzyme would serve as part of their containment system, and quickly alert crew to leakage from the synthesis system. Our team was very interested in this potential application of our DNAzyme and decided to mail a quantity of it over for pilot testing from Calgary iGEM.
Experiment
A small amount of DNAzyme was shipped to Calgary for testing its specificity in the presence of E. coli, and confirming lack of cleavage activity in the presence of other bacteria. The following outlines the procedure followed by Calgary iGEM and their results.
Overnight cultures of E. coli DH5α and Bacillus subtilis WB800 were prepared in liquid M9 media and diluted to a concentration of 106 cells/mL. Quadrants were drawn on agar plates with M9 media and labelled as either E. coli or B. subtilis, DNAzyme, and two negative controls (Figure 1).
On the quadrants labelled as bacteria, 30 µL of the overnight E. coli or B. subtilis were spread and left to grow for 36 hours. Calgary encountered a lack of bacterial growth following this incubation step. They decided to use a thicker agar plate and plate a higher concentration of cells (108 cells/mL), which resulted in colony growth (Figure"

The first steps
The filter combinations
Does fluorescence photography work on Paper?
The app
The black case
Output Signal processing
A prototype for easy fluorescence detection
The problem
The aim of our project was to design a convenient test strip using fluorescence as an output signal. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is  one of the most frequently used reporter proteins and it has already been used in numerous iGEM projects, e.g. iGEM Aachen 2014. Instruments for fluorescence-measurement are not readily available outside of the lab. So our aim was to develop an easy and cheap method for analyzing a fluorescence output. Therefore we developed an easy and cheap method for analyzing a fluorescence output. So we developed a smartphone app in combination with two light filters. One filter is used to ensure the correct extinction of GFP by putting it in front of the flash, while the other filter passes only the evaluable emission spectrum of GFP for minimizing the background noise. Thereby it is put in front of the camera of the smartphone.
The first steps
When starting with our project, we wanted to verify if fluorescence of sfGFP can be measured by a smartphone. So in the first step we measured the extinction and emission spectra from sfGFP to test if the smartphone flash can excites sfGFP. Although the characteristic curve of the flash of the smartphone s5 mini, do not covers the hole sfGFP exciting curve, it is possible to extinct sfGFP with the flash, because the maximum turning point"

B) Transmembrane domain prediction by the TMHMM 2.0 server , indicating positioning of N- and C-termini out- and inside of the cell, respectively, as well as predicting functionality of transmembrane regions. C) Schematic depiction of the C-terminal stop-transfer sequence of the receptor.
Elements for detection
In order to confirm the correct expression and localization of the receptor, the receptor contains three functional elements for its detection for both the N- and the C-terminal receptor domains:
The intracellularly located C-terminal red fluorescent protein mRuby 3 for detection of the receptor via fluorescence microscopy while also providing a stable, folded domain at the C-terminus,
an extracellular epitope domain near the N-terminus for immunochemical detection via A3C5-antibody fragments as well as FACS, and
an intracellular Strep-tag II at the N-terminus for the detection and purification via immunochemical methods.
Further elements that were included into the expression construct are the CMV promoter for overall high expression levels of the receptor, resulting in a high-avidity-interaction. At the 3'-end, the construct contains the polyadenylation signal of human growth hormone (hGH) for functional polyadenylation of the transcribed mRNA.
Design of an autotransporter construct for bacterial surface display
Besides the design of biotinylated and biotin-binding receptors for eukaryotic cells, we also wanted to apply our biotINK approach for prokaryotic cells. For this purpose, we designed an autotransporter device that is able to present biotinylated or biotin-binding protein domains on the surface of E. coli. Constructs for bacterial surface display are hereby already well known in the field of protein engineering of therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies. There, they are used to screen libraries of different antibodies concerning their affinity towards a given therapeutic target.
We based our design on the autotransporter EspP [9] .

The autotransporter system itself is established and functional (see Fig. A [10] ), and here we ""bricked"" it down into RFC[10] and RFC[25] BioBricks.

As the act of patenting is costly, we were also introduced to the concept of strategic patenting. This practice ensures that the patentee has a much time as possible to work on their IP while being protected before fully committing economically to the patenting process. Since we will be disclosing the majority of out findings on the iGEM wiki in late October, the ability to file a patent in many international markets are limited as they immediately label any knowledge on the internet as public domain. For a patent in Canada/United States, there is a one-year grace period after the date of disclosure in order to file a patent before the IP becomes part of the public domain. During this time period, one can file for a provisional patent valid for Canada and the U.S, the function of the provisional patent is to serve as a place holder for a patent down the line and lasts for a year from the date of filing. After the 12 months, one can go straight into a U.S. patent which lasts 20 years or can file a Paris Convention Treaty Patent, which would extend protection by 18 months which allows for more time to get research funding, additional development and entrepreneurship.
As a team we were also curious to see how intellectual property rights in emerging markets affected patenting. The rationale behind this exploration was to explore intellectual property in other emerging markets and see whether or not dNANO could potentially commercialized. We then contacted and collaborated with the Sichuan University (SCU-China) iGEM team in order to compare and contrast intellectual property rights in Canada and in China.
We realized that some countries have compulsory licencing where the government is able to licence out one’s IP without prior consent of the inventor. Usually, these are granted under special circumstances such as a national emergency and ultimately undermines the inventor’s autonomy with the IP. P

Entrepreneurship
Most patents lead to business development in some capacity. As a project that originated from the university, share of the venture would be divided in a way where a third is assigned to the university, a third is assigned to the inventors and the last third is assigned to the party that is responsible for commercialization. So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology independently, they would"

If we run the simulation with the default parameters, we can see that LacI represses the transcription of c1ts. The oscillations are caused by the cellular division process.
We can observe that under these conditions the c1ts promoter is always repressed.
The bistable works correctly under these conditions.
Turning off the bistable
Secondly, applying 1 µmol of IPTG to induce the off-state, we observe how the protein LacI disappears. However, this state is much more unstable and sometimes c1ts repressors separate from the promoters they are repressing and LacI is expressed again fast.
Specifically, in the second 15000 we can see that c1ts are not repressing with enough strength, which allows the RNA transcription, modifying the bistable state. Moreover, we can see peaks of LacI expression that are turned off by c1ts, but they would not have to appear if this state was perfectly stable.

Table 1: Preliminary aggregation assay results: ATCC 13048, X90 w/ EC93 and EPI100 w/ EC869 strains all obtained from the Hayes lab in UCSB. DH5-alpha w/ pSK33 and DH5-alpha w/ EC93 created in Kosuri lab by UCLA iGEM team. EPI100 w/ EC869 and DH5-alpha w EC93 displayed observable autoaggregation after t = 2h. No aggregation was expected in  DH5-alpha w/ pSK33 since it does not have a CDI system. We were uncertain as to whether or not ATCC 13048 would auto-aggregate or not as it has not been previously established, thus the lack of auto-aggregation does not necessarily indicate lack of CDI expression. X90 w/ EC93 did not auto-aggregate, suggesting there may be an issue expressing the CDI system.
Competition assay (07/29/16)
Due to the lack of auto-aggregation seen in EC93 during the auto-aggregation assay on 07/13/16, we conducted a competition assay to test for inhibitory activity in X90 w/ EC93 using EPI100 w/ EC869 as a CDI+ positive control and DH5-alpha w/ ampR as a CDI- negative"

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#SiruiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," presentation on key features of Geneious.
Week of 6/19/2011
6/20-6/22: continued research on PGP (Personal Genome Project) and Prof. Church and K-nome.  Started drafting questions for the interview with Professor Church on the 22nd, as well as looking up more information on useful features of Geneious.
6/22: George Church interview with Orit and Michelle.  It was an amazing experience where I learned a lot more about related works in the area as well as the future of synthetic biology.  It was very interesting listening to Professor Church talk about the connection between “personalized medicine” and synthetic biology.  Interviewed the BU lab team about the notebook, and made further observations of the wet lab environment.  We began learning about fluorescent proteins and how they are indicators in parts.  Wet lab members were interviewed one by one after the lab meeting about improvements and suggestions for tools they think would be useful to have in the lab.  Members of the team suggested having a cataloging system for test tubes and samples, perhaps a barcode or QR code system.  Alberto mentioned putting up a timer, Kyle mentioned a personalized scheduling tool would be useful in time management, and Shannon and Evelyn suggested that a “status bar” for the progress of each “part” made would be incredibly useful.  Also, the team members would like to be able to search for specific parts at the end of the process, as well as access information on parts they are not currently working on, but are managed by other members of the wet lab.
6/23: Combined BU Comp/WetLab meeting. MIT lab meeting:
from the meeting we learned about many information sharing tools used by the MIT iGEM team to manage information.  The team used conferenceWIKI, Piazza, Stellar, Twitter, Geneious, AdGene, and PubMed extensively.  Perhaps we could look into different social media and research tools being used by other teams as well.   The team talked about having an assembly line for part creation the year before; while this emphasized parts creation, students were not able to acquire full skill sets, which is not the most educational approach to iGEM.  Instead, the tasks this year are divided between everyone doing their own wiki and are responsible for their own parts, and a few students managing specific aspects, such as media relations or parts documentation.   Suggestions from the MIT iGEM team on software to use:  QR codes for documenting parts; having “glove-only” computers;  perhaps even looking into a system that can be managed"
Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," by running an agarose gel, as shown in Figure 8 (b). In addition, we also loaded the digested pUC57 samples to ensure the inserts look identical. The ladder we used in this agarose gel is Fermentas GeneRuler 1kb DNA ladder. We have saved 2 copies of each of 8 clones in our lab freezer and we have also sent one of each type of clone (a total of 4 clones) to the IGEM registry.
Fig 8b: Sub-cloning results with Fermentas GeneRuler 1kb DNA ladder
After successfully cloning the inserts into pSB1C3, we proceed with the RFC 53 protocol to make the main construct. Unfortunately, we were unable to find a clone with the right-sized insert for the L-intron and L-GFP ligation due to time constraints. As a result, we were unable to finish the making of the main construct.
The positive control construct is assembled using RFC 53. Fluorescence is expected to demonstrate that the one amino acid scar from RFC 53 does not disrupt GFP. The negative control construct is assembled using RFC 10. Fluorescence is not expected, in order to demonstrate that presence of the lox site disrupts GFP folding and activity.
Fig 8(c): image of the gel used to extract fragments for the control constructs
Figure 8(c) is an example of a gel used to prepare gel extracted fragments for the two control constructs. We were unable to get any successfully transformed colonies for either construct.
Two criticisms in last year's experimental design have been highlighted this year, which may explain some of the difficulties in creating a working construct.  First, many of the fragments being used are relatively small, which makes it difficult to isolate them for ligation.  A suggested solution is to use PCR to amplify or introduce, for example, the 34bp lox site to the construct. Second, some of the REN being used for double digests are very close to each other on the plasmid (< 10bp).  This may be impeding the RENs' ability to bind and cleave DNA.  An alternative design to the one proposed here would be to create a gene with multiple intron sites to allow continuous mRNA recombination in vivo, rather than a one time recombination event at the DNA level (6).

Module 3
Module 3 is going to make a standard part which is crucially important for our whole experimental design in iGEM project. Project is basically about releasing of intrinsic factor (by GIF gene) in right part of the body and module 3 aims to activate GIF gene to maximum level by pH change in that part. Sensing pH difference is going to be made with pH-dependent promoter (nhaA promoter) that is designed in 2008 by another iGEM team called NYMU-Taipei (Figure 1). (1)
NhaA is responsible gene for Na+/H+ antiporter that has a promoter which can be defined as pH sensor.(2)
In our design, nhaA promoter is going to be inserted into our part in order to activate expression of OmpA+GIF as shown in Figure 2. NhaA promoter is going to be obtained by PCR technique.
Primers were designed by depending on promoter regions, which were defined as previous researches.(3) After all primer designing, the expected PCR product which consists of 192 bases, is shown in Figure 3.
pH dependency of promoter remote the releasing different amount of intrinsic factor in different pHs. The maximum releasing of intrinsic factor ought to be at pH 8.5. (1) It is also known that small intestine has alkaline pH.
After constructing that standard part, intrinsic factor protein is going to be isolated from extracellular medium to prove that protein of interest can be released to ileum.

Following his advice, we made a survey among the iGEM teams participating in the NCTU_Formosa meetup. We asked them questions about what they expect if they need software. Here are some of their answers:
“We’d like a tool to predict the performance of our design…And after obtaining experiment results, we need a tool to model our system. However, matlab is hard to use.” by BIT-China
“There’re so many tools with the same or similar functions. It’s hard to choose from…usually, we’ll ask team members of previous years for recommendations.” by Fudan
Obviously, for wet-lab teams a software that can predict the performance of, or model, their systems is needed. Usually they prefer ONE software with integrated functions, not several tools with separate functions.
A newsletter by 2014 iGEM team Amoy, Paris Bettencourt and Pasteur
We also learned about the needs of iGEM wet-lab teams in the newsletter by Amoy, Paris Bettencourt and Pasteur. In the 6th issue on software, they devised an open questionnaire about software：
What software are you using in iGEM this year?
What software have you used in previous competitions?
What kind of software do you need most?

We made a statistical investigation form this questionnaire and here are some representative answers:
For the first question, we know the most popular software used by wet-lab teams are the Microsoft Office and MATLAB (represented by WLCMilwaukee and UPV Valencia team). In addition, software that assist wet-lab is also popular, such as BitBucket, snapgene and primer premier (represented by NJU_CHINA and SYSU_China team).
For the second question, we know in previous competitions the most commonly used software are adobe and matlab (by Bettencourt Paris and WLCMilwaukee team).
For the third question, a software for wet-lab teams should be user-friendly. This is because wet-lab teams lack experience in working on source code, and they have little time to “discover” the function of a software (represented by Colombia team). Other"

Safety Cases and Synthetic Biology
How are Safety Cases Applicable to Synthetic Biology?
Limited regard has been given to develop systematic techniques to validate engineered biological systems in general. Recently, two of the 2016 UNL iGEM advisors, Dr. Cohen and Dr. Pierobon have published a paper introducing the idea of applying the aforementioned safety cases to the biological domain. There are clear parallels between software systems and synthetically engineered biological organisms (SEBO’s).
Parallels between software systems and synthetically engineered organisms
Engineering the DNA of a microorganism is similar to designing software programs
DNA genetic code has precise biological function
SEBO’s perform information processing
SEBO’s have logical control capabilities
When engineered microorganisms are introduced into an environment outside of the lab, they become safety critical devices
There is a need for predictability in both SEBO’s and Software Systems
Software systems are composed of subsystems and can be built into other systems creating systems of systems. In a very similar sense, an SEBO is a systems of systems. They are made up of BioBricks (subsystems) and are introduced into environmental systems.
One more interesting parallel to draw on is that the environment of many software systems, especially those in transportation or avionics is always changing. Both SEBO’s and software systems must be dynamic and be able to adapt to their environments. SEBO’s do however, have an added level of complexity. The engineered genetic code itself in engineered microorganisms is dynamic due to mutations, whereas the code in software is constant. Cohen and Pierobon suggest the development of the evolution envelope, a method to account for the mutations in safety cases. Safety timelines could potentially be used to compliment safety cases. When safety cases are designed for SB projects, potential evolution patterns can be predicted and mechanisms to mitigate their consequences can be integrated into their design.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"a sample with target, but dried without TDPs was measured. Cas13a with the respective TDP and the target without previous drying were used as control.
As shown in Figure 31a and b, the fluorescence intensity triggered by the RNase-like activity of Cas13a dried without any TDPs is very low in comparison to that of the Cas13a undried and stored frozen. However, while the fluorescence intensity and thus Cas13a activity was higher when Cas13a was dried with CAHS 94205, it also seemed to lose its specificity: the fluorescence intensity after one hour was the same with crRNA and target as without (Figure 31a). However, when the same experiments were repeated with SAHS 33020 instead (Figure 31b), Cas13a remained active after being dried and rehydrated, and the fluorescence intensity observed in the presence of the target and crRNA was clearly higher than in its absence. This indicates that SAHS 33020 can preserve Cas13a activity after desiccation and rehydration, thus keeping the protein functional and opening the possibility of the storage of Cas13a with TDPs.
In view of the unexpected results observed for CAHS94205 and the fact that iGEM  Munich 2017 was also working with Cas13a and similar fluorescence assays, we sent them a newly purified batch of CAHS 94205, to determine whether the same phenomenon would be observed in experiments under the same conditions (see Figure 32).
Figure 32: Cas13a activity with CAHS 94205 in RNase Alert Assay by iGEM  Munich 2017 . Fluorescence intensities over time triggered by RNase activity of Cas13a after drying with the TDP CAHS 94205, with and without crRNA and target RNA. Data from iGEM Munich 2017 .
The results of iGEM Munich 2017 also showed the unexpected RNase activity of Cas13a. We therefore hypothesize, that the conformational change in Cas13a, normally caused by the binding of the crRNA with the target, is induced as a result of an interaction between CAHS 94205 and Cas13a upon drying and resuspension. Consequently, CAHS 94205 was ruled out as a potential desiccation tolerance mediator for Cas13a.
Conclusions
After receiving gene fragments for the four chosen TDPs and promoters, we assembled the fragments into a pSB1C3 backbone with the T7 promoter and transformed the resulting plasmids into the protein expression strain"

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.

Achim Hübner however pointed out that the use of glyphosate is essential in order to guarantee the high amount of yield and the low prices of food in the supermarkets. In addition, he said that we never know all the side effects of the substances that we consume and therefore one cannot forbid only one specific herbicide on speculations.
When our team members asked about an alternative for glyphosate Horst-Henning Steinmann stated that the current alternative to glyphosate are non-chemical methods such as ploughing, this however is more expensive and takes more time. He also said that glyphosate is the cheapest and most effective herbicide available at the moment and pointed out that the side effects of alternative herbicides are also not known yet. However he is also in favour of the reduction of the wide use of glyphosate especially in area where it is not a 100% necessary. Werner Wille agreed with the point of view of Achim Hübner and would see the act of forbidding glyphosate as populist.
After the very diverse and motivated discussion of our guest the audience also asked a few questions. This was very interesting because it was a very versatile audience of students of agriculture, members of the BUND Göttingen and even farmer of farms close to Göttingen. In the end it can be said that even though the panel discussion lasted for one and a half hours there is still much more to talk and discuss about.
The result so far was that there is no alternative at the moment, especially when the people are not willing to pay more for their food in the supermarket, even though the impact of glyphosate on the biodiversity could be severe. All in all the panel discussion was a huge success and we thank all of the participants for coming!

Participating in the third Synthetic Biology conference in Landshut
Synthetic biology is constantly evolving, as new research topics revolutionize the way we look at natural sciences. From newly-found approaches in artificial photosynthesis to finding out, which genes are necessarily required to enable an organism to live, the Third conference for Synthetic Biology in Landshut gave us stunning insights into various areas of research. Of course, we didn't miss the opportunity to present our own project to the fellow scientists, using our poster (right picture) and a presentation (left picture).

Northeastern_Boston,2015,Team:Northeastern Boston#Written Investigation_-_-_TEXT.html," gene flow from transgenic crops can have unpredictable effects on the ecological landscape. Herbicide resistant plants can confer their immunity to weeds and other species. Long term herbicide usage eventually will lower its effectiveness, as the resistant weeds become dominant over their vulnerable brethren, causing farmers to switch to less environmentally-friendly herbicides, and lowering crop yield as once farmable land is overrun.
Any organism bestowed with a fitness advantage in the laboratory might have a similar effect when introduced into the wild. As more transgenic crops enter commercial use we may witness an increase in invasive species, biodiversity loss, or other unforeseen threats. Though these side effects likely will be too localized to warrant global concern, even marginal influences on an ecosystem can harm the quality of life and economy of the surrounding human population. Further down the road, too, synthetic biology will undoubtedly produce organisms capable of more severe damage that do demand global regulation.
As organizations like iGEM continue to catalog and standardize parts for open access, it will be easier for synthetic biology to be used in criminal and malicious ways. While it may be possible to screen orders for custom genetic strands now, it will not be when the technology for nucleotide synthesis becomes widespread and cheaper. One potential danger is the production of a super pathogen or other bioweapon. Current consensus [ 5 ] downplays the feasibility of a terrorist organization or other actor being proficient enough in the lab to reproduce professional experiments. However, difficulty level is unlikely to remain the sole barrier. We can safely assume that any sufficiently funded and knowledgeable organization—terrorist or otherwise—will be able to produce a bioweapon such as smallpox in the near future while facing little to no obstacles, if security measures remain at current levels.
Additionally, synthetic biology is also a huge boon for the narcotics industry. Labs have already devised new pathways in yeast for producing opiates using sugar instead of poppies, traditionally the key ingredient. Drug cartels of the future may be able to string together different biomachines into a veritable heroin factory, like building a meth lab out of LEGO.
For all the unending possibilities synbio brings to the table, current regulations are relatively sparse. United States biosecurity is focused on a predetermined list of toxins and biological agents and legislation addressing genetically engineered organisms is almost non-existent. The USDA, FDA, and EPA are responsible for the policing of specific end products, but do not oversee the processes that produce them. Additionally, the Controlled Substances Act does not prohibit drug-synthesizing microbes.
One hope is that synbio can be self-regulating. The same advances that will expose us to new forms of"

SynBioWorld
Synbioworld is a collaborative web platform created to give the synthetic biology community a place  to talk, share data and resources, and stay abreast of new developments in the ﬁeld.  The site is  based on a CMS system that allows for all the normal features of a blog, but also allows for seamless  user management in the various apps we have on the site.  SynBioWorld inludes the following features:
News: SynBioWorld will aggregate several Twitter and RSS feeds related to synthetic biology.  Original content will also be created by the team and members of the community.
Librarian: Librarian is an algorithm and UI frame that automatically aggregates, displays and  allows to search through papers, scientists, and institutions relevant to synthetic biology.
Forum: This feature will ﬁnally answer the repeated request of members of the community, in  particular iGEM participants. It will be moderated by volunteers from the community (over 50  people have already expressed interest in helping out.)
Events: All events relevant to the synthetic biology community will be announced on the site.  Furthermore, we are working on a partnership with the new talk aggregation site SittingO,  which has been described as the “imdb of the conference circuit” to provide a huge annotated  database of synthetic biology talks.

openProtocol
Experimental Protocols are an important tool of synthetic biologists both when doing and publishing experiments.  The ideal protocol must be flexible: both detailed enough for a beginner to complete the experiment successfully, but concise enough for an expert to be able to comfortably make use of it to guide their experiment.
In addition, an ideal protocol is easily sharable with those who wish to replicate your experiment or carry out similar experiments of their own.  At present, there is no tool that allows for the creation of such a protocol, so this summer at the CRI we decided to build one of our own called openProtocol and share it with the synthetic biology community.
openProtocol is a website that allows people to create protocols using a simple web form, and have them come out automatically formatted and laid out in a beautiful and easy to use way.   Every openProtocol has its own URL,"

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#Biosafety_-_-_TEXT.html," the lab with disinfectants, etc). In a lab environment, all materials used for cell and/or bacteria cultures are decontaminated via autoclave. Laboratory personnel have specific training in the procedures conducted in the laboratory and are supervised by a scientist with general training in life science.
Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2)
This level is similar to Biosafety Level 1 and is suitable for work involving moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. It includes various bacteria and viruses that cause only mild disease to humans and are difficult to contract via aerosol in a lab setting, such as C. diff, hepatitis A, B, and C, influenza A, Lyme disease, dengue fever, Salmonella, mumps, Bacillus subtilis, measles, HIV, scrapie.
BSL-2 differs from BSL-1 in that:
laboratory personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic agents and are directed by scientists with advanced training;
access to the laboratory is limited when work is being conducted;
extreme precautions are taken with contaminated sharp items;
certain procedures in which infectious aerosols or splashes may be created are conducted in biological safety cabinets or other physical containment equipment.
Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3)
This level is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching, research, or production facilities where work is done with indigenous or exotic agents which may cause serious or potentially lethal disease as a result of exposure by the inhalation route. It includes various bacteria and viruses that can cause severe to fatal disease in humans, but for which vaccines or other treatment exist, such as anthrax, West Nile virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis, SARS, tuberculosis, typhus, Rift Valley fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, yellow fever.
Laboratory personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents, and are supervised by competent scientists who are experienced in working with these agents in the lab. This is considered a neutral or warm zone.
All procedures involving the manipulation of infectious materials are conducted within biological safety cabinets or other physical containment devices, or by personnel wearing appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment. The laboratory has special engineering and design features.
It is recognized, however, that some existing facilities may not have all the features recommended for BSL3 (i.e., double-door access zone and sealed penetrations). In this circumstance, an acceptable level of safety for the conduct of routine procedures, (e.g., diagnostic procedures involving the propagation of an agent for identification, typing, susceptibility testing, etc.), may be achieved in"

Phage Display Protocols
All protocols displayed here are identical to the ones provided in the NEB Ph.D.™-7 Phage Display Peptide Libraries Instruction Manual, except for the Panning Procedure that was adapted to our needs.
Phage Titering
The number of plaques will increase linearly with added phage only when the multiplicity of infection (MOI) is much less than 1 (i.e., cells are in considerable excess). For this reason, it is recommended that phage stocks be titered by diluting prior to infection, rather than by diluting cells infected at a high MOI. Plating at low MOI will also ensure that each plaque contains only one DNA sequence.

Synthetic Operon
We got the pDSK-GFPuv plasmid from the Noble Foundation and signed an MTA for its use in the iGEM competition. We PCRed the strong 250 bp consitutive promoter from this plasmid (its the 16S ribosomal promoter from the chloroplast of an herbicide resistant type of Amaranthus weed) and put it into the promoter testing device, BBa_E0240 and it does indeed prove to be a strong promoter:
Knowing we had at least this biobricked strong promoter to work with, we went on building the synthetic operon in the pSB1A2 biobrick plasmid. Using the Phusion proofreading taq kindly provided to us by NEB and primers from IDT, we PCR amplified the crtE, B, and Y genes from Erwinia uredevora that were shared with us by members of iGEM Minnesota. Biobricked crt I was sent to us by iGEM Edinburgh. These were sequenced and test digested to confirm insert size. The gel photo showing Eco/Pst digests of the constructs in pSB1A2 is below.
Next, we ligated crt B to E, and crt Y to I. E and I were cut with SpeI and Pst, while B and Y were cut with XbaI and PstI. To cap off the operon, we used the same strategy; to restrict and ligate the biobrick GFP (plus terminators and rbs) from BBa_E0240 onto the end of the operon - you can see the approximately 1000 bp size increase on the gel above. We also ligated the 1.5 kb frdBCD operon to this GFP in vitro, then PCR fished for the frdBCD plus GFP using a frdBCD fwd primer and VR primer. This PCR product was cut with XbaI and PstI and put onto the end of the CrtE,B,I,Y operon but was not thoroughly tested by October 29th.
The last cloning steps were to put promoters onto the constructs, test them for carotenoid production and GFP fluorescence. We definately didn't get a chance to test the operon with frdBCD in it, but crt"

In this way, new components can enter the original organelles and the time of occurrence can be regulated as it is inducer-mediated regulation. So it give our designs and functions more possibilities.
Figure. 5 Interaction of PYL and PP2C[7]
Two function sites
Now, we have artificially designed phase separation in cells and synthesized membraneless organelles. But how can we fulfill intended functions with synthetic organelles? Here, we propose two ideas. We reserve two sites to implement functions, which means function modules, such as enzymes in metabolism, proteins in signaling pathway, transcription factors in transcription and so on, have two sites in our designs.
1.
Direct integration into the skeleton
Just as we characterized synthetic organelles with fluorescent proteins, we can fuse function modules between the C-termini of the interaction modules and the N-termini of HOTags. Then, the function modules can be fused into S to implement intended functions.
Figure. 6 Integrate function modules to the skeleton
2.
Targeting GFP with nanobody
We introduced a specific protein, an anti-GFP nanobody, which is very small (only 13 kDa, 1.5nm-2.5nm) and has a high affinity (0.59 nM). It is a camelid antibody against GFP[8]. We can fuse GFP between the C-termini of the interaction modules and the N-termini of HOTags, and fuse function modules to the C-terminus of the anti-GFP nanobody. Then, with the help of the interaction between the anti-GFP nanobody and GFP, SPOT can load function modules, and targeted functions can be realized. You may ask: How does an anti-GFP nanobody improve the design? Firstly, it will not make the protein very large and will reduce its effect on the structure of the function modules, which can ensure the quality of the designed functions. Secondly, it can bring components not belonging to the original structure to synthetic organelles, which can extend their function. Thirdly, it is easy to regulate the expression of target proteins. Thus, nanobodies may have a surprise in store!
Figure. 7 Interaction of anti-GFP nanobody and GFP
Conclusion
We implemented phase separation in vivo and synthesized artificial membrane-less organelles. The main challenge in synthesizing an organelle is to implement phase separation in a cell, so we stress the importance of interactions and multivalence. For these two aspects, we offered our ideas and their"

This can be weighed against the reduction in food waste that is expected to flow from better control of ripening. However, full life-cycle assessments (LCA) should be carried out on various alternative versions of the product in order to minimize potential environmental costs.

Our memory-module will, upon activation and swift subsequent inactivation, excise a stop cassette from a portion of the population, according to the activity of the biosensor. The ratio of yeast cells with and without stop cassette will be a quantitative measure of the activity of the biosensor at the time of memory-module activation. Yeast cells without stop cassette will express a marker protein (GFP or Luciferase). The readout may occur at any point after the activation.
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks? Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?  The organisms we are working with are exceedingly well characterized and not known to pose danger to either humans or the environment. The same is true for the DNA fragments we use in our system. These organisms and recombinant DNA reagents are classified S1 according to the German Gene Technology Law (GenTG). Our experiments are performed under S1 conditions. These conditions include the usual safety features of wearing laboratory coats and rubber gloves, sterilizing waste, regularly disinfecting the workspace, etc. We have designed different BioBricks and none is found toxic or dangerous by any means. We re-used parts from 2013, which are also not toxic or dangerous. All of the parts we use are not known to have any harmful effect on humans or other organisms.
How would your project be used in the real world?
We do not intend any direct applications outside the laboratory. Any use as consumer products or in any small device is conceivable, but not intended.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
In a fully developed device neither the release into the environment, nor the contact with humans could be ruled out with 100% certainty. Such a device could implement a ""killswitch"" (to ensure that any cells released by accident would quickly and surely perish without access to required conditions that are only available in the laboratory). Also, the GMOs are held under physical barriers to the environment. A fully developed safety-approach would have to be part of any following project, concerning real world application of our foundational advance.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even"

Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
One of our goals is to help add to the available basic parts for using yeast as a chassis. For our project this year, we needed to make plasmids that contained multiple genes that used, but did not share, the same promoter. We had to use the terminators tEno2 ( BBa_K1829003 ) and tFba1 ( BBa_K1829004 ) to separate the end of one gene from the beginning of the next promoter. By using these terminators, we were able to make a plasmid that contained three different genes with three copies of the same promoter. All of the parts were submitted on the pSB1C3 backbone. Specific part details can be found on our iGEM parts registry page and our Parts Page.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"3 (KO11 with only GSH) gave better results with respect to both of the groups #1 and #2 by maintaining its cell mass stable. Group #4 (KO11                      with both FucO and GSH) gave the most promising measurement data as we hypothesized by continuing cellular growth (almost doubling cell mass) in the first 48 hours.
Second Assay:
For our second characterization, we followed more of qualitative evaluation to see the inhibitory zone of furfural. Firstly, we prepared a solution of furfural at                      a final concentration of 20 mM by diluting the stock solution with distilled H2O. Then, we soaked filter paper discs in that solution and placed them on LB agar                      plates hosting the four groups of our assay.
Figure 24: Image of the plates right after filter papers soaked in furfural (20 mM) were placed.
After 48 hours, we’ve observed a clear zone around the filter paper of the group containing KO11 un-engineered while others weren’t inhibited as much.
Figure 25: Plate having group KO11 un-engineered.
Figure 26 Plate having group KO11 with only FucO.
Figure 27: Plate having group KO11 with only GSH.
Figure 28: Plate having group KO11 with Bio-E.
Conclusion:
When the quantitative measurement data and qualitative phenotypic evaluation for all of our biochemical assays are considered, we can conclude that the groups containing KO11 un-engineered are the weakest ones against furfural toxicity; and neither the group of KO11 with only FucO nor the group with only GSH is resistant enough to continue cellular growth when furfural is present in the medium. Out of four groups, only the group containing KO11 with Bio-E (both FucO and GSH) can sustain its cellular growth and survive. Overall, we can infer that our best part design (Bio-E) was successful enough to combat the inhibitive effects of furfural, indicating trueness of our hypothesis.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Alphabrick_-_-_TEXT.html," set of accessible computational tools that enable the synthetic biologist to quickly and collaboratively design and test DNA circuitry.
Employing a lean methodology, we have identified the three key problems faced by the synthetic biology community. Currently, (1) the design of gene circuits is complex because collaboration between and within teams is difficult and thought processes are lost, (2) exchange of gene circuit parts is messy, as you have to individually track and hunt down the person who created it and (3) individuals have to have an advanced understanding of programming languages to use automated labs.
Our software platform solution, Alpha Brick, originated at the UK’s first 72-hour bio-hackathon at which it won first place.  AlphaBrick allows synthetic biologists to easily design, exchange and create DNA circuitry. The platform enables users to experience a quicker, traceable design process that ensures that decisions are recorded and that subsequent progress is accelerated. It provides a marketplace for lab designs by facilitating the buying and selling of gene circuit parts, making collaboration easier. The integration of the AlphaBrick platform with Transcriptic’s automated laboratories saves precious time and reduces the knowledge-barrier to using robotic labs. Our platform’s patent notification and parts combination recommendation, furthermore, address an unmet need of biotech industry that we identified through industry interviews.  We envisage that AlphaBrick will have a big impact on accelerating synthetic biology research and commercialisation.
The synthetic biology community of biohackers, academics, startups and established biotech companies who have these problems is growing quickly and the current tools available don’t address these concerns in an integrated way. There is space in this is $1.2 billion market for an easy to use tool that allows high share ability of gene circuitry. The platform will be commercialised such that users will be required to pay a monthly subscription fee at the average market rate for the platform’s premium features.
Our multidisciplinary team consists of developers, biologists and entrepreneurs and can be broadly stratified into product development and business development. The current team was formed at the Cambridge University Technology and Enterprise Club’s 2016 Bio hackathon. Our 4 co-founding members are working to establish AlphaBrick as an incorporated software company.
Working through the prestigious Accelerate Cambridge programme, we envisage that our alpha-version will be ready for distribution in January 2017 and that our final product will be ready for launch in June 2017. In order to ensure the progression of our venture, Alphabrick are looking to raise £20,000 in pre-seed from angel investors funding or non-dilutive funding by the start"

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

We also prepared a synthbio game composed of plasmid backbones with standard iGEM prefixes and suffixes surrounding elements such as (but not limited to) genes of interest. The players were asked to figure out the way of joining the biobricks into a new, longer biobrick using restriction enzymes and selection by antibiotic resistance. The players on their own initiative commented on the advantages of the biobrick format and a discussion on pros and cons of the standarised technique followed.
Finally, we presented our poster and received some feedback on our project.

Our App
As mobile phones are becoming increasing part of our lives, we thought that developing an app may be a great way to get more people more aware of synthetic biology. We have decided to create a game that works by getting users to create certain biobricks, where the gene of interest will only complete the biobrick if the plasmid backbone is cut with the correct restriction enzymes. We want to make it as user friendly as possible and we are hoping to integrate our project and iGEM into the app as well.

Results of Melanin transformation
Plate on the left is the melA plasmid plated on LB agar with 15ug/ml copper, 0.2ug/ul tyrosine and 100ug/ml Amp. The plate was incubated at 37 degrees for 24 hours and then left on the bench at room temperature over the weekend. Quicker induction of the melanin would be achieved by growing on plates containing IPTG. The relative concentrations of copper, tyrosine and IPTG could also be optimized.  Of particular note is the fact that the pigment appears to have diffused out of the colonies.
The plate on the right is the  control plate, containing untransformed TOP10 E. coli. These were the cells used for the transformation.  We will also need to do a second control experiment to show that pigmentation is due to the bacteria and not due to auto-oxidation of any of the supplements we added to the media.

In our project we want to use this system to specifically repair the mutation in a mRNA leading to the malfunction of a protein. The function of the protein is restored by inserting the missing bases and thus the patients symptoms disappear.
Next to the directed evolution of existing ribozymes in vitro selection methods
Bartel1993
were developed to select nucleic acids with new catalytic activities from a random pool. Catalytic RNA of versatile functions arose from these methods. For instance Seelig and Jäschke selected a diels alderase ribozyme catalyzing the Diels-Alder reaction leading to the formation of a carbon-carbon bond.
Seelig1999
Not only can in vitro selection methods be applied to reveal new catalytic RNA but also to select aptamers.

Aptamers
Figure 4. Theophylline Aptamer
Aptamers are RNA or DNA sequences that can selectively bind to a ligand or target. Scientists have selected a variety of aptamers for small molecules ranging from theophylline (Fig. 4A) being one of the first described aptamers
Jenison1994

Sassanfar1993
to an aptamer for the protein thrombin

Both catalytic nucleic acids and aptamers are as for today selected via systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enhancement

Bartel1993
also known as SELEX (Fig. 5). It is a very time consuming and expensive process. Many cycles of selection from a random pool of sequences have to be performed in order select the best candidates in each round. A variable starting pool of random sequences has to be prepared and after every cycle the candidates have to be mutated to further improve the binding to the target. All in all the process is rather inefficient. Probably this is the reason why there are still many small molecules and proteins for which no aptamer has been published yet.
It has been shown that selected aptamers can be used to make the catalytic activity dependent on the presence of a ligand.

Toronto,2018,Team:Toronto#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," a large variety of applications (one simply has to change α and β). One very promising application is the removal of pharmaceuticals, such as penicillin, from municipal waste-water. The reactor is viable for many different binding methods, strains of E. coli, and initial concentrations of waste, as displayed in §2.5. This reactor is independent of volume, all the parameters are relative to each other, this system would perform the same with 1 L of effluent as with 1 × 1010 L of effluent. Evidently, the size of the chambers would need to be scaled appropriately.
3. A Mechanistic Buoyancy Model: Maximum Carrying Capacity Determination
3.1 Goal
The buoyancy model has 2 main goals:
Estimate the mean buoyant force experienced by the genetically engineered E. coli biomass per unit mass as a result of gas vesicle formation from ARG1 over-expression. This effectively determines a mechanical upper bound for carrying capacity of the biomass.
Characterize and quantify flotation observations from wet lab experimentation. It is not well known what the role of some of the secondary gas vesicle proteins (GVPs) in the ARG1 construct is for gas vesicle formation, and being able to quantify flotation facilities comparison of different combinations of secondary GVPs for optimization of a gene construct specifically engineered for biomass flotation.
3.2 Mathematical Formulation
Concepts
Newtonian mechanics: $$\vec{F} = m\vec{a} \equiv m\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{v}}{\mathrm{t}}$$
F≡ vector sum of forces on body
m≡ mass of body
a≡ acceleration as a function of time
v≡ velocity as a function of time
Stokes-Einstein Drag: $$\vec{F_D} = -6\pi \eta R \vec{v}$$
FD≡drag force (note it opposes direction of velocity)
η≡viscosity of fluid medium
R≡(approximate) radius of body in spherical approximation.
Integrating factor method to solve first order linear ODE:
$$\label{ODE}             \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t}+f(t)y = g(t)$$
Equation 5.
Let μ(t) = eβt. Multiply both sides by μ(t).
Chain rule $$\implies \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\big(y(t)\mu(t)\big) = h(t)\mu(t)$$"

    We designed a “smell game” to get the public involved throughout the whole summer. We prepared different concentrations of 2-PE (1mmol/L, 3mmol/L, 5mmol/L, 10mmol/L, 15mmol/L, 20mmol/L) in unknown tubes to let people smell and evaluate about their feelings. The game was launched during our school’s 110th anniversary, public activities and some other special times. More than 200 people have participated in our “smell game”, they are of different ages and the ratio of women and men is quite. After analyzing the feedback, we found 2-PE above 15mmol/L is not very pleasant, while which of 5mmol/L and 10mmol/L is more popular. 5mmol/L of 2-PE is most acceptable for the most people.
    Based on the result of our “smell game”, we improved our experiment to achieve 5mmol/L yield of 2-PE. The first figure shows our initial 2-PE yield, and the optimized 2-pe yield is shown in the second figure.(More details on our Results page)
Safety
    Biosafety is of great significance, and we must put it into consideration. Thought teams under the environment track focus on different issues, we are all faced with the limited application scenarios and public concerns, which pose barriers for the practical use of projects. We collaborated with ECUST to propose “Three Plus Net”, which include three parts, “Application+”, “Biosafety+”, “Society+” and can be an example for other teams under the environment. Firstly we hope to better translate the results into practical applications and bring greater social value. And then is to make a general guide to universal issues, so that people can use it to supplement topics and improve the subject. The third is to get the public's view on using engineering bacteria for environmental restoration.
    ECUST is the main responsible school in the “3+ Net”, and we are mainly responsible for “Biosafety+”. In scientific methods, we always cite some simple means to guarantee safety of our project, such as designing suicide switches, knocking out resistance genes, genome integration, visualization of genetically engineered bacteria, hardware design, network monitoring, and so on. We have made a summary of the current common suicide switches for different types of environmental conditions, which can give reference and convenience to other teams under the environment.

Fiscal management : David and Joshy have agreed to try and set up a preliminary budget plan.
Logo: Stefani will design our first logo.
Wikipedia: Joshy agreed to handle our wikipedia for the time being.
Music video: Verena has big plans for a laboratory-themed song and corresponding music video.
Website: we still need someone who either knows a bit about website design or wants to learn how
to set up a web site. We can use the old site as template, but we still need to convert/cannibalise it
into our own. Please mail Verena or me if you would like to try your hand as a web designer.
4.) Dismissing members
We are a comparatively small group with an ambitious project and a limited number of members. The coming months are very important, since this decides     pretty much how easy we will have it later in the year. We currently have registered everybody who either mailed Verena or Julian or came to one of our     meetings and are currently at 10 members total, 12 being the limit. If we get to the limit,we have to put people on the waiting list. Since we are a small     group with an ambitious project, having someone in the group who doesn't bother to cancel to agreed appointments or, worse, won't do work she/he agreed on     doing, would not only unnecessary aggravate the rest of the group but would also slow us down.
Therefore, with the coming meeting, we will introduce a three strike system. If you can't come to a meeting, that's no problem - just tell someone who will     attend in advance or post it on facebook. If you don't do so three times, you will be excluded from the iGEM group.
If someone keeps making trouble within the group, the organisation team reserves the right to vote on excluding them.

We intend to utilise a scaffold protein in order to assemble enzymes with different functions into one complex, which will hopefully increase their     efficiency as well as being customisable.
As model organisms B.subtilis or E.coli seem to be to most viable at this point
Issues may arise from the connection of linker regions to the enzymes and the subsequent loss of function.

Their results demonstrate that recently reported declines in several taxa such as butterflies, wild bees and moths, are in parallel with a severe loss of total aerial insect biomass, suggesting that it is not only the vulnerable species but the flying insect community as a whole, that has been decimated over the last few decades.2
Beekeepers also spoke about the current contamination that exists in honey, the main problems are antibiotics, sulfonamides are still used in many parts of the country. The mentioned honey that is not exported is because it is contaminated with antibiotics. Another issue Mexican beekeepers are facing are transgenic crops, there is the presence of transgenic pollen in bees' honey. In 2009 Germany banned MON810 maize from cultivation for agricultural purposes, even though the EU has approved it for release into the environment.3Harmless honey for exportation to Germany is not allowed to have presence of MON810 maize which is cultivated here in Mexico.
In the forum, we had the opportunity to speak with diverse beekeeping companies, Api ofertas, APIMAT, X-nox Inovación and Salcido apiarios, who showed us some of their beekeeping products and also treatments they market for managing Varroa. We participated in a raffle organized by Api Ofertas and we are so excited we won a Beekeeper suit we will show it to our iGEM friends in Boston!
On the first day of the forum, the Delicia’s beekeeping association invited us to join them in a dinner, at this dinner we spoke with Mr. Rodolfo Contreras Martínez and Mr. Rodolfo Contreras Lozano, two beekeepers from Chile owners of San Martín Apiaries. We spoke about pollination, the
different types of honey and their exportation. We especially thank Delicias' beekeeping society for their hospitality by offering us to stay the night in the hotel Los Cedros at Delicias city where other guests of the forum were also staying.
We were the closure presentation of the event. Juan Carlos Coronado, a Chilean beekeeper we met at the forum, invited us to visit his apiaries. In general, beekeepers told us we were doing impressive research and saw huge potential in our work as a real solution for the foulbrood problem as well as a possible treatment for Nosema and Varroa. Other presentations at the forum included topics such as pollination, neonicotinoids in Beekeeping, the honey market, between others.

The original model of DNA recombination by integrase
At the beginning of our dry lab work, we use a simple model to describe the main process of the integrase recombination. (figure1.1)
Figure 1.1 | “PB” is the attP and attB sites of DNA, and “LR” is the recombination product, attL and attR sites, which are direction-changed, of the DNA. PBI is the complex of DNA and 4 integrase molecule. LRI1 and LRI2 are two kinds of complex which are conformationally distinct from PBI. The “single arrow” represents the reaction which can reach rapid equilibrium with the equilibrium constant over it. The “double arrow” represents the slow reaction with the reaction rate constant over and below it. “K(bI)” is the equilibrium constant. “k(+r), “k(-r)”, “k(+syn)”, “k(-syn)” is the reaction rate constant. The site direction change occur in the second reaction: “PBI” to “LRI(1)”.
Previous researches have shown that the combination and dissociation process between DNA and the integrase can be very fast. Therefore, we assume that rapid equilibrium can be reached in the first and forth step in our model. Both of the reaction share the same equilibrium constant, KbI. [1]
Thus, we are able to describe the whole process above with four equations.
The original model composed of all the functions above can perfectly predict the recombination reaction in vitro[1], where the concentration of integrase is considered to be constant, because the concentration of integrase required for efficient recombination is much higher than the one of the DNA substrate. The simulation results are shown here. (figure1.2)
Figure 1.2 | It separately describes how the proportion of substrate “PB” and product “LR” in total DNA varies within 10 hours. The red line represents the concentration proportion of the product, “LR”. More calculation details about this graph are attached to the back.
As the graph shows, the transformation rate can reach almost 80 percent in general.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," use lower water temperatures in their growth tanks. We encountered and talked to Serdar, CEO of PureSpinach, who gave us insight on farming and monitoring of his products. He was especially concerned with the temperature of his system, which needs to be carefully regulated in order to keep the spinach growing. He also emphasized the necessity for large-scale testing to ensure the validity of our findings.
Businesses
Overview
We contacted vendors and distributors of hydroponic supplies who gave us insight into the viability and practicality of our device. They informed us on how large-scale hydroponic farms are laid-out and operated on a daily basis. These “big picture” contacts inspired the software integration of our biological and hardware parts of our project. Their insight helped us design a sleek, streamlined and consumer friendly-product adapted for all hydroponic growing conditions.
Key Takeaways
Businesses put an emphasis on minimizing and reducing waste in hydroponic growing.
Growers would invest in better equipment if there is a large return value even with high upfront costs.
Data is key. Businesses and growers would like to see live data from their hydroponic tanks not only for growth monitoring, but to streamline expensive documentation and certification processes. The interface should be easy to use, interactive, and informative. We responded to this feedback by developing a user-friendly software to integrate with OxyPonics hardware and and biological components.The dashboard features real-time analytics of key environmental markers such as pH, conductivity, and of course oxidative stress levels. More information on the user interface can be found in our applied design section.

Vertical Harvest
Vertical Harvest Hydroponics, based in Alaska, is a veteran-owned agricultural technology company aimed at providing innovative farming solutions around the world. Vertical Harvest recently rolled out the 4th generation of their product, a hydroponic farm in a box, geared towards northern climates. We spoke to Cameron Willingham, the founder of Vertical Harvest, who provided us with insight on the business aspect of hydroponics and the technical aspect of building a reliable, low maintenance hydroponics system. Specifically, they wanted to make their designs simple, hardy, and robust to ensure self sufficiency and versatility of their hydroponic systems.Their products and comments reminded us that our product needed a sleek and hassle-free profile. This was a big emphasis as we designed our user interface, where we incorporated graphs and visually uncluttered representations of the analytics from the hydroponic farm, but also longer in depth reports if more analysis was desired.

Prof. Urs Jenal Head of the research group for microbiology at the Biozentrum Basel Prof. Urs Jenal’s research addresses basic molecular principles of bacterial signal transduction. His in-depth knowledge about microbiology helped us building the foundation of our project, which focuses on the bacterial                     chemotaxis pathway. We gained a lot of insight and received valuable advice about the chemotactic signal processing in bacteria.

Dr. Hannes Link Research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Marburg Hannes works on engineering allosteric enzymes for biotechnology. We consulted him and pitched our project idea of visualizing transcription factor binding to DNA. He confirmed that our system could in theory work and suggested                     to test various amino acid linkers. Based on this advice, we designed our approach in a modular manner with different amino acid linkers consisting of mixtures of flexible and rigid repeats.
Imaging
Dr. Laurence Wilson Lecturer in biophysics at the University of York Dr. Laurence Wilson as well as the York iGEM team of 2017 provided us advice on our lensless microscopy setup. They advised us to go for a monochromatic light source and pointed out that for resolving extremely small object with                     very little contrast (like E.coli) an additional magnification might be necessary.
