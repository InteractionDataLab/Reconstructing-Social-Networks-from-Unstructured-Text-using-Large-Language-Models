March
We built up a team and tried our best to negotiate with professors to get academic supports and financial sponsor. Well, the situation was not optimistic. Most professors’ worktable had already been loaded even in summer vacation and they doubted our capability to fulfill our experiment in time. Even though we just managed to have the registration done and were very excited to become an iGEMer for the first time. Also, it was spring.
April
We deeply studied on the two proposals put forward in March. One is ‘bacteria death countdown’, which aims to give a precise limit on the generation of the propagating E. coli, by altering the rate of the expression of the codon modified toxin; Another is the ‘nisin producting yeast’ which could be used in fermentation. However, we gived up them as there were problems in generation counting and expression system in yeast used to"

Having met with the IndieBio teams and hearing about some of their previous IGEM experiences, we were interested in seeing if there is a correlation between iGEM and the creation of start-up companies.
We sent out surveys to the start-ups in this year’s accelerator programme. A total of 11 start-ups replied to our survey. The start-ups were Moirai Biodesign, Benthic labs, GlowDX, Saphium Biotechnology GmbH, Ageria, Briefcase Biotech GmbH, Magenta Biolabs, CRI, Spira, Hyasynth Bio and MilisBio.
One of our initial questions was “What is the educational/ professional backgrounds of your co-founders?” The answers for this were mixed but the majority of the co-founders were from a life-science educational background.
We subsequently were interested in knowing if any of the co-founders had previously been involved in iGEM in any capacity. Almost half of the co-founders had (see below).
There appeared to be a mixed response to the next question which asked on a scale of 1(very valuable) -5(not at all) how valuable iGEM is for the creation of biotechnology start-ups.
Some of the respondents felt iGEM was valuable and led to the creation of their companies. Others however didn’t think it was as valuable
We then focused on investigating to what extent they had known about iGEM prior to IndieBio.
.
Over 54% of the respondents were either highly influenced or very aware of iGEM prior to entering the startup accelerator. This may seem to contradict the previous question since 45% of respondents have answered that they were highly influenced by iGEM whereas in the previous question 0% of respondents felt that iGEM was highly valuable for the creation of start-ups. This discrepancy may be due to wording of the questions as the previous question may have been interpreted as the projects coming directly from iGEM projects whereas here the startup’s idea may have been influenced by iGEM or the co-founders met at iGEM.
We are also interested in the correlation of the creation of start-ups and the DIY Bio movement. There appears to be significant overlap between the two from the results.
Several of the startups responded with the name of the DIY Bio lab they were involved in or previously helped start up.
Our last quantitative question inquired to what extent the co-founders were aware of the DIY Bio movement prior to IndieBio.
There again appeared to be a strong link between the creation of startups and the DIY Bio"

On veut donc approfondir sur le fait que certaines organismes, des unicellulaires tant que des multicellulaires, possèdent déjà des formes de photo-communication assez primitives. En plus, avec nos constructions l'information sera changée de strate (chimique à photonique et vice versa) à l'intérieur des cellules. En conséquence, les membranes qu'une fois étaient des barrières à la communication, seront transformées en isolants de bruit de fond. Avec le découplage du messager et du strate chimique, on rend possible tout un univers d'usages auparavant impossibles. On imagine des applications en neurobiologie, en couplage cybernétique, et même en télécommunications biologiques.
La Réception
On se propose l'utilisation des domaines semblables à ceux des phytochromes chez les plantes, mais cette fois-ci chez les cyanobacteries. Ce cyanobacteriochrome sera couplé a une domaine kinase de EnvZ pour détecter de la lumière rouge, et alors déclencher une réponse chimique qui puisse être reconnue par la cellule, c'est-à-dire du OmpR phosphorilé. Ce système à été conçu comme Coliroid par l'équipe iGEM 2004 de l'Université de Texas en Austin, et l'UCSF. Cependant, ce système possède la fonction d'une porte logique <IF ! LIGTH>, tandis que nous voulons une porte du type <IF LIGHT>. On travail encore en ce petit problème...
Notre deuxième système capteur sera fondé sur une autre parte BioBrick: LOVtap . Ce facteur de transcription dimerize lorsqu'il reçoit de la lumière bleue. Il démarre donc la transcription des gènes contenus après un certain promoteur.
Le troisième système de réception reposera sur un système semblable à celui du EnvZ-OmpR. Ce nouveau dispositif utilise une protéine sensible à la lumière, appelée CcaS, qui possède de l'activité kinase lorsqu'elle reçoit de la lumière verte. En conséquence, un facteur de transcription appelé CcaR est phosphorilé. On constate alors la transcription des gènes en dessous du promoteur associ"

PCR of Magnesium riboswitch vector fragment B and Magnesium promoter
Riboswitch and promoter gel. Lanes 2+3: Fragment B without 8 codon substitution, lanes 4+5: Fragment B with 8 codon substitution, lanes 6+7: magnesium sensitive promoter, lane 8: +ve control
Normal PCR settings used, annealing temperature 57 °C, elongation step 90s long.
Lane 5 accidentally loaded with a DNA ladder instead of loading dye.
Expected fragment sizes:
Lane 2-5: 3kbp
Lane 6-7: 300bp
After electrophoresis, found vector products had, for the most part, worked. Promoter elements were not amplified - no band of the expected size was observed.
Positive control also failed, although this has ceased to work for several days, potentially due to DNA degradation.

Experiment 4
Procedure
In this aerobic experiment, we add increasing concentrations of ammonium NH4+ to transformed E. coli cells growing aerobically, in order to test whether our AMO transformant is converting ammonium to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) .  The same protocol is used to measure whether our HAO transformant is converting hydroxylamine to nitrite NO2-.
The bottle is placed to a magnetic stirrer on 270 rpm and 37oC.
The AMO experiment will need the following:
AMO E. coli transformant (duplicate)
Control: Untransformed E. coli.
Control: Nitrosomonas at 26 oC
Control: Abiotic
We expect the AMO transformant to use ammonium more quickly than the untransformed control, and Nitrosomonas to also use ammonia.
The HAO experiment will need the following:
HAO E. coli transformant (duplicate)
Control: Untransformed E. coli.
Control: Nitrosomonas at 26 oC
Control: Abiotic
We expect the HAO transformant and Nitrosomonas to consume hydroxylamine and produce nitrite, and the untransformed E. coli will not.
There will be 10 experimental flasks:
E. coli cultures will be grown at 37 oC in the incubator and
Nitrosomonas Europaea at 26 oC
EQUIPMENT NEEDED
4 erlyenmeyer flasks for growing cultures
1 hot plate and magnet stirrer
Syringe filters with pore size 0.2μm
Stopwatch.
Ammonium Chloride (NH4Cl)
Modified DM minimal medium
E. coli overnight culture
Nitrosomonas overnight culture

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Internal_-_-_TEXT.html," 2009 measured the pLux promoter relative to pCI, which allows us to calculate the PoPS for pCI: $\frac{1}{0.43} {\cdot} 0.00169=0.0394$ PoPS. They also measured pPen from which we are able to calculate the PoPS: $0.3106 {\cdot} 0.0394=0.01224$.
These values all depend on measuring activities and since the strains, media and antibiotic markers won’t be completely the same, the real values will diverge from the values found with these simple calculations. Nevertheless, these values can give us an idea about the relative strength of the different promoters. We could measure the real values of mRNA concentration in our cells by executing a qPCR, but for now we will use the found values for our model. Another important parameter for transcription is the copy number in which the genes are present in the cell. The plasmid that incorporates the genes, has an ORI with a copy number between 100 and 300. In our model we will use a mean copy number of 200.
Inducable promoters
For inducable promoters the maximum transcription rate has to be multiplied with a factor to integrate the effect of the transcription factors. Our system includes two types of DNA binding proteins: repressors and activators. These proteins bind certain regions in the promoter region of the DNA and can either repress or activate the promoter activity, affecting transcription rate. The repressor proteins used in our system are the cI protein of the lambda phage and the PenI protein. The activator protein is LuxR, which has to be activated with AHL. The proteins first need to form dimers before they are able to bind their target DNA.
DNA binding will be simulated using the Hill function : ${\theta} = \frac{{[L]}^n}{{K_d}^n + [L]^n} = \frac{1}{1+(\frac{K_{d}}{[L]})^{n}}$. $\theta$ is the amount of DNA bound by the protein, $L$ is the amount of protein, $K_d$ is the dissociation constant and $n$ is the Hill coefficient [3] . This Hill function has values between 0 and 1 and acts like an ON/OFF switch.
For the repressors, we are interested in how much of the DNA is still unbound and active: $\frac{1}{1 + ({\frac{[Repressor]}{K_{d}}})^{n"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#QuorumSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," measure the population-wide response in mRFP activity. Of course, subpopulations could only really be observed when fluorescence is assessed for individual cells. To this end we performed fluorescence microscopy on colonies B6, C10, E11 and H9, comparing samples grown in LB (with selection antibiotics) with L-Arabinose to samples where we also added D-Glucose. In an effort to visualize the number of cells that show fluorescence among the other cells, we chose to make pictures where the cells were exposed to mRFP excitation with laser light, but also to low levels of white-light. Pictures were taken after 10m and 4h20m after glucose addition. From the investigated sample, clone H9 seemed to give more mRFP producing cells after glucose addition, but this difference is already seen after 10m, a time too short to allow for the envisioned mechanism to change protein levels. Therefore we have little faith in the validity of these preliminary results.
Figure x. Fluorescence microscopy ‘overlay’ images 4.5 hours after glucose addition. Shown is fluorescence imaging of microscopy slides covered with a cover glass.
Attempted to measure the subpopulations with flow cytometry in Leiden with Paul van Heusden, Assistant professor Institute of Biology, Leiden. Unfortunately we were unable to differentiated between medium only and bacteria grown in medium, even using other E. coli samples present in the laboratory in Leiden. They have no experience using flow cytometry on bacteria, but are experienced in analysis of yeasts. We thank Paul van Heusden for his effort and time.
Quorum sensing 1 plasmid system construction and testing
Digested BBa_K1913005 in pSB4K5 with EcoRI-HF and PStI-HF and used the same enzymes to digest pSB1C3. Used NEB enzymes and protocol. Purified digestion with Zymo kit for DNA purification. Ligated with T4 according to NEB protocol. Again purified using Zymo kit. Belwina transformed (2 days later) the mixture to NEB chemically competent cells according to the NEB protocol and plated on Cm agar plates.
Four green colonies from the transformation plates were used to test the functioning of the plasmid in an overnight plate reader experiment: results show in ‘population dynamics’ section of the wetlab results. The results indicated that 3 of the 4 colonies showed the expected response to population density. After sequence confirmation of the insert, we submitted a plasmid isolation of 1 colony to the registry ("

For our team, keeping in touch with experts is essential for the diffusion of synthetic biology and for receiving feedback of the project, that's why we contacted ANMVEA, A.C., the most important Mexican association. We showed them this year´s project and they completely loved it. They were amazed at our engagement and commitment to bees.
One day while we were discussing the project, they mentioned that they were very happy because we were working with bees, this due to the lack of research for beekeeping. The secretary of ANMVEA, A.C., MVZ Ernesto Tanus Sánchez, explained that this area needed a lot of research because beekeepers nowadays were 50+ years old and most of them were not related to science. They said that they needed young minds working to solve beekeeping problems and people who stayed updated with situations related to bees. ANMVEA, A.C. is concerned about the future of beekeeping. As well, they are aware of all the diseases and beekeeping issues that could be solved using new scientific techniques, such as synthetic biology.
As  we  mentioned  before,  almost  no  beekeeper  is  acquainted  with  synthetic  biology  or  science  in  general.
That's why iGEM Tec Chihuahua is looking forward to introducing the synthetic biology topic to professionals in this field. As well, we want to invite and inspire international beekeeping experts to relate to this newly emerging field of synthetic biology. To achieve this, we received an invitation from this national association to the XXVI International Apicola Update Congress 2019 from ANMVEA, A.C. to present this new science branch and our project in next year´s congress.
With an event of such major, we want to spread knowledge and to dialog with people who may have doubts about the science. Therefore, we will be attending to the next year's invitation to the ExpoChihuahua Convention Center on May 22nd to generate knowledge and acceptance in people outside the lab.
We hope not only to spread knowledge but to get to know what people thinks about synthetic biology and the techniques it is using to try to contribute something good to the environment. We want to keep going with this project that’s why we look to keep engaging the community even when the Giant Jamboree has already taken place.
By assisting, we expect to learn more about bees and to implement everything international experts teach us to enhance our project and our social panorama with the rest of the community.
Here we annex the invitation ANMVEA, A.C."

The Oilsands Leadership Initiative - OSLI
The Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI) is a collaborative network  of oil sands companies (ConocoPhillips Canada, Nexen, Shell, Statoil, Suncor Energy, and Total E&P).  As a collective these companies have come together to improve the oil sands industry's reputation by demonstrating and communicating environmental, social and economic performance and technological advancements.  OSLI's vision is to achieve world-class environmental, social and economic performance in developing this world-scale oil sands resource in Northern Alberta. In addressing oil sands challenges, they have divided their project work into the areas of land stewardship, water management, technology breakthrough and sustainable communities.
OSLI has funded iGEM projects which pertain to the oil and gas sector for several years and have greatly supported the growth of synthetic biology in Canada and abroad.  As a sponsor of"

Ran a gel of the PCR reactions.  1% agarose.  Loaded 10 uL of each reaction and 2-log NEB  ladder.
500bp product for the + control reaction, as expected
Got a 1.5 kB product from the GalKO reaction- this looks to be correct.  There is also a faint band at ~4kb.  This is likely template- perhaps I'll use less next time.
No products were visible in the - CTRL or TEF reactions.
Thinking about trobleshooting the TEF reaction- maybe the template is wrong?  I'd like to try using our primers in a whole cell reaction with W303 yeast.  It should pull the TEF promoter out of the genome if the primers are correct.  Also, I found a paper detailing their generation of variants of the TEF1 promoter using error-prone PCR.  They list their primers- perhaps we could use those instead.

Streaked out plates of W303a and W303alpha from plate & gly stock to try out the GalKO and to use as template for the pTEF PCR reaction.

This pair has already been reported to be orthogonal in E. coli and was mutated for the use with other ncAAs. By computational analysis and comparison to the E. coli leucyl tRNA/synthetase pair which has been changed to DMNBS affinity, amino acids in the binding pocket were identified. These needed to be mutated to achieve DMNBS specificity in the Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl tRNA/synthetase pair. We were lucky that the synthetase backbone was not affected by the size of the ncAA. The other mutation sites were determined with respect to chemical properties, space for the photoprotection group and codon usage of E. coli.

Sensitivity and Robustness
We've tested whether pattern forms or not if we change the parameters, and what parameters would exert effects on the formation. Here are the details:
There are two points of view in sensitivity; local or global. This classification was suggested by iGEM Waterloo 2014 team. Local sensitivity is a test about how the result turns by changing only one parameter. Global one sees the same thing by changing various parameters. We've done the two tests and examined what parameter sets would satisfy the conditions of Turing Pattern.
case 2
We observed strong polarization along the eigenvalue gets bigger or smaller. Polarization of 50 of those, which have small eigenvalue was not so stronger than previous examination. The more eigenvalue get bigger, the more strong polarization occurs. In other words, it can be said that something which makes eigenvalue bigger exists in the place where alpha's max and beta's minimum. The max place where each parameters take would be the boundary line of whether pattern is formed or not. If the parameter go beyond the boundary line, parameter sets couldn't have stable point or could not be stable, because of no occurrence of diffusion. Thus, we believe there would be trade-off between size of eigenvalue and robustness. We analyzed the stability of the random numbers around the parameter (parameter*0.5~parameter*1.5) and examined if there was deviation of distribution when pattern formed. The distribution should be linearly condition if there was no deviation. Second, we simulated Turing pattern numerically. in two dimension, and saw if it forms a pattern. See this figure.
Here,  you can see pattern is formed.
System2
Another system
Here, we explain the ""third"" model. This is similar to the colicin-using model. There is some difference. The third strategy is inspired by the pattern formation mechanism of zebrafish[1]. Two types of E. coli (activator and inhibitor) react to each other in two manners according to the distance between them. When E. coli (activator) and E. coli (inhibitor) are close, they inhibit each other in the same manner as in the conventional system. This control loop functions as local activation. In addition, E. coli (activator) activates E. coli (inhibitor) through AHL in long distance (detailed scheme is explained in the chapter of System).  The control loop composed of"

The reason why I joined the team was that biology is so mysterious and fancy for an outsider like me, and I wish one day I may be able to untangle some of the fascinating enigmas of living creatures.  Well, it is a bliss that we are living in such a wonderful world with so many lovely people caring about each other. We are so young and have the hearts to live what seemed impossible and challenging. As long as we have enough courage and wit, we are the ones who can make a change!

Indeed, in the  course of this competition we will have to  leverage our creativity, our passion for science and our team  spirit.

Master 1, Theoretical Physics, Paris Diderot University
As a Physics student my curiosity and enthusiasm towards life  sciences has been the driving force to undertake a research  internship in an Israeli laboratory of modern theoretical  Biophysics. There, I learned that Biology is an inexhaustible source of  functions and systems which identification, recombination and  adaption will help to better understand life, and open a new era  of original and fruitful technologies. Synthetic Biology and iGEM  are the best way to implement this teaching. The numerous  testimonies of former iGEM participants evoking an invaluable  personal gain as much on social, organizational and  psychological dimensions, convinced me of my interest to join  the Paris iGEM team.

To assume our  capabilities and know how to cooperate? Take pleasure by  advancing? That are the questions that I would like to meet and  answer through my participation in iGEM! I want to test my  own limits in a group that strives for excellence through powerful  synergies. iGEM is probably the missing link that connects  youth and dynamism to the particular world of research.

Visit to Biocon's R&D Facility
Near the end of June, we were planning on using gas vesicles to simplify recombinant protein purification. To understand this problem better — and direct our project focus toward solving it — we visited Biocon, India's largest pharmaceutical company.
Biocon's R&D park, located in Bangalore, hosted four members of our team who toured the facility and spoke to the Manager of the R&D division to understand how industrial recombinant protein synthesis works. Topics discussed ranged widely, from the choice of expression system — E. coli, Pichia pastoris, CHO cells — to the choice of growth medium for the microbes.
Durjay, Rajas and Bhaskar outside Biocon's R&D facility
The most important takeaway from this industrial visit was the importance of scale: any novel idea that functions perfectly in a lab need not work even passably on an industrial scale! This visit to Biocon sparked our interest in industrial processes, leading to a more fruitful collaboration with industry that turned our project in an entirely different direction...

He also gave advice on yeast strains, plasmids, and designing the genome integration of the transporters.
Pezhman Mohammadi (Aalto University) was the go-to person whenever we faced problems with protein work, be it in the practical work or designing the experiment. He gave us useful advice on protein purification and helped choose parameters for FPLC. He advised us on homology modeling, codon optimization for the enzyme production, and also helped order the enzyme constructs.
Georg Schmidt (Aalto University) has answered our questions relating to DNA constructs design, and was the go-to person for any questions on cloning. He also helped us with PCR troubleshooting and advised on things to take into account with our microplate reader assay.
Dominik Mojzita (VTT) gave us advice related to stress reactions and yeast strain choices. He provided valuable input on yeast stress response, choice of linkers, enzyme activity controls, and also suggested the use of FACS.
Mari Piirainen (Aalto University) helped us with practical problems related to yeast, and also taught us how to use FACS.
Anssi Rantasalo (VTT) helped us with designing our transporter constructs and gave general advice on FACS and analyzing the results.
Merja Oja (VTT) introduced us to the field of modelling and helped give direction to our modellers.
Ion Petre (Åbo Akademi) oriented us further into modelling and provided us with helpful example programs and models for our project.
Sami Havukainen (Aalto University) gave valuable advice us on choice of yeast strain and cloning, especially with Gibson assembly.
Filip Mollerup (Aalto University) gave input on ideas for scaling up enzyme production when we were developing our project idea, and later on in the project suggested ways to improve enzyme purification.
Salla Virtanen (Aalto University) showed how to use the microplate reader and gave advice on setting up our microplate reader fluorescence assay.

Basic Description
The Database part is designated to build up the bridge combining the abstract parameters yielded by the System Identification process and the concrete needs from users via SBML. Therefore, corresponding to its transitive role here, the inputs and outputs of this part is similarity characterized.
The Functions
1.Filter all matching reactions from the database via matching suitable parameters of all terms of the ODE array, provided by preceding GA and PSO part;
2.Yield a complete list of substances contained in these reactions;
3.Sort reactions by reaction type, reactant/product’s type or number;
4.Make it possible for users to expand the database in directed form.
Abstract and approximation
1.All bio-chemical reactions on the genetic level are characterized in a finite set of reaction types, specifically as listed in the following figure;
2.Each term of the ODE can be mapped to part of a prototype of reactions (including all info from reactants and partial info from products);
3.Space-independent and Compartment-independent.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#pneumosensor#modules_-_-_TEXT.html," by the secretion of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), which is a 17-     residue long pheromone that is species-specific. Our team aims to adopt the specific CSP sensing mechanism of S. pneumoniae to detect its populations.
The mechanism we adopted is controlled by a two-component regulatory system (TCS), which consists of the histidine kinase (HK) ComD and its      cognate response regulator (RR) ComE ( BBa_K1379051 ).  When CSP binds to it, ComD autophosphorylates to become phospho-ComD, ComD~P; at the expenditure of ATP.      The cytosolic protein ComE is then phosphorylated by ComD~P through transphosphorylation reactions, producing ComE~P. Genes coding for ComD and ComE are constitutively      expressed in our Pneumosensor.
ComE~P binds to repeat sites adjacent to the comCDE and comAB operons (Ween et al., 1999), creating a positive      feedback loop, producing both pre-CSP and its required machinery for maturation and transport. The signal is thus amplified and competence is      coordinated throughout the population.
As part of our detection circuit design, we make use of the inducible promoter from the comCDE operon, PcomCDE. We obtain the sequence by oligos,      and will characterize it using green fluorescence protein (GFP) that we constructed the downstream of the promoter by BioBrick RFC10. Rather than using ComE~P that has to     be phosphorylated by ComD~P, which involves a chain of reactions, we use a phosphorylmimetic ComE mutant, ComED58E, kindly     shared with us by Bernard Martin et al. After characterization of PcomCDE, we hope to put PcomCDE together with the S. pneumoniae σx promoters module, for the ultimate goal of creating a tightly regulated automatic detection of S. pneumoniae.
S. pneumoniae σx promoters Module Description
σx - Com-Box mechanism
Figure 1. σx-Com-Box promoter mechanism
The reporter system contains a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for Com-Box promoter induction. σx will then bind to Com-Box promoter and express green fluorescence protein. The whole construct was built in E. coli DH10B strain.
In order to achieve the functionality of pneumosensor, we must have a highly specific reporting system which will only give fluorescent signal under"

Scalability
We can transform AND gate into OR gate through a flip of the sequence between opposite loxP sites. Moreover, based on a similar idea, our system shows a strong scalability in further design. AND / OR Transformation is a typical pattern of two-input programmable logic devices. There are 16 kinds of two-input logical relations in all, as the table below shows.
Yi and Yi’ (i=0⋯7) stand for 8 logical relations seperately. For example, y1 stands for OR gate and y1’ stands for NOR gate. Pay attentions to the truth table. Y0(Y0’) shows that the output is always 0(1),which stands for a zero-input logical relation. Y6(Y6’) and Y7(Y7’) stand for one-input logical relation, which can be realized easily. Therefore, only the other 10 kinds of logical relations are real two-input logic which we really care about. Thus, we build a flip system with three modules. Flip Module 1: It’s same with our core module, which can help us choose whether we want a AND logic or an OR logic. For example, we can transform AND gate(Y4) to OR gate(Y1) by this module.
Flip Module 2: With the help of this module, we can transform A to A’ in our logic. For example, as the figure below shows, we use Y as our output, now Y = A’B(Y2), and we will get AB if we flip the Flip Module 2, then Y will be AB(Y4).
Flip Module 3: Using this module, we will be able to get XNOR gate(Y5) because it will help us start another circuit, as the figure below shows. For example, once the Flip Module 3 is activated, the expression of Y will be under the control of the promoter in this sequence. Combining it with the sequence above, Y will be expressed once A"

Part 1: The Construction of the Worker System
Step 1: Gene Cloning
To find the optimal temperature for oprF and cynRTS composite amplification, we set a gradient of annealing temperature. The result shows that 58℃ is suitable to this PCR. The PCR product was stored in -20℃. The PCR reaction system was listed in table 1-1.

Step 2: Optimization of oprF
We choose the 188aa or 196aa of OprF as the CBP fusion points. Primers were designed (Table1-2) to clone the target fragment, and then the GS linker and/or the gene fragment coding CBP were added at the C-terminal of the target fragment.
The protein with GS linker, using the 188aa as CBP fusion point, was named as OprF-1. While the protein without GS linker, using the 196aa as CBP fusion point, was named as OprF-2.

Example:
java -jar DoubleOptimizer.jar seq.test codons.txt -S121 -E1853 -R1000 -D100
-D##
This option will make the program periodically display the current best sequence, and associated statistics, as it runs. The number given is the number of optoimization cycles the program will perform between each round of displaying the sequence. This provides a continuous measure of progress on long optimization runs. Note that, when given 10 seconds, the program may execute several thousand cycles of optimization, so an argument on the order of 100 may be reasonable.
Example:
java -jar DoubleOptimizer.jar seq.test codons.txt -S121 -E1853 -R1000 -D100
-R##
This option will make the program halt optimization after a certain number of optimization cycles. This may be used with a large value of -T to standardize optimization quality between computers of different speeds. Because this option is mostly only useful for testing the efficiency of this program itself, it may be removed from future releases.
Example:
java -jar DoubleOptimizer.jar seq.test codons.txt -S121 -E1853 -T1000 -R1000
Examples of Use
As an example of the normal operation of the program on an amino acid sequence, consider the above-listed example of a repetitive amino acid sequence, hypothetical protein X777_06170 from the ant species Cerapachys biroi. At one point in our waterproofing project, this protein was considered for sythesis as a possible homologue of the waterproofing Polistes protein. DoubleOptimizer was originally written to overcome difficulties in synthesising this protein for expression in E. coli. (Due to further advances in the Polistes project, this gene was never synthesized).  A screenshot of a run of DoubleOptimizer on the amino acid sequence for this protein (listed above), with the E. coli codon usage table also listed above, with default settings for 10 seconds on a laptop computer (2011 model Macbook Pro) is shown below:
Note that the number of repeated sequences is significantly reduced, and the closeness-of-fit to the desired codon sequence is much improved, compared to the initial random reverse-translation. As an example of DoubleOptimizer run on a DNA sequence, a somewhat-repetitive Homo sapiens gene was arbitrarily selected from the NCBI database. Specifically, the exon sequence for Ca+2-binding protein CBP86 form VII was optimized for synthesis, again in E."

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation"

We could not just digest the citrine out because there is no upstream restriction site available. PCR with these primers will result in the addition of a NheI site on the end of the vector fragment near the promoter (to be ligated to the N terminus of the fusion protein), and a SexAI site on the end far from the promoter (to be ligated to the c terminus of the fusion protein) b.

pgaABCD operon control
This particular four - gene locus in E.coli is responsible for synthesis of the biofilm adhesion protein called PGA. As this is a virulence factor, i.e. non-essential for growth in supplemented media, a possible insertion of GFP and possible disruption the operon would not cause lethal effects to our cells.
As far as it is known, the pgaABCD genes are subject to post-translational inhibition by the small regulatory RNA CsrA as well as activation by the cation-responsive regulatory protein NhaR.  The first fact is to our advantage. In theory, once the binding of the CAI-1 to fusion kinase occurred, the CsrA inhibition would be releaved and the GFP would be expressed . Also, according to research it has been proven that the csrA deletion mutant had an impressive 3000 fold increase compared to the wild type.
Possible “noise” in the system
As mentioned before, one of the factors to be taken into account prior choosing the gene within which the GFP would be inserted is the interference or “noise” in the system. This possibility might have caused background fluorescence or GFP expression independent from the sensing event of our interest.
The reasons underlying this “noise” are listed below:
High salt concentrations (NhaR dependent)
Alkaline pH (NhaR dependent)
Ethanol ( NhaR dependent)
Glucose presence in the media (Independent from both CsrA and NhaR)
The noise in the system appears only if the cells are grown at extreme conditions. However, if the growth media contains only 1% glucose, 1 % ethanol, 1 % NaCl the levels of the pgaABCD transcript should not be elevated by any other factors except CsrA.  On the other hand, if additional NaCl or glucose are added to the medium it might cause significant increase in the pgaABCD mRNA appearance [2]
Target of insertion
As the pgaABCD is a four-gene locus another question that arose was the actual place within the operon where the insertion could take place. Another obstacle was that genes b, c and d overlap with each other.

Thus our total carbon footprint is roughly 50 tonnes CO2
Our Solution
To reduce our net carbon footprint we have made some local and one global initiative. The local initiatives are planting trees, buying green and travelling green. After thorough systematic research we could conclude that in general planting grass and most trees would increase our net carbon footprint, so we planted a few apple trees Carbon sequestration of trees Global warming and lawns Carbon sequestration in turfgrass .
Acknowledging this is not even cents on the dollar, we had to do more. Therefore some of the team changed their eating habits into a more local, organic and sustainable diet. The main focus of this diet was that a majority of the vegetables had to be local and should be picked up on nearby farms. For this reason one of the teammates signed up for “Odense Food Community” Odense Food Community (translated) .
The last element of the local initiatives was to travel green. In general the team has been travelling by bike or public transport when going to and from the university. For the purpose of travelling to every meetup, we have been driving in vans, leaving very little carbon footprint. Had we been able to go to Boston in a more eco-friendly way, we of course would.
Regarding global initiatives we started a partnership with CO2 Neutral Website, which ended up in a sponsorship from them. What they have done in our name is
Build energy efficient stoves for families in Africa, reducing CO2 emissions as less trees are logged. It also creates local jobs and creates a healthier life. Certified and audited through the Gold Standard.
Build boreholes for clean water instead of families boiling water. This also improves quality of life and reduces CO2 emission. Certified and audited through the Gold Standard.
Build new, renewable energy sources. So far we are involved in several windmill parks.
Help protect rainforest from devastating deforestation. Certified and audited through the Redd+.
Help companies reduce their climate impact through energy efficiency.
Thus we have had a global impact on climate, which cannot be estimated precisely.
Conclusion
In conclusion we would like to highlight the following
Due to flying being a necessity for us when going to Boston we have a massive carbon footprint.
We acknowledge that any local initiative we have made are pennies on the dollar in regards to CO2 emission and reduction.
The main initiative from us is the partnership with CO2 Neutral Website, which has had a global impact.

Stability Analysis
In our tri-stable system, stability plays an indispensable role in determining the robustness of the system. What we learnt from the bi-stable switch is the variation in biological parts, e.g. promoters and ribosome binding sites (RBS), would cause the system to be unstable. Therefore, we performed stability analysis to assess the conditions and constraints that the system"
BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#CraigNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," So far this is the only functionality that I have coded.  By Friday, I hope to integrate the key tables and key trees into the app so that when the user presses go, all of this information is generated.
7/15/11
Today I finished adding the tailored key tables for hitting certain permutations as well as the tree visualization for these key tables.  When the user presses go, now a result tab is generated for that set of permutations.  The result tab itself contains a two tabbed pane, the first of which is a simple key table as shown below:
The second tabbed pane is a tree visualization of the the key table.  Each permutation is represented as a node and each edge is labeled with the invertase responsible for transitioning between two permutations.  Here is an example.
Also, the link sort algorithm can now generate very basic top-down tailored designs.  To do this, it first generates a link sort design for the n parts in each permutation.  Then, it generates a permutation/key table for the desired permutations specified by the user.  Using this table, it determines which of the invertase sites of the scaled design are necessary for these permutations, and deletes the rest of these invertases.  I am hoping that later, after making these deletions, I can re-index the invertases, however, I haven't implemented this yet.  Another addition I hope to add is a visual way of distinguishing between desired permutations and intermediate permutations in the tree (probably using different colors).  I haven't looked in the JUNG library enough to fix this yet.
7/19/11
I believe that the first version of Trumpet, which only utilizes the Link Sort algorithm is nearly completed.  Today I finished adding a save and export tab to the results generated which allows the user to name the part, provide a description, and assign actual invertases to those of the construct.  Below is an example of this tab.
I still need to implement a format filter for Trumpet.  I imagine that this can be a simple drop down menu near the working part set which allows the user to specify the format for the parts that will compose the composite part.  Lastly, I need to be able to close result tabs.  I don't think it will be hard to put in a simple, functioning ""x"" icon in the corner of the result tabs.

The colorectal cancer
Colorectal cancer includes tumors affecting ...
... a segment of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. It is treatable and, in most cases, curable when detected early, before they haven`t spread to other organs. Most of these tumors starts from polyps, benign lesions may grow on the inner wall of the large intestine.
The estimated new cases in Brazil in 2013 was 32,600, 15,070 men and 17,530 women. These values correspond to an estimated risk of 15 new every 100 000 men and 16 women per 100 thousand cases. While the number of deaths was 14,016, with 7,198 woman and 6.818 man, as updated in 2011. According to the National Cancer Institute (INCA) was estimated incidence of Colorectal Cancer, 2006, as the 5th most common malignancy among men (with 11,390 new) and 4 among women (13,970 new cases) cases, being higher in the age group between 50 and 70 years, but the potential development has increased from 40 years. (INCA, Souza et al, 2008)
The diagnosis requires a biopsy (take tissue fragment removed the suspicious lesion), made by handset introduced by rectum (endoscope). This procedure is invasive and often inhibits patients to submit to this practice, hampering the discovery of cancer at an early stage and thereby reducing the chances of effective treatment and cure. Thinking this bias, our group, The Colonyeast, is developing a methodology for noninvasive diagnosis.
DNA-L
From different approaches to colorectal cancer screening, Klaassen et al (2003) proposed a noninvasive method to it. Analysis of stool samples from colorectal cancer patients contain increased concentration of human DNA. This increase could be explained by decreased apoptosis of bowel cells and/or increased shedding of cancer. Ahlquist et al. (2000) have already demonstrated that large DNA fragments were amplified from DNA in stool samples from colorectal cancer patients more frequently than from healthy volunteers.  Analysis of human"

Edinburgh,2014,Team:Edinburgh#log_-_-_TEXT.html," is what we need. The sugar logic system would provide an alternative but it is not without its own problems.
Some of the groundwork was laid for the modelling too – mainly skill learning today – and primers were designed.
Many people seem stressed about the amount of time left  - probably more because we have only a vague idea of how long things will take rather than any actual shortage of time. Time will tell.
Wednesday 18th
We finished making our cells competent today, and learnt how to make up the TSS buffer necessary to do so. Transformations should begin tomorrow. We also really need to source more materials and pieces of equipment for our lab – it has a real ‘abandoned’ feel.
Meanwhile a number of problems with the theoretical aspects were worked on. Four of us met with Dr. French to see if he had a workaround for a problem with our sugar logic system – the problem that each strain is too sensitive to false positives because it doesn’t rely on the prior strain for precursor. He didn’t have a solution, but did offer a possible solution to the secondary problem of signal quenching – make the enzymes unstable rather than use a degradation tag (which wouldn’t work outside the cell). We also looked for a way to source E. coli cells with the tetR gene as the strain we are working with is missing it, and we sort of need it for all our IPD circuits.
In addition, more organised circuit diagrams were made alongside matching plasmid diagrams, which will hopefully make the transition to multi-cell IPD easier, and a more in depth investigation of the Hbp operon (required for the metabolic wiring) was done. Philip and Cesar left us today to go and attend the Oxford iGEM meetup as our representatives. Good luck guys!
Finally, it was far too hot today. We almost denatured.
Thursday 19th
The first transformations were done today, which was exciting. They’re being incubated overnight, ready for a miniprep tomorrow. We were also very kindly given some TetR+ cells by Dr. Garry Blakely (once we’d prepared the tetracycline plate for him).
Meanwhile there was a discussion about what our ultimate aims should be, and some questions from the dry team about the specifics of metabolic wiring were answered. It was felt we need to make sure we are all on the same page, so to speak, lest we drift apart into different, unrelated subprojects.
Elize is looking into a Synthetic Biology Film Festival which previous iGEM teams have entered into with some success. The deadline for entries is in"

Mode of action
Lantibiotics are active against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria including multidrug-resistant pathogens. Some lantibiotics have a dual mode of action, subtilin is proposed to be among them. Subtilin forms a complex with the cell wall precursor lipid II, whereby the pyrophosphate moiety may play a key role for target recognition. Thereby, the cell wall biosynthesis is inhibited. Furthermore, the complexes aggregate and form a pore in the bacterial membrane by using lipid II as a docking molecule. This leads to a depolarisation of the membrane potential, the efflux of cytoplasma and in turn to rapid cell death. Just like nisin, which is highly similar, subtilin is still active in the nanomolar range and thus serves excellently as alternative killing strategy against multidrug-resistant pathogens. [7 ] [8 ]
Fig. 4. Proposed mechanism of pyrophosphate-mediated target engagement by the lanthionine antibiotic subtilin. Membrane breaches occur in a lipid II-mediated fashion and cell wall synthesis is impeded through engagement of pyrophosphate-containing intermediates into complexes. [7 ]
Lysostaphin
targeted pentaglycinbridge in the cellwall of some Staphylococcus species [B1]
Lysostaphin is a murein-hydrolase, which is naturally produced by Staphylococcus simulans biovar staphylolyticus in order to defeat other, competing Staphylococcus species.  It cleaves specifically the pentaglycinbridge between the tetrapeptides of the peptidoglycan in the cell wall. In addition to killing the cells, lysostaphin also dissolves the biofilms of lysostaphin-sensitive bacteria. [B1 ]  This targeted pentaglycinbridge is a feature of the cell wall of some Staphylococcus species, leading to the high specificity of lysostaphin against S. carnosus, S. epidermidis and S. aureus, which is particularly sensitive towards lysostaphin. [ B2 ]
The immunity of S. simulans is accomplished by substitution of the glycine-residues in the cell wall by serine which is mediated by the immunity factor Lif [B1 ] .

The pre-pro-lysostaphin consists of a signal peptide to mediate the export, 15 tandem repeats of 13 amino acids length and two protein"

DTU-Denmark,2013,Team:DTU-Denmark#IP and Synthetic Biology_-_-_TEXT.html," these genes.  This patent was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ), who held that genes should not be patentable.
Recently, the US Supreme Court ruled on the Myriad Genetics case stating that while naturally occurring human genes cannot be patented, cDNA which is derived from a human gene can be.
This is potentially confusing for anyone working in synthetic biology, because it is not clear whether the information content of the cDNA (with introns spliced out) is what is being protected, or if instead just the physical new cDNA molecule is being protected.
Interview with the Speakers
Why aren't genes subject to copyright instead of patent law?
Jakob: According to IP law in Denmark, technology can only be patented, it cannot be copyrighted.
Michael: In the US, no one has tried to copyright genes, but it could be possible.
The ruling was applied only to the non-patentability of human genes; is it reasonable to expect that it will be extended to all natural genes?
All: Not going to speculate
Are the mutants that we are creating patentable?
Jakob: Recombining genes in a novel order is sufficient modification to expect that a patent would be granted.
Is this ruling in the best interest of society?
Michael: At the end of the day, funding for genetic research is not going away.
He is implying that this ruling isn't going to hamper genetic research.  People will continue to fund this sort of work even though genes themselves cannot be patented.
Are there provisions in patent law for academic or personal use?
Jakob: In Europe, you cannot prevent reverse engineering for interoperability [in contrast with the US], but if an academic wanted to research the BRCA1 cDNA, they would need to pay a licensing fee.
Part of the ruling states that the splicing of introns from the genes is a factor in the 'artificiality' of the cDNA construct -- does this limit patentability of prokaryotic genes since they don't have introns?
All: Declined to comment
The information content of cDNA is the same as the template RNA (after intron splicing) and is patentable, but mRNA which has the same information content as the original DNA is not patentable. Thoughts?
Michael: Agree, the information content is not the important part.

Workflow
Circuit Beginnings
Once we had designed our circuit, we went about obtaining all of the necessary parts for its construction. Because the registry did not contain the majority of parts crucial to our circuit, we collaborated with teams EPF-Lausanne, PKU, and Davidson-Missouri Western to obtain the relevant parts. From EPF-Lausanne, we received <partinfo>BBa_K191003</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K191005</partinfo>. We received from PKU Beijing AraC+pBad+T7ptag+Terminator, NahR+pSal+supD+Terminator, the Bistable switch, and other miscellaneous parts. From Davidson-Missouri Western, we received <partinfo>BBa_K091141</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K091147</partinfo> to aid in the characterization of the pLac/Mnt hybrid promoter in the distribution. Thanks all for the assistance!
Experimental Procedure
Once we began receiving genetic material, we started our attempts at constructing each required module of our circuit. Clearly, our circuit has many components that, to build a complete example, would require an incredible amount of time. We decided that we could demonstrate our ideas in two ways:
Through extensive mathematical modeling, we can show the likely functionality of our circuit and the likely functionality of our circuit through extensive mathematical modeling, which is considerably less prone to error than laboratory work.
We can establish proof of concept by pairing our Conversion Module with the Memory Module. By testing this segment of the circuit together, we can show a progression across three states (as we move from light OFF->ON->OFF) by changing one input. Because the state of the circuit when the light is turned back off is different from that when the light was originally off, the crux of the circuit concept has been demonstrated and the ability to achieve more states is evident.

This force we called it osmotic pressure, yet, desalination process is working against osmotic pressure. Therefore, we have to give an artificial pressure called reverse osmotic pressure, which is where RO comes from. This extra pressure requirements is also the main cost of desalination process.
The method comparison
In a word, our project favors the starting point, and RO method favors the ending point. Using the human practice experience, we made a simple table 6.3.2 to compare their characteristic. As you can see, some actual of our project is remain unknown.
For example,we have difficulties in estimating the energy cost of our project via our model result. Frankly speaking, we could give an estimated value but we can’t control the error of the estimated value. Such difficulties are caused by insufficient parameters setting. We judge our current modeling results in qualitative sense but not in quantitative sense. As a result, the energy cost is not suitable to calculate by our model.
In table 6.3.2, we marked our estimated advantages into green.

Combination possibility
Overall, our project is expected to working independently with its own pretreatment and after-process, but we think it will be great to find a collaboration way with current method. Either way, our goal is to find the most efficient and feasible way for seawater desalination.
In last section, we mentioned that our project favors the starting point, and RO method favors the ending point. However, it is not enough if the power is only simple as 1+1=2. Here’s some reasons why we think that the combination contains a lot of potential.

East_Chapel_Hill,2017,Team:East Chapel Hill#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," everyone in the community understand the cause of fluorosis and have an incentive to address it?
A: When I first arrived, I found that most people did not know their water was causing fluorosis. They said the water looks great and tastes great so there is nothing to be worried about. If they don’t understand what fluorosis is within their own communities, you can’t sell the idea of TOXI-SWITCH to them. You have to start with education from within the community. You also must illustrate your idea in a way that is understandable and acceptable. For example, in east Africa they found that bone char was effective in removing fluoride. They would take cow bones and cook them so that they would char and become a powder. This would act as an adsorbent to remove the fluoride. This idea gave some people the creeps and thus was not very popular. It also gave the water a funny taste.
In these large rural communities a very oral culture is present, meaning they learn from oral storytelling and help each other through town meetings. Because government workers are not really related to the community at all - they are just assigned posts which are subject to change every few years or so, it would be best to find someone from within the community that likes our idea and believes it's worth trying. This well-respected community member could hold community clinics and talk to people about the causes of fluorosis.
It is important to remember that fluorosis is not exactly these people’s top priority, they are more worried about getting regular income, food, and water (they are subsistence farmers). In fact, some of them don’t even know what fluorosis is. In northern Ghana, there are virtually no cases of skeletal fluorosis - a much more obvious, severe, and crippling problem which has been documented in China and India. Dental fluorosis are the only documented cases, and dental fluorosis does not prohibit one from working, making it a mild problem.
Q: Why do some locations have higher concentrations of fluoride than others?
A: Fluoride comes from the rock. In Ghana, there are pockets in the earth rich in “bongo granite”, which contains fluorine. As the water travels through the ground to a distant area, fluorine starts to disperse and dilute itself. In other countries where the concentration of fluoride is higher than in Northern Ghana, the high fluoride rock is more widely dispersed.
That’s why one of my other ideas was to install wells a little farther away from the water pipe, which would be in a high fluoride concentration area. However, the initial cost would be very high, somewhere between $"
Penn,2013,Team:Penn State#CesaProject_-_-_TEXT.html," and using PCR amplification. The CesA 4, 7, and 8 genes were obtained from cDNA via the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center and tissue samples. PCR amplification from vector pDMC107 enabled the isolation of GFP and NOS terminator. Ultimately, the construct was tied together via Gibson assembly synthesising all tags and markers from the primers used.
Further Study
Due to limitations resulting from the lack of previous synthetic biology application within plants, we were unable to obtain any results. We have successfully isolated the desired CesA 1 promoter, CesA genes 7 and 8 and the Nos terminator parts. However, we were not able to isolate the CesA 4 gene needed for assembly of the plasmid. Thus successful construct assembly of these parts is still needed for bacterial and plant transformation. Following promising transformation, fluorescence testing and characterization must be done.

Model of Metal Intake
James has done some of the work but needs more help from biologists!
It was discussed that we first of all need to model cadmium only and THEN we can consider other metals - start from the basics.
Need to find out how much cadmium binds to the promoter/protein per second
Need to measure how much protein is expressed by promoter activation
Using this data, work out how much cadmium is taken in by the metallothionein
It was decided that the whole team (students) should meet up after lab sessions to work together on getting relevant data and get this model working.
We need TWO models - 1) A model for Bacillus subtilis response to cadmium in different scenarios and 2) A model for cadmium influx in B. subtilis

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#NicoleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a part. Going to work on testing out how to search through PubMed and iGEM. Will check the quality of the custom search results compared to Parts Registry ‘Text Search’ results.
Day 17: June 20, 2012
Comparing Google Custom Search results between what shows up in the C# implementation and when testing out the custom search engine in the site, there is a significant difference. For one thing there are only 10 results that appear in the pop-up window of the C# code whereas there are 10 pages worth of results in the sample site. Moreover, the results do not show up in the same order, so now we are trying to figure out how to make the results that appear on the DataGrid window be more similar to how they should appear. To be able to search through PubMed, Consuelo provided us with the web crawler she coded for one of last summer’s projects. It definitely works with genes, so we’ll have to test out whether it works for phrases or other keywords. As for searching through the iGEM archive, we’ve added all previous iGEM sites to what the custom search engine will look through.
Unfortunately, we weren’t able to figure out how our problem with C# implement of Google custom search results in terms of order and amount, so we’ve decided to customize Conseulo’s previous web crawler for PubMed and modify it for the Parts Registry. So far, we’ve managed to find a URL scheme for text searches. We are learning the code behind her Web Crawler before we start editing it to better suit our needs. With the web crawler, we’ll also be handling the results that appear by going through the links and creating data sheets from the links to the different parts.
Day 18: June 21, 2012
Veronica and I managed to finish customizing part of Conseulo’s web crawler, so now we have a Web Crawler that goes through the search results of a query and extract the title of the pages, the links to said pages, and the number of results (which appears if the query is not too generic). Linda sent us a document listing the information she needs to be able to construct a data sheet, and we’ve come up with a structure for the classes needed to be able to extract the information in an organized manner and are currently working on the code.

UCL,2015,Team:UCL#Notebooktrial_-_-_TEXT.html," cultures were left to grow over night. We also prepared plates with kanamycin which we are going to use for 3A assembly of our promoters and effectors. We made a miniprep of another GFP culture from last week
Tuesday 14th
Interlab Study
We used the cultures we inoculated yesterday for making a miniprep. Just to be safe we had made two cultures and after figuring out the quirks of the nanodrop it turned out that one had a DNA concentration more than twice that of the other. We digested the minipreps and the promoters from the Interlab Study with Xba1, Spe1 and Pst1 to ligate them together in the next step. We checked if the digestion of GFP (Interlab Study) worked but we could not see any bands so we'll try again tomorrow with an Ethidium Bromide gel and use more DNA. We started the ligation of promoters to GFP anyway, transformed and let these cultures grow overnight.
Bifidobacter
We have checked the concentrations of preps from yesterday and they were really low! The diagnostic digests confirmed that there was no DNA in our preps. In the mean time we decided to do the gel extraction od Ptac and GFP we got from our other team members. We digested the Ptac with S and P and GFP with X and P and run it on the gel. The Ptac was there, but GFP wasn't.
Wednesday 15th
Interlab Study
We ran the same digestion as yesterday but this time with lots of DNA and a ton of Ethidium Bromide and it worked!!!
We could see the bands we expected in one of our samples (second well from the ladder). The other one seemed not to be digested. Now we are going to stick only to the good one. We transformed cells with the ligation from yesterday and let them grow overnight.
Mind the Gut: Promoters
We also started working on the promoters of our actual project Gad-A+RBS, Gad-A and PyeAr digested them and ligated them into a backbone with Cam resistance.
Mind the Gut: Effectors
Today we have decide to clone our TPH1 biobrick into the expression cassette using three different approaches: 3A assembly, gel extraction, and amplified insert assembly. We were not able to get hold of the kanamycin backbone we needed for subcloning the expression cassette, but we succeeded with two other approaches and managed to get to the stage of PCR/gel extraction clean ups.

Approach
Venomic studies have enabled the characterization of venom composition, from snakes species of medical importance [1]. From these, it can be shown that the venom between snake species, even within families, is more similar than expected [2]. However, these studies have also shown that there are certain enzymes that are innate to snake families, or much higher in abundance compared to distant species.
Our approach
We applied an alternative approach to detect snake venom circumventing immunoassay based methods. We decided to create a proteolytic enzyme assay based on a linker sequence which contains a cleavage site for proteases that are characteristic for the venom of different snakes.
Our approach to snake venom detection, utilising the proteolytic activity of different venoms, has several potential advantages compared to current methods used for snake venom detection, such as lowers cost, new target substrates and relative quantification of the envenoming.
Choice of snakes
The focus of our project was sub-Saharan Africa, where snakebites are more common than other regions of the continent. As a proof of concept, we attempted to distinguish the snake venoms from the species Bitis gabonica, Bitis arietans and Naja nigricollis.
Our Biosensor
Proteins that give off signals when a linker sequence is cleaved, are not a new invention. FRET (Föster resonance energy transfer) has been used for many years in research, to gain a better understanding of protein-protein interactions.
FRET illustration by Thomas Shafee.
Our biosensor consists of a fusion protein. Inspired by the design of different FRET reporters, our fusion protein contains two larger protein domains, separated by a flexible linker containing one or more substrate sequences. However, unlike FRET reporters, where fluorescent proteins make up the two larger domains, the two large protein domains in our biosensor are a chromoprotein domain and a binding domain. The linker between the two domains is designed to contain the specific cleavage sites found through screening methods.  The binding domain can be used to immobilize the construct, in order to detect cleavage by the release of the chromophore protein.

Cooperation with USTC wet team
It's always a good experience working with our wet team through the whole summer. During the process of iGEM 2010, we learn from each other and help each other to achieve more! This year we cooperate with USTC team in modeling and human practice. Read the following sections for more details.
Modeling
This year the team of USTC focuses on the construction a Host-cell-free Reaction Chamber using Synthetic Biology methods. We help them to visualize an artificial organelle of capacity. For more details, please refer to our wet team's modeling page .
Human Practice
This year, we also had close collaboration with USTC wet team on human practice, for the simple reason that none of us is biology major and we had to resort to biology major fellows for professional advice. Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together. The collaboration with them not only enhanced the quality of our work, but improved the biology knowledge of our own.
iGEM2010 China Meetup Shanghai
Something amazing happened at Shanghai this summer. On August 5th, USTC_Software, together with teams from 6 other top universities in China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, ECUST-Shanghai, Peking, Tsinghua, USTC, ZJU-China, and Sun Yat-sen University all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#human practice#start-up kit#interview_-_-_TEXT.html," chose governors and young students as the most important target audience. Moreover, we discussed about some worthwhile areas to be explored in human practice and the prospect of human practice in iGEM.
Fig 1. Interview with Dr.Samuel Yu and Ms.Christine Chiu from HKUST
Interview with Human Practice Judge from Outside Our Institution
Fig 2. Skype interview with Prof.Tom Richard from Pennsylvania State University
To further broaden our perspective of human practice and our understanding of the purpose and impact of human practice in iGEM we also contacted a past human practice judge from outside our institution. Prof. Tom Richard has kindly agreed to have an online interview with us using Skype.
He defined human practice as understanding of non-technical parts of synthetic biology, which clearly has issues and concerns regarding the general public and involve ethical, legal and security concerns. Prof. Tom Richard emphasized that they are looking for projects that are more novel and insightful that might generate new ideas and opportunities. We asked if he thinks any specific target group may have more impact than the other groups. He said there are two kinds of target group he sees as important: people that will actually have broad impact through their position (policy makers) and individuals that will have life long impact (young generation).
During the interview he also pointed out that art and culture has very important relationship with science and technology and should be explored more. He explained that they provide different window on science and technology for both general public, who often do not understand technical definitions and also for scientists and professionals in the field, because it helps them think in different ways. We also discussed about the prospective of new track in iGEM called “Policy and Practice” and effectiveness of surveys and talks, which are the most common projects in iGEM human practice.

Attendance to Meet Ups
The meets ups bring several advantages to the teams. It is one of the simplest ways to reach a greater number of people to whom you can explain your project. And therefore they allow you to know first-hand the projects of the rest of the teams so that you can consult and clarify doubts. These meetings also allow for more related and powerful collaborations thanks to knowing the rest of the teams in person. And last but not least, they allow you to practice exposing your project with a view to improving in the Giant Jamboree.
Our team attended two meet ups that took place in the month of August.
Marseille
Mediterranean Meet Up (Marseille)
This meet up took place between Thursday 9 and Friday 10 August in the city of Marseille and was organized by the team of this city, the Aix-Marseille. In it, all the teams from the Mediterranean area were summoned, so they ended up attending both France and Spain. Francisco, Gonzalo and Ivan attended this meet up on behalf of the team.
The event began with a reception in which all teams had their first informal contact. Subsequently, a 5 minutes presentation of each of the projects was organized, summarizing the concept on which the proyect was based, the work carried out and the plans to complete it. After the exhibition, each team answered the questions that could have the jury and the rest of the teams.
Later they invited us to a joint meal. In the afternoon it was organized a sightseeing tour of the city, but due to inclement weather it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night"

But the main problem remains: in the equilibrium there's still a vast amount of LuxR which represses the transcription of ccdB. This way, cell death can never take place.
Memory seems to fail, the promoter's strength is not high enough to keep the memory's digital value at 0, thereby keeping the system in its off state when no light is shed on the system... After some time the memory will always change its state to 1, light or not.
The modeling wiki has been worked on and is under construction to make it readable to other teams. Current goal is to retrieve the information used to determine the parameters. Some have been updated, the parameters for the pulse generator and the inverter have been added...

1.Introduction
Bacteria chemotaxis is related to a series of proteins, such as receptors including kinds of Tar, Tsr, Trp, Tap, Aer and cheR, cheB, cheW, cheA, cheZ, cheY in the cytoplasm. The chemotaxis network is formed in three steps: (1) Receptors at the membrane sense extracellular signals; (2) The chemotaxis proteins in the cytoplasm transmit signals from receptors to flagella; (3) The flagella accept signals and determine to swim or tumble.
The flagella switch is pivotal for the decision of strain on swimming or tumbling. It is regulated by cheY-p and cheY. The concentration of cheY-p is controlled by cheA and cheZ. So we use cheZ to regulate the differences of diffusion range rate on swarming plate to achieve our destination of pattern formation.
2.Materials and Methods
2.1 Strain and Plasmid Construction
Trans-5a is a commercialized chemically competent cell bought from Transgene for molecule cloning in E.coli. Strain CL1 is a CheZ deleted strain of E.coli K12 AMB1655 strain(maybe) and MG1655 is a motile wild type E.coli K12 strain. These two strains are generally shared by Dr. Chenli Liu, SIAT CSynBER. CG is constructed by transforming our fused fragment of CheZ and GFP into CL1 strain, and 01-CG, 06-CG and 17-CG are constructed by replacing the promoter of our fused protein with J23101, J23106, and J23117 respectively. CK is constructed by transforming BBa_K819010, a CheZ generator constructed by iGEM12"

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"

The Plight of the Horseshoe Crab
To understand the plight of the horseshoe crab we decided to reach out to our local authorities, the Georgia Aquarium. The aquarium was able to provide an immersive learning environment. At the Georgia Aquarium, we were able to learn about the crab from our tour guide Max and able to touch the horseshoe crab, it was a tad bit slimy but cute nevertheless.  On our tour, we were made aware that horseshoe crabs are crucial to the food webs of many species and that with the depletion of the horseshoe crab population we see a reduction of a lot of other species, especially certain types of birds.  The crisis that the horseshoe crab faces was made clear by our tour guide, with the crabs serve as valuable resources for commercial fishers and the biomedical industry. But, in recent years concerns have been raised about the decline in Limuli population. Click on the tabs to learn about crab population threats and environmental impact of crab population depletion.
Environmental Impact
Threats from All Sides
Limuli plays a vital role in the ecology of estuarine and coastal communities.  Horseshoe crabs utilize autochthonous and allochthonous production from pelagic and benthic food webs(figure 2; Carmichael et al. 2004). The horseshoe crab is an integral part of many vertebrate predators diet. Benthic fish feed on horseshoe crab eggs and larvae, sharks feed on the smaller juveniles, and sea turtles feed on adults (Botton et al. 2003).  Horseshoe crabs are dietary generalists, and adult crabs are ecologically essential bivalve predators in some locations. One of the most notable predator-prey relationships that were pointed out to us while we were at the Georgia Aquarium was the migratory shorebird–horseshoe crab egg interaction. Eleven species, such as the more familiar red knot(featured to the right) and the dowitch"

The new process of the brainstorming. All the thing about is to make a portable test paper using fried Yeast. and take advantage of the mating process of Yeast haploid, to make a switch box which can sense different signals input and generate different output. Great idea~ Now the problem is how to sense the signals and which signals to output? First idea is to be the pathogenic microorganisms. But how to sense the pathogenic microorganisms?
Xiaochen has invstigated and consult such ideas with the medical school students. Replied to be several medicines can inhibit the growth of microorganisms by various ways, yet the testing is still the important and cannot solved issue. Okay, just change a little bit~ went to another thing might be the better choice. Or maybe not.

New breakthrough! Though it was hard to detect the pathogenic by such as antigen – antibody reaction, or like directly interaction , or synthesize the new information pathway in yeast, there is actually a very simple way to do that! Detect the AHLs existed in pathogenic microorganisms! First of all, AHL has specificity and differed in different microorganisms. Second thing is, actually qurum sensing system parts are easy"

For example, if you want to get the information of ‘BBa_I14050’, you type in ‘BBa_I’, the software will return the BioBricks that contain the part name ‘BBa_I’. Sometimes you may find it hard to remember the name of a BioBrick. Other search methods will help you find the target BioBrick. Submit a keyword, our software will return the BioBircks which have some relationship with this keyword (Refer to Fig.3). Moreover, you can choose the chassis a BioBrick in by press the Chassis button (Refer to Fig.4). You can choose from a variety of choices such as E.coli and yeast (Refer to Fig.5_1). If you don’t choose a specific chassis, our software will find the BioBricks from all chassis. Similarly, you can choose to search a specific type of BioBricks, e.g. terminator (Refer to Fig.5_2).

If you find the above options cannot meet your standard, you can find some advanced options by press the edit button on top right (Refer to Fig.7). Three advanced options are available. The first is the author option. If you know the name of the creator of some BioBricks, you can refine the search by typing his/her name. If you yourself has created some BioBricks, why not try your name to see whether you can see your BioBricks? (Refer to Fig.8) The second choice is the status option. The status of a BioBrick reveals whether it is available or not. Of course, some BioBricks are also labeled ‘planning’, ‘deleted’ etc. (Refer to Fig.9) The last choice is the creation date option. If you want to pick up the BioBricks created during a period of time. Chosse a start and an end date, then our software will return the BioBricks which created during this period.
