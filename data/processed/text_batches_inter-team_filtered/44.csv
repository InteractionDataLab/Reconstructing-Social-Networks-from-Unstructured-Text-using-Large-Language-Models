USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program. In addition, process of products generating is not as easy as just creating a new species with specific name, too. Their structures are required to be constructed under rules defined in MoDeL at the same time. The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.
To complete the final systemn network from initial conditions, we break up the task to several parts:
Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file;
Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species;
For each template species found matching, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both at the same time;
For each template reaction found possible to occur, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction;
For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied for given constraints, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
Go to step 2 until the end of the species list;
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
Figure 1: Algorithm Flow Chart
Special reactions and volume strategy
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions. The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. It means number of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute"
Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," time periods, the cleavage of the on-target site (which has around 7X higher probability of cleavage than the next most likely site) dwarfs all other sites, and untransformed genome copies tail off rapidly. Around 4 hours in, the rate of transformation begins to tail off, as less on-target sites exist and the probability of being “found” by Cas9 is lower. In response, cleavage rates of off-target sites increase, due to decreased competition, but quickly regain steady state levels due to the speed of homologous recombination.
Graph 6
Plots of gRNA and Cas9 over time show the gRNA to be the limiting factor in Cas9:gRNA active complex formation, due to its higher degradation rate. Plots of off-target sites over time show very few of them to be cleaved at any given time, due to the high probability of homology-directed repair. This is encouraging, as it shows our assumption of being able to combine Cas9 activity at several thousand other sites into a single differential equation due to very low rates of change to be valid. Only one site (shown on the graph in purple) – which has a free energy change of only around 1 kcal.mol-1 less than the on-target site – shows any significant activity at steady state.
Graph 7
2. Sensitivity analysis
The Salis lab have already done sensitivity tests for their own model parameters, however, we thought it pertinent to check our own model’s sensitivity to our own parameters. Without experimental data to check our model against, we chose instead to measure how the model’s expected time to homoplasmy varies with each parameter across one order of magnitude difference (centred around our final value), if all other parameters are held constant. This would also allow us to validate several assumptions about the model.
First, we checked the effect of the assumption of “perfect selection pressure”, by varying the percentage of the time in which the on-target site is transformed by homology-directed repair, rather than being repaired back to its original state. The results were encouraging – even when the cut site used the gene of interest as its template for homology-directed repair a mere 10% of the time (with it using another genome copy the other 90% and reverting to its original form), the time to homoplasmy was only increased by 50 minutes (a 12% increase), with very little change in the homoplasmy time observed from about a 50-50 chance of template choice onwards.
We next checked the effect of increasing the number of “driver"

Dr. ir. Arnold van Vliet has set up several citizen science networks, like the global mosquito alert and is an expert in communicating science to society. In citizen science, stakeholders, citizens, and mass media work together on scientific projects. This might be a nice future perspective of our device, where test results are saved and put online. In this way, a map and graph can be created that shows where and when the disease has spread or the mosquitoes are most active. This can be used to warn people at the right time and determine which measures should be taken.

Internist-infectiologist, Rijnstate Hospital Velp
This Dutch internist has experience in diagnosing tropical infectious diseases, including the only case of Mayaro virus in the Netherlands. Availability of diagnostics for obscure infectious diseases is a problem, even in western countries like the Netherlands, especially for diseases harboring cross-reactivity with similar diseases. Although no specific treatment is available for Mayaro, correct diagnosis is important on global scale. Due to globalisation and climate change tropical infectious diseases will spread to the western world more and more often.

In 2008, a Dutch couple came back ill from Surinam and went to the hospital of Rotterdam where they were investigated. They showed very common symptoms for viral infections and most likely they were infected with either dengue or chikungunya, both of which are very similar viruses. However, serological tests proved that this was not the case. Taking into account the areas where similar but obscure viruses are present, Mayaro proved to be the most logical candidate and after obtaining assays against Mayaro, this suspicion was proven to be right. Dr. Robert-Jan Hassing was involved in this progress, being it the only case of Mayaro in the Netherlands up to now. He wrote a paper on this particular case: “Imported Mayaro Virus infection in the Netherlands (2010)” [1].
Mayaro Virus (MAYV) causes long persisting symptoms, which is the most crippling feature of the disease. In developed countries patients run into problems regarding disability insurance as MAYV is not an officially recognized disease. Currently, no specific treatment is known.

This method can greatly increase the possibility of contacting the survey group, with relatively low funds and strong feasibility. In this survey, we were unable to obtain hospital diagnostic information and people who had been tested for allergens were relatively hidden. Thus, we used snowball sampling to encourage respondents to pass questionnaires to people around them who had allergies or who might have been tested for allergens.
Online Survey
We did an online survey that is based on Wechat - the most popular social network in China. The questionnaire is showed on screen as it showed on a paper. And the respondents need to tap the proper options or type in their answer, which is more convenient than the traditional paper way. But the drawback of this method is also obvious. This survey can only collect data from the certain population with a smartphone and a Wechat account, which is highly possible to result in an unbalance sample. We will further discuss this dilemma in the section of sample characteristics analysis.
Result
Analysis of Sample Characteristics
The final sample was formed by the first sample with convenience sampling and the latter sample with snowball sampling. And we focus on the following characteristics of the sample, which help us to analyze the sampling way we design and the population.
Age
As it shows in the pie charts, the respondents of 40-60 years old take up over 60% of the sample, while the old whose age is over 60 occupy the least. This result gives us hints that the sample way we choose is easier to get feedback among people in 22-60 years old.
Family Income
It is showed in the figure that the households of middle class prefer to fulfill the questionnaire rather than others. This is probably because most of these families have smart phone and social network, which are both essential to fulfill the questionnaire.
Sex
In this circle chart, it is obvious that the female respondents occupy the majority.
Education
From the diagram, we can know that the high education respondents make up over 80% of the sample.
Biology or Clinic Background
From the charts, it is worth noticing that the respondents whose family has biology or clinic background occupy a proportion about 29%, which is surprisingly higher than we expected.
According to the displayed statistics, the respondents of our survey are mostly the young and middle-aged who live in a middle-class family. And people who are female or have a biology or clinic background are more likely to answer our questionnaire. One reason for this result is that our survey is based on social networks and this certain population of people is more likely to have chances to use the social network and answer the questions"

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," e.g. a genetic amplification circuit. However, this would require much optimization to achieve stable and comparable signals. Genomic integration of the synthetic constructs would greatly enhance stability; this would remove potential issues such as plasmid loss or differences in plasmid copy count.  An important additional note is that although our tested CCP1 promoter clearly worked, its sequence did contain a single base mutation. Whether this difference has a positive or negative effect on the fluorescence would have to be confirmed by obtaining the correct promoter sequence.
A potential improvement to make our sensor more convenient would be the use of a different visual reporter. A suitable visual reporter for our purpose would be bright enough to be seen by bare eye, sensitive, quickly formed and stable. It would also be good if no additional cofactors were needed to reporter molecule production.
The duration it takes for the fluorescent signal to develop could be another issue. To assess this, more time points for our flow cytometry would be beneficial. However, as median fluorescence values from flow cytometry didn’t increase when increasing the induction time to 4 h from 2 h, it can be assumed that the response itself is quick, and increases of fluorescence over a longer time period are mainly due to increases in cell density. In addition, doing the measurements with multiple replicates would give as accurate information as possible about the expression profiles of the promoters in different induction concentrations. In particular, for low expression levels, values normalized to uninduced values are greatly affected by small errors. To this end, although microplate reader experiments proved to be useful in giving some general information about the expression trends of the constructs, cell clumping was a considerable problem, as several replicates of a measurement could be rendered inaccurate by the scattered reads.
Even if it eventually turned out that our promoters were not functional with microcystin induction, it wouldn’t mean that they couldn’t have other applications. As the basic idea of our promoter devices is to respond to oxidative stress they could be used for other applications centered around this idea. Our hypothesis was that in fresh waters, microcystin is one of the strongest factors causing oxidative stress, and thus, our promoters would give a signal relative to its concentration. However, there are many other agents that cause oxidative stress, and thus our device could be used for studying their combinatory effect and monitoring stress levels in form of a fluorescence signal. A general oxidative stress sensor like this could be used for example for easy monitoring of stress in yeast cell cultures when optimizing its growth conditions.

Freiburg,2011,Team:Freiburg#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," there are over a thousand already known structures of LRR proteins, what gave us a broad choice of motifs to choose and compare. The Construction of a new protein After a long and detailed search, we found out that it is most reasonable to use bacterial LRR motifs, since they seemed very well conserved in sequence, and they are the shortest – with only 21 amino acids per LRR repeat. (Wei 2008, Kajava 1998). We wanted to have a protein as simple and as predictable in behavior and structure as possible. Several search inquiries led to the most conserved and shortest of all bacterial LRR (PDB: 3CVR), unluckily this protein is a toxin derived from Yersinia pestis. We of course did not want to mess around with toxins,
The aminoacid sequence of a bacterial
ligase we chose for our design (PDB:3CVR)
especially not with one of the black plague. We also did not know what amino acid pattern on the LRR motif would cause the toxic effect. Probably, there would have been no harm in using this protein alone, even if we did clone and express it, but why should we do that when we have a huge choice freely available anyway. Finally, we settled on the bacterial ligase PDB:3CVR. A ligase would be definitively harmless, especially since we planned to restructure it entirely.
To do this we needed to understand how the structure of the Ligase was made up. Our desired protein LRR motif was only a part of a bigger protein “factory” which included several domains that seemed to serve distinct functions – more than we had use for. So we exclusively used the LRR domain. It seemed to us that this domain had mostly a structural role in this “factory”, but we could still not exactly tell. To avoid any unspecific biological function it was necessary to rearrange the amino acid composition. We fed the protein sequence in a free online consensus sequence generator called weblogo from the Berkeley University.
Consensus sequences derived from the repeating loops of the 3CVR ligase to work out the conserved aminoacids and shared chemical properties of the different positions in the loops.
By analyzing the logo it was obvious which positions of the LRR motif were conserved and which not – AND: which of the non-conserved amino acids appeared in what kind of pattern. Were there positions in the protein that required a polar amino acid? Or a non-polar, hydrophobic /-philic, charged, non-charged one?. We compared the consensus sequence"

Overview of Experiments
1. Production Strains
Following strains were cultivated:
Escherichia coli DH5alpha: DSMZ
Raoultella planticola DSM 3069 (ATCC 33531): DSMZ
Shimwelia blattae DSM 4481 (ATCC 29907) : DSMZ
In order to ensure that the bacteria we are working with are really the ones we want to work with, a 16S rDNA PCR was performed.
As an antibiotic resistance will be used in our later experiments to select transformants, we checked for any native antibiotic resistance against ampicillin, kanamycin, tetracyclin and chloramphenicol in an LB agar plate growth test. It turned out that kanamycin was the only antibiotic, against which none of our strains showed any resistance. For this reason, we decided to use only vectors with kanamycin resistance for our later projects.
After this, we prepared electro competent cells from our strains. All of our strains were grown on LB medium.
2. BioBricks
Our BioBricks were designed using the software SnapGene. The original Genes for our B12 binding proteins, and the torA signal sequence were codon optimized for E. coli.
The DNA containing the Genes were synthesized and friendly provided by IDT Integrated DNA Technologies.
In case of torA-mutB, the length of the gene exceeded the maximum length of 2000 bp from IDT. For this reason, we designed two DNA parts, with a natural occurring HindIII restriction site at both ends. We intended to fuse these both genes by ligation. However, after having diffuculties to fuse the genes by ligation, we decided to fuse them by fusion PCR. In order to multiply the DNA for our cloning experiments, and to equip our genes with restriction sites, PCR was used.
For our purpose, we were searching for a vector with (a) kanamycin resistance and (b) araBAD operon. We thus decided to use the pBAD202 expression system. This vector, however, is equipped with a thioredoxin fusion protein which increases the rate of expression, but prohibits the physiological function of our protein. For"

Interviews concerned on important application fields
Nowadays, miRNA inhibitors play an important role in medical treatment. To know more information of miRNA antagonist therapy, we interviewed a professor and a teaching assistant from two different medical universities.
Ling Li is a Professor and master’s supervisor of biochemistry and molecular biology department in school of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University. His main research focus is molecular mechanism of bone metastasis in tumor.
Q: A major application direction of our project is microRNA antagonist therapy. What impact do you think it will bring to the basic treatment? And what new challenges will it pose to hospitals and doctors?
A: News showed that the FDA program approved gene therapy technology and the first gene therapy was expected to be approved in January 2018. In addition, an RNAi (RNA interference) drug has entered the main clinical endpoint of third phase clinical trials. MicroRNA and its antagonist therapy are promising new techniques for treating diseases at genetic level. With the wide application of this technology in clinic, many harmful clinical drugs and therapies will be eliminated and replaced. However, new therapies will have their own advantages and shortcomings. While old things cannot fade away immediately, new findings will also face many challenges to retain their own status. Hospitals and clinicians should keep up with"

Reporter Plasmid Construction
Figure 1: Recipient bacteria carrying our reporter plasmid (AmpR and RFP)
Killer Plasmid : design and construction
Design
We received a mobilizable plasmid (pK18mob) carrying Kanamycin resistance gene and OriT. Our purpose in to combine its conjugative capabilities with the Crispr/Cas9 system, so the final killer plasmid will be able to conjugate and to cut           a target gene (the RFP gene and Ampicillin resistance gene). So, from the pK18mob, we have inserted the Crispr/Cas9 system : the Cas9 gene, and a single guide RNA.
We have design two single guide RNA, to target the RFP gene and the Ampicillin resistance gene by Crispr/Cas9 system. The sequence was design in Benchling, and carry : cut/ligation sites at extremities, promoter pJ23119, the guide RNA           and the terminator. Three DAM site (GATC) was cleaned, to avoid methylation. This sequence was synthetized by IDT.
Figure 2: Schematic representation of our system
Construction Step 1: integration of Cas9 gene
From the plasmid pCAS, we have cut the Cas9 gene (4469bp with its promoter and terminator) with NEB digestion enzyme, and we have inserted it by ligation (with T4 ligase) in the plasmid pK18mob (3793 bp, received from C.E.N). We verify             the presence of Cas9 sequence insertion in our cloned bacteria by performing a Miniprep and an enzyme digestion to linearize the plasmid, and check its size.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

Results & Discussion
LacI - pLac
LacI represses the frequently used promoter, pLac. The binding of LacI to pLac is competitively inhibited and the repression of pLac is weakened by introducing 8 LacI-binding-sites on pSB1C3 (a high-copy-plasmid). By introducing 8 tandem repeats of LacI binding sites on pSB1C3 in addition to pLac-RBS-GFP-d.term on pSB1A2, it is expected that the binding of LacI to pLac is competitively inhibited which can be visually tracked by GFP expression. Moreover, longer LacI binding sites  (more than 8 binding sites) is thought to capture more LacI and enhance GFP expression more effectively.
ArgR - ArgR binding site
rocF is the gene coding the enzyme that converts L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. By introducing rocF, e.coli obtains the urea cycle. ArgR is the common repressor of the bacterial arginine biosynthetic genes. By introducing ArgR binding sites, the probability that ArgR binds to the operator of the arginine biosynthetic genes falls and arginine biosynthesis is derepressed. (Tokyo Tech 2011) By introducing ArgR binding sites (including 8 binding sites) on pSB1C3 (high-copy-plasmid) in addition to Ptrc-RBS-rocF on pSB6A1 (low-copy-plasmid), ArgR is sequestered by ArgR binding sites and arginine biosynthesis is derepressed, so that urea production rate is expected to rise compared to Ptrc-RBS-rocF on low-copy-plasmid / ArgR binding site"
Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,": Receiver cells that contain the indicator plasmid could be distinguished from sender cells due to the presence of the GFP.
1b. Control constructs
As a positive control, we used senders carrying a complete helper plasmid (gene VIII present) and a messaging phagemid carrying the M13 origin of replication and an RFP expression cassette (BBa_K314110- BBa_J04450). With the helper plasmid intact and all phage proteins expressed, we expect the phage machinery to recognize the M13 origin and package the messaging phagemid to be sent to the receiver population.
M13 ori- RFP cassette (pSB1C3) (BBa_K314110- BBa_J04450)
HPdO (BBa_K1039016)
As a negative control to confirm the necessity of the M13 origin, we performed an experiment identical to the positive control using a messaging phagemid that is missing the M13 origin. Without the M13 origin, we expect no transmission of the messaging phagemid. We also performed a negative control for the gene VIII complementation experiment wherein the messaging phagemid was missing the M13 ori.

To demonstrate the need of gene VIII for viral packaging, we added a negative control to the experiment that is identical to the gene VIII complementation experiment, but with the messaging phagemid lacking gene VIII (ie no gene VIII was present in the system).

UNITN-Trento,2012,Team:UNITN-Trento#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"2°C higher for the annealing step and a 30s longer initial denaturation) proves successful . Along with Andrea, who’s making the same thing with her CysDes, I use the Master Mix for Gibson’s Assembly and transform it in the good old DH5a. The screening, again, is kind of ambiguous. It seems, though, that the GFP is not there.
Coming back to characterization, I have to say this phase of the project is very tiring. I’ve to stay until late hours to get to 8h of induction. I also add serial dilutions to the mess: at 4h and 8h I plate serial dilutions of the cultures to estimate the number of cells, as measuring O.D is not a direct method.      Growth curves results are accumulating, I now have triplicates and have to      find the time to analyze them.
By the end of the week minipreps of the Tragedy are screened, confirmed      and sent for sequencing. I try with one that looks good on the gel in      NEB10b.
I finally optimized the protocol for the characterization! First step of growth (until OD reaches 0.3-0.4) is done in LB broth, then the colture is splitted, spinned and resuspended in MOPS, half with glycerol as carbon source, the other half with glucose. Growth continues in the new medium until OD reach 0.6, then cultures are induced. This shortens considerably the time from the fresh inoculation and the induction, and bought me some more sleep too!      This week I fully tested K731260: I tested the effect of  different concentrations of arabinose, and expression over time in LB broth and MOPS (both with glycerol and glucose as carbon source).
This was very tiring. I had too many things to do, and as they were not enough I had also to prepare the Biochemistry exam. But as it usually happens in situations when you are tired a lot of mistakes are made, starting from my usual unlucky construct K731600: this time the digestion did not work, and I had to transform twice before screening. I also started to prepare a new construct (K731660) with a different low-copy plasmid, pSB6A1, but the digestion did not work.
Fortunately I was lucky with another new construct, K731480: it contains LacI-CysDes+sfGFP into pSB1C3 (PCR gel photo 1 and 2), and I constructed this BioBr"

Macquarie_Australia,2017,Team:Macquarie Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," first round as gas was leaking however with tubing switched out, and a few other adjustments to ensure no leakage, we collected a decent sample of hydrogen gas. Enough for a pop test.
This week we cut two bands from the Fer SDS page gel in readiness for mass spectrometry.
Since this gel wasn’t very photographic we thought it was worthwhile to replicate.
We continued to collect data from our Clark electrode and ran into an unexpected anomaly.
Our non- transformed DH5α E. coli are producing much more hydrogen than expected. So much so we are unsure that the culture can be trusted.
We mini-prepped to see if our cells contained plasmid and made a rooky mistake of using wash without ethanol which gave us haywire poor quality nanodrops.
Third time we got it right and oddly there was a little plasmid present. Even though growing up new mature cultures is a setback it is the only solution at this point so we plated up some cultures in readiness for Monday.
This week we also began collaboration work for Singapore NTU by initially transforming BL21 cells with their plasmids then growing these up in liquid culture.

We set up three more inverted measuring cylinder set ups, full of water and linked to cultures via a tube, to measure total volume of gas produced by three cultures: non-transformed DH5α, Omega induced and Fer/Hyd induced. The race is on to see which makes the most gas.
The question remains how much of that gas is hydrogen? Knowing some of that gas will be carbon dioxide, a sample of gas was drawn from each measuring cylinder and injected into sealed test tubes containing barium hydroxide which creates a solid precipitate when it reacts with CO2. By weighing this precipitate, we hope to determine just how much of this gas is carbon dioxide. We also weighed a sample of gas, comparing it to the weight of the equivalent volume of air, and hydrogen, to estimate the percentage of hydrogen in our gas.
Maldi TOF mass spectrometry (MS) was used to assess. Fer.

Tokyo_Tech,2016,Team:Tokyo Tech#Medal_-_-_TEXT.html," RFU of GFP / Turbidity of the samples cultivated at 18°C was higher than those cultivated at 37°C.
The above results indicate that this promoter is induced at low temperatures.
2． Rhl system assay
Here shows how we changed the rhl promoter to the one that suited our project best. We conducted an experiment using BBa_K1949060 .
Fig. 6-3-2-1. Our original improved Prhl(NM) is much more sensitive to C4HSL than Prhl(WT).
A single point mutation was inserted in a wild type rhl promoter( BBa_R0071 ).
In the experiment, an AHL reagent was included in the reporter, and then we measured the RFU.
As a result, the mutant promoter Prhl(NM), which is stronger than a wild type promoter, was newly obtained.
Fig. 6-3-2-2. The Signal-to-Noise (SN) ratio of Prhl(NM) is higher than that of past improved Prhl(LR), and Prhl(NM) does not crosstalk to C12 unlike
iGEM 2014 team Tokyo_Tech has improved the rhl promoter. However, comparing the Prhl(NM) with the Prhl(LR), the SN ratio of Prhl(NM) was higher than that of Prhl(LR). Also, the graph shows that Prhl(LR) has crosstalk with C12 at a specific proportion. If we use it in the recreation of Snow White, and the  crosstalk between the promoter and C12 will mean that the Queen eats the Poisoned Apple, which she produced herself, and dies. Therefore, this promoter cannot be used in our project.
The graph also shows that Prhl(NM) almost have no crosstalk with C12.
Based on the results above, we can say that we found a promoter with strong activity, and it almost have no crosstalk with C12,  which is the most suitable one for our story.

Tsinghua-D,2012,Team:Tsinghua-D#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"  potential application in the fermentation industry is discussed:  the software provides a new method for  achieving controlled expression of products in the fermentation industry.
RNA Thermometer (RNAT)
Residing in the 5’ untranslated  region (5’UTR) of the entire mRNA, the RNA thermometer (RNAT) is a kind of  temperature-sensing sequence.  As the  environmental temperature changes, the RNAT folds into a series of different secondary  structures.  Several of the structures  block ribosomes’ access to the mRNA thus hinder translation (referred to as  unmelted structure).  Other structures cause  ribosomes’ binding to the mRNA and the initiation of translation (referred to  as melted structure).  By shifting from  the two kinds of structures, the RNAT regulates gene expression in the level of  translation (1). 
The software RNAThermo designs RNATs that meet the  given parameters
Based on biological and physical  principles, adapting computer algorithms, TNAThermo designs RNATs that meet the  given parameters.  What the user tells  the software are the regulation temperature, the structure (both unmelted structure  and melted structure) of the RNAT and the SD sequence position of the RNAT.  RNAThermo gives the sequences of RNATs that fulfill  these requirements. 
The design of RNATs based on biological principles
The principle behind the RNATs’ response to temperature is fundamental: At  low temperatures, the sequence that binds to ribosomes will be trapped in a  hairpin structure.  Increasing  temperature destabilizes the structure such that the trapped sequence becomes  accessible, allowing translation to be initiated.  The following (Figure 1) is the schematic diagram (2):
 
Figure 1.  Structural change of RNAT’s according to the environmental  temperature.  The SD stands for  Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which is recognized and bind by ribosome to initiate translation.  The AUG stands for start codon, from where  the translation begins.
One example for this mechanism is the  regulation of E.Coli’s rpoH gene (Figure 2).  Responding to  environmental temperature change, rpoH gene regulates the expression of the heat shock protein.  Low temperature (30℃)  induces a bend in the ribosome-binding site (RBS)-associated downstream box  (DB) region, thereby interfering with ribosome binding.  High temperature (42℃)  disrupts the bend and initiates the process of translation (3"

Protocol
Sample Collection
Take cells out of the incubator and wash them with PBS 3x
Lyse the cells (we used three different protocols for this step: Freeze-Thaw Protocol for Protein Samples , Glass Beads Cell Lysis Protocol for Protein Samples )
This solution should be gooey once you collect it. Boil your sample at 95°C for 5 minutes and pass it through a 20-200uL pipette. If the lysate is passing freely (i.e. not gooey) then freeze the sample or do protein assay. If the lysate is still gooey boil it again and repeat the steps until it is no longer gooey
Protein Quantification
Add 20uL of reagent S to each mL of reagent A that will be necessary for the run. This makes reagent A’ (If the solution precipitates warm the solution and vortex. Do not pipette the solution the precipitate might clog the tip)
Prepare standards (use BSA at 0.2mg/mL, 0.5mg/mL, 1.0mg/mL and 1.5 mg/mL)
In a 96 well plate put in 5µL of your standards as well as your samples in triplicates. Make sure to map it out first

Raneem: I don’t know if you know about this but the government has also decided not to proceed with regulations to ensure households and new homes would be zero-carbon. Why is that?
Terry: I haven’t got a clue. I’m not involved with national and local policies. These decisions are made by people higher than me. I think we should look at carbon footprint and do what we can do. A lot of houses are built with solar panels and insulation to start with to save energy. I support that.
Raneem: My final question is what projects has the local council of Canterbury been involved in that involve renewable energy? Right now, there is the unibus which uses biofuel going around. What other projects are there? Or that you know of?
Terry: I know they monitor pollution on the roads
Raneem: How do they do that? Do you know?
Terry: Yes, they have monitors in certain parts of the city
Raneem: and they just collect the data
Terry: Yes, they have done quite a lot of monitoring. They have done a trial traffic scheme. Through the Westgate towers, which was a big issue, they stopped all the buses from going through the towers. Changed the traffic routes and people were against it. It improved some things and made some things worse than others. It didn’t work.  And in the end the whole scheme had to be scrapped. They got a lot of data about pollution. It got better in some areas when they changed the routes and other areas got worse.
Raneem: There was no balance
Terry: No, but I do agree with the biofuel buses. I think they might increase their fleet later. That’s good.
Raneem: Do you know within the UK of projects going on?
Terry: From the top of my head, No. Too much of my time has taken up by local issues.
Lee: Has there been a lot of local complaints regarding renewable energy area or energy efficiency?
Terry: personally I don’t get complaints. I know a lot more people are getting solar panels. I think they have become more popular. The government did have a scheme at one time were they were encouraging people to insulate their houses more and offered an incentive to people.
Lee: Have you been following the UN Climate change conference that is about to happen?
Terry: No
Lee: Know of anyone who is going?

iv. Discussion
The efficiency of PiggyBac transposon system ranged from about 2% for one transposon to 0.5% for five transposons [3]  So it’s quite possible for us to screen out the cells with single or low copies of NeoLoxp.
In practical experiments, the selected CHO-K1 cell transfected with NeoLoxp by then had NeoLoxp copy number of around 4, which was not good enough. The reason may be that the designed primer was not so satisfying. Also, the contamination during real-time PCR was hard to avoid. To get cells with single copy of NeoLoxp, we still need to design better primers as well as paying attention to the experiment operations.
III. Directed Evolution
After we’ve selected the CHO-K1 cell transfected with single copy of NeoLoxp, we could transfect mutated TRPC5 into the cell’s genomic DNA using Cre-Loxp recombination system. Then we would use fluorescence activated cell sorting(FACS) to select the cells with high intensity of GFP after long term stimulation. To realize high-throughput screening, we designed a device as shown in the figure below. Cells are seeded at the larger area side of the bottle, and the bottle is fixed above vortex through a holder and foam. Then we are going to place this device in cell culture incubator with vortex running for 20 hours, to fulfill long term mechanical force stimulation.
Figure 17. Self-designed Device for Long Term Stimulation
After the first round of mutation and screening, we still need to continue mutation based on the previous result. We will extract genomic DNA of the screened-out CHO-K1 cell, performing polymerase chain reaction with the mutation primer and sending the PCR product for sequencing. Through alignment of the mutated TRPC5 with normal one, we could clearly see which base site has been mutated. Combing with the TRPC5 structure we’ve known, we may explain why the specific site mutation could induce channel’s greater sensitivity to mechanical force. Then we could specify the mutation region every time, repeating then huge-library mutation and high-throughout screening procedure, thus realizing directed evolution.
Ideally, we would like to screen out then mutated TRPC5 with high sensitivity to"

The 2013 TU-Eindhoven iGEM team started their ""synthetic facts"" project . With this they want to bring the world of synthetic biology closer to everyone (scientist & non-scientist) in a correct manner. They provide facts that are thoroughly analysed by different teams and given a final statement noting that the fact is either true, false or undecided. We were happy to contribute some of our time to checking a fact and got this nice medal for it!
BeNe(Lux) – UGent & Groningen
In the beginning of July, the idea of organising a debate attracted us. After consulting multiple people (Professors, PhD students,…), we found out that everyone noticed the need for such a debate. Furthermore, they advised us to give the general academic public an introduction on synthetic biology and iGEM. The idea was therefore extended to a symposium followed by a debate. We invited all teams of the BeNe(Lux), from which the team of UGent and Groningen responded positively. After introductory seminars by Prof. J. Robben and Prof. K. Verstrepen, and our own project presentation, we were pleased to welcome the team of Groningen. After a five hour drive they still kept their enthusiasm for the Symposium. After some ‘Belgian’ fries we were ready for the debate. The end of the day was closed with a reception where the people could further debate.

What is ESOF?
ESOF (EuroScience Open Forum) is the largest interdisciplinary science meeting in Europe. It is dedicated to scientific research and innovation and offers a unique framework for interaction and debate for scientists, innovators, policy makers, business people and the general public. Created in 2004 by EuroScience, this biennial European forum brings together over 4,000 researchers, educators, business actors, policy makers and journalists from all over the world to discuss breakthroughs in science. More than 40% of the participants are students and young researchers. Following Stockholm in 2004, Munich in 2006, Barcelona in 2008, Turin in 2010, Dublin in 2012, Copenhagen in 2014 and Manchester in 2016, the city of Toulouse was chosen to host this unique European event for the first time in France, which took place from 9th to 14th July 2018.
Why were we at this event?
We participated in this event in association with our partner laboratory LISBP. An event of the magnitude of ESOF brings together delegates from more than 80 countries, journalists and science communicators but also conferences, workshops and scientific sessions. This event was open to the general public and more than 5000 participants attended. Taking part in ESOF was a unique opportunity for our iGEM team INSA UPS Toulouse to create links, discuss and debate with the scientific community worldwide but also with the general public. Furthermore this allowed us to communicate about our project to an international audience.
What did we do?
For one week, we operated a stand in collaboration with the LISBP. We presented microbiology with 3 activities. The first one was to question people about what they know about microbiology. We used a card game to start the discussion with the public with question like: “do you think that you can adopt a pet that came from lab experiments in France?” or “Do you think that you can find GMO in human foods?”. In a second part, we performed some activities around DNA and an observation of yeasts and onion cells with a microscope. We also offered to the public to extract banana DNA. At the end of our stand, we explained iGEM and the iGEM team INSA UPS with poster presentations.
Conclusion
This event was extremely enlighting for our team, as much for the human relations as for our personal development. It was noted that most people do not know much about microbiology but are inclined to learn new things."

1 MaSp2 Polymerase Chain Assembly
Set up 2 50 uL reactions following the same protocol from yesterday scaled to 50 uL for 2AB. We included the following modifications:
∙ Annealing temperature: 64 C
∙ 25 cycles instead of 20
∙ Used primers 2A-F, 2B-R
2 Results
Cast 1.5% TAE agarose gel. Used 3 uL of NEB 50 bp ladder.
Figure 1: Each band corresponds to 25 uL reaction of MaSp2.
This protocol works better than the one previously. The target product at 170 bp is clearly more intense. While there is still some primer dimer formation, we will stick with this protocol."

Idea 9
Using Na+ pump, we can make electricity: many related studies exist. There are microorganisms, which circulate electron. If we use this system in bacteria we might make battery.
Idea 10
RBCs can trap virus because virus can't replicate in RBCs. Such system can only delay infection; it is no cure. Therefore, it is not perfect system. However, many possible applications remain; we can use it for rabies because the infection proceeds faster than healing process.
Idea 11
There are many steps in mammalian cell replication. If we make a mammalian cell replicable in vitro, it would be very convenient for researchers.
Idea Sum-up
We can work on mammalian cell replication tool or DDS that works on respiratory system. So, we decided to dig more on those topics.

Although there are some difference in bacteria density between strain K1755007 and strain K1755008 at the same time, the difference isn't obvious. Statistical analysis also shows that the difference of bacteria density between K1755007 and control group isn't obvious, but the difference of bacteria density between K1755008 and control group is remarkable.

Fig 5-D Riboflavin concentration of  K1755007 and K1755008 bacterial strains vary with time.
After linking different parts, riboflavin expression level is distinctly different because K1755007 is constructed with strong promoter and strong RBS so that it has the strongest ability to produce riboflavin followed by K1755008, which is weaker than K1755007. The experimental phenomena coincide with theoretical analysis, showing that K1755007 and K1755008 both can work. Some problematic data have been removed.
Figure5-E
 
Fig 5-E The ratio of riboflavin and bacteria concentration of different kinds of BL21 vary with time.
Through the ratio curve of riboflavin and OD value from the same serial number and the same time point, we can intuitively know that K1755007 and K1755008 can observably improve riboflavin production in E.Coli and K1755007 behaves batter than K1755008.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," but they have got their own reasons why they keep the animals together with them in the same house. So here we are using the same theory, because [in] areas that are doing that, trachoma is a problem. And in areas, where they donˋt stay in the same house with animals the incidence is low.
Daniel C.:
That really plays for a study there, because we went through all the research papers and couldn’t find anything.
David Chinyanya:
Yes, we haven’t done any study it just shows, not as scientifical research, but you just observe, as you were saying, where you are seeing this dung, dusty, dirty places. Especially when the dung component overweights you find that there is a lot of trachoma there. If you have the chance of going up North of Malawi, where those things are not there we didnˋt find any trachoma. The people keep the animals away from the house. I went myself to the island in the lake Malawi, Likoma. I didnˋt see the animals like you are always seeing them here. I was there for four days, I didn’t even see one case of trachoma. Not even a case. So theoretically it might be along those lines. When you come down here, [the people say] because I am afraid of my animals that they can be away, outside my house, I put them in my house, the problem is there.
Daniel C.:
Thank you. This was very interesting.

As Prof. Kalua´s personal assistant and project assistant in data management as well as information and communication technology, she was able to give us deep insights into the day to day work at BICO. We also learned from Salomie how BICO collects and analyzes trachoma epidemiologic data and how that contributes to the fight against the disease in Malawi.

We have a lot of general questions concerning your trachoma mapping efforts in Malawi and the general measures you take to fight the disease.

NAU-CHINA,2018,Team:NAU-CHINA#human practices_-_-_TEXT.html," It will bring drug resistance and doctors may not be able to find a suitable target. Nowadays, immunotherapy are developing fast. Although the efficacy is excellent, it is still limited. Maybe it is the future direction of development. 4. Q: How is basic research translated into clinical treatment? Prof. Yang Chenghua: Basic research 3-5 years, development of drugs for 3-5 years, the total time is about 20 years. The antibody drug is relatively fast, and it can basically be marketed in about ten years. There are currently some common targets that use these targets to do some medicine. 5. Q: What do you think is the best cancer treatment? Prof. Chen Jianfeng: Personalized treatment, based on the different cancer symptoms of each patient. In the future, because cancer is not a problem of cells or genes, but a systemic disorder, it is good to hope that the system of the human body will be restored to normal by disorder. 6. What do you think about the current relatively high cost of cancer treatment? Prof. Ji Hongbin: Treating a disease is not an individual's behavior and requires government involvement. For the cost of treatment, the individual has to bear part of it, the state has to bear a part, and the insurance has to bear part of it. The research and development of drugs is imperative. China must increase the intensity of drug research and development, and it cannot rely solely on import and imitation. We must look at this society from a development perspective. Over the past decade or so, China’s basic scientific research and drug research and development have made great progress and leap. I believe that in the next decade or so, China will certainly have great development.
Science Popularization Activities
Through the preliminary search on the Internet and the investigation of the public, we learned that the public has insufficient knowledge about cancer and cancer treatment, and there are many misunderstandings. In order to spread the knowledge about cancer and cancer treatment to the public, eliminate the public's misunderstanding of cancer, and let the public establish a correct understanding of cancer, we decided to conduct science popularization activities. First of all, we have integrated the relevant knowledge collected in the previous period. Our sources of information include relevant literature, interviews with relevant information obtained by researchers of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and authoritative medical institutions. We repeatedly verify the information to be displayed to ensure the authenticity, scientificity, reliability and authority of the information and to avoid misleading the public. At the same time, we have also optimized the language of the materials to make them more interesting and popular"

The sequence of pR was then flanked by an upstream strong promoter and strong ribosome binding site (RBS) combination (BBa_K880005), and a downstream double terminator (BBa_B0015) to maximize expression of PR protein. This final construct (BBa_K2229400; figure 2-2) was ordered from IDT and cloned into pSB1C3, a biobrick backbone (BBa_K2229400; figure 2-4). We designed PCR primers to isolate the pR open reading frame (ORF), and then cloned it into pSB1C3 (BBa_K2229450; figure 2-3 and 2-5). Sequencing results from Tri-I Biotech confirmed that our final construct and the pR ORF are correct.

Using a solution containing 60 nm CC-AgNPs (from Sigma Aldrich), we tested PR’s ability to trap CC-NPs as we hypothesized. Because CC-AgNP solution is yellow in color, we can take absorbance measurements. Two groups were set up: E. coli carrying either BBa_K2229400 (PR expression construct; figure 2-2) or a negative control BBa_E0240 (GFP-generator) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth overnight.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Notebook#Engineering#ODF_-_-_TEXT.html,", as seen by the regression coefficient. In fact, 3.416 and 3.461 are such close together, that the minor deviation could be just measuring inaccuracy. Therefore, we fix the regression coefficient for converting true OD of our device to true OD of the photospectrometer to an average of 3.432 .
Additionally, the function $f$ for mapping transmittance to true OD for our device is similar for all cell types, as seen in the following figure. Therefore the exponential regression curve for all cell types specifies this function.
Transmission of different cell types at OD-values from 0.001-1
The transmittance data of NIH 3T3 cells (mouse fibroblasts) align with the transmittance of P. putida and S. cerevisiae strains, even though the measured optical densities are lower by 1-2 orders of magnitude.
Finally, we have empirically determined our $OD(T)$ function by finding $f$ and $g$, such that we can convert true OD to the optical density of the photospectrometer.
By this evaluation, we have shown that our self-build OD/F Device can compete with commercial systems. It is easy to calibrate by just calculating the true optical density.
Evaluation of the Fluorescence Measurement
For the evaluation of the fluorescence measurement, we performed a dilution series of a constitutively GFPmut3b expressing E. coli.
The below figure shows the absolute measurements for both the platereader and our OD/F Device. The abrupt jump at 50% concentration can be explained by a second dilution step and is prevalent in both devices. It can be seen that the platereader show a much higher difference between the GFP and non-GFP cell culture at a higher standard deviation. Another interesting metric is the difference between the GFP and non-GFP, which can be seen as the normalized fluorescence measure.
Fluorescence Measurement comparison OD/F Device and Platereader (absolute values)
Comparison of a fluorescence measurement of our device and the platereader. Our OD/F Device shows no significant linearity.
If one compares the results there, as in the below figure with normalized fluorescence values, interesting observations can be made. First, both platereader and OD/F Device show very similar results. The regression curves differ only in a linear factor. Most interestingly the general fit of the OD/F Device to a linear function seems to be better than the platereader. Overall the linearity which has been observed earlier (in testing the general setup) could be verified. Therefore our do-it-your"

Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide
   Using electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to synthesize formic acid, methanol and other one-carbon compounds is a highly efficient and a green carbon dioxide fixation method. In the reaction system, through the external power supply, the buffer can be ionized and then protonated with carbon dioxide, resulting in a series of reactants. By using different electrodes, buffer systems, and loading different voltages, different reaction products can be produced. Among them, formic acid and methanol are considered the most potential for the development of electrical conversion products.[6] The AACHEN 2015 team introduced one synthesis of methanol using electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide pathway as a sustainable carbon source. For the spacecraft, achieving he controllable recovery of carbon dioxide and making use of electricity are a safe and easy way.
Figue 4, CO2 Reduction Thermodynamics & The Strategy of Hydrogenation of CO2 to Formic Acid.
   At present, some scientists have made carbon dioxide synthesis of formic acid conversion rate increased to 80% or more(up to 96%).[7]This is much more than the current conversion rate of about 0.2% of the actual conversion of methanol from carbon dioxide. [8] Moreover, the toxicity of formate is much lower than that of methanol. It is beneficial for the synthesis of carbohydrates to use formic acid as carbon source. It is clear that formic acid is more suitable as a sustainable carbon source than methanol.
   So, how can we make E.coli assimilate formic acid? There are few pathways of formic acid assimilation in nature, and we have searched through the literature to find a path that has been validated. The use of two enzymes, ACS and ACDH can turn formic acid into formaldehyde.[9]
Figue 5, Investigator Peng Kang, from TIPC of CAS, designed a electrical device which can transform carbon dioxide into Formaldehyde. Amazingly, the conversion efficiency could be more than 80%.
   The synthesis of glycogen was achieved by using the synthetic route of formaldehyde to D-xylulose, the partial methanol assimilation pathway and glycogen metabolic pathway.

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
The sheer amount that our project has developed since its inception is extraordinary.  The amazing work here at NUSGEM definitely would definitely not have been possible without the invaluable guidance and unfailing kindness of those who have helped us, in one way or another. In this spirit, credit must be given where it is due, and we would like to express our utmost gratitude to the following people and organizations who saw the value in our humble project,  and selflessly offered their expertise for the betterment our project.
We would like to wholeheartedly thank Associate Professor POH Chueh Loo and Assistant Professor Jimmy Chih-Hsien PENG, our greatest cheerleaders.  Both of these Professors toiled tirelessly for our project since its conception, and provided the team constant direction and well-meaning motivation every step of the way.
PART 1: IDEA GENERATION
The team brainstormed project ideas from February to late May.  During this period, the team received constructive and detailed feedback on all of our preliminary project ideas from Professor Richard KITNEY from Imperial College London  - he was a great critic, and imparted the wisdom gleaned from his many years of iGEM involvement to us. Professor Paul FREEMONT, also from Imperial College London, was instrumental in opening our eyes to the fashion industry that was fraught with issues, and provided us with much-needed inspiration to pursue a problem within the fashion industry.
PART 2: WET LAB
Lab work began in late May.  We were fortunate to have a team of treasured advisors and instructors who patiently guided us in our experiments  - Dr. LIM Yan Ping, Mr. ZHANG Jingyun, and Dr. Saravanan Prabhu NADARAJAN, who taught us the fundamental laboratory techniques necessary for our experiments, gave us a primer on interpreting laboratory data, showed us the ropes of primer"

Here we could modify them by removing helixes and use them                  for further calculations in online software  tools, like Flexpepdock, to calculate binding strength.
Characterization with Bilkent Unam Team
After the iGEM Turkey Meet-up, the Bilkent UNAM team has further contacted us for help. During their presentation in the meetup, they have told us about their project and how they were aiming to use magnets but they didn't have enough.
In order to benefit from the situation, we have talked to our physics teachers at school and asked whether we could improve and then borrow the magnets we use at school and lend them to UNAM. After a few days, we have prepared the magnets to help them characterize their parts. The next day, we met in front of our school and lended them the magnets and further discussed the status of our projects. At the moment we are looking forward to our next collaboration and hoping to hear good news from them and their experiments.
Collaboration with TUDelft
With TUDelft team, we have collaborated to help each other. We have communicated numerous times via Instagram, especially when we faced an obstacle, and since they were an Overgraduate team, they were very knowledgeable. We appreciate their help and their thoughtfulness.

Week 1 (May 29 - June 4)
Wetlab Summary
Starting off the summer by cloning parts that will enable us to test the basic functionality of the mf-Lon for protein degradation. These parts consist of pBad and J231** parts for all of the sfGFP pdt tag variants, as well as mf-Lon. Currently we have confirmed versions of 3 of 6 J231** sfGFP variants, as well as an mf-Lon under the control of J231**.
Outreach Summary
We began to lay down the foundation for our big outreach project, which will become a searchable database of past outreach projects from award-winning teams. Project categories are being brainstormed in addition to tags for different audiences.
Week 2 (June 5 - June 11)
Wetlab Summary
Continued to make progress towards functionally validating and testing our mf-Lon and pdt parts. While our pBad sfGFP pdt tags have been lagging behind, we moved ahead with making combination parts for our simple circuit (LacI pdt and pLac sfGFP pdt combos), and we have been validating our existing mf-Lon and pdt tagged sfGFPs. From the current data, it appears that some of our sequence confirmed pdts are working, while others are not. However, all of our mf-Lons are functional.
Outreach Summary
We entered information about 2016 and 2015 IHP/EPE award-winners and decided to move the database information to a spread sheet to make it easier to eventually create a website. Alyssa met with Professor Griffin, who specializes in community-based research and outreach. We worked on the PowerPoint"

Then we compare Model 1 with Model 2.
Analysis: According to the graph, we can conclude that two models have relatively large differences( The difference of Subtraction Model has a range of -0.10~0.06 μM and the difference of Division Model has a range of 0.65~1.05 ). This difference may result from the concentration difference of module 1 products and the extended units. When the concentration of the extended units more than that is needed to participate in the reactions, the concentration of Module 1 products is critical. At this time, it is suitable to choose Model 2. On the contrary, it is suitable to choose Model 1.

Compared with model 2 :
Analysis: According to the graph, we can There are relatively large differences between Model 3 and two models showed before. The initial rates of two models are relatively quicker than Model 3 and the concentration is more a half too.
In comparison of three models, we draw a conclusion that the simulation of DEBS1 catalyzed reactions is not accurate.
The possible reason are:
(1) Determination of kinetic constants is in specific environment. The constants provided from literature are not companied with the related data of environment. Therefore, we have no evidence to select the constants.
(2) In modeling work, we just simply mathematically stacked the kinetic equations. The model is too ideal. However, the model of the whole DEBS 1 is suitable to reality. So it is common of large differences.
(3) According to the related literature, reactions may occur on some linkers between two domains. We predict that we should consider the kinetic mechanism of reactions occurring on linkers. But this time, we have ignored it.

In the future, we will go on optimizing"

Bettencourt asked for project modelling advice, which we provided by suggesting that they could use MatLab and Molecular Dynamics for their model, as we were in the middle of building our modelling tools. As part of this, we also sent them a copy of the code of our model to assist them. Bettencourt assisted our team by sharing laboratory techniques, and putting us in contact with a Parisian team (the Pasteur Institute Paris team) who were also considering the legal dimensions of their project as an element of their human practices.
One of Bettencourt’s enzyme scaffolds was based on the StarScaffold system developed by the 2016 Melbourne University team . Bettencourt asked us to try reach out to them for more information as they had no luck contacting them. We contacted the team leader from 2016 through our 2016 team mentors, and emailed the PI of the project, however, we also had no luck with receiving a reply.
Pasteur Paris
Human Practices Legal Collaboration
Our UNSW team also contacted the Parisian Pasteur Institute’s team via Skype, following the earlier suggestion by Bettencourt. Initial email contact had led us to ask Pasteur a series of tricky legal questions with which we were having trouble, but needed to understand for part of our human practices. The Pasteur team kindly wrote a summary of both the French patent system and how the European Union affects (and does not affect) this law, as intellectual property is a supporting competence in the European Union so there is exclusive national jurisdiction.
The Skype call expanded on these questions, and we compared the systems in which our different teams were working. They also spoke about the Paris High Court, a specialist intellectual property court, which led to further research, and eventually formed the basis of one of the suggestions for improving the law’s relationship with science elucidated in our policy proposal. It also laid the ground for our team’s further consultation with Dr Alexandra George.

Chemoattractant Diffusion
The basic equations for the diffusion of the chemoattractant in the medium are the Fick laws of diffusion , which govern the variation of the concentration of a substance within a medium.
The flux J (that is, the amount of substance that flows through a given surface per unit of time mol m-2s-1) is given by:
where φ is the concentration (mol m-3) in a given point. D is a constant called the diffusion coefficient, and that depends on the medium .
Basically, the equation states that the is directed towards places with lower concentration (thus the minus sign). If the concentration is constant in the space (∇φ=0) there is no flux.
If the flux is known, it is possible to determine the amount of substance that goes through a small surface S and a small amount of time dt
In order to simulate the diffusion, we define the environment and discretize it in very small cells. Each cell determines a given volume V, and has a surface S. At a given time instant, the cell has an amount of substance c (and then a concentration c\V).
If the cells and time step Δt are small, we can consider that the gradient of concentration can be approximated though the differences in concentration between a cell i and 4 (or 8) neighbors j. Thus:
and then, the amount of substance that diffusses from i to j:
The following figure illustrates the basic elements of the simulation. The flux J between cells is computed by the difference of concentrations. Then, this flux is used to compute the amount of substance that will flow to the neighbour cell. The amount is proportional to the flux and the common surface between cells.
Bacteria motion
The main actuator of E. coli is a flagellar motor that can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. Through a set of transmembrane receptors proteins, E. coli is able to detect chemoattractants. Moreover, this detection influences the motion of the flagellar motor [Topp and Gallivan, 2007] .

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#dataAnalysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"iciency virus (HIV), and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), could be prevented through behavioral changes and infection controlling. Reducing unnecessary sun exposure can also prevent skin cancer effectively. At the same time, regular physical examination can help detecting early cancer. Thereby greatly increasing the survival rate, this could also be the reason for half of the teams focus on detecting cancer. The primary modalities of cancer treatment are surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, immune therapy, and targeted therapy, so it is innovative for the iGEM teams to treat cancer with synthetic biology.
E. Antibiosis
In the statistics, we found that projects focusing on Antimicrobial accounted the largest proportion in the Health and Medicine track, which shows the public attention in this area. According to our data, the amount of antibacterial projects are increasing year by year, and maintains a high level all the time. There are 37 projects in total of which most occur in North America, Europe and Asia. Thus, we looked into this area and find some interesting things. In the survey, we found that infectious disease, such as tuberculosis, meningitis, bacterial meningitis, cholera and influenza caused by bacteria, has a great impact on human health. There is also a big difference in their level of health care that it is difficult to prevent pathogen infection effectively in some areas because of different levels of economic development among regions. As a result, some of these projects try to prevent disease by detecting specific bacteria in vitro. Besides, antibiotic resistance is also a threat to us. Since the overuse of antibiotics, some bacteria have evolved resistance characteristics. For example, there were about 480 000 new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in 2013 and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has been found in 100 countries. Antibiotic resistance greatly hinders the prevention, control and treatment of infectious diseases and therefore new treatments against pathogens have been a focus of attention. Actually most of these projects have involved the treatment of communicable disease or killing pathogens. Some of them even involve a detection module to avoid breaking the ecological balance in vivo. We assume that there will be more teams study in this area and make further exploration to fight pathogens through synthetic biology.

Hg(II) Bioabsorption Device
Dsba-mbp(mercury metal binding peptide)+mbp(mercury metal binding peptide)+lpp-ompa-mbp(mercury metal binding peptide)
This part was designed to function as mercury(II) ions absorption device in our project. If T7 polymerase is inductively expressed, this device will be switched on and metal bind peptide will be dramatically expressed and translocated to cytosol, periplasm and outer membrane surface. Namely, bacteria bearing this device will function as whole-cell bioabsorbent in the presence of T7 polymerase.
Description:
As the main part of mercury bioabsorbant of our project, this device is designed to assemble three subparts----the T7promoter-rbs-Dsba-mbp-terminator, T7promoter-rbs-mbp-terminator and T7promoter-rbs-lpp-ompa-mbp-terminator (figure1), which can bind mercury separately in periplasm, cytosol and the membrane of E.coli, to make full use of the space and maximize the absorption of mercury. Since all these subparts are driven by their own T7 promotors, they can be expressed when T7polymerase exists.
1 Metal Binding Pepside(MBP)
MBP was designed as a single polypeptide that could fold into an antiparallel coiled coil. Previous work shows that artificial MBP chain still kept the in vivo metal-binding ability comparable to dimeric, full-length MerR, while it comprises less amino acids and will cost less for large-scale expression. Since our ultimate goal is to design a high-performance and less energy-consuming bioabsorbent, the MBP is an excellent candidate for the absorbent effector.The construction and structure of MBP are shown as followed.
2 Dsba-MBP
MBP was fused with DsbA, a periplasmic expression signal protein to construct periplasmic MBP.
3 Lpp-OmpA-MBP
Lpp-OmpA-mbp is designed as a fusion protein consisting of the signal sequence and first 9 amino acid of Lpp, residue 46~159 of OmpA and the metal binding"

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," homologous sequence. It was shown that the transformation efficiency is much higher with 3kb homologous regions than for example with 0.5kB but she is still high. In a cotransformation, however, it is important that the homologous regions are chosen to be slightly larger. There was a big difference between the efficiency of the transformation. For example, the efficiency is 6-fold lower with 1kb-flanks than with 3kb-flanks (Daliaet al.2017) . Moreover, you have to remember that you have to make multiple iterative cycles to get the complexity of genome edits in the population (Daliaet al.2014) . In each cycle it is important to change the antibiotic marker. An advantage is that the efficient in V. natriegens ist still high and you only need a low amount of the unselected product (25-50ng/108 CFU) (Daliaet al.2017) .
Figure 1:Schematic figure that shows how to build a cassette for integration. Amplify the upstream and downstream regions of the gene of interest and the antibiotic cassette with frt sites. These three Fragments will be fused.
To get in touch with the multiplex genome editing by natural transformation, we construct a linear DNA Fragment to transform. We have chosen an antibiotic resistance for selection, which has to be different to the resistance marker on the plasmid in the strain. Using a PCR we construct at first the chloramphenicol cassette with the frt sites and fuse this on the upstream and downstream regions of the gene we want to delete in order to integrate it by homologous recombination (Figure 1). In this case it was the dns. It was previously shown that cells with genetic modifications on this site did not developed unfavorable phenotype (Daliaet al.2017) .   To use the strain after completion of the modifications it is important to get the plasmid out. At first we inoculate a culture without the antibiotic in order to lose the plasmid with the tfox gene. Every 12h 10μl were plated out and with 10µl a new culture is inoculate. By doing that we don´t get the plasmid out, so we have to think about another technique for getting rid of the plasmid. For that we looked up again into the literature. We could find, that Ankur B. Dalia wrote that the plasmid is very stable and you can use the strain without antibiotic. Then we contacted him again to pray for help. He"

After our first step on the assembly of FnCas12a and crRNA was taken，we successfully tested sequence-specific             cleavage activity on plasmid and trans-cleavage activity on ssDNA. With tremendous trails, we optimized cleavage             protocol of both cis and trans cleavage. Last but not least, for achieving high-throughput detection on chips,             we dried the Janus on the chip, then incubated Cas12a protein and crRNA complex, and finally, the fluorescence             probe was cut and detected by fluorescence microscope. With the help of Janus, we were glad that higher fluorescence             values were detected under the condition of a smaller amount of materials.
