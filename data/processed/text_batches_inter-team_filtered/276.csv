Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget.

Rundt om ager og eng var der store skove, og midt i skovene dybe søer; jo, der var rigtignok dejligt derude på landet! Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.

Contamination of aquatic and terrestrial environments with crude oils (or petroleum) represents a serious problem worldwide that results in both immediate and long-term environmental damages with toxicity to plants and/or soil invertebrates, as well as risks to humans and wildlife.  Crude oils, while made of complex mixtures of thousands of types of molecular compounds, are predominantly composed of hydrocarbons including linear alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons based on a 6-carbon ring account for approximately 80% of the total petroleum hydrocarbons in crude oils.  Aromatic carbons such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like fluorene and phenanthrene are the molecular compounds in oil that are the most toxic as they can be quite persistent in the environment due to their intrinsic stability provided by the aromatic ring.
Contamination cleaning up processes include skimming the oil into containment tanks - an approach that cannot be applied on high seas and bad weather conditions-  and in situ burning - an approach that may create additional pollutants. Chemical dispersants are sometimes added to break down oil spills; however, the breakdown products may be absorbed by marine organisms and thus entered the food chain.
Clearly, bioremediation using microorganisms that naturally use crude oil as a source for growth and at the same degrade it is the preferred approach.  Up to now, bioremediation approaches have mostly targeted microorganisms already present in the ecosystem where the oil spill occurs. However, this approach has limited results because the decontamination can take decades because of slow degradation rate. Fertilizers such as nitrogen and phosphorous may be added to enhance their activities with the risk of local pollution.  The newest bioremediation products include a mixture of microorganisms that are able to deplete linear alkanes whereas the PAH class may not be degraded at all.
Our team’s design for the bioremediation of oil spills is based upon pumping in and treating water found in lakes, reservoirs, groundwater, and ocean water. Due to the flexibility of our project, this process can be carried out on ships, within bioremedi"

BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"s’, may have the job of ﬁnding the locations that particles need to be placed. Once found, they emit a chemoattractant signal that the second group, the ’workmen’ (which could be engineered in order to exert more force than normal), can use to move the particles to the necessary location. This could then be extended to allow bacteria to set locations that change over time leading to structures that evolve either due to a deﬁned genetic program, or environmental cues, whereby bacteria would assimilate necessary environmental information, and then decide on the best course of action.
Approach
This project brings together an array of different cellular processes including chemotaxis, environmental sensing and cell-cell communication. For this reason, we will attempt to use the bio-bricks registry as much as possible in addition to previous work by other iGEM teams (for instance [3] and [4]). In order to make the project manageable, the following milestones have been identiﬁed:
Preliminary Tests - The ﬁrst aspect we will investigate is how well bacteria can naturally move particles of differing sizes when swimming towards a chemoattractant. This differs from similar experiments in the literature, where bacteria were shown to move particles in a random manner without following any prescribed motion [5].
Sticky Particles - In the preliminary tests bacteria may naturally adhere and unadhere to the particle randomly. In an aim to improve the efficiency of particle movement, the propensity of attachment will be increased by physical lock-and-key bindings, e.g. biotin and streptavidin.
Binding Induced Chemotactic Activation - This builds on the previous milestone by modifying the bacteria so that a response to the goal chemoattractant is dependent on interaction with a particle. The bacteria will therefore move about randomly, ’searching’ for a particle. When they ﬁnd one, they will move it towards the goal.
Short Range Co-ordination - To allow many bacteria to work together, quorum sensing will be used through a quorum signaling molecule (currently we have identiﬁed AHL as a potential signal). Signal production will occur after binding to the particle, i.e. via gene expression changes, which will cause bacteria in the vicinity to switch on their response to the goal chemoattractant, and move towards it. Some of the bacteria that are signalled to will be in a position to impart a force on the particle towards the goal, and their co-ordinated effort will improve efficiency.
Long Range Co-ordination - To further improve efficiency, we might consider involving bacteria"

I am a recent graduate of METU Molecular Biology and Genetics       department and now studying towards my masters degree on Molecular       Bioengineering at METU. My interest in synthetic biology did       start during my undergraduate years and after graduation I started       up the Sentegen company which is the first biotechnology based       company focused on synthetic biology in Turkey. I continue my       research and training in synthetic biology while also contributing       to the development of the field in my country. We need new scientific       revolutions to solve huge problems of life and emerging field       of synthetic biology is best candidate for biotechnological       revolution. I am interested in synthetic biology applications,       along with Lab-on-a-Chip devices for molecular biology techniques,       and we are designing gene synthesis chips to produce biobricks       - raw materials of synthetic garage biology- faster and cheaper.       I enjoy snowboarding, cycling and write poems.

DLUT_China_B,2018,Team:DLUT China B#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"athy are needed for                         optimal clinical management.""[3] Studies have shown that the urine of diabetic nephropathy patients                         with beta2 microglobulin was abnormal 5 years earlier than that of urinary microalbumin.[4]
Our social practice survey found that people are much more receptive to urine tests than blood tests.                         So our project was launched to provide diabetes patients with a home, visual, portable test box for                         early and early kidney disease using beta2 microglobulin as a marker.
Principle brief introduction
In this project, we combined the highly specific nanobody with the highly sensitive liquid                         crystal detection to develop a detection method that meets the above conditions, and we hope to                         achieve the semi-quantitative visual analysis of ß2m in urine of 150-400ng/ml. The normal                         concentration of ß2m in human urine is about 150ng/ml, and other obvious symptoms appear when                         the concentration of buxi2m in urine is about 450ng/ml. Firstly, nanobody was selected to                         specifically bind the ß2m in urine, and long chain modification was carried out for improving                         detection sensitivity. We performed the sentinel modification of the nanobacteria using a method                         catalyzed by enterobacterium, and then linked other molecules with active and specialized                         aldehyde groups. Compared with traditional antibodies, nanobody has smaller molecular weight, is                         not easily denatured, and still has complete antigen-binding property. Moreover, the nanobody                         can be expressed by escherichia coli as the host, and the preparation cost is greatly                         reduced.
Fig.1 A schematic of catalysis in E. coli
More subtly, we took advantage of crystals' fluidity and anisotropy. First, the substrate of the                         liquid crystal pool was modified with an antigen, and then a certain concentration of nanobody                         and the mixture of the solution to be tested were added. After a period of reaction, some                         antibodies preferentially bound with the scaffold ß2M in the solution, and the other with the                         substrate ß2M. After the glass slides were rinsed, the microenvironment of the liquid crystal                         base changed due to the combination of ß2m and Nb, resulting in obvious color or light and shade                         differences of the liquid crystal, thus realizing the visualization of detection. Finally, we                         expressed the brightness of the liquid crystal with the gray value of the image, and established                         the relationship between the fixed antigen concentration of the liquid crystal substrate and the                         gray value of the image.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Notebook#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," we have calculated out the orthogonality of our experimental states, which goes the same with the result of the wet lab. We also calculated the relative protein expression level of the three states.
The Second Week of August
Seeking for appropriate perspective and problem to establish our modeling work, we have a good idea is to study how the gene pollution transferred within the environment. So we searched a lot of papers about genetic pollution and find an inspiring idea Bass Model which give us a spark to describe the genetic pollution.
The Third Week of August
With the basic equation in Bass Model, we are still searching papers and trying to apply this model into the real conditions. We have considered the disappearing of plasmid, the changing number of bacteria under ideal and real condition. We also considered the spatial diffusion of the equation and many other future work details.
The Fourth Week of August
We have also talked with the team member who are in charge of the human practice to search for new point to provide tasks for modeling, after thoroughly discussion, we have are surprisingly to find there are many points to be modeled. So we have searched important articles about the related problems, especially those related to AHP method.

Munich,2018,Team:Munich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,". Moreover, the expression quality was likewise increased after Lysozyme addition, indicating that the remaining enzyme does not interfere with protein biosynthesis.
Cell Extract Processing
Cultivation and cell lysis are the apparent most crucial steps in preparation of cell extract but there are other steps that can have a great impact on cell extract quality. Some of our findings regarding those steps are:
Freezing cell pellets overnight for next-day processing does not interfere with extract quality but confers a major simplification of cell extract preparation
Preliminary results indicate that omitting the run-off reaction after lysis does not significantly impair extract quality
Dialysis of cell extract can be substituted by diafiltration in centrifugal filters without reducing the expression yield of the resulting extract
Characterizing Cell Extract Quality
In order to validate the success of our optimization efforts, adequate characterization of cell extract is indispensable. Here we will give a short review about the tools for quality assessment we implemented. Further details about characterization of these tools are available on the Measurement page.
We had initially defined increase of protein content in cell extract as optimization goal. However, as we realized early on, protein content alone is not a good measure for extract quality, because it provides no information about the activity of the cellular machinery.
To assess functionality of cell extract, testing of protein expression is necessary, which can be achieved by expressing fluorescent proteins and measuring the fluorescence time trace in a plate reader. To find the optimal quality control we compared the performance of different fluorescent proteins in cell extract.
We chose expression of mTurquoise – a variant of Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) – as our favorite quality control for cell extract, as it results in high fluorescence intensity in a reproducible manner.
In addition, to examining protein expression we decided to analyze transcription uncoupled from translation by transcribing an RNA aptamer that binds a fluorescent dye.
We compared the fluorescence time trace of a Malachite Green binding aptamer in different cell extract samples. The fluorescence time traces decline after 30-50min, indicating that RNA degradation starts to prevail over transcription. Differences in the observed kinetics can be explained by variations in cell extract composition.
Cultivation and Extract Preparation Barely Impacts Cell Extract Composition
The main question was if the different performance of the cell extracts (P15, E10, myTXTL), especially concerning phage titers, is due to a divergent composition or caused by a discrepancy in activity of the relevant proteins e.g. transcription and translation related proteins     Therefore, one student was sent to Bavarian Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry Centre (BayBioMS), where"

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to DTU. A former team member, and current employee of Biotech Academy, set up the laboratory exercises and gave a lecture on BioBricks. Biotech Academy has helped us with the understanding of BioBricks and advised on our laboratory strategy. Furthermore we received an amilCP (BBa_K592009) culture from Biosensor to test our prototyped device in the early stages of the project.
In turn, we helped on the Biosensor project with their laboratory work by testing and developing response genes as well as optimizing production. The protocol was tested with our high school team member to make sure that it was understandable. Lastly, we gave a presentation about synthetic biology and our project at the Biotech Academy Camp for high school students.
Figure 3: These plates was made in collaboration with Biosensor. The second picture is posted on Biosensors webpage.
High school student
To spread word about iGEM and synthetic biology to future students within the field we invited a high school student, Minh Greulich, to be a part of the team.
Minh assisted on the interlab study, helped us test the protocol for the Biosensor project and did some creative work related to the wiki.
This is what Minh had to say about her experience being on the team:
""It was surprising for me,  to experience such a relaxed and playful environment, despite the very serious and difficult nature of the work. My takeaway from participating in the project was that biomedicine is a field of work, where you can be sure to contribute to improving the world, and still have a life whilst doing so.""
By helping us in the lab, Minh gained valuable skills and learned what it means to be a part of a team. She was eager to learn and was enthusiastic about the project.
Public Engagement
Snakebite is an urgent, neglected problem and we are immensely passionate about contributing to the solutions. The best way to combat such a vast, multi-faceted issue is to spread this enthusiasm to the future generations - semper ardens.
Social media
Through social media such as Facebook, our homepage, instagram, twitter, and snapchat we have informed the public and our fellow students about our project and synthetic biology as a means to address important societal problems.
Fairs and presentations
Our team has attended multiple fairs during the project.  At DTU’s Open House we talked to potential new students about the opportunities you get by starting at DTU and being a part of an iGEM team such as DTU BioBuilders. We also attended two student fairs held at DTU the DSE Fair and PF Study Fair"

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
When researching metal binding and interactions between metals and peptides, we realized that few teams or researchers focused on isolating the specific manner of interaction and determining the thermodynamic parameters pertaining to the affinity. We utilized a method called Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) to characterize this, and quantitively understand the specifics of how our rationally designed peptides and fusion proteins bound copper. The dual approach of understanding the molecular underpinnings of our filter in addition to more macroscopic effects (such as the Phen Green SK copper assay for bulk surface adsorption) allowed us to definitely conclude that our filter behaves according to our hypothesis and supports the claims pertaining to copper binding that we subsequently make What follows is a summary of how ITC (and QUARK ab initio modeling) was used in our study.
ITC Specifications
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; MicroCal iTC200) was employed to determine the association equilibrium constant (Ka), enthalpy (ΔH), and the number of ions bound per ligand (n). Ka describes the affinity of a ligand for its substrate, and we used it to quantitatively characterize the interaction between our peptide and copper [21]. All binding parameters for the test were within the specifications determined by the manufacturer. We used 10 mM, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer for testing because it does not cause metal ion interference, and has a stable pKa over a wide temperature and pH range. Experiments were conducted at pH 5.5 to prevent copper precipitation, and pre-made copper stock solutions of known concentration were used.
Peptides were prepared for ITC by dissolving lyophilized protein (powder) in MES buffer, and ITC experiments were run at 25°C and set to deliver 20, 0.5 – 1 µL injections of Cu at 150 second intervals. The metal solution in the syringe was titrated into the peptide solution in the cell,"

Grenoble,2011,Team:Grenoble#HumanPractice#developing_-_-_TEXT.html," (Life Sciences, Physics and Electronic Engineering and Computer Sciences).     None of them was involved in our project and synthetic biology was for most of them unheard of. Three quiz sessions were held on August 20th/October 25th in Grenoble and on September 20th in Paris.     The session in Paris involved the collaboration with iGEM Paris Bettencourt 2011 team and they recruited students from the Master Interdisciplinary Approach of the Living (AIV: Approche Interdisciplinaire du Vivant) from the Center of Interdisciplinary Research (CIR) at Paris Descartes University.
We prepared a quiz to evaluate the content and the efficiency of our flyers in promoting interdisciplinary communication skills.
Conclusion
From this experience, we learned how to overcome interaction difficulties between scientists of different fields and foster efficient communication between team members. The interdisciplinary approach of synthetic biology helped us to enlarge our views on topics that are indeed closely related to our work in iGEM, but that we sometimes forget when we are just ‘doing science and engineering.
Concretely, improving communication between modelers and biologist of the team made us realize the necessity to:
Characterize the initial state of the system.
Identify the crucial elements of the toggle switch and quorum sensing that should be measured.
Determine the necessary and sufficient set of parameters that specify the context and biological state of our system.

Our main goal was to fight Antibiotic Resistance, but the plasmidic CRISPR-Cas9 system is so efficient that we can imagine to target almost anything!
These are just our words, but our idea convinced many researchers around us and we have established to great agreement for testing our system, namely:
Royal Military Hospital Queen Astrid, Brussels
Our first and most important partnership! We first met them in February when our idea was a phage system as a therapeutic tool. After various brainstormings we decided to keep the Antibiotic Resistance as our main main topic but we switched to a plasmidic vector!
Jean-Paul Pirnay has always been a useful advisor. He’s a leading scientist in Europe for phage therapy and manages the microbiology lab of the military hospital. He took part to various amazing researches, including PhagoBurn.
The military hospital has a wide bacteria collection and our partnership with them will allow us to test our system on their strains, especially V. Cholerae!
We already have achieved our proof of concept!
Our next step: demonstrate the inter-species conjugation!
We are excited to cooperate with the military hospital and their support is a big acknowledgement of our hard work!
CHU Namur Mont-Godinne
This is a university hospital linked to our home university. In September, Pierre Bogaerts, from the microbiology lab, decided to test our system on his bacterial strains! We are very excited for this upcoming experience. The proof of concept was achieved, now it’s time to make it real!
The support of the hospital is very important for us, as the medical application is the ultimate goal of our project!
Last but not least the humanitarian journey in Benin, West Africa made by our colleague Sara, medical student and iGEMer, made us clear how important is to keep working and looking for new solutions! We saw with our eyes what bacterial infection can do when we are not prepared! We want to change it!
All these opportunities were a big plus for our project and they are the confirmation that it will not stop after the Jamboree! Boston will be a starting point for new exciting developments!

uniBOX - A lightbox built from lego!
Idea
Light inducible systems are more and more used in iGEM and synthetic biology in general. Team Munich for example uses a light inducible killswitch, while Shanghai uses light-controlled expression systems. Even our uniCAS gene regulation system is controllable via light . Therefore we thought of an easy and affordable way to build a light box to illuminate our cells with a certain wavelength. But construction of such a light box can be hard because there are certain problems you have to face like dimout but still enough oxygen supply or illumination with the right wavelength. Our so called uniBOX can be build by using common things like Lego bricks, glass, foil and LEDs. We were able to show that light systems can be controlled efficiently and we now provide a do-it-yourself manual for building your own uniBOX!
Construction
Slider and video may take a while to load. Please be patient!
uniBOX - Freiburg's light box
You want an affordable and easy to build box for your light experiments? Here is the instruction for constructing our uniBOX. And do you know what time it is? - Yeah, it's tooltime!
Preparations
You need several things before you can start. First you need a box of lego bricks, a role of black self-adhesive foil, applicable glass plates, paper or foil for dispersion and last but not least 9 LEDs which can display the desired wavelength"
DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Inteins_-_-_TEXT.html," were selected and re-streaked in order to grow enough biomass for detection of peptides by chromatography. Due to time constraints, the sequence of the transformants were not confirmed. Instead, six samples for each peptide (total of 12) were analyzed by UHPLC-DAD-QTOFMS. It was not possible to detect the cyclized protein from methanol extraction of secondary metabolites. In order to confirm whether this was due to improper splicing of intein, cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The size of the unspliced protein iwas 19.4 kDA (cycloviolacin Y1) and 17.2 kDa (tyrocidine-like). It was not possible to detect bands at this molecular weight on the gel (data not shown). The size of the cyclic peptide was below the lower detection limit for SDS-PAGE.
Discussion
It was not possible to produce short cyclic peptides using the Npu DnaE. No unspliced variant were detected by SDS-PAGE and no cyclized peptides were detected by LC/MS. This may be explained by (1) a sequence mistake in the construct or incorrect integration of the promoter and/or (2) that the peptide was not proper cyclized. As 12 colonies were sequenced, it seems unlikely that a mutation in the oligo should be present in all transformants. The promoter may not have been inserted correctly, but the results are contradicting. Lack of cyclisation may be due to either its small size (tyrocidine) or the fact that the extein sequence was mutated from its native for expression of cycloviolacin Y1. It may also not be possible to distinguish the unspliced intein-peptide due to background in E. coli. Cyclisation of cylotides (cycloviolacin Y1 is a cyclotide) by Npu DnaE has been achieved in E. coli. [4]. It has however to our knowledge not been possible to use Npu DnaE to successfully cyclize a 10 amino acid peptide. It may be possible to achieve cyclisation of these peptides by exploring the diversity of inteins used by different organisms [5]. Heidelberg tested an intein library , which may be a start point for such intein screening in the future.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our project could take, we spoke with experts from both industry and academia. From them, we have gained valuable information on how to conduct our experiments and what to look for.
Meeting with Novozymes
Early in our project we met with Mikako Sasa and Sara Landwik from Novozymes, the world's largest producer of industrial enzymes (in which a high number originates from fungi), to consult experts from the industry. Their advice was to work with either Aspergillus, Schizophyllum or Fusarium. At DTU we already had Aspergillus strains, and we acquired a Schizophyllum strain from Hans Wösten. In addition to knowledge of fungal strains, they shared some ideas on which features could be interesting to engineer. For engineering the material properties of the structure, they suggested changing the branching patterns of beta-glucan in order to achieve stronger cell walls or changing the acetylation of chitin. These are some of the points we are interested in pursuing next.
Lastly, they gave us advice on how to grow these filamentous fungi and how to easily transfer the fungi from liquid medium to the solid substrates, which was put to use in mycolab .
Hyphaebox
Hyphaebox is a startup from DTU that produces packaging materials from mycotecture. They shared their expertise in growing mycotecture, including which substrates, temperatures, and ambient moisture are best suited for producing high-quality mycomaterials.
As they are a startup that focuses on design, they are interested in knowing more of the technical aspects of the materials. Therefore, they asked us to look into the effects of growth on different substrates and material properties of the products. In addition, they are interested in data from other types of fungi. They used shiitake (Lentinula edodes) for their materials and are interested in what other fungal species could be useful for the production of materials.
Ecovative
In our talks with Ecovative Design, the subject of the physical appearances of the products and how to integrate it was discussed. One physical appearance could be a change to the color of the mycelium, which we decided to solve by integrating sequences for chromoproteins or pigments into the fungal genome. We established two methods to solve this: In the first one we assembled a melanin producing cassette that results in darkening the mycelium.  The other method involves a chromoprotein cassette , which is a blue protein that makes the mycelium greener. The idea of optimizing the appearance of the fungal products is appealing to a company"
Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," general idea is to take advantage of the “natural apoptotic process of prokaryotes” which was coined as “proapoptosis” by researcher Alaya Hochman in 1997. In summary, the paper claims that the execution of proapoptosis requires the activation of a developmental program that results in massive structural and morphological changes. These changes may include cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and proteolysis and DNA degradation, followed by cell fragmentation into apoptotic bodies that are phagocytized, just like eukaryotes in the standard apoptotic process. Bacteria currently exhibit a range of natural developmental programs for survival purposes. For example, Caulobacter cereus forms swarmer cells and differentiation in order to adapt to its stressful environment. If we are interested in activating a developmental program instead of using a targeted payload system as described above, we would need to formulate a system that is possible to be activated by the bacterium itself, and this would possibly involve similar chemical pathways. It would be of interest at this point to investigate the possible chemical pathways that our prion-like proteins can take, and this would be a good first step in the design process.
Application and Benefits
There was a study done by Eric Kandel and Kausik Si which determined that cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), an RNA binding protein, had a role to play in memory storage. CPEB has two conformations, the native one and the non-native (prion-like) conformation. This non-native conformation is capable of acting like a prion, such that it changes conformation to become multimeric and self-perpetuates this by inducing other CPEB to change conformation, as shown in yeast and the sea slug Aplysia. It was shown, in Aplysia, that this prion-like form was what marked active synapses to store long-term memories. A similarly functioning protein, Orb2, was found in drosophila, so it is possible this may have a human homologue. Knowing this, we may be able to use our own knowledge of prions to help treat diseases concerning long-term memory loss, such as Alzheimer’s or amnesia.
Restrictions
As previously mentioned, this system requires activation by the strain of bacteria that is being targeted. If there is no natural pathway for the strain to activate the system on its own, a supplementary system would have to be created to support this action. Another restriction with this system is finding compatible chemical pathways between our prions and the strain of interest"

USTC,2016,Team:USTC-Software#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the concentration of the substances involved in this reaction.
Simulation is a simulator designed to solve the concentration function with respect to time based on the differential equations given by the user. After the user has submitted control functions, this module will upload relative data to a high performance server, which will be able to return results in minutes or hours, based on the quantity of control functions and the width of time domain. The concentration of all nodes will be displayed visualized, meanwhile a proper notice will pop up if an instability is detected in order to warn the user to be cautious about the result after the critical point.
You can simulate concentration of genes’ products by entering controlling ODEs. There are two ways to access to “Simulation”: Clicking “Simulation” at sidebar, or entering pano project and selecting “Simulation” with some certain nodes. Normally, the second way is more common. Here is the instruction of “Simulation”.
1. Enter your pano project and click button 1.
2. On the popped dialog, click “START SIMULATION”.
Module:BLAST
BioHub provide users with convenient one-key BLAST. In graphical interface, the user select the components which he or she wants to align the sequence, and by just pressing one build-in button, BioHub will read the sequence and align it with sequences in online databases using BLAST interface provided by NCBI, and show the outcome simply and elegantly to the users.
Tips: BLAST is available only online. When using NCBI BLAST API, any user should obey their usage guidelines.
Module:ABACUS
A plugin design to design amino acid sequence from the .pdb file provided by user. The uploaded .pdb file will be evaluated by several progress, with support of simulated annealing algorithm, then the server will generate a .zip file containing several .pdb files and .fasta files for user to download. It’s recommended to run this plugin on a high performance server, because the plugin will invoke computationally intensive programs. So please be patient while this plugin is running, it may take several hours to get results on a high performance server. You can press get status button to check if the calculation is done.
ABACUS can be a really useful function, because for synthetic biologists who want to design new protein, they may need to know the amino acid sequence for proteins in specific structure. For some researchers, they also need to design new protein which should in maximum degree resemble their original structure, which is needed to purify the protein. This steps can be really time-consuming, because if you make some mistakes in designing amino acid sequences"

Preparing fibers for Instron testing
cut 25mm x 25mm cardstock squares
in the squares, cut a 10mm long hole to create a frame
Lay down some black tape on the inside of a PDMS mold (which happens to be 25mm x 25mm as well)
place the frame on top of the PDMS mold
place epoxy glue on the sides of the frame
Lay down a single fiber across the frame
place another layer of cardstock on the epoxy glue to cover the fiber.
allow epoxy to cure for at least 24 hours
Today, we ran Instron tests on natural b.mori silk fibers.
some challenges in the Instron testing:
it's near impossible to get the fibers to be perfectly straight in the Instron
very difficult to lay down the fiber so that it is flat on the tab
when cutting the tab margins, sometimes the fiber is shifted at an angle in the Instron
sometimes when laying down the fiber, it is not taut, and so you are actually tabbing a longer length of fiber than the length of the window.
tabbed some of yesterday's fibers for Instron testing.

Sponsors!
This month we would like to give a special mention to our major sponsors: Medical                                                       Delta and Sarstedt . Medical Delta supports cooperation in Life Sciences, Health & Technology in Leiden, Delft and Rotterdam. Within the three Universities of these cities they are                                                   represented by YOUNG Medical                                                   Delta. Sarstedt is a                                                   distributor of disposable                                                   lab material. They were kind enough to provide us with enough disposables for our project and even paid a visit to our lab.

EL CID
Every year Leiden welcomes thousands of new first year students during its introduction week in August, the EL CID. This week is filled with fun activities, allowing                                                     the new students                                                     to get to know each other, the city and the university. This year the EL CID hosted their very first EL CID symposium and iGEM Leiden was there! We informed students visiting the symposium about                                                     our project and invited them to draw with coloured bacteria.                                                     Moreover, we tested our newly developed “Escape Room board game”! In this game, the students were faced with a problem: drug resistant bacteria. In order to find the cure, the students had to solve                                                     four minigames in time. We received lots of great feedback,                                                     which will allow us to make the game even more fun and educational.

iGEM Japan Kansai Forum
We participated in iGEM Japan Kansai Forum held in Kansai(West central area in Japan). In the forum paticipants made presentations about their team's project. After that, everyone filled in questionnaires and shared some advice for impriving their projects. In addition to those, we had a party, free talk, and free presentation sessions.
The team which participated in the forum were as below:
Kyoto
Nagahama
Kobe
Gifu

With Botchan Lab Tokyo
Team Botchan Lab Tokyo was newly created this year. Last summer, one of their members, Ayumi Taga, met Yusuke Kishimoto, who belongs to our team HokkaidoU_Japan. Because HokkaidoU_Japan has many years of experience, he taught her how to start up an iGEM team, how to register, what making a project is like, and how to find sponsors. As a result, a new iGEM team came into being.
With Kyoto
We shared our presentation slides and movies to each other on 13th January. We studied their project “NORO CATCHER,” and vice versa: they studied our project “Self-AssembRing.” Furthermore, we studied their way of presentation. We are not good at making presentation slides, so we analyzed how they make slides using Keynote. Also, one of our members, Yusuke Kishimoto, was impressed by the presentation of team Kyoto at the Giant Jamboree 2016, so we all watched the movie of their presentation and it motivated us toward Giant Jamboree 2017."
Jilin_China,2017,Team:Jilin China#Geneguard_-_-_TEXT.html," the contrary, the addition of IPTG or both inducers show no significant effect, which confirm that the expression of antitoxin can relieve the suppression of toxin in bacteria.
Discussion: Since no colony forms in the plate with L-Arabinose, we can conclude that the expression of CbtA can suppress the growth of bacteria. When CbeA and CbtA are co-induced by IPTG and L-Arabinose, the bacteria can growth and reproduce normally. It is reported that CbeA acts as an antagonist, rather than binding to CbtA, which is different from other Type-II Toxin-Antitoxin system.[2]
Figure 3. Growth bacteria with TA system under different inducers. (A) Plate with none inducer. (B) Plate with IPTG. (C) Plate with arabinose. (D) Plate with arabinose and IPTG. All the plates are incubated for 16 hrs after streak cultivation.
Drawing Abs600-time curve with different inducers
1. CbtA function validation:
Results: Abs600 values were measured from 0 to 14 hours in two groups and the toxication curves were drawn as shown in Figure 4. The growth rate of vector group bacteria after adding L-Arabinose sped up for a short time and then slowed down. At last, the trend was consistent with that without L-Arabinose. However, TA group, with the addition of L-Arabinose, showed the same OD and Abs600 values from the 4th hour for a while. After that, Abs600 values displayed a little increase. Besides, after culturing for 14 hrs, difference in turbidities of bacteria in different groups was visible .(Figure 5.)
Discussion: (1) The reason why the growth of vector group bacteria accelerates after addition of L-Arabinose is probably because that E.coli can turn L-Arabinose into DXylulose 5-phosphate, which is an intermediate product in pentose phosphate pathway and can be used in bacteria as a carbon resource. What is more, the decrease after that maybe related with Carbon catabolite repression(CCR)[3]. (2) According to the characterization of pBAD, the addition of L-Arabinose with the concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.6% shows no obvious difference in induction level of CbtA. Therefore, the difference among various concentrations of L-Arabinose in TA group maybe because of the metabolism of L-ar"

Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic Resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control, and Antibiotic Research and Development
In order to fully implement the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, the FY16 AR Solution Initiative was adopted. This implementation will include: comprehensive tracking and detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, faster outbreak response, insights for research innovation, better patient care, improved prescribing, increased susceptibility testing, nationwide implementation of CDC’s Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship (http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/healthcare/implementation/core-elements.html), and global partnerships for prevention and detection.
The FY16 budget also supports a $14 million increase for the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)—the nation’s leading system to track healthcare-associated infections, including antibiotic resistance and antibiotic use—as a companion to CDC’s FY16 Antibiotic Resistance Solutions Initiative, supporting multiple goals under the National Strategy, including new activities to better understand and monitor sepsis, leading to enhanced prevention to save lives.
One of the elements of the initiative is advance development and use of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests for identification and characterization of resistant bacteria. FY 16 AR Solution initiative also includes comprehensive tracking and detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
According to the National Action Plan to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released on 27, March, 2015, Improved detection and control of antibiotic resistance in human and animal pathogens will be achieved through a “One-Health” approach to disease surveillance that integrates data from multiple monitoring networks. To achieve the goal by 2020 the government has adopted action plan in order to generate significant outcomes.
Action Plan
Creation of a regional public health network—the Detect Network of AR Regional Laboratories—for resistance testing, a specimen repository for resistant bacterial strains, and a National Sequence Database of Resistant Pathogens.
Routine reporting of antibiotic use and resistance data to National Health Safety Network (NHSN) by 95% of Medicare-eligible hospitals, as well as by Department of Defense  and Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities.
Routine testing of zoonotic and animal pathogens for antibiotic susceptibility at ten to twenty National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) and Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN) member laboratories, using standardized testing methods and data sharing practices.
Also important is advance development and use of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests for identification and characterization of resistant bacteria. In order to facilitate the achievement of the task, the government will take the lead with the support of funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. When it is"
Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"TORC1 could help recover the cell growth and intracellular phosphorylation, leading to more RTG1/3 being excluded out of the nucleus, and expression of Mut-TOR would decrease. Eventually the yeast cell will grow into a balance and EGFP strength have the following tendency.
After the reconstruction of TOR pathway, data and results are necessary for testing the system. Two methods are applied here. One is qualitative: detecting the location transfer of transcription factors. The other is quantitative: measure the growth curve of recombinant strains and compare with parental ones.
With the inducible promoter and fussion protein of Rtg1/3, we could observe the fluorescence location and strength. Details will be shown in presentation and poster.
Yeast growing rate, ethanol yield and productivity data will be shown in presentation and poster.
imited by the competition deadline, we could just concentrate on the reconstruction of TOR pathway. Yet we still have various project brunches to increase the tolerance of yeast to in other perspectives. For example, we can bring in detoxification pathways to speed up the rate of FAP degradation. Up-regulation of ADH6 would obviously remove furfurals in cytoplasm; exogenous genes such as laccase and phenol hydroxylase would transform phenols into less poisonous chmicals; getting through the pathway from acetate to ethanol will be helpful to release acetate accumulation; PH-sensitive promoter and modifications on acetate efflux pumps proteins will keep it from heavily inflowing. There are endless areas to explore only if you have passion, perseverance and patience. Actually, the parts and modules we built presently still needs improving, combinations and testing, to find out the best group. Finally, all the modules will be integrated into a pYD11 (or other vectors having functions like Yeast Artificial Chromosome to express gene in nucleus). We hope to make it become the 17th chromosome of the yeast (normally 16). With this additional chromosome, the yeast will gain stable growth, high yield and productivity of ethanol and an extension in life span regardless of composite inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Furthermore, we also want to apply this integrated pYD11 with different functions and into others kinds of organism. That is to say, with this universal and standard module, we can put it into any organism needs to be remodeled, just like an USB, to be a universe vector.

Design
Our Petal Death Protein (PDP) part (BBa_K179200) was design to produce a modest amount of Oxalic acid. The PDP gene was obtained from Dianthus caryophyllus (Carnation) (Clove pink). PDP catalyzes the production of Oxalic acid from Oxaloacetate: Oxaloacetate + H2O = oxalic acid + acetate. The first 3 amino acids represent a propeptide and are not included in the PDP sequence. The PDP gene is under control of the constitutively active medium transcription promoter (J23107) and a strong RBS (B0034). This combination was chosen to allow us to tune the amount of oxalic acid produced through control of PDP production. Mutation of the transcription promoter to strong or weak activity will result in more or less PDP production and subsequent changes in oxalic acid production. The same principle can be applied to the RBS from strong to medium to weak.

Analysis of survey findings
To facilitate data analysis, choices of concerns provided in part 1 and part 2 of our survey was grouped into the following categories:
1. Environmental damage (eg. release of toxic chemicals, disposal of parts, etc)
2. Impacts on human health (low frequency waves due to turbines)
3. Production constraints (limited power supply, weather dependent)
4. Cost to society (Ethical issues on land and crop usage)
Figure 1
Figure 1 shows a stacked bar chart comparing the total average points of importance that the general public of different age group gave when considering each category of concerns when choosing renewable energy. The brown toned stacks show grouped data of answers before  the video while the green toned stacks summarized data after our team’s introduction video.
In general, all 4 areas of concerns shows differences before and after the video with ‘health impacts’ and ‘production constraints’ showing an increase in importance under the public’s perception, while the ‘environmental damage’ and ‘social cost’ show a decrease in importance. Since the function of our video in between the parts are aimed to educate the viewers about different types of renewable energies, it suggests that these differences can be influenced by education outside classes, implying that there can be a significant shift in society's concerns and interests in certain renewable energy source when they are exposed to the new or updated information about renewable energy and, therefore, show that there is a need for public education in this area. However, there are also possibilities that these differences are purely due to the fact that there are views to the issues that the public did not originally consider.
Figure 2
Factors in Fig. 2 are grouped according to the following:
Environmental Damage
Environmental pollutants
Visual Impact
Pollution Caused by parts
Impacts on human health
Effects on human health
Product Constraints
Low Energy Production
Weather Dependent
Difficult energy storage
Thick solar panel
Requirement of wind power
Large area used by generator
Social Cost
Ethical issue on crop usage
Ethical issue on land usage
Maintenance cost
When expanding the different limitations each renewable energy poses, Fig.2 shows that impacts on human health are still considered the most important when choosing renewable energy. Impacts on human health that renewable energy might potentially cause are the low-frequency waves caused by the wind turbines in wind farms or the toxic and carcinogenic chemicals released during the manufacturing processes. This shows that impacts on human health should be our top priority when modifying our MFC.
Production constraints are the second most important category after"

The cells induced with l-rhamnose showed an increased absorbance at 590 (the peak of the dye) when compared to the empty-plasmid controls, and also with the non-induced sample. That results clearly demonstrate how our engineered cells with BBa_K1583000 successfully make biofilms, regarding that the empty plasmid controls and the analysed samples have significantly (table 3.) higher crystal violet retention. On the other hand, a higher concentration of rhamnose is not leading to a higher expression. The cells induced with a 0.2% w/v of rhamnose seem to create better a biofilm structure. However, this could be a consequence of different growth patterns; the cultures induced with 0.5% w/v of rhamnose could have stopped duplicating earlier, so the cell concentration could have decreased. So, the dyed area could be consequently smaller.

Quantification of the internal CsgA concentration using Western Blot
Background
For the kinetic model , we needed to determine the internal concentration of csgA. We cloned a CsgA gene, with a C-terminus His tag, in the construct in a CsgA deficient strain. The His-tag would give us the advantage to use multiple techniques, for measuring the amount of CsgA proteins. Based on the kinetic experiment with GFPmut3, we obtained an internal amount of CsgA in the order of 104 molecules/cell. To validate whether this value was plausible we decided to use a sensitive, and an accurate method: the Western Blot.
Methodology
Experiment 1: Qualitative analysis of internal CsgA_His protein
We performed the Western Blot according to protocol 24. The following samples (Table 4) were used for performing the Western Blotting experiment.
Table 4. Samples used for the first Western Blot experiment.
Alternative steps were done during step 5 of the protocol. After incubation we removed the medium, by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in sample buffer to obtain an OD600 of 10. The cells were then heated for 10 minutes at 95°C, followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes"

You apply this drop to the surface of the agar and streak as if you would streak a solid, moving back and forth horizontally while gradually bringing the loop down.  I've found this method to work especially well when you believe that the cells have a fairly high concentration, such as in a glycerol stock or in an overnight culture.
Note with regard to the transformation that after the 2 hour incubation we were forced to put it in the fridge for about 4.5 hours since other obligations prevented us from finishing the protocol.  Normally, we would have plated the transformations immediately after they came out of the incubator.  Since we had refridgerated them, we stuck the transformed cells into the incubator for about half an hour, but it is possible that all of the DNA had been ejected due to the cooling.  We also plated these cells as described instead, rather than adding all of the liquid to the plates.  We saved the remaining liquid in case we needed it the following day.
6/11/08
Came in to discover wonderful colonies on all plates except J63006.  After putting J63006 in the incubator for several more hours, exactly one colony was discovered later on and used for an overnight culture.
Attempted another transformation with the remaining plasmid DNA from the 2007 parts kit (that we had placed in the fridge yesterday).  Put the plates into the incubator at roughly 7:15 pm, including one positive control (3x flag), one negative control, one transformation from today, and another containing cells from yesterday's transformation that had been in the incubator for the majority of the day.
6/12/08
Came in around 11 am to take tubes out of incubator.  Total time in incubator was 15hr and 48 min.  Found substantial growth in all three test tubes.  Also, took out plates around 11:17 to discover good colonies on both the positive control and the transformation that I had done yesterday.  There were only about a couple dozen colonies on the J63006 plate, so it is apparent that one should use all of the liquid from the transformation steps when plating.  However, the positive control had No growth on the transformation from 6/10, but this was to be expected since the cells had been refridgerated for an entire night and were likely dead or had lost their plasmids.

Overview
Our collaborations this year have proved to be really successful and fruitful for us. This year, we collaborated with iGEM Berlin, iGEM Manchester and iGEM Glasgow. Not only did we collaborate with other iGEM teams to improve our project, we were also involved in mentoring iGEM IISER Mohali team this year around. It was hugely fulfilling for us to work with all these teams despite being so distant from each other. We would sincerely like to thank iGEM for giving all of us synthetic biology enthusiasts a platform to interact with so many like-minded people. Hoping for many more such fruitful collaborations in the future.
Team: Berlin
The IIT Delhi iGEM team whole-heartedly collaborated with Berlin team. Berlin team was working on the affordable, practical and effective diagnostic of the widespread third world parasitic disease -Tapeworm Infection. Since India is one of the countries where millions of people are infected by this parasite, IIT Delhi directed Berlin team to a suitable site. Here is the link to the detailed description of the complete journey:

Team: MANCHESTER
Willing to gain an even deeper understanding of GMM legislations, 15 teams were invited from different countries to participate in these collaborative efforts. In the end, the final document has been created by 137 iGEMers from 10 teams, 10 countries, 7 different iGEM tracks and 5 continents.

Right now, you may be wondering “why is the word ‘novel’ bolded?” to which the answer is 1) the writers like bolding words and 2) being novel is arguably the most important part of applying for a patent and is directly responsible for the ambiguity surrounding patents in synthetic biology.  To be “novel,” and invention must be “nonobvious” to other researchers in the same field; however, this definition has only been loosely applied in the fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology.  For example, molecular cloning techniques have been widely used for decades to create plasmids and therefore products of such clonings should not be novel.  Nevertheless, gene products of molecular clonings are still considered novel and therefore patentable by the Federal Circuit courts. Furthermore, new devices and systems in synthetic biology are often created from a wide variety of independently patented genetic parts, causing issue when the inventor of a new device or system using patented parts attempts to patent.
Undoubtedly, there are a lot of issues in patenting/copyrighting synthetic biology products, as almost all parts are based on an expressive DNA code (which indicates the use of copyright) and yet most devices created are functional (which indicates the use of a patent).  This ambiguity in patenting and copyrighting products of synthetic biology is surprisingly similar to the issues faced in past decades by software developers. By looking at how software developers have handled the copyright/patent problem, we will define several more important terms (yay, more definitions!) and will open a dialogue on how to address intellectual property in synthetic biology.
Notes from the Writers
Over the past 5 minutes of reading time, you hopefully learned the definitions of property rights, intellectual property, copyright and patent, as well as how these definitions apply to synthetic biology.  We also introduced issues of patent law in synthetic biology, a topic that will be revisited in Part 2 of this post.  For ease of future reading, we are providing a “cheatsheet” of definitions as our third blog post that includes definitions from both this post and Part 2.  When reading future posts, we hope that this cheat sheet will help redefine words you may have forgotten.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html,") tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides. However, they all need users to provide details of the system network, such as the activation and repression of transcription and translation reactions in genetic regulatory network. It is so difficult for even professionals to construct a detailed network of a complex system depending only on their minds. In this sense, modeling through CAD tools will not reduce the work of modeling: users are actually required to model manually and input their model in details.
However, since our software is developed for non-biological background users, it is unrealistic to expect them to model their design manually. To solve this problem, the USTC_Software 2010 team attempts to take synthetic biology modeling one step further by introducing new methods for automatic modeling of biological systems. Just as the word automation implies, users are only required to submit their assembling of parts, and the generation of biological model is automatically done by our program. Being the first-ever team trying to develop a synthetic biology automatic modeling tool, we focus on genetic regulatory network for the first year and develop our software tool, iGaME, which will assist the design of genetic function modules for biological systems in synthetic biology. We believe this will greatly relieve users from handling complex interactions of species in biological system.
Many novel and revolutionary concepts are proposed during our development. The first is our Chain-Node model for complex structure with multiple chains bound together. It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names: it is impossible to construct a universal name-based reaction database applying for different systems. The next is Template . A species with a certain structure is a template species, and a reaction occurring between several template species is a template reaction. The introduction of Template makes it possible to describe a group of reactions with same structure-determined reaction mechanism. Finally, based on our Chain-Node and Template concept, we propose an XML-based Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL for abbreviation) to fully characterize Species and Reaction in templates with clear definitions of elements and attributes in XML fashion. It is a database language for next generation when automatic modeling is widely used throughout the world. To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea of our modeling system.
Though we have no enough time to achieve our ultimate goal completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The first component"

The two mutants were cultured in M9 culture medium for 24 hours. If needed the medium was supplemented with antibiotics or glutamate at the following concentrations: 5 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 0 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 2.5 g/L or 5.0 g/L glutamate. During the fermentation, 1.5mL bacteria culture was taken out every 3 hours, of which 600µL was for GFP FI measurement (395nm\509nm) by microplate reader, and 900µL for OD600 measurement.

However, in our preliminary experiments, we found that they could hardly be expressed in E. coli.

Therefore, we optimized the codon to make it be highly expressed in E. coli. After verification, we got the following graph which indicated that the parts we constructured with optimized codons can work productively and efficiently. Thus, we use these two enzymes as a benchmark to construct a part: BBa_K2685011 Part: BBa_K2685012 Part: BBa_K2685013. Finally, we found that lip enzyme has the best and the most desirable effect of degradation compared with other parts.

Collaborations
Paris Bettencourt
This year Paris Bettencourt team focused on engineering an enzyme capable of degrading red wine stains by synthetic biology. We were happy to help them by sending them three different samples of wine, grapes and soil from the south area of France. Now we are waiting for a discount for their enzyme when it will be available on the market.
Bordeaux
One of the current problems of today’s society is sleep disorder. This year, Bordeaux iGEM team worked on a sleep-inducing peptide. After a Skype meeting with the iGEMers from Bordeaux, our team advised and supported them with a mathematical model for bacterial growth. On the other hand, they kindly hosted two of our members during their visit for a conference related to our project in their city.
METU HS Ankara
METU HS Ankara iGEM team created a database consisting of basic and routinely used protocols in different languages. We have responded to their collaboration request and we have translated their protocols to French. So, if you are looking for protocols in Yupik or Pawnee, check out here:
Edinburgh UG
The Edinburgh UG iGEM worked on finding a solution to the problem of data storage. Their idea was to develop a modular system for encoding text or any other unit of information into DNA. We have helped them with the translation of the Letter of Mary Queen of Scots to French.
UCL
UCL ’s project about maintaining the quality of life and extending lifespan is interesting and challenging at the same time. The part of their project on the Catheter Lubricant centered on the same problem as our project, about Sexually Transmitted Infections. During our Skype meeting, we shared our projects and also our knowledge about the use of aptamers for STI detection.

Then take it into the oven and dry it, then take it out and press it out. Finally, the tablet needs to be coated or printed on the outside. The capsule is relatively simple, the drug excipient is mixed up, and then it can be sent to the capsule to be filled in.
After metal detection, polishing dust can be removed. Generally speaking, capsule shells are produced by outsourcing companies. They can choose enteric-soluble capsule shells according to their demand. They are acid-resistant and can completely deliver drugs to the absorption sites of the intestines, without being affected by gastric acid, and only begin to dissolve in the environment above pH5.
Of course, the process of Chang-soluble tablets has been very mature, but compared to the capsule process is more complicated, generally lower capsule cost. Most oral drugs can be made into capsules and tablets. No more than the difficulty, some of the properties of API special, can not be made into granules, or poor compressibility, capsule more suitable. In terms of patient experience, most Chinese patients report that capsules are easier to swallow.
In view of the complexity of the production process for tablets, it is recommended that capsules be encapsulated in the form of capsules.

After PCR was finished, the resulting products were mixed with 10 uL of 6x Loading Dye and split into two 30 uL products. Each sample was loaded into a 1% wt/vol agarose gel, along with 10 uL of 1 kbp GeneRuler DNA ladder, and ran for 20 minutes at 100V in 1x TAE buffer. (Note: only 6 lanes were on the gel, so the second 30uL product of the Device 3 PCR reaction was stored at -20, to be ran on a separate gel on Monday).
Gel was removed and imaged on an Invitrogen gel box. Pictures will be uploaded in results using cell phone camera.
Results
PCR shows high amplification of a 1kb band of each device, consistent with amplification of an expected 970 bp product in all devices using the same primer. Bands were cut and placed in eppendorf tubes.  Device 1 band had a weight of 188 mg, Device 2 had a weight of 199mg, and Device 3 had a weight of 103 mg. Device 3 has a second product that has not been run on a gel yet, resulting in lower weight amounts (and possibly lower yields).
The resulting PCR shows show proper amplification.  Bands were cut out and extracted using the Zymo Gel Recovery Kit , with the following protocol:

We are Team Berkeley, a cohesive unit of 7 undergraduates and 3 advisers. Earlier this year we planned a complex and risky project, given the short amount of time iGEM made available. We quickly learned each others strengths and weaknesses and developed standard systems of organizational management in order to synchronize our efforts for the many parallel tasks at hand. We created protocols, shared them with one another, and worked together on troubleshooting. Using google docs to keep up with the status of cloning projects, the results of assays, material logistics, or the final steps required to complete a project ensured that through the months of hard work, we fine-tuned our ability to work together. As a team, we have learned firsthand how the synthetic biology community relies on the goal-oriented cooperation of skilled individuals from very different backgrounds and with very different skill sets. Some of us have strong engineering backgrounds while others of us have strong biology backgrounds, but we all share a desire to build synthetic biological systems that solve human problems. We are proud of the project that we have created which we will present at the Jamboree together in October.

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," age for intellectual property began.
Instead, the justification for patents became quickly socio-economic. Patents are now conceived as an incentive for production and knowledge spreading. When a patent is awarded, the description of the invention goes public, in exchange for a maximum twenty-years commercial monopoly to the owner.
Patents are actually supposed to promote innovation and the disclosure of technological knowledge, which means allowing the latest inventions to be known by anyone, though their commercial use is forbidden without a license from the patent owner until the patent ends. On the one hand, the benefits that patents are expected to offer to society are very clear as their design is specifically supposed to improve the global technological level. Indeed, huge technological steps have been made since the patent’s creation (although it is not the only factor). On the other hand, stimulating the competition FOR the market (i.e for “new” markets) by granting some kind of monopoly rents generates economic costs for society, which derive from a weakening in the competition IN the market (i.e. in the “same” market).
As a result, the patent system rests on a socio-economic balance, in which society is supposed to be beneficiary. Nevertheless, as we will further see, this balance is fragile and depends on the answers to the following questions :
What is the patentability scope ? What can be patented ? ;
How patents are granted ? (i.e.  the toughness of the conditions required) ;
What are the rights of the patent owner ? ;
How long do these rights last ?
Economic limits of the patent model
Several factors (change in laws and in the practices of patent offices, technological and industrial evolution, etc.) may lead this balance between social costs and advantages to be broken. In some cases, the patent system may lead to hamper the innovation dynamics.
For instance, narrow patents are sometimes granted to different companies on very specific elements, the gathering of which may be necessary to develop an innovation (a new product for example). Nowadays, major worldwide companies use patents as defensive or offensive tools to block competition by preventing (potential) rivals to use specific useful components.When powerful enough, these rivals strike back by doing the exact same thing on other components so that they are mutually blocked. This case is known as the ""patent thicket"" problem. As an example Google has recently bought Motorola Mobile and its 17000 patents for 12 billion dollars, which means they spent a lot of money to get these patents probably as offensive / defensive ends instead of spending it into pure R&D. Consequently patents sometimes paradoxically discourage innovation.
Contrary to the previous case, some patents may protect wide discoveries ("

Making connection with close competitors in an early stage of the competition
iGEM Mini Symposium
When we started to create an iGEM team, we were eager to show our ideas to our friends and convincing others to join the unique experience that iGEM offers: creating an own idea, building a project around it and manage the project. And all these are with undergraduate students. After the project definition decision, we’ve got a request of another Dutch team (TU-Eindhoven) to help them starting up and to talk in general about projects. We were very interested in the idea, and we saw the potential value of such a meeting for getting in touch with the nearby competition to informally talk about the teams idea’s, goals, dreams and their expertise that they could offer in collaboration. A good moment where you can see how other teams like your idea, and are able to give some constructive advises on the ideas. In the end, iGEM is a competition, but collaboration is also a big part of iGEM.
The Wageningen_UR team therefore saw the need of organizing a small symposium for all the Dutch teams, in an early stage of the competition. Our idea was that looking at wiki pages and mail contact is not enough to bond to your fellow iGEM teams: a meet-up was missing in the current way iGEM teams approach their nearby “colleagues”. So"

1. PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS
""Pablo and the iGEM-Team Freiburg delve deep into biological theory and philosophy without losing sight of ethical implications of these issues.
A truly impressive accomplishment!""
Dr. Joachim Boldt
Institute of Ethics and the History of Medicine, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg
1.1 Philosophical essay
Synthetic biology aspires to be an engineering discipline, with the aim of constructing artificial living systems as means to human ends. The products of synthetic biology ought to be living machines. The ‘international Genetically Engineered Machine competition’ is prospectively raising a whole generation of future scientists trained in the methods of this novel field of synthetic biology. We believe that in this context the ‘Know How’ (procedure) needs to be accompanied with the ‘Know Why’ (causal knowledge), but most important by the often forgotten ‘Know What’ (meaning), because the emerging of every new engineering discipline brings not only chances but also risks, uncertainties, and worries. There is no doubt that the field of synthetic biology promises a large number of meaningful applications and solutions for many present problems. However, at the same time, many social, ethical and legal problems are being revealed by the claim of the creation of ‘artificial living systems’ or ‘living machines’. We need to ask ourselves: ‘what are we actually doing?’, ‘what are living machines good for?’ and also ‘what are they in themselves?’. Any ad-hoc answer to these questions would lead to a misjudgement of the arising problems.
Our iGEM-team tried to leave aside any preconceived opinion and to make a profound critical analysis of the actual source of the nascent public concerns (dual-use-dilemma, ‘playing god’, biosafety, biosecurity, etc). We did not only meet for lab meetings, but for philosophical evenings as well"

How can we make sure that the beer will be sterile and free of genetically engineered yeast?
pasteurisation does kill the yeast but does not eliminate the dead yeast cells
filtering might be a suitable approach, but oxygen will be lost and would have to be introduced afterwards
brewing students will contact a specialist of our university concerning filter techniques

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz"

Danielle Huang
Danielle, ""the overachiever"" always aims for higher goals. Her schedule is packed just like that of a Hollywood star, except that she doesn't act, but she truly enjoys keeping herself busy and productive. What an exemplary student. Over the summer break, she worked very hard to contribute to Cornell iGEM until the day before she left Cornell for a co-op at Johnson & Johnson. We miss you Danielle!
Dan Levine
While most of us are water-based, Dan is not water-based. He enjoys long walks on the tight-rope, bumpy rides on the pommel horse, gliding through the atmosphere , and protein-heavy meals. If you are what you eat, then Dan is a bowl of non-fat Chobani yogurt (the serving spoon being a vanilla-flavored Power Bar). However, a cranial examination reveals Dan is wired to circuit-boards and graphics cards. At a glance, his computer models could be mistaken for supermodels. Needless to say, Dan is popular among ladies.
Rafael Lizarralde

His brain surpasses Amazon's servers with the storage capacity approximately equal to a googlebyte or three of data. After majoring in Biological Engineering, Rafael plans to go to graduate school. In graduate school, it is rumored that Rafael plans to study meat science and the art of turf grass management. Rafael's career aspirations are to win a couple of Nobel prizes and designation as Cosmo's ""Man Candy of the Year.""

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

We then placed this sheet into the oven and starting at 20 °C raised the temperature degree by degree until all chromoproteins had lost their color

Here are the chromoproteins after they have been heated. They were heated to 60 °C before all of them lost their color. A video is in the googleDrive to show the color loss

Here are the chromoproteins after they have been rehydrated with 3 ul of milliQ water. They have regained their color
●
We then repeated this process by adding another row of these chromoproteins to see if there was a difference in the heat response after they have been heated multiple times
IMG_0124.JPG
The top row is a new set of chromoproteins that have been pipetted (as before 3 ul let dry, then another 3 ul) onto the cellulose sheet. The bottom row is the previously tested chromoproteins that have been rehydrated.

We then heated these starting at 40  °C until all the colors were gone again (around 60  °C)

Here are the chromoproteins after being heated. The bottom row was heated a second time and the top row was heated for the first time. They have all lost their color.

We rehydrated these again with 3 ul of milliQ water
IMG_1646.jpg
Here are the chromoproteins after they have been rehydrated with 3 ul of water. Both the top and bottom row look the same even though the bottom row has been heated more. This helps to show that the number of times of heating does not affect the outcome of rehydration. This also shows a reversible color change in our chromoproteins at relatively low temperatures compared to those in the cell lysate tests.

Successfully transform plant cell target at the low pressure levels generated by the gun, relative to commercial gene guns.
Safety screen around gun to shield user from ruptured membrane debris. This will fit over the electronics box and gun trigger when stored, so the user must consciously handle the safety screen before firing the gun and will thus be reminded to use this safety feature.
Base to provide stability for the gun and petri dishes of different sizes.
Easy to surface sterilise the gun and base for use in sterile fume hood.
We plan to test the gun in early September by transforming onion bulb cells with a GFP or GUS reporter system, experimenting with optimisation of the firing pressure for the gun and documenting penetration of the cell target qualitatively.
The connections in the gun have all been pressure tested under water and sealed using PTFE tape, to ensure the gun is safe for repeated use.
General layout of the gene gun
The gun is mounted on a clamp stand and wooden base, with all the electronics contained inside the box on the left (the gun would go inside the sterile fume hood and the box could be left on the bench outside). The stand height has been reduced to 0.4m so it can fit inside any standard sterile hood.
The final prototype will also include a ruler clamped alongside the gun to measure distance to the target plate on firing.
The wires connecting the box to the gun are 0.6m long, to allow the electronics to remain contained and outside of the sterile hood during transformations (reducing the risk of liquid disinfectant being sprayed on any electrical connections).

AQA_Unesp (Brazil), Valencia_UPV (Spain) and SECA_NZ (New Zealand)
We joined our local towns city festival in the end of summer. Before this festival we considered other countries projects and wanted to find some interesting projects to share at the festival. We found three projects that seemed extra interesting and we wrote to the teams and asked if they were interested in a collaboration. We wanted to show the public the diversity of what syntetic biology can be used for. The projects who caught our attention was Valencia UPVs project chatter plant, AQA Unseps project Insubiota and SECA NZs project with frost-resistance in fruit. We wrote the teams and were very happy when all three teams were interested in collaborating with us.
The teams wrote us simplified summaries of their project descriptions and we hung these up at the city festival. A lot of people read about the projects and were surprised that these kinds of things could be done, they thought it sounded surreal. We had read the project descriptions and other information on the team’s wiki and were there to answer the questions that were raised.
We are very thankful for this collaboration and it gave us an opportunity to mediate the importance of syntetic biology and the platform for young individuals to get a chance to try and implement their ideas. We chose these projects because we thought their projects really could contribute to a better world and that this fact would make it easier for the public to see the importance of iGEM.
Harvard (USA)
A collaboration with Harvard iGEM 2017 was initiated during this summer. We helped them design questions around biomanufacturing. Three other teams were also a part of this collaboration. These teams were AQA_Unesp, Aalto-Helsinki and Hamburg. The survey was aimed at people within the general population, academics, industry, pharmaceutical regulation, politics etc. and included question like;
What comes to mind when somebody say biomanufacturing? Do you know what it is?
How acceptable to you is using biomanufacturing to produce cosmetics?
What are the main ways that you see academic research relating to biomanufacturing as different from industrial research related to biomanufacturing?
What do you think you or the government"

Eliminating Varoa Destructor
Overview
The top 100 food crops produced provide 90% of the world’s nutrition. 70% of these crops are pollinated by bees. A phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has decimated honeybee colonies across the world, halving the number of productive colonies worldwide. One of the main factors hypothesized to contribute to CCD is the mite and viral vector Varroa destructor. While feeding on the bee’s hemolymph, Varroa destructor expels RNA viruses into the bee crippling colony’s strength. Current commercial methods to eradicate Varroa have seen a gradual development of resistance in treated populations. Using synthetic biology, we plan to target Varroa more effectively by directly delivering the miticide, oxalic acid into Varroa and utilizing RNA interference to eliminate Varroa populations within commercial hives.
Our Solution
A few methods to deal with V. destructor are ineffective as they do not target the mite at a crucial phase when the bee is most susceptible. Others rely on chemicals that increase bee mortality rate. For example, formic acid has a harmful effect on capped and uncapped honey bee brood. We are working on killing the mites more effectively by directing delivery of the miticide, oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is an optimal weapon against the mites because the concentration needed to kill a mite is 70 times less lethal to the bee. The acid is already being used in syrup and spray solutions. Our method differs from other oxalic acid methods as it directly transfers the oxalic acid to the mite through the blood-like substance of the bee. Specifically, we are aiming to put E. coli in the midgut of the bee via ingestion, the E. coli would then produce oxalic acid which would be absorbed into the bloodstream. From there, when the mite attacks the bee and drinks its hemolymph, the oxalic acid will be there as a defense mechanism.
Human Practices
Although the science is an integral part of our project, we put some emphasis on human practices as well. Every team member contributed so that we could have a diverse and engaging set of human practices. We reached out many individuals, including one of our MLAs, who is also the Minister of Environment to get her support of our project; rural beekeepers in Southern"

Coexpression of ComW with σx restores the accumulation of σx and the expression of late genes as ComW contributes to the stabilization of the alternative sigma factor X against proteolysis by ClpXP and is required for full activity of σx in directing transcription of late competence genes (Piotrowski, Luo, and Morrison, 2009).
Based on these findings, we tried to integrate this ComW into the mechanism to see whether and how the presence of ComW affects σx. We firstly cloned out the comX gene expressing σx, and comW genes from the genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 strain. We then used BBa_K880005 (consisting of constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and strong RBS BBa_B0034 ) from the BioBricks to express those genes.
