A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

OVERVIEW
Modeling is a useful and powerful tool, which can reduce the waste of time in experiments and predict a proper direction of our work. Thus, the modeling work is essential dealing to the complexity of E.co-lock.
In E.co-lock, we developed layered AND gates to simulate the construction of electronic lock. At the same time, a common quorum sensing system: Min system is also introduced in E.co-lock. Therefore, we developed an integral and excellent modeling to our system. We will introduce our model to you one by one and at last we have a combination of these model. In particular, we described and solved following questions:
(1) The condition of sensors after adding different inducers.
(2) The effect of quorum control inducer（AHL） to a single cell
(3) The cell density influenced by MIN system
(4) A connection of layered logic gates and MIN system
Small RNAs Regulatory System Model
sRNAs can regulate protein expression by pairing with target mRNAs. We construct an easy model for this process by the equations as follows[1]:
Then we wrote some other equations which describe the normal condition (without sRNA) of mRNA and proteins. We removed the equation for sRNA and the factor related to sRNA in other equations:
The parameters are the same as previous described. We combined (I) and (II) by time parameter. At first we use equations (II) to simulate the normal process of transcription and translation. After some time we use the equations (I) to simulate the repression the process in which sRNAs pair with target mRNAs. The figure 1.1 shows the results.
Because the parameter μ is not a certain number that can be tested by experiment, we use different value of μ to simulate the process. The results shows as figure 1.2:
From our experimental data, the efficiency of sRNAs selected by ourselves are around 55%. According to these data we chose the value of μ that can suit the experimental data best so that we can have better  simulation for next big model: Layered AND gates.
Layered AND Gates Model
The construction strategy we use for this model is the same as sRNA’s. We wrote a series of differential equations associated with each other to simulate the dynamic change of all the materials (including inducers, mRNAs, sRNAs and proteins).In this model, we"

All these four sections, together with linkers, enable us to build the second type of fusion protein, which can be anchored to the cell membrane. Besides, FP, the fluorescent protein is also needed when we want to detect whether the fusion protein is expressed. During detection, FP is expressed between ssDsbA and Lgt while enzyme is not linked to the whole fusion protein in order to ensure its proper size. For different connectee, we can use different fluorescent protein to detect the expression successively, so that they can be distinguished easily.
In conclusion, with the help of our artificial multi-enzyme complex systems, we are sure to improve the dynamic characteristics of metabolic reactions in many applicational fields.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#summerscienceparty_-_-_TEXT.html," these responses contradicts to our research findings prior to the events. There is no valid proof that GM food is harmful to human health. Our team realized that this misconceptions and bias can be an important barrier to the advancement of synthetic biology, so we had tried to educate or event participants further throughout our project introduction and posted articles on synthetic biology on local science FaceBook page.
We also got feedbacks asking opinions about our project, which some parents were interested and spent time discussing with us at our booth.
From this feedbacks, we were able to draft out an idea how our future project would look like. We sought to interview with Prof. Terrence Lau who is knowledgeable about current GMOs situation in Hong Kong. It is also a surprise that GMO papaya is actually very common in Hong Kong,  while our survey conveys that people know GMOs in a broad sense, but not the GMOs that surround them.
Throughout the interview, we sparked another similar idea that we can also tackle, which is the Genetic Containment Strategy, where we also care about preventing accidental release of the genetically engineered organisms, and we sought more in-depth detail about how to improve our construct to Prof. Matthew Bennett

Faculty contributions
Clarissa Czekster—Dr. Clarissa Czekster is the glue that holds this team together.  She did everything from teach us how to use a plate reader to giving advice on what experiments to conduct next and from helping to conduct the lessons for primary school children to trouble shooting our system when some experiments didn’t work.  Thank you so much Clarissa!
Helder Ferreira—Dr. Helder Ferreira gave lots of good theoretical advice on the design of the system and was an excellent resource when we had questions or needed guidance on how to proceed.  He gave great examples of useful databases and software to use when designing each of our composite parts.  He also gave us safety training at the beginning of the summer as well as things to consider regarding aseptic technique.
Anne Smith—Dr. V. Anne Smith played a major role in the fundraising necessary to even begin this project.  She helped write grants and made contacts with funding bodies to help us pay for iGEM registration and the cost of Jamboree attendance.  She gave advice on possibilities for computational modeling strategies and was a major organizing force for the Scottish Meetup this summer.  She’ll also be serving as a judge at the Giant Jamboree.
Chris Hooley—Dr. Chris Hooley gave significant time and effort to help us in the modeling component of the project.  His advice and expertise were invaluable in creating the differential equations used to understand the mechanism of our system on a quantitative level.
Paula Miles—Dr. Paula Miles helped us design questions for the surveys for our human practices, shepherded the them through joint ethical approval from the Schools of Biology and Psychology, and will assist in their administration throughout this fall and into the future.
Mhairi Stewart and Alina Loth—Dr. Mhairi Stewart and Alina Loth were instrumental in reaching out to primary schools for our educational program, and gave great advice on how we should go about designing it.  They helped us make contact with Dr. Margaret Ritchie, and the outreach part of our project wouldn’t have been the same without them.
John Mitchell—Dr. John Mitchell was invaluable in securing funding from the School of Chemistry.

Therefore, we can evidently improve the output of riboflavin by knocking out the FMN riboswitch or overexpressing RibB. Related experiment statistics can be referred from Fig 3. Compared with the whole riboflavin synthesis genes cluster, RibB has the advantages of convenience, high efficiency and short sequence as it is only 654bp. Consequently, our team choosed RibB as a report gene to construct parts and then builded the connection between heavy metal ions and RibB and finally used the product of RibB riboflavin to impact the voltage of MFC so that we realized the monitoring of heavy metal ions automatically, quantitatively and efficiently.

V) Results
Filling the tube all the way to the top of the base of the neck made it easier to pull the tubes out avoiding any accidental mixing of gradients. We noticed only one band in the tubes.  The one band that we observed seemed to have bacterial debris just from a naked eye observation, we will be spot testing the band to see if it contained any phage.

At this time, I have a working prototype for the site. It has a user interfaces with forms and/or dropdown menus to select the desired compound. From there the site will return the shortest path (by number of reactions). It displayed the KeggID and common name of each intermediate, as well as the reaction ID's that correspond to the returned pathway. It's final feature to date, is listing the cofactors and additional substrates that were assumed to be present for the pathway to succeed.

Biobricks!! - The goal of our project will be to provide the user with all the biobricks that code for all the enzymes needed for a particular reaction pathway.  So first, we will have to figure out the genes that code for all the enzymes that will carry out a particular pathway.  First, we will take the nucleotide sequences for these genes and check whether the exact sequence already exists in the existing biobrick database.  So we will have to scan through the biobrick registry to compare our sequences with the existing sequences.  Since the current biobrick registry only has about 3200 parts, it is highly unlikely that the exact sequence will already be existing.  However, if any of the sequences do already exist, the program will tell the user that the biobrick for that particular gene already exists, and for the remaining sequences, the program will construct biobricks for all these genes and display them for the user. Now from what I think, each biobrick will be one gene.  (Because one enzyme cant come from two different genes, but one gene can code for several proteins).  Each gene can either code for a single enzyme, or multiple enzymes.  So if a particular reaction pathway contains 20 enzymes, there may be up to 20 different biobricks.  The program will add the appropriate suffix and prefix to the sequences, assign them to a biobrick standard, and then present them in a proper biobrick format.  (Now Im not sure if we could combine these biobricks into one biobrick, since all the biobricks code for one reaction).  So the user then can order all these biobricks, and then in lab, can insert these plasmids into a bacteria and carry out"

The PCR for pC13A failed again too. We miniprepped our pAh13G cultures. Our new fungal culture doesn’t have nearly as much mass in it, leading us to believe that the old cultures were almost definitely contaminated with bacteria. Our transformed pC13BK and pC13BM grew into masses covering the plates rather than colonies, and the others didn’t grow. We restreaked pC13BK and pC13BM hoping for single colonies. We attempted a diagnostic protoplasting, determining that pellets formed are likely from contaminations, as the new cultures with ampicillin did not produce pellets. We also tried to manually extract mycelium and enzyme digest it, but microscope visualization did not show signs of protoplasting having occurred. Even after filtering through one layer of cheesecloth and nylon, there was no appearance of protoplasts.
Digest screen of PtrpC + T7 polymerase and the Anderson promoter + T7 polymerase showed good expected banding pattern. The pC13CK construct is correct. A gel of pC13CB PCR products was run and was inconclusive. We repeated the PCR from yesterday for pC13AF, pC13CV, pC13I and pC13L but using the Q5 polymerase. Except for pC13AF from colony #2, all else failed. We attempted to protoplast again, this time with emphasis on determining what our issue is in hopes that we can fix it.

Human Practices
The University of Calgary team used a wide range of approaches to Human Practices, from generating awareness about iGEM and enthusiasm for synthetic biology to rigorously examining the legislation surrounding the toxin that we are studying and assessing the market for a biosensor for naphthenic acids.
To enhance community outreach, the team visited a school outside of Calgary to promote iGEM and science in general. The Student Union at the University of Calgary recently sanctioned a new iGEM club that we will be developing. We are hoping to promote iGEM and help attract new members to the team. Two of our current members competed in a presentation competition and exposed a new range of scientists and engineers to the ideas and themes of synthetic biology.
To fully understand the role that our biosensor will fill in environmental assessment, we first needed to find out how the government looked at naphthenic acids in tailings ponds and how they regulate their cleanup. This led to a report that we have summarized on the government regulation page .
We recently collaborated with the iGEM team from the University of Lethbridge on an E. coli growth assay. The results of this collaboration can be found here . Lastly, we are in the process of making a music video . Stay tuned for updates on this after the wiki freeze!

IngenuityLab_Canada,2016,Team:IngenuityLab Canada#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the last third is assigned to the party that is responsible for commercialization. So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology independently, they would have 2/3s of the company share. The most likely progression of dNANO would be first to patent the technology. Once we own the exclusive rights, TEC would then suggest connecting with industry partners who we would licence our toolkit to. Alternatively, TEC also suggested an option to a be likely route, where we would give the company exclusive rights to our technology for 1-2 years. In this time, logistical aspects would be dealt with the company such as scaling up production or further developing the technology in house. We would then licence out the technology to company once the option expires. TEC has also given insights into how other factors can play a role in whether startup is successful or not. For example, does the technology in question address a market need? If not, then demand for such a technology will not exist and the startup will fail. Other pitfalls, are that start-ups fail to recognize how long it takes for technology to become commercialized and end up bleeding themselves out financially. At the moment, the market share for nanotechnology has been slow, however most efforts are focussed on drug delivery. Perhaps, future innovations in DNA origami should be directed at novel drug delivery methods?
As a project that originated from the university, share of the venture would be divided in a way where a third is assigned to the university, a third is assigned to the inventors and the last third is assigned to the party that is responsible for commercialization. So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology independently, they would have 2/3s of the company share."

This page shows all the parts we have made or used in our whole project. Click on the links below to see our constructs on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts in detail. Click here to access our result page for an overview of our achievements with those parts.
How our system works:
Data For Our Favorite New Parts:
Mitochondrial leader sequence, BBa_K1119001 : for directing proteins to the mitochondria. When the mitochondrial leader sequence is attached, glyoxylate enzymes AceA and AceB can be led into mitochondria to facilitate glyoxylate shunt.
Cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV Promoter), BBa_K1119006 : constitutive mammalian promoter. With the CMV promoter, constitutive expression of the glyoxylate genes aceA and aceB can be realized.
Human Elongation Factor-1alpha promoter (EF-1alpha Promoter), BBa_K1119010 : constitutive mammalian promoter. With the EF-1alpha promoter, constitutive expression of the glyoxylate genes aceA and aceB can be realized.
Data for Pre-existing Parts:
Kozak-XbaI-NLS-6His-Stop, BBa_J176171 (Haynes Lab, 2007): used as a backbone for PfadBA and Pfabp1.
hGH-PolyA, BBa_K404108 (Freiburg Bioware iGEM, 2010): hGH PolyA tail was added after the GFP sequence in the construct of BBa_K1119008 and BBa_K1119009 for characterization of MLS, which gave us the expected results.
GFP BBa_K648013 (Penn-State iGEM, 2011): green fluorescent protein reporter ( BBa_E0040 ) with RFC 25 assembly standard prefix and suffix was used as a reporter for characterization of MLS and the CMV promoter.

Plaques from the titering can be used for sequencing: time the procedure so that plates are incubated at 37°C for no longer than 18 hours, as deletions may occur if plates are grown longer. Stored at 4°C, plates should be used to pick plaques within 1–3 days of plating. The remaining eluate can be stored at 4°C for at least one week.
For preparation of individual clones for sequencing or ELISA, set up a 10-ml overnight culture of ER2738 from a colony, not by diluting the titering culture. Proceed with plaque amplification. Do not amplify the third round eluate and carry out a fourth round of panning unless the characterization shows no clear consensus sequence or phage ELISA results are negative.
Plaque Amplification for ELISA or Sequencing
Selected phage clones can be identified by DNA sequencing, and target specificity can be confirmed by phage ELISA. In both cases it is necessary to amplify phage, either from individual plaques or from the eluted pool, to obtain sufficient quantities to work with.
Dilute an overnight culture of ER2738 1:100 in LB. Dispense 1 ml of diluted culture into culture tubes, one for each clone to be characterized. 10–20 clones from the third round are usually sufficient to detect a consensus binding sequence.
Use a sterile wooden stick or pipette tip to stab a blue plaque from a titering plate (important: plates should be less than 1–3 days old, stored at 4°C and have less than 100 plaques) and transfer to a tube containing the diluted culture. Pick well-separated plaques. This will ensure that each plaque contains a single DNA sequence.
Incubate the tubes at 37°C with shaking for 4.5–5 hours (no longer).
Transfer the cultures to microcentrifuge tubes, and microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 30 seconds (see next section to purify sequencing template). Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and re-spin. Using a pipette, transfer the upper 80% of the supernatant to a fresh tube. This is the amplified phage stock and can be stored at 4°C for several weeks with little loss of titer. For longterm storage (up to several years), dilute 1:1 with sterile glycerol and store at –20°C.

Chris completed mini-preps and digestions on components to be ligated together to test the suspected construct for the Multidirectional Promoter Project. Kevin worked more on the animation and got to another milestone.
Tuesday, July 24, 2012
Hannah ran a PCR on the vector component for the Multiple Start Codon Project. She proceeded to complete another CBAR to try and get the missing segment into the construct. Kait and Victoria inserted a fragment into their vector backbone. This will hopefully yield the construct for the Codon Optimization Project. Kevin ran a gel extraction and cleanup on a gel run by Chris.

Chris completed some annealings for inserts for his construct for the Bidirectional Promoter Project (formerly known as the Multidirectional Promoter Project). Kait and Victoria ran some miniprepps and plated some cultures to create stocks of their construct components for the Codon Optimization Project. Hannah learned more about working with webpages. Kevin made some more progress with the animation.
Thursday, July 26, 2012
Chris completed some transformation into new CC and old CC. This will not only show if his construct is correct, but also determine how good the new CC are. Hannah ran some transformations to see if she got the completed construct for the Multiple Start Codon Project. Victoria tracked down the required materials for running flow cytometry on samples when the Codon Optimization Construct is completed. Kevin made more headway with the animation.
Friday, July 27, 2012
Kait completed 12 mini-preps of two components needed for one of the assembly methods for the Codon Optimization Project's construct. She also made some stock cultures for the freezer for long-term storage. She also picked some colonies and cultured them. Kevin continued work on the animation.

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," use “self-remedies” instead of standard treatment which can keep lesions at bay, but there is lack success in resolving of the condition as the parasite often returns. Also, the current standard treatment for Leishmaniasis in the country (Glucantime, an Antimony based drug that can cause liver and kidney damage) consists of a series of painful 15ml intramuscular injections for 20 consecutive days. Often, those infected stop in the middle of treatment, or sometimes don’t present at all due to fear of pain. This poor compliance is a major problem as without completing the full course of treatment, the parasite can continue to spread and increase in severity.
This provides the the answer to the first question.. Not only did he mention that around 2,700 cases present per year in the country, but as many people with the disease don’t present, and many others refuse treatment, the figures of those infected in reality are actually much higher than the numbers reflected by this. Also, lack of compliance to the current treatment and lack of education about the disease would suggest that a prevention may be a much better solution than a treatment. So we concluded that not only is there a need for immunisation against Leishmaniasis, but the need is actually much greater than we had ever anticipated.
Also, the fact that many attempt to treat the lesions with home-made self-remedies indicates that people do actually want to treat the condition, so a viable therapeutic should be welcomed by the population. But it appears that the inconvenience and pain involved in the injected antimony treatment is a major factor in detering people from seeking medical help for the condition. This highlights the need to ensure that the treatment is convenient and that it doesn’t instigate fear to be accepted by the population. More on this will be discussed following our visit to the Choluteca area.
A recording of part of the conversation with Dr. Valladares can be found here
National Autonomous University of Honduras, Tegucigalpa
Leading on from the visit to the hospital, we were eager to learn more about the condition in Honduras, and to deepen our understanding of Leishmaniasis on a scientific level. Thus, we visited the National Autonomous University of Honduras in Tegucigalpa, where we met Dr. Jorge Alberto Carrasco. Dr. Carrasco is head of Immunology and Parasitology in the University, and he is a leading expert on Leishmaniasis in the country. He is also part of the biosecurity council of Honduras.

Observations:  Upon adding lysis buffer, the solution appeared very milky/cloudy.  Perhaps too much cells were used.  The final supernatant had a moderate yellow tint.  Both the pellet, and the supernatant were stored in the -20C.  It is possible that the pipettes used may be erroneous.
Conclusions:  BCA will be used to measure protein concentration tomorrow, in order to determine how much of the His-resin to use."

Linkoping_Sweden,2016,Team:Linkoping Sweden#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"Everyone obtains information in different ways; for example some by listening, others by watching. When it comes to science, the text and information sources can be quite heavy if you are not used to read concise texts and are not familiar with technical terms. Since we aim to reach out to all of the public, we wanted to make our project and information accessible for everyone independent of background and preknowledge of synthetic biology. With this in mind, we made a short film where we explain our project in a basic way with illustration in order to concretize.
Industry and commerce
NuLink is a municipality owned Business Corporation that acts as a communication channel between the municipality and the business community. LiU iGEM in help of NuLink are spreading the message of our research, synthetic biology and young entrepreneurship through Nulinks many channels such as website and social media. Besides an opportunity to spread our message among companies, it also creates opportunities for future cooperations.
Additionally LiU iGEM has been working on getting connections with different local companies. By letting the industry know we exist we can find suitable cooperation for the future as well as support and knowledge from companies that are working towards a common goal. LiU iGEM has visited and informed companies working both with urban planning and oil testing hoping to maintain a prospective contact.
Media
Social media
By frequently updating our Facebook and Instagram account we have allowed our followers to see how our work is proceeding. In our posts we interviewed different personalities connected to the project, showed different experiment from the lab, informed about fundraising and cooperations with other iGEM teams.
Reaching the broader public
We also believe it is important to share our work with the broader public in order to raise the awareness of potential solutions for climate friendly fuels. The project has been highlighted in three different newspapers;  Östgöta Correspondenten, Affärsliv and LiU-Nytt as well as in on the local news channel SVT News.
In progress
Quintek
Each year Linköping University hosts an event called The Quintek days, this year it will be held in the beginning of November. The purpose for this event is to introduce and increase the interest for science and technology to girls in the senior year at high school. This year LiU iGEM will be there as well, to introduce the girls to synthetic biology and higher technical studies. We hope that this will increase the common knowledge for synthetic biology and that the girls will be inspired to higher education.
New iGEM teams
We had ambitions of starting new iGEM teams at other universities in Sweden with science departments"
Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", the prototype . With this design, the need to bring genetically modified yeast into a hospital environment is made redundant. In Sweden a specific approval is needed to be able to work with genetically modified organisms and it would be the most efficient to use laboratory facilities that already have this approval [1]. Another benefit with this design is that there is absolutely no risk for patients to inhale the genetically modified yeast.
The second step was to ensure that the yeast used as a biosensor is in no way dangerous to the environment or to the people working with it in the laboratory facilities. Risk assessment of the procedures connected to the biosensor show the normal risk associated with working in a laboratory environment. With the right knowledge, correct safety clothing and precautions, the laboratory personnel should not be exposed to any harm.  For more information regarding the safety, see Notebook, safety .
When working with genetically modified organisms it is important to consider the ethical aspects and acknowledge possible hazards for the environment. In this case, the yeast should be limited to the laboratory environment and not be spread or get in contact with nature.

mtrB
Many genes are involved in S. oneidensis’s complex respiratory system (Heidelberg et al. 2002).  We focused on mtrB, which encodes a 679-amino-acid-long outer membrane protein involved in the binding of metals and the localization of outer membrane cytochromes during reduction (Bretschger et al. 2007).  It is unfortunately toxic in E. coli (Saffarini).  Bretschger et al. recently characterized the role of mtrB in anaerobic respiration of S. oneidensis by looking at the effects of knock-out and complementation of mtrB on the electrical output of S. oneidensis.  It was found that the strain which lacked mtrB produced less than 20% of the current generated by the wild type strain.  In complemented strains, where mtrB is expressed constitutively under the control of the lacZ promoter in the knock-out strain, the phenotype was rescued with a similar amount of current being produced to that of the wild type (Bretschger et al. 2007).  Not only does this experiment demonstrate the importance of mtrB in reduction in S. oneidensis, it also suggests a mechanism by which this electrical output could be controlled.  Transforming plasmids containing mtrB under the control of an inducible promoter into mtrB knock out S. oneidensis, would conceivably create a strain of S. oneidensis which could increase its electrical output in response to the turning-on of the promoter controlling mtrB expression.  The creation of a strain with an inducible electrical output could have important applications in biotechnology by creating a system which couples the ability of S. oneidensis to respond to a diverse array of stimuli with the speed and ubiquity of electricity.
Since we found construction intermediates from the registry to be especially useful, we provided our intermediates with mtrB with RBS, terminator, or both"

Overview
As we think iGEM can be enjoyed by everyone, we designed our three-part human practice project, which is consists of the tale, the synbio chess game, and plenty of activities and outreaches.
The Tale of Ghost and Elf, written by our team member Xiaoyue Yang, is a supplement of the masterpiece The Little Prince. It is a fantasy, as on the planet Ecoli, the Little Prince happens to meet a girl named Summer. They come across a catastrophic pollution of atrazine, but fortunately Summer is a scientist, and she creates the Ghost Sensor and the Atrazine Seek & Destroy system to defeat the herbicides.
The story is well plotted and illustrated that we think it a work of art. Throughout our survey and outreach, we realize that synthetic biology is a science that is rather far from our common life. Thus we want to make it easier to see and touch with the use of art. Since the tale is suitable for all ages, synthetic biology can be more acceptable by the public.
The Synbio Chess Game, designed by Xihan Li, is a special board game for synthetic biology. The route on the gameboard are molecules: DNA helix, mRNA and polypeptide linking one by one, with function units like enhancer, descriptions like methyl, and typical"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Introduction
What is terminator?
Terminators are genetic parts that cause transcription to stop, which usually occur at the end of a gene or operon. In prokaryotes, terminators usually fall into two categories (1) rho-independent terminators and (2) rho-dependent terminators.
Rho-independent terminators are generally composed of palindromic sequence that forms a stem loop rich in G-C base pairs followed by several T bases. The conventional model of transcriptional termination is that the stem loop causes RNA polymerase to pause and transcription of the poly-A tail causes the RNA:DNA duplex to unwind and dissociate from RNA polymerase.
Terminator Efficiency：
In prokaryotes, many termination sites serve as targets for regulating gene expression. It is important that transcription is imperfectly terminated at some terminator so that the ratio of the amount of the mRNA transcribed from upstream and that from downstream of the terminator is controlled. This regulation is quantified by the termination efficiency (%T), which is determined by the terminator structure's ability to block the transcription by detaching the RNA polymerase from the DNA. In both in vivo and in vitro, the terminator efficiency of the terminator ranges from 2% to 95%.
Software：
We also developed a software and a web server for people to calculate their terminators and built a database of terminator efficiency which we believe is the largest database of such kind.
Algorithm：
Now, our algorithm is mainly based on a algorithm put forward by d'Aubenton Carafa. Also, we had a look at other terminator-finding algorithms.

METU-Ankara
Since M4B contains bioparts from 2011 distribution in its database and we know METU-Ankara Team who are engineering E.Coli to decrease harmful effects of methane gas use 2011 distribution as well, we sent it them.
Their feedback is the following.
Click on the image to view larger size.
""We are constructing a device that is induced by IPTG and that gives lysis enzymes and GFP as the outputs because, in order to elute methanol we need to kill our modified cells that convert ambient methane to methanol and the reason why we want GFP as one output is to be sure that it works. Our modelled device has promoter induced by IPTG, RBS, gene coding GFP and lysis cassette ending with cell death and we are glad to have it and it's working how we expected. So then, we use M4B to see that if it finds the exact device or the device that can do the same job. Since the software has only one place for output, we queried IPTG as an input and GFP as an output on the software and got corresponding 117 results. These results contain devices exactly what we have one for the same operation. However, we couldn't find the lysozyme output for the IPTG input in the software.""
We are pleased to hear the feedback of METU-Ankara Team and it's good the know that their first query on our software was successful. As for the second one, we haven't included DNA, RNA and tags yet. It's one of our future plans and next year, it'll be done. Furthermore, queries with multiple inputs or outputs will be available. So, in one operation, they will be able to get what they want.

Full System Kinetic Model
With a preliminary understanding of how our system works we proceeded to quantitatively model our entire system. To do this we used the kinetic constants found in our experiments from the TALE and prussian blue ferritin characterization to build a deterministic model in Scilab. We modelled the binding of an immobilized TALE to target DNA in solution and then the subsequent binding of one of our FerriTALEs. We then used the Michaelis-Menton kinetics of our prussian blue ferritin to calculate how quickly it converts TMB into the coloured product that we can see. A list of our constants and variables can be seen in the table below.

Table 1.Variables and constants used in our deterministic model.
When we assembled our reactions into differential equations we had 6 equations to cover the change in our 6 variables over time. These can be seen below in the screenshot of the Scilab model.
Figure 5. Screenshot of the code for the Scilab model showing the differential equations governing the change of our 6 variables over time.
When this equation was run with the amount of DNA present in a super shedding cow the output chemical, X, changes over time as shown below.
Figure 6. Change in X, the output chemical of our prussian blue ferritin reaction, over time in a system with the amount of target DNA present in a super shedding cow. The red line indicates the concentration at which the reaction becomes visible to the naked eye.
The red line on the figure above shows when the reaction reaches 22.176 µM, which is the concentration at which a blue dot or line becomes visible. This value was calculated based on the kinetic parameters we determined in our characterization of prussian blue ferritin . This takes approximately 4.9 minutes, meaning that we will be able to see a visible response from a super shedding cow in less than 5 minutes!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar"
FAFU-CHINA,2016,Team:FAFU-CHINA#page4_-_-_TEXT.html,". We devoted to prepare a lecture for them, talking about what synthetic biology and iGEM is based on their knowledge learnt from the biology classes set by their own school. At the same time, we used the simplest words we can express to explain our project concept. Primary PI, Dr. Wei Huang briefly introduced synthetic biology and iGEM. Team member Jiashun Xiao introduced our project and Haiyan Wang concluded the newest progress made on plasmid construction. We collected their questions and suggestions, which may give us new thoughts about our projects. Their teacher said that, “although I have no biology background, I can really understand what you were talking about. Your works are really amazing and I am deeply impressed.”
Actually we always want to inspire those youngsters and we hope several years later, it are them who push synthetic biology forward and make great progress.
The lecture given by Dr. Wei Huang, Jiashun Xiao and Haiyan Wang, to high school students joining SUSTech Summer Camp.
Citizens and residents
In addition to student population, we thought our project must be known by a wider range of people. Besides, to make our “Sound Visualization” closer to life, we hope to make our effort turned into actual therapy idea or new way to modify genetic structure in response to mechanical stress or sound. We start to concentrate on those who have problems with hearing, not only limited to those with damaged hair cells in ear or other components of ear, but also all of the people with hearing loss in different extents.
We designed a questionnaire on the Internet (link: sojump ) to collect information about the understanding and care about hearing-impaired people, and to find a way that can help them in the most comprehensive and effective way. Meanwhile, we included introduction about iGEM and the basic status of those people and we called for attention to care about them at the beginning of the questionnaire.
To minimize the acquired hearing impairment caused by noise and electronic equipment, we also designed a brochure named ""Shape and Sound"". We printed more than 500 pieces and handed out on our campus as well as several residential communities. In the 6-pages brochure, we introduced the mechanism of hearing forming and the status of hearing-impaired people around the world. We called for concerns about them and also gave several tips for ear caring in daily life in order to reduce chronic hearing loss, which is popular nowadays but draws little attention actually for time course.
Booklets ""Shape and Sound"" designed by ourselves independently. We focused on ear caring and called on public awareness on hearing loss.

As is often the case with enzymes of low substrate specificity, MerB has very slow  turnover rates ranging from 0.7 to 240 min−1 on various substrates. Although relatively  slow for an enzyme, these rates do represent a 106–107-fold acceleration over chemical  protonolysis rates of organomercurials. Paradoxically for a protonolysis catalyst, MerB's  pH optimum was >9. Mechanistic studies revealed retention of the skeletal  configuration of the substrate consistent with the rare SE2 mechanism rather than a  radical-based mechanism.

The problem was the online wiki protocol was correct except for one thing; it missed out the 'shake rigourously' step which comes immediately after the addition of isopropanol. This meant that the proteins didn't properly aggregate and so the centrifugation step didn't properly pellet all of the unwanted substances. Because the mini-preps were conducted in the afternoon, time soon ran out and rather than trying to put the samples right the procedure was abandoned.
Conclusions
Whilst most of the 5ml culture samples were consumed by the mini-prep attempt there was still the 3 flasks of 50ml LB+amp solution growing in the orbital incubator. Therefore tomorrow the Metal Sensing Team will focus on conducting midi-preps without doing mini-preps and will take a small sample of the resulting DNA for analysis.
The online wiki protocol has since been changed to ensure mistakes like these don't happen again.
Stochastic Switch Team
Transformations from last week worked. We had transformed colonies from plates with Tube 1 solution which had the backbone + insert ligaton product. (4 colonies from the plate with 400ul of ligation product and 1 from the plate with 20ul of ligation product)
We also did not have any transformation from the plate(LB + Amp) with cut backbone (pSB1AT3 cut with EcoRI and SpeI). So there was no uncut pSB1AT3.
Today we will plate out transformed colonies and leave them in LB + Amp overnight for tomorrow's minipreps. (Remember to dry the plates having the colonies before using them). We mixed the colonies in 3ml LB + Amp solution and left them overnight in shaking incubator for minipreps.
We prepared 5 fresh plates from 5 transformed colonies and 10 LB + Amp tubes, 2 for each transformed colony. The plates were left in 37C incubator.
For LB+Amp solution we used 5ml of LB + 250ul Amp.
Today we also did fast ligations of the cut sac and ara fragments:
For the ara ligation:
5ul cut pSB1AT3 (12ng/ul)
35ul cut ara (5.5ng/ul)

We continued yesterday's cloning experiment by purifying the insert DNA via gel extraction and dephosphorylation of vector DNA followed by ligation and transformation (see protocoll).
Friday, August 2, 2013
Investigators: Kevin, Anna, Melanie
In order to test the success of the last days’ cloning experiment we conducted a colony PCR. Unfortunately all clones of both our supposed final Prhl constructs were negative. Therefore the PCR was repeated later with new colonies.  The N-butyryl-HSL synthase RhlI with amilGFP reporter cassette (B0032-C0070-B0015-J23100-B0032-K592010-B0015) and the eCFP cassette (J23100-E0420) showed both clones bearing the correct construct.
We also conducted a test in 5 mL 2xYT liquid cultures with different concentrations of ampicillin and autoinducers to test if our new constructs were leaky. Cells bearing the inducible ampicillin resistance and LasR transcription factor (B0015-K091117-B0032-ampR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0079) were tested with ampicillin supplements between 1 and 8 µg/mL. We expected no growth as the ampicillin resistance was not induced.
Cells carrying the inducible ampicillin resistance with RhlR expression cassette (R0071-B0032-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0071) were incubated in 2xYT medium containing ampicillin in concentrations between 1 and 2 µg/mL and additionally 5 to 50 µmol/L N-butyryl-HSL (Rhl autoinducer). As we induce the ampicillin resistance we expect some of the cultures to grow, depending on which concentration is optimal.
Cells carrying the constructs inducible ampicillin resistance combined with LasR transcription factor (B0015-K091117-B0032-ampR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0079) and"

At CCiC, we were attracted by the exquisite comic books made by China Ocean University . This comic book introduced the basic knowledge of synthetic biology in an academic way without losing wit. We used this booklet to help the iGEM team at Fudan Affiliated High school and received fantastic feedback. ""I’m rather surprised at the affinity between synthetic biology and engineering，both featuring logic and inspiration, and thus have a better understanding of the “E” in iGEM.” “The comic vividly explains the basic logics in the biological gene regulation mechanisms. I used to know the very basic control systems like the Lacrosse operon model in E.Coli before, but now I found the more intricate systems no longer out of reach.""
Major Conferences
The iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University
Exchanging ideas is always good for igemers and researchers, so we attended many meet-ups and conferences this year. We intended to attend a conference in NKU on the 6th of July. However, bad weather condition prevented our flight. A video was made to introduce our project before we answered questions from professors and other iGEMers online. Advice was collected and applied to the refinement of project design and purpose. Also we watched the presentation of other teams, getting to know how their experiment goes on. We got familiar with Peking, NKU_CHINA and Jilin_China through this conference and developed collaboration afterwards.

At the iGEM Reporting Conference held by National Chung Hsing University , we introduced our project to professors of synthetic biology and other teams. By this way, we gained valuable feedback from them to enable us to perfect our project background and made us realize the importance of pertinency we should pay more attention to hereafter. Moreover, we are more convinced of the rationality of our modeling after discussing with other universities on modeling issue.

Receptor
Since we want to measure progestin concentrations (e.g. Kolodziej et al., 2003, also see Motivation ) that have an effect on fish but usually do not harm humans (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, 1999) we decided to not use human progestin receptors (for a human cell derived measurement system see for example van der Linden et al., 2008) but rather the progestin receptors of fish for our progestin measurement system. This has some advantages:
Firstly, any progestin concentration that can cause a reporter signal in our system might also affect fish in some way. In fact, we use exactly the progestin receptors that induce the oocyte meiotic maturation in fish and amphibia we mentioned in our project motivation (Zhu et al., 2003).
Secondly, currently unknown compound that can bind to the progestin receptor may have progestin-like effects in fish (see the relation between bisphenol A and estrogen receptors (Takayanagi et al., 2006, Gould et al., 1998, Okada et al., 2008) as an example for such reactions).
We are using progesterone membrane receptors (mPR) that mediate nongenomic progesterone responses and belong to the progestin and AdipoQ-Receptor (PAQR) family (Tang et al., 2005) as “progestin sniffers” for our measurement system. mPR seems to have G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) characteristics though there are no other GPCRs in the PAQR family (Tang et al., 2005, Zhu et al., 2003).
Smith et al. (2008) were able to show that human mPRs can sense progesterone and structurally similar compounds like 17alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone at physiologically relevant concentrations"
TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins are ordinary tools of biologists. The students have seen, by what means organisms are changed and what safety standards prevail in an S1 laboratory. In a final discussion students could ask about synthetic biology.
A second important area in Germany is the elder generation. Demographic trends in Germany go on towards an elder society. Traditional and often conservative thinking restricts the development and especially the exploration of new technologies. For this reason, the iGEM team of Darmstadt took part in a senior session of chemists in order to elucidate the elder generations about the new technologies. Often, the elder one has to face with fear of things, they do not even know. The team has tried to take the fear and tried an open and honest talk about opportunities and risks of synthetic biology. The enthusiasm of the team was also well received by the elderly.
Another aspect is mainly the industry, because they are interested in most cases for new technologies. The iGEM team from Darmstadt got the opportunity to present their project to an economic audience at the ACHEMA. It attended quickly that the questions about the project were very different. Even at the ACHEMA the team had to made persuasions to the company and also informs about the new technology of synthetic biology. Risk management plays a special role, as the technology is in contact to the product and further with the consumer.
Another area in which it should be informed and discussed is the scientific field itself. The CAS Conference - Synthetic Biology offered a good place especially for discussion about pros and contras of Synthetic Biology. Here got the team from Darmstadt the opportunity to present their project to a consortium of scientists. Discussions quickly immersed themselves in tiny scientific details
Probably the most important section are people from everyday life. To achieve these people, the iGEM team had organized an interactive panel discussion. Here were the residents of Darmstadt informed about the project and of course biotechnology and also Synthetic Biology. Guests were able to actively participate in the discussion and remained a few hours even after the end. At the event day, that has been initiated by the eleven German iGEM teams in Berlin, the team was able to take part at an ""Umweltbörse"". This gave the team an excellent opportunity to address the people on the street to interest in the project. Since the project of the iGEM team dealing with environment and recycling, it fits well in this event day of the city of Darmstadt. It's a long way for synthetic biology to be accepted as normal technology in Germany. The iGEM team from Darmstadt played a small part in this"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the MEs were recognized and that the donor DNA was integrated.  We would have expected either targeted or non-targeted integration, but neither occured. Even when we try out the setup with just Tn5 and donor sequence, this yielded no integration.
3.4 Fusion Protein In Vitro Functionality Test
Design: Two assays were performed to prove the in vitro functionality of the fusion protein:
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) verified the ability of fusion protein to load DNA adapter and sgRNA, and form complex with the target DNA (EPO).
Integration assay verified the target specific integration of fusion protein.
Results and interpretation: We successfully performed EMSA to individual (non-fused) dxCas9 and Tn5 protein (see the notebook ). Next, we performed EMSA to verify that our fusion protein was able to load Cy5-labbelled adapter DNA, sgRNA, and Cy5-labelled target DNA. Figure 17 displays the result of the EMSA on 5% TBE native PAGE as shown by the Typhoon Imaging System.

In 2013 iGEM team Imperial college London increased PHB production 11-fold by adding an extra promotor and ribosomal binding site in front of the phaCAP genes. We created a library of different promotor hybrids in order to investigate elements of importance and possibly increase PHB production further. In order to determine the effectiveness of our library of PHB producing cells, we used flow cytometry. By staining the cell cultures with nile red, we created a relative measure on PHB levels inside each cell. The following results were obtained with 4 biologic replicates of each E.coli strain (Table 4). The E.coli strains were incubated for 28 hours before the measurements were made.

Figure 9 display the number of normalized events on the y-axis and the corresponding intensities on the x-axis. Cells of the different strains are displayed in different colors. Each event represents a cell and the intensity represents the amount of PHB in the respective cell.
Figure 9 shows a clear separation of the different strains. This we would expect for strains with different promoter and ribosomal binding sites in front of the phaCAB genes. We included the BioBrick created by the iGEM Tokyo Tech team 2009 (K934001) and one by the iGEM Imperial College team 2013 (K1149051) as references for our own constructs. The strain containing the reference Imperial College team construct is displayed in green in Figure 9. However, as seen in Figure 9, the events with the largest intensities, originates from the E. coli strain containing our construct (K2018036) . This indicates that our construct generates more plastic, than any other hybrid promoter phaCAB tested in the figure.
Unlike our initial expectations, the results of our flow cytometry analysis strongly suggest that the strongest additional promoter does not produce the largest amount of plastic(see below). However, without further qualitative data, we can only speculate as to why, this is the case.

We will prepare a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measure the                         fluorescence in a 96 well plate in our plate reader. By measuring these in our plate reader,we                         generate a                         standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. Thus we are able to use this to                         convert our cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration.

iGEM Asian Conference
The perfect event that NCTU_Formosa had been preparing for so long started on 7/19, which lasted for 5 days. We had 27 teams present, about 210 attendees from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We even have teams from India and Kazakhstan join us during the meetup through the internet. So all the process of Asian conference is open to the whole world. Throughout the 5-day conference, each team had prepared presentation for their amazing projects and ideas.  After all the presentations, our professors also as judges will give pieces of advice to the teams. Afterwards, Q&A time was a chance to interact with each team. Besides presentation, poster time during every meal not only fed us with exquisitely prepared food but also knowledge. All these activities enable us to rethink our project with different angles, improving our 27 projects into a new level.   At the end of the conference, each team were given special gifts, embrace bunch of friends, and feel happy and proud to be igemers. After the conference, we planned a day trip in Taipei, visiting National Palace Museum and Taipei 101. Both are the must-go attraction that nobody would miss when coming to Taiwan.
Skype meetup
We had 4 engaging internet discussions with teams that were KAIT_ Japan, Amoy_ China, TU Delft, and Oxford. We always learned so much from each team’s amazing idea. After exchanging ideas, we were amazed by them and what’s more, as we talked to different people from different culture, culture shock and multicultural interaction experience were something we were excited about. With all these cross-cultural meet ups, our lives had been spiced up.

Week 9: June 30th - July 4th
We began this week talking to Kirsten Jacobsen from the Public Health Agency of Canada.  Kirsten was a Policy and Practices judge from last years iGEM competition and reached out to our team to become involved in the project and get our team to present via video conference to a committee from the public health agency of Canada regarding our project and the safety measures that we take when working on these projects.   We are additionally looking into Biosafety policy of Canada and plan on using Kirsten as a resource. To learn more about the Biosafety laws in developing countries we also started looking at potential organizations that we can contact for more information.
Week 10: July 7th - July 11th
This week we also started contacting some organizations working with health care in developing countries. We contacted the Health Policy Project, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND). The Health Policy Project got back to us saying they are happy to answer our questions. So this week we started preparing a list of questions that we can ask the organizations that we contact.
Week 11: July 14th - July 18th
The list of questions for the organizations was discussed with all of the members of the Policies and Practices sub-team and sent to Health Policy Project. The questions we asked are: What are the regulatory requirements to get a diagnostic device to market in Ethiopia? What safety tests must a diagnostic device pass in order to be considered approved in Ethiopia? What policies are in place in developing countries such as Ethiopia regarding synthetic"

- Seeing if we can scale our project up to industrial size and see what the yield would be on an industrial scale so we can compare it to current industrial practices.
- Observing the difference in yield/flux between the mono-terpenes and the sesqui-terpenes
 
Was suggested that we look at the Edinburgh team from 2008 who made limonene  and see what they did
 
Lab Work:
 
This week the team have been working on limonene and the aim by next week is to have it working as a bio brick
 
Also this week we want to practise the techniques we will be using on Zingiberene.  So using limonene work on PCR and ligation techniques.
 
With limonene having problems doing a gel extraction of the RBS and promoter, they are small and keep running off the gel.  It was suggested that instead we PCR the RBS and Promoter so there is a higher concentration and it will be easier to see on the gel.  Also to run the gel for less time.

Why Sensitivity Analysis? The models we use to describe a gene network are systems of ordinary differential equations. In the case of ODE models, robustness is generally studied in the context of parametric uncertainty via properties such as robust stability and response to perturbation. Although there is no standard quantitative measure of robustness, a common thread in the literature relates robustness to parametric sensitivity. Parameters whose perturbation causes undesirable changes (either qualitative or quantitative) in some output identify processes with fragility The sensitivity information can then guide the selection of the optimal mutation targets and thereby reduce the laboratory effort.
Theoretical Foundations of GSA
High dimensional model representation(HDMR) is a general set of quantitative model assessment and analysis tools for capturing high dimensional IO system behavior. As the impact of the multiple input variables on the output can be independent and cooperative, it is natural to express the model output <math>f(x)</math> as a finite hierarchical correlated function expansion in terms of the input variables:
<math>f(x)=f_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i})+\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(x_{i}, x_{j})+ \sum_{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}f_{ijk}(x_{i},x_{j},x_{k})+...+\sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{l}\leq n}f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{il}) +...+f_{12...n}(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})</math>
Where the zeroth-order component function <math>f_{0}</math> is a constant representing the mean response to <math>f(x)</math> , and the first order component function <math>f_{i}(x_{i})</math> gives the independent contribution to <math>f(x)</math> by the ith input variable acting alone, the second order component function <math>f_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j})</math> gives the pair correlated contribution to <math>f(x)</math> by the input variables <math>x_{i}</math> and <math>x_{j}</math>, etc. The last term contains any residual nth order correlated contribution of all input variables.

Dangerous chemicals
We tried to avoid the use of dangerous chemicals whenever possible. We have completely banned a number of dangerous chemicals, such as ethidium bromide which had been replaced by anthocyanin for our DNA gel electrophoresis. At the same time, we have restricted  the use of dangerous chemicals (such as acrylamide) which must be clearly placed in marked areas in the laboratory. And we were also required to keep the chemistry reagents in classified storage.

The assumptions we made are:
(1) AraC protein is enough to combine with the arabinose
(2) The concentration of repressor protein will not change while a part of them are combined with the promoter sequence
(3) When the arabinose doesn’t exist, PBAD promoter can be completely silent
(4) The effect of PBAD promoter’s will be fully terminated by the terminator B0015
(5)The ""in-promoter"" will constitutively express the RFP protein when the inhibitor protein doesn’t exist
The reaction processes of circuit are described as below:
PBAD promoter activity:
""In-promoter"" activity:
And groups of differential equations are:
We chose the cI-PR circuit to apply this model. There are some parameters for promoter activity equations:
The initial values and description of variables are:
So we can get the curve describing the relationship between the RFP intensity and time under the different concentrations of arabinose (Fig. 4).
Fig.4 PBAD promoter induced by different concentration of the arabinose from 0.0000％ to 0.0050％ and the PR promoter respond to different concentration of inhibitor to express the corresponding RFP intensity. More arabinose added, less RFP expressed.
From this curve (Fig. 4), we can clearly see the RFP intensity changes with time going on. The concentration of the arabinose will affect the expression of RFP negatively.
After this, in order to get the relationship between the RFP intensity and the concentration of arabinose more intuitive, we also got this curve about the relationship between RFP intensity and arabinose when the RFP intensity was stable (Fig. 5).
Fig.5 this curve is about the corresponding RFP intensity under the different concentration of the arabinose.
From this picture, we can know the ""in-promoter"" activity have a relationship with the different concentrations of the arabinose. That means when we add different concentrations of arabinose, the concentration of inhibitor will also be different. We regarded the concentration of arabinose 0.003% as a threshold, the corresponding expression of RFP (stands for killer) is about 12.05 units. At this point the expression of killer is regarded as just be repressed. Once the concentration of inhibitor decreases further, the killer gene can start to work. Conversely, more inhibitor remains, the killer will be repressed harder. Thus"

Results
Results from model simulations show that GFP is expressed upon detection of persistent organic pollutants, such as polyethylene, in line with expectations. The rate of increase in fluorescence levels eventually decreases, with a maximal asymptotic expression being reached. With this in mind and satisfied that degradation is working as expected in silico, we extended the model to create the cell model for degradation and show how polyethylene is degraded by Laccase proteins and how sensitive it is to changes within biochemical rates.

Edinburgh_OG,2016,Team:Edinburgh OG#Experiments#Cyanobacteria_-_-_TEXT.html,", extended -10 element, the -10 element, and a nucleotide in two positions downstream of the -10 element are considered critical for the correct interaction of a promoter with RNA polymerase (RNAP). One way to regulate transcription is to make use of transcription factors that bind to operator regions within promoters and disrupt or block the RNAP binding sites. Following that same principle, a promoter library was created by Huang et al, using the BBa_R0040 promoter. The L03 promoter was selected from this library of promoters because it showed a moderate repression and high induction rates in Synechocystis in the presence of the repressor protein TetR. The fact that TetR does not naturally exist in the cyanobacteria adds second layer of control over the independent behaviour of the promoter. Meaning that TetR will only interact with the operator regions in the L03 promoter(Huang et al. 2013b). For this research project, L03 was only intended to be used as a constitutive promoter in Synechocystis, meaning that the interactions with its repressor protein and inducer were not taken into account. However, since it will be characterized initially in E. coli, and the bacteria produces its own TetR, in order for it to work, aTc experiments will be required for gene induction.
Sca6-2
The Sca6-2 promoter, comes from Albers and co-workers, rational design approach towards the existing tac promoter. The tac promoter being a hybrid generated from the E. coli promoter regions Ptrp and Plac. Several iterations were generated by mutating nucleotides in a step-wise manner within the −10 and −35 cis-acting regions of the promoter. This produced a library of several promoters with a dynamic range of expression strength as well as its ability to be repressed, thanks to the lac operator sequence located after the -10 region of the promoter. These were further characterized in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Showing that in the presence of the repressor protein LacI, the promoter was able to remain highly repressed. Subsequently, in the presence of the iPTG inducer, the promoter was able to express high concentrations of protein (Stevan C. Albers et al. 2015).
PA1lac0-1
One of the metabolite-inducible promoters that have been previously characterized in Synechocystis is PA1lac0-1 . Derived from the PA1 promoter of bacteriophage T7 (Lutz et al., 1997),"

7/5/13 Bryan did extra research into the best protocol to get the results that we are hoping for. He found a paper entitled, ""Genetic Control of Capsid Length in Bacteriophage T4"" By:A. H. DOERMANN, F. A. EISERLING, AND LINDE BOEHNER
7/8/13 Today we need to address some problems we ran into and make some plans for the future.
1. Plaque sizes aren't consistent, even though we are using the same agarose each time.
2. We haven't been able to observe plaque phenotypes staying the same through multiple generations
3. We have tried multiple liquid cultures and rounds of mutagenesis but we haven't been able to observe clearage in a flask yet.
Good things to model
- Change in plaque size vs. agarose concentration
- Mutant vs wild type phage under UV - graph survival rates
7/10/13 Today we are trying out a different but similar protocol. We are hoping to see clearage in our overnight cultures which we haven't seen so far. This new protocol describes that the phage will super infect the bacteria this would explain why our phage wasn't clearing the flask. The paper states,
""After one round of infection and lysis,all remaining cells become infected. Some of these
lyse on schedule, liberating phage which superinfect the majority of cells which are still unlysed. This
superinfection causes inhibition of lysis (9). Starting at 150 min, samples (5 ml) are removed periodically
and shaken"
Sheffield,2014,Team:Sheffield#LabNotation_-_-_TEXT.html,", improved notation that took into consideration the problems identified initially:
Through our improvements, we used a colour key to represent actions, materials, substances and sterility level; when implementing this, we were careful to pick colours that could be easily seen by colour-blind individuals to make it more accessible. We also used indentations to show orders of instructions where things linked together.
To retest this, we sent the second iteration of the lab notation to the Valencia_UPV iGEM team. From this second testing and the comments and feedback, we saw some improvement but there was still a long way to go.
After further consideration and speaking to post-doctorate students, we concluded that this notation system would be better implemented as a computer programming language as it was already showing characteristics of some existing systems such as Python.
Discussion
On presenting this at YSB 2.0 and the UCL meet up, we received a lot of positive feedback and interest in the notation. Other teams and their members could relate to the lack of standardisation in this area of the project and agreed that this could be a solution to be pioneered.
We hope for this system to be used by future teams and potentially picked up to be implemented into a computer programming language as it has a lot of potential if done successfully.

Another similar “suicide” containment system uses streptavidin (BBa_J36841) (Kaplan, Mello et al. 1999; Urgun-Demirtas, Stark et al. 2006). This protein binds very tightly to biotin, a required co-enzyme for many metabolic pathways. This makes biotin unavailable and causes cell death.

Clotho Framework:
Clotho implements the current biosafety standards as outlined by the NIH and the CDC. Whenever a new part is instantiated, Clotho BLAST's its sequence against a databank of known virulence factors and pathogens and returns the RG number of the highest match. This framework ensures that every part in Clotho has a RG value associated with it. In addition, when composite parts are made by joining basic parts, the composite part is also assigned a BSL number. Finally, all strains in Clotho have a risk group.

This was the first work to investigate the aerobic biodegradation of the energetic compound RDX, and  he discovered that a cytochrome p450 enzyme was responsible for this activity. After graduating in 2001, Nick worked as a postdoc for 3 years at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, USA. The highlight of this work was the isolation of the first and thus-far only known bacterium able to grow on dichloroethene as a carbon source (Polaromonas strain JS666) - this bacterium has now been genome-sequenced.
Nick returned to Sydney and worked for 3 years as a postdoc in Andy Holmes' lab in SMB, studying mobile genetic elements in Pseudomonas stutzeri. This led to a new method for quantifying integron activities that could be applied in environmental bacteria. Nick's research has been supported by ARC Discovery grants, by a NSW Environmental Trust grant, and by collaborations with industry partners (eg. Orica). Nick was our hero throughout the iGEM season, and the amount of support and guidance he provided couldn’t be quantified. From teaching us new concepts (and clarifying old ones), to letting us loose in his lab, and helping us with the constant troubleshooting of protocols, we couldn’t have done this project without him. The amount of faith he had in us, even after the multitude of wonky SDS PAGE gels we presented to him asking for explanations, is what kept us going.

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a"
EPFL,2017,Team:EPFL#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the aptamers and toehold switches, because they are made of DNA, are stable at room temperature and do not require a cold-chain storage to transport. Additionally the lyophilized cell-free expression systems were shown to also retain activity at room temperature for extended periods 2 . This makes our sensor easily distributable without the need for special infrastructures, and resistant to varying temperatures across different regions.
Finally, by using a CFES to amplify the sensor signal, there is no need for expensive fluorescence readers or other specialized machinery to read the output. A simple change of color indicates whether the test was positive or negative. The only skills required to administer the test is how to pipette and potentially how to draw a blood sample. Furthermore, while we did not have the opportunity to try it out, we had planned on making the sensor fully self-contained by implementing it on paper, inspired by the paper microfluidic devices developed by the Whitesides group at Harvard 4 .
Finally, because our sensor is not specific to any protein, it can be used to diagnose a wide range of diseases. In addition the sensor can be retooled for any number of other possible uses. For example it could be used to diagnose crop diseases, another major issue for developing countries. The impact of our biosensor could also extend beyond developing countries with over-the-counter tests to identify microorganisms in your garden, analyze your gut microbiome, or authenticate your wine based on the strain of bacteria it contains. Our sensor also pioneers the idea of distributed bio-sensing, allowing for large scale data acquisition in macro-level studies.
In summary, because our biosensor’s modularity, ease-of-use, low-cost and remarkable flexibility, it can impact a wide spectrum of sectors and make a meaningful difference in tackling major issues such as the proliferation of diseases in developing countries.

The system therefore provides     a selective advantage to re-sensitised bacteria, reducing the likelihood that resistance to the lysogenic phage will develop.

Our Project
The Aim
We based our project on the work of Yosef et al. (2015), and aimed to expand their ideas to create a toolkit for bacterial re-sensitisation. We planned to use two species of lysogenic phage, two species of lytic phage, three CRISPR systems     and two target genes (Figure 4).
Figure 4: A: We engineered lysogenic P1 /  λ (P1 in this example) to contain either a CRISPR-SaCas9, FnCpf1 or SpCas9 system containing     spacers of VanA and KPC (VanA in this example), and a lytic T4 / T7 (T4 in this example) phage containing identical spacer sequences for targeting by the same CRISPR system. B: Cells containing  plasmids with gene regions of VanA and KPC were mixed with engineered lysogenic P1 phages, triggering destruction of the  plasmid by CRISPR-SaCas9/Cpf1 (SaCas9/Cpf1 = blue, CRISPR = orange hairpins, black = VanA/KPC plasmid, cyan = lysogenic P1 phage DNA, purple = lytic T4 phage DNA). C: CRISPR-SaCas9/Cpf1 is continually produced, thus cells could destroy injected T4 DNA and survive infection. D: Cells resistant to lysogenic phages or avoided infection by chance are killed by lytic T4. Thus, only cells with no antibiotic     resistance survive. Figure adapted from (Pires et al., 2016)
The Phages
Because we planned to use an E. coli testing platform, we chose phages that were specific for E. coli. Our lysogenic phages were λ and P1, and our lytic phages were T4 and T7. We chose the λ and T7 phages as these were previously used successfully by Yosef et al. (2015), so we knew it was possible to create a working system with these phages.
P1 was chosen as it"

The lung cancer mortality rate for female experienced a slightly decrease to just below 0.01% in 2011. From the graphs above, lung cancer can be seen as one of the biggest threat to Chinese people’s health, with both high incidence and mortality rate. Only minor differences can be found between the incidence and mortality rate for both males and females indicate that lung cancer is still a life-taking disease with a low chance to be cured in individuals. One of the reason for this is lung cancer always can only be detected and diagnosed when it is already developed into stage 3 or 4. At this stage, cancer has spread into rest of the body which causes the difficulty to cure. Our product can provide a simple, low cost, and efficient way to carry out early lung cancer detection. It is also easy to use which individuals can detect their ctDNA for lung cancer by themselves before going to hospital for a more detailed check.
5.Age-Standardized (Segi Standard Population) Incidence Rates for All Cancers Combined and Estimated New Cases (Thousands) for Selected Cancers in China, 2015, by Geographic Location (partial)
6.Age-Standardized (Segi Standard Population) Mortality Rates for All Cancers Combined and Estimated Deaths (Thousands) for Selected Cancers in China, 2015, by Geographic Location (partial)
Both tables show a huge proportion of lung cancer patients is found in the rural areas in China. Those areas may have their limitation in public health care and medical services. Our product can provide a cheaper and easier way to detect ctDNA which can helps the early diagnosis of lung cancer.
2.Health check market in China
According to statistic data from ministry of public health,  Chinese health market account for 373 million person-time in 2014. It had increased 62.17% compare to 230 million person-time in 2009. However, Chinese still has a relatively low percentage,27.27%, of people having health check each year as the population accounts for 1.368 billion people in China.
The number of people have health check each year from 2009 to 2014 (ten thousand)
Chinese professional health check market capacity is 1.6 billion yuan in 2015. It is predicted that the CAGR of the capacity of health check market will be 25% between 2016 and 2020. Health check market capacity is projected to reach 5.2 billion yuan in 2020."

However, I would have to redesign how you could put things together so I believe I will hold off coding anymore of this until the activity has been finished.  Tomorrow morning I can quickly complete the third construction site script and test with generic notecards.
One thing I'm not really comfortable with the dataserver event yet, which is very important to reading the notecard so I think it would be useful for me to trace the code within this event and determine exactly what it does just so I completely understand how notecard reading works. Since we should probably get started on the base of the spiral that will contain levels I have started to write up some more notecards that are even more basic than the ones I have been writing (transcription, translation etc.) like:
What is a gene?
What is DNA? etc.

1. Sequencing
I have sequenced by Colony 1 and 9 of my Pqrr4+Boo34 (RBS) because they were the closest to the positive controls and the cleanest lanes. For this, I have only used Biobrick CP forward sequencing primers, and no reverse. I only used forward and not reverse because the piece is quite short, and forward primer is enough to read every base pair. These are hopefully being sequenced right now and I am waiting for the result to be in.
2. Competent cells.
Two types of competent cells were made today, and they were TOP10 and XL Gold. Top 10 cells were made because we were running out on them, and XL gold was made because Top10 seemed to be not competent enough for Carol’s luciferase.

Wiki Notebook Page Construction & Housekeeping
Updates sections for all teams are up. Lab section has both a notebook that goes by day (calendar) and a section for each part (so, like the reports. Carol wrote up modelling, lab, and overall project descriptions.
FINALLY figured out how to insert wiki code into HTML tables. I had no idea you could just end  tags in the MIDDLE of tables, put in wiki code, and then continue with the again afterwards. This is extremely useful for the main sections, as wikicode allows us to have a mini table of contents at the top of the page, so I can just put navigational/and mini introductions in the left hand bar.
Jen Hill sent us a few photos from dragon’s den and presentation workshops, so they have been added to the Alberta Events page.
