Two tryptophane residues are involved in cellulose binding in this family which is only found in bacteria. Also, a CBM49 carbohydrate binding domain is found within the protein domain, where binding studies have shown, that it binds to crystalline cellulose, which could be a possible target for immobilization.

The CBD of the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose binding protein gene (cbpA) on the other hand is a N-terminal domain with 92 amino acids, theoretical pI of 4.56 and is also classified as stable. It belongs to the Cellulose Binding Module family 3 (pfam00942/cl03026; Figure 8) and is part of a very large cellulose binding protein with four other carbohydrate binding modules and a lot of docking interfaces for the proteins in its amino acid sequence (Figure 7).
The Binding Assay
Figure 9: Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein in action
To measure the capacity and strength of the bonding between the cellulose binding domains and different types of cellulose many different assays have been made. One of the simplest and most often used is the fusion of the CBD to a reporter-protein, especially green or red fluorescent protein (GFP/RFP) is very common. The place of the CBD is measured through the fluorescence of the fused GFP and quantification can easily been done.
Protocol :
Harvest the E coli-cells producing the fusion-protein of CBD and GFP and centifuge 10 minutes at top speed.
Re-suspend the cell-pellet in 50 mM Tris-HCl-Buffer (pH 8.0).
Break down cells via sonication.
Centrifuge at top speed for 20 minutes to get rid of the cell-debris.
Take the supernatant and measure the emission at 511 nm (excitation at 501 nm) (<partinfo>E0040</partinfo>)
Mix a definite volume of lysate with a definite volume or mass of e.g. crystalline cellulose (CC) or reactivated amorphous cellulose (RAC)

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#CraigNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", such a design required longer than 30 minutes of computation.
The second fix I am working on is developing a hash table where each key is the input vector and the corresponding information is the output design array.  By doing this, we can avoid a number of recalculations.  For example, when we test input vector {1,2,3,4}, we test every element individually and finally come up with an output design (with corresponding part permutation).  Well, rather than test every element, with this hash table, we could find the output design already calculated for {1,2,3}.  Starting with this output design, then we only need to test adding element 4, thus reducing the number of recalculations.  I have not implemented this yet, but I am working on this today.  I believe that this simple fix could allow us to test 6 part designs relatively quickly.
I will continue to update this entry throughout the day.
Hash map implementation is a success!  I can now run my 5 part design in about 2 minutes, using 11 invertases.  Without completely redesigning the software, I think this is as good as it will ever get.  Thus, for now I am going to work on using this ""completed"" tool to characterize the different categories I outlined last week.
6/20/11
- Although I will not be able to attend Tuesday's meeting this week, I wanted to address the update information that will be discussed.
Summary - I have been working on developing an initial expensive invertase architecture that is scalable to N inputs.  To accomplish this, I have built two tools, both enclosed in a single Clotho tool.  One of these tools takes an invertase design and an input, and shows the user what would happen if those invertases were added to the design.  The other tool takes a design and automatically checks whether the design allows for all part permutations to be made.  Now that these are in working order, I found an expensive algorithm and am currently trying to understand why it works properly.
Bigger Picture - This fits well into the overall iGEM project because we are interested in developing a Clotho tool that allows the user to drag and drop parts into a plasmid, and then tells the user where invertases can be placed so that every permutation of these parts can be achieved.  The first step to doing this is to find algorithms that allow for all permutations to be made.  Once we understand these algorithms, we can then place constraints on the problem, such as the number of invertases available"

Meeting Of Young Minds Debate
Meeting Of Young Minds
At the beginning of June, the Rathenau Instituut (a Dutch body which promotes the formation of political and public opinion on science and technology) put out a call for proposals for a debate, the Meeting of Young Minds, to be held on the Friday evening preceding the African-European jamboree.
The first Meeting of Young Minds debate, which took place in 2011 , pitted iGEM teams against representatives from Dutch youth political parties in a meeting of ‘future scientists and future politicians’ to discuss the ‘promises and perils of synthetic biology’. For Meeting of Young Minds 2012, iGEM teams were invivted to submit their own themes for debate.  Our proposal ‘A synthetic biology future, a synthetic biology crisis’ was one of two themes selected.
Our proposal
We decided that we wanted our proposal to have some link to our project, hoping that we might gain some new perspectives from the debate.  At this point in the summer, we knew what our project was going to be, but not how it was going to work, so we came up with the idea of a debate broadly based around geoengineering – deliberate large-scale scientific projects to address or remedy the environmental impact of human activities.
Early ideas included discussion on the ethics of syn-bio geoengineering and the rights and responsibilities relating to such large scale projects.  However, our research quickly revealed that these topics had been already been well-publicized and thoroughly discussed.  We decided to try and avoid the tired and abstract moral"

IRIS Website
IRIS is a website containing resources which are available to over 450 schools from across the world which have signed up for it. Its main aims are to inspire students to pursue careers in STEM subjects and to enrich the work of teachers. The website contains resources covering a wide variety of scientific topics and is a truly unique tool for the schools that can access it.
Being the first UK state school to go to the Giant Jamboree in Boston, our team felt our work was noteworthy enough to have an involvement on IRIS. When we saw that we had been given a small segment with our frog site link included, we were extremely excited. We now have access to thousands more students and teachers who will hopefully be inspired by our work in synthetic biology and the IGEM competition. Because of this we have raised awareness for this fascinating area of science. You can visit the IRIS website <a href="" http://www.researchinschools.org "">here</a>. which shows one of the greatest successes of our human practices.
March for Science
<img src=""
"" style=""width:20%"">
The March for Science took place on April 22nd 2017, where thousands of scientists, journalists and enthusiasts came together in over 500 cities worldwide to stand up for evidence based research, scientific rigour, sound methodology and expertise. Amongst the thousands were five members of the Judd iGEM team carrying a sign to demonstrate their support. This caught the eye of Peter Capaldi – the twelfth incarnation of Doctor Who! After getting his signature and photos, the team continued with the march where they saw many incredible banners and took in the atmosphere where these thousands of people were all marching for one cause. At the end of the march, a variety of scientists and journalists gave 5 minute speeches on why the movement was so important and how this needs to be promoted within society and politics. This march caused the whole team, not only"

iGaME: Synthetic Biology for Gamers
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team is devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically. With a mass of data for the use of modeling, we propose the Standard Biological Parts Automatic Modeling Database Language, which enables descriptions of complicated biological processes. Additionally, previous iGEM project models will be featured to demonstrate the availability of our idea.

Michigan,2017,Team:Michigan#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," holin by binding to T4 holin’s soluble domain. In nature T-even phages produce T4 antiholin to delay the destruction of their host cell.
How It Works
Our design places T4 antiholin under the control of the TlpA36 promoter. T4 endolysin and T4 holin are expressed constitutively. We cloned three different versions of the construct, each with different strength for this promoter in order to leverage the kinetics between Holin/Endolysin and Antiholin. We used the T, JJ, L promoters characterized in Tuning genetic control through promoter engineering (Alper, Fischer, Nevoigt & Stephanopoulos, 2005). At temperatures below 37C, TlpA36 represses T4 antiholin expression, allowing the constitutively expressed T4 holin and T4 endolysin to lyse the cell and preventing its ‘escape’ into the environment.
At 37C however, TlpA36 stops repressing T4 antiholin, allowing it to prevent T4 holin and T4 endolysin from lysing the cell.

A Ribosome Binding Site (RBS; represented by a green circle; BBa_B0030 ), is added between each gene in order to improve the proteic  synthesis.  Finally, a strong terminator BBa_B1006) represents the end of the sequence.
tesB and crt have been described above. ccr encodes a crotonyl-CoA reductase (an oxidoreductase which acts on the double bond CH=CH). hbd from Clostridium acetobutylicum encodes a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA  dehydrogenase (an oxidoreductase which catalyses the formation of alcohol function). atoB , from E. coli, encodes an acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase which catalyses the condensation of two acetyl-CoA.
Butyrate pathway wihout ccr (BBa_K1587005)
This BioBrick construction is the same as the previous one, but for the fact that it does not  contain the ccr gene from Streptomyces collinus.  It is composed of a constitutive promoter P(Bla) ( BBa_I14018 ) and of 4 of the 5 genes present in the previous construction. Genes are issued from two micro-organisms : in yellow from E. coli, and in blue from Clostridium acetobutylicum. The green  circles correspond to the strong RBS sequence ( BBa_B0030 ) based on Ron Weiss thesis and the red one is the terminator ( BBa_B1006 ).
Eradication (formate pathway)
The second module is dedicated to formate production and composed of two key genes : pflA and pflB .
Formate pathway ( BBa_K1587007 )
pflB encodes a pyruvate formate lyase, an enzyme which catalyses  the cutting between C1 and C2 carbons of pyruvate. This enzyme   is oxygen-sensitive and is only active in microaerobic or anaerobic   conditions.
pflA encodes the pyruvate formate lyase activase, an enzyme  which activates pflB.
The formate compound is naturally produced by E. coli, that is why we  decided to overexpress these two genes. For this, pflB and pflA are put  together with"

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Week 1 (19 June - 25 June)
Biology Division
First week detailed experementation plan and lab supplies ordering. We have several candidates for a co-culture.
Microscopy Division
Had the first meeting of the division. Discussed timeline and the components we have available. For now, we will order only camera. Figured out that Biology Labs do not have any lasers and optical benches.
Week 2 (26 June - 2 July)
Biology Division
In the end of a last weeek, we decided to work with algae and bacteria. Biology Lab Safety talk for all team members. Prepared LB media for E.coli and pored it into plates. Freezig E.coli cells for an emergency. Checking plates for algae and liquid culture for transformation. Prepared for plasmid extraction via electrophoresis.
Microscopy Division
We were given access to Physics Labs. It will be our home for the next weeks. We watched laser safety video and started taking pictures with freshly arrived Raspberry Pi V2 Camera. Made prototype of the DIHM. How easy was that?!
Week 3 (3 July - 9 July)
Biology Division
Digested and extracted pLM005. Prepared TAP media plates for algae. Performed colony PCR for ACA3.
Microscopy Division
Flower shape leaves pictures were obtained by shining laser on camera. Problem might be in IR filter on the lens of the camera. We ordered Raspberry Pi V2 NoIR camera which does not have IR filter. While waiting for a new camera, we were trying to make Rapsberry Pi to sent pictures automatically to desktop computer.
Week 4 (10 July - 16 July)
Biology Division
Nanodroped and extracted PCR products. Re-streaked algae. Did cell counts through Optical Density and took pictures of Chlamydomonas. Currently we are devising growth experiments for algae and bacteria.
Microscopy Division
Received NoIR camera."

Moreover, letting scientific project exert real impact on the society, we would like to spread our project and  iGEM  culture. In publicity and education, we have made presentations to introduce synthetic biology,  iGEM competitions and  the  project carried out by our  team to students in  high school  and our university. We sincerely hope that increasing people will know us and join us. Let us see what we have done about human practices.
Farmland Investigation:
We put great elbow grease into connecting human practice with laboratory work. We tried to make our human practice progress along with experiments. In order to analyze the demands of our project. We went to the farmland of our university and a farm in the city center to get rigorous information of morbidity and current remedy.
farm of our university
a farm in the city center
We interviewed a farmer in our city who has had five years experience with wheat planting on his land. He commented that he has suffered a great loss from FHB. In 2015, 40%~50% wheat in his field was affected with FHB. He uses chemical pesticide every year, but it doesn’t always work. It is necessary for him to purchase a new kind of chemical pesticide because plant pathogens were resistant to the original one.
This experience gave us the opportunity to explore the impact our project might have on society. They also assisted us in thinking about responsibility in science.
“safety is important”，it inspired us that “Got to talk more in depth with people who were interested”.

What did we discuss?
1.Could you please tell us the incidence of wheat scab in recent years?
——last year (2016) continued raining and drizzling, as a result wheat scab is particularly serious, the incidence rate of infection is approximately 50% to 60%.
This year ( 2017 ) wheat grew particularly well, almost no wheat scab, the morbidity was less than one percent. You know, infected musty wheat contains vomitoxin. Taking the Huaihe River as the boundary, in the south of the Huaihe River, due to  Huainan climate mostly wet and humid, higher the  morbidity is, vomitoxin content is almost in 1500~1600ppm. Last year the situation is relatively more serious"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," same amino acid is coded for (a different amino acid means an incorrect protein). GAA codes for glutamic acid but so does GAG; thus by changing the third nucleotide from A to G, the final polypeptide sequence remains unchanged (glutamic acid is still coded for) but there is no longer an EcoRI restriction wite within the DspB coding sequence.
Once you have all the DNA sequences for everything you need, it's then time to assemble your constructs in a software like SnapGene. Together, the coding DNA sequences and the control elements make the constructs that need designing. For example, a part of our project looks at different ways of secreting anti-biofilm agents out of E. coli. If we're considering artilysin (one of the proteins we want to secrete), the construct needs to contain the DNA sequence for artilysin as well as a secretion signal (a tag that directs the protein to a secretion system), a histidine tag (enables us to purify the protein at a later stage) and start and stop sequences (enable the bacteria to know where to start reading the DNA and where to stop). We put all of these parts together in the right order so that the bacteria can understand what to make and how to make it. These constructs have to be madr for each individual component of the project. The DNA order can be made after ensuring that the constructs are suitable for DNA synthesis by a company such as IDT.
This is the stage we are at with our project. Most of the Easter vacation was spent finalising our project and the last few weeks have involved sorting our DNA sequences and playin around with SnapGene. Currently, we're making sure that our constructs comply with IDT DNA synthesis rules and double checking that everything is in the right place and right order to put into plasmids when the DNA arrives. After adding the final touches to our constructs, we should be ready to order by the end of next week.
THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION - IMPLICATIONS OF DNA AMPLIFICATION
Introduction
During our time in the lab, we have been getting to grips with several important biochemical techniques, one of which is the Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR. This is a technique which is used to amplify the DNA in a sample, copying it many times so that you end up with a quantity of DNA that can be used for other techniques and analysis. As I'm sure you can imagine, this is very helpful in the lab, but it also has many implications for the outside world.

Short Summary
Expanding the genetic code with unnatural base pairs leads to a variety of challenges. Given that all standard lab methods are designed for a four-letter DNA, methods such as PCR, cloning and sequencing have to be adapted. Additionally, bioinformatic software tools such as BLAST do not work with a six-letter DNA or an expanded amino acid repertoire. Therefore, to validate our work, the development of new methods was essential for our project.
Biological Challenges
All organisms share the same four-letter DNA, composed of the two pyrimidine bases cytosine and thymine and the two purine bases adenine and guanin. This composition of the DNA is the result of billions of years of evolution. The entire cellular machinery is designed to work with or to be compatible with this four-letter DNA composition. Therefore, the addition of two new bases to the DNA proves very challenging from a biological point of view. Firstly, the initial integration of unnatural bases into the DNA is based on the synthesis of modified DNA, which is by now available from almost all DNA synthesis companies. The big challenges arise when it comes"

We made glycerol stocks of the final Prhl (E. coli Top10F'::K1073035) and Plas (E. coli JM109::K1073034) constructs from agar plates of the reactor cultivation.
Furthermore 10 mM stock solutions of the homoserine lactones (autoinducers) of the rhl and las quorum sensing system (1.7 mg N-butyryl  homoserine lactone + 1 ml DMSO and 2.8 mg N-3-oxododecanoyl  homoserine lactone +  933 µl DMSO, respectively) were prepared.
Additionally we repeated the continuous bioreactor cultivation we conducted Monday.
Week 15: August 25 - August 31, 2013
Preparation for exams kept us really busy so just a few experiments were done this week. We unsuccessfully tried to find the source of the mysterious white colonies, which we observed in samples taken from previous continuous cultivation experiments.
Tuesday, August 27, 2013
Investigators: Kevin
Today we checked one pink, one blue and six white colonies from a spread out sample that we took during our previous continuous cultivation for successful integration of our cloned vectors. This was primarily done to reveal the unknown source of white cultures on our agar plates. The blue colony and three of the white colonies were positive for integration of the final Plas construct. These colonies later turned blue. For some reason, all colonies showed integration of final Prhl construct, including the blue control.
Furthermore, we inoculated liquid cultures of final Plas and final Prhl constructs in E. coli JM109 and E. coli Top10 F' cells and also the autoinducer detecting strains E. coli JM109 pSB1075 and E. coli JM109 pSB406 which are used to detect the production ofautoinducers by our constructs.
Wednesday, August 28, 2013
Investigators: Kevin
On Wednesday, we tried to resolve the puzzling results from the colony PCR that we performed on Tuesday, this time with different primer/annealing temperature/DNA polymerase combinations but with the same colonies. However, PCRs didn’t clarify the previous results. Using GoTaq polymerase, the red and the blue colony were positive for aeBlue amplification, while white colonies were negative. PCR with Q5 polymerase indicated surprising integration patterns. Unfortunately, extraction of these bands did not yield enough DNA for sequencing.

It was shown that d-isoCTP is quite unstable even when stored at -20 ℃ (Switzer et al., 1993), possibly due to hydrolysis of isoC. Therefore, we postulate that the reduced PCR fidelity might be caused by a a reduced template integrity.
The results in Figure 17 indicate that the analysis with Nanopore sequencing and iCG as well as the analysis with M.A.X. are orthogonal methods producing the same analysis results. Arguably, it can be supposed that the results produced by Nanopore sequencing are more precise, allowing the detection of uncommon mutation events that are not detectable with M.A.X. Nevertheless, the analysis with restriction digests is much faster and cost efficient.

Kompala et al simulations:
1. Variation in initial concentration of glucose in the medium with a very small concentration of secondary carbon source
The larger the amount of glucose present immediately in the medium, the longer it takes for it to be used up and the population grows more before it reaches a point of saturation. This is an example of resource limited growth. It is not diauxic growth because there is a low concentration of secondary source, so it is not sufficient to start a second exponential growth phase in the bacterial population.
2. Fix the initial concentration of glucose in the medium and sweep through different initial concentrations of secondary carbon sources
Now, we fixed the primary source [Glu]= 1 and varied [S2] (Secondary source) from 1 to 6. The lower the amount of S2, the shorter the second exponential phase and faster saturation of cell growth.
3. Variation of initial concentration of e1 (enzyme metabolizing primary source S1-glucose)
As expected, a higher e1 concentration initially, means faster consumption of glucose so we hit the 2nd exponential phase quicker than with a low concentration of the enzyme. Furthermore, if there is less e1 initially, it takes longer to consume S2 by consequence, so we can see longer delays in reaching the lag phase, and consequently, the second exponential phase.
3. Variation of initial concentration of e2 (enzyme metabolizing secondary source S2)
The less e2 present, the longer the lag phase and the slower the second exponential growth phase. However, as amounts of e2 are increased, the lag phase is not visible and the transition between primary and secondary growth is faster. In theory, e2 should only affect the secondary exponential phase. In practice, enzymes compete and the amouns of e2 also affect the metabolism of the primary source, hence why the glucose metabolism is changed too.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," discomfort if the bandage should grab or got stucked in some skin. It could be a possibility to cover the silk with, for example, Ibumetin (NSAID-preparate), so you could kill the pain locally and avoid the side effects which Ibumetin can have (such as increased stomach acid production, blood thinner effect and much more), or could expand the movement and not prevent limitation of movement under rehabilitation of, for example, fingers. If the patient is hospitalized, the bandage will be washed off with lukewarm water mixed with NaCl (commonly known as salt). This can not be done in the ambulance or elsewhere due to the time and the space that is needed for this kind of treatment. When the wound is kept moist it increases the movement and the flexibility of the surrounding skin/new skin. The pain is minimized because the skin is not as tight and the bandage will not grab skin.”

*Lidocain:is a local analgesic widely used in ambulatory surgeries in Denmark.
**Fibrin: is created in the body under the healing process of a wound. Fibrin and granulation has to be present for an effective healing of the wound. If there is only fibrin when healing, the healing process stops. It is therefore important to ensure that the excess of fibrin is scratched off (often made by a nurse or a doctor).
Interviewing Hans Jørn Kolmos
From your point of view, how big is the resistance problem?
He believes that it is an increasing problem, but it should not be the cause of any panic yet. New strategies should be devolved in the use of antibiotics so the increase in antibiotic resistance becomes limited. Antibiotics should not be used to treat infections that we do not know the cause of. Instead a more careful approach in the distribution should be taken. He suggested a simple approach to this issue: three simple steps should undertaken before giving an antibiotic treatment to an infection. First step is to isolate the bacteria. This can be done by evaluating the microorganisms species, its concentration and the origin of isolation. The second step is to conclude whether the isolated microorganism is the cause of  infection. This can be done in association with e.g. a prosthesis where an infection has occurred. The third step is to evaluate whether antibiotics can be used against the infection. If the infection occurred in a prosthesis, the bacteria would most likely develop a biofilm. If treated with antibiotics, the infectious bacteria will only be exposed to small concentrations of antibiotics and this will provide time to develop resistance."

Human Practice Overview
The HKUST iGEM 2014 team has three main components for human practice: start-up kit, outreach, as well as safety and ethics. Our goal is to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to wide range of audience in the society. We targeted groups of audience consisting of college freshmen, secondary school students and members within the iGEM society. Each group of audience has potential to contribute to the field of synthetic biology in different ways, and we believe that putting equal amount of effort and paying attention to them all should be the best approach to ensure healthy growth and development of the field of synthetic biology.
Start-up Kit
Start-up kit is a manual designed to aid future iGEM teams in starting their own human practice projects. Click to find out more about the items we have prepared.
Outreach
A key element in human practice is to create a link between the society and synthetic biology. Check out whom we have reached out to during this process.
Safety and Ethics

Consumer exposure
Naturally found on our skin and scalp, our organism of choice is a wild type B. subtilis.  The strain is commercially used as a skincare product, a food ingredient for human consumption, in animal feed, in fertilizer, and in an antibiotic substitute 3 .  Its widespread use hints at its low-risk usability in commercial products. Even though both B. subtilis and E. coli used in our product are poor colonizers and lack the ability of producing a significant amount of toxins to harm humans, we chose to keep the E. coli trapped in a membrane inside a special syringe, so only B. subtilis will come into contact with the user’s skin 4 , 5 .
E. coli K-12 strains are considered enfeebled organisms after being maintained in a laboratory environment for more than 70 years. They have also a defective cell wall, so they lack the ability to efficiently recognize and adhere to the mucosal surfaces of the intestinal tract, contrary to other strains found as part of the natural microflora. Moreover, organisms grown under laboratory conditions in general are not particularly competitive in comparison to microorganisms isolated from the environmental niche of the organism 4 .
As in any other skincare product, in our product, in some cases, an allergic reaction may occur.  Therefore, our user manual will include warnings and will refer to possible incidents requiring the user to consult a doctor.  The consumers will also be able to sterilize the containers and comb by themselves, using 70-85% alcohol supplied as part of the final product kit.
Genetically modified organism release to environment
Another advantage of working with B. subtilis is that genetic modifications are made in the genome itself, so the chances of gene transfer decrease due to the absence of independent replicating plasmid. Theoretically, our engineered B. subtilis is able to exchange genes through recombination with other closely related strains, though under most conditions the organism is not biologically active, rather exists in the spore form 5 , thus limiting the spread of the antibiotic resistance genes.
In addition to this, survival of E. coli outside its natural habitat (mammalian bowels) is very limited and a spore form doesn't exist 4 .
In both cases, for personal use the amount of cells that risks being released to the environment is not even close to the amounts released as result of industrial fermentation processes used for the production of a variety of proteins and enzymes, and considered of low risk level according to EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency)"

She suggests that we should not consider the detected increase of the concentration of cGMP as the end of our experiment. We must do more experiments to show what positive changes that will happen to cells and body functions after cGMP increases. Because of over-expressing the gene of sGC and silencing PDE5A, the concentration of cGMP is bound to increase if our experiment is successful. While doctors and patients don’t care about the increase; it is whether the changes in cell and body functions relief of the symptom of myocardial ischemia or not that they take considerable interest in.
In addition, as we know, the lentiviral vector can integrate gene into chromosome randomly, indicating it can transcript anytime. There still remains some questions of biosafety to be answered. For example, we should do deep discussion about how long the RNA interference will last for and whether the interference is reversible or not. In addition, if PDE5A is silenced for too long even forever, how do we assess the side effect like the apoptosis?
If successful, this new therapy can help to save time and money for patients who suffer from myocardial ischemia. Those patients will not need to take medicine every day because the new therapy has more lasting and steady-going effect. Additionally, those who live in outlying poverty-stricken areas don’t have to go to major hospitals. Moreover, it can also be helpful for patients to get rid of a series of side-effects resulting from drug tolerance, drug adverse reaction and so on. Therefore In this way the pain of patients and the pressure of their families can be relieved a lot. As Dr. Guo says, we really hope to make differences to those in need!
(Talk with nurses)
b.Interview Summary of the Interns
Actually, gene therapy is a trend we must follow up. It is a great innovation to combine gene therapy with synthetic biology, where scientists use biological information technology to design and stimulate firstly. With the help of modeling, great achievement will be made in the experiment, while the experiment would feedback to modeling and stimulating. Additionally, we have to say that some existing clinic treatment methods used in myocardial ischemic have lasted for decades, especially the drug, which mainly relieves the symptom, not radically solve the underlying problem. Thus, there is a great necessity in developing a different technique, even though there is a long way to reach remarkable breakthroughs.

Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?
a. Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they? Provide a link to them online if possible.
The EPFL Safety Committee has put together specific protocols to follow with regards to biological and genetic work that are available on their website. These rules are followed by all EPFL labs including the two labs that organize the iGEM experience. These are standard rules covering both the ethics and methodology of all biological protocols. Clicking on the hyperlink will redirect you to the appropriate website listing out all of these rules in detail.
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns or changes that were made based on this review.
The EPFL does have an institutional safety committee, but not specific biosafety committee. We have been in touch with Stéphane Karlen, the biosciences representative to the institutional safety committee. The modus operandi, as far as project reviews are concerned, is to bring in an expert from the safety committee if toxic chemicals or potentially dangerous organisms are being used by a lab. Since this is not our case, we have not had to present a project review.
c. Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If so, describe this training.
We did not receive any specific biosafety training prior to working in the lab. However, whenever a new piece of equipment is introduced or a new protocol is created, we are all briefed on the safety concerns involved in its use. In particular, three of our lab members have received training from the CMI at the EPFL to be able to use the clean rooms for microfluidic chip fabrication. The website for clean room safety  is here . More specifically, the training involves the use and wear of clean room gear (eyewear, body-suits, etc...) as well as the proper disposal of toxic chemicals involved in photolithography.
d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, provide a link to them online if possible.
Switzerland signed the Cartagena Protocol for Biosafety in 2000, and it was first enforced in 2005. For more"
Groningen,2018,Team:Groningen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," The Ball Mill was started at 9:55 and stopped at 10:10. A small sample (200 mg) was taken (ReCellBM15). The sample taken after 15 minutes was not significantly visibly different from the starting material. The milling process was continued at 10:30.
At 11:00 the Ball Mill was still very warm so it was decided to keep it cooling for another 15 minutes and start the next run at 11:30.
From there on out a 15 minute running and 30 minute cooling pattern was kept until 14:15 which samples taken every time the Ball Mill was stopped (ReCellBM30 - ReCellBM90).
A visual comparison of cellulose with different degrees of milling. All tubes contain 200 mg of cellulose but finer grinded cellulose collapses into a much smaller volume then the original, more fibery cellulose.
The samples of different milling times were also compared by making plates of them and comparing colony number and size after 3 days of cultivating.
After milling and taking samples 8,5 g of very fine, colloid cellulose powder were obtained. Parts of the cellulose were further treated with phosphorylation, hydroxylation and ultra-sonication. All prepared cellulose was ultimately used for growth medium, mostly for liquid cultures with a concentration of 2 g/ 100 ml.

M13·DESIGN
Why do we choose M13 bacteriophage?
Our project aims to provide a method for artificial protein evolution, so the selection of target protein carrier is very important. A suitable vector should have a short proliferation cycle and provide enough capacity for target gene. Thus, based on comparison among different vectors, we decided to use Enterobacteria phage M13 as the gene carrier of the protein we aimed to evolve.
Under laboratory condition, M13 bacteriophage can breed a generation every ten minutes[1]. It is demonstrated that capacity of M13 phage vector is limited, but if part of its genome knocked-out, successful expression of larger proteins can be somewhat expected.
Life Cycle of M13 bacteriophage
Enterobacteria phage M13 is a filamentous bacteriophage composed of protein capsid and a circular single stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome of 6407bp[2], where 11 individual genes are categorized into three classes, which regulate its replication, coat packaging, and budding respectively[4].

<p1> Figure 1. Life cycle of Enterobacteria phage M13 in host cell. Mainly shows the replication of viral DNA. Thin thread represents single strand DNA, while bold thread represent double strand DNA. </p1>
To better understand the crucial role M13 played in this system, an introduction of M13 life cycle is necessary (Fig. 1).  The general stages of M13 life cycle comprises: infection, genome replication, assembly of new particles, and then release of the offspring particles from the host.
The genome replication is firmly connected with G2P and G5P. The single-stranded phage DNA that enters the cell is converted to a supercoiled, double-stranded replicative form (RF) by several host enzymes. Phage gene expression ensues, and G2P nicks the viral strand at the positive-strand origin. The 3' end of the nick is extended by DNA polymer"

They seemed so interested in biology. Then we popularize scientific knowledge about synthetic biology and introduced the iGEM competition to them. It was a little changeable for them, so we tried to make it easy to understand. It’s great to share with senior high school students. They are so young that they have some extraordinary ideas which surprised us a lot.
Tongji Hospital Visit
Since our project is about tumor and its treatment, we want to know how will patients and citizens think of it. Thanks to Tongji Hospital, we could get the access to introduce iGEM and our project to the patients, and then we could communicate with them about their life as well. Some ideas were quite constructive and helpful to our improvement of the project, though most patients couldn't understand it well. On the other hand, it's meaningful for us to learn more about empathy and care. We are willing and determined to do more volunteer work about health and care in the future. IGEM is a great platform to start, and there is a long way to go.
Team Communications
Taipei Workshop in NYMU
We are proudly invited by National Yang-Ming University, an active iGEM team to have a visit in Taipei in August. NYMU kindly held an communication meeting together with other iGEM teams in north Taiwan: TAS, NTHU, NCTU.
We shared our project ideas and give suggestion with each other. To improve commutation experience, we had a “World Café” Workshop focus on environmental protect and youth social responsibility. Team members from different schools presented their personal thoughtful ideas. Moreover, we made a colorful painting together to conclude our discussion results after the workshop.
Unforgettable experience with all the new friends form Taiwan! We not only considered project suggestions and perfected our projects but made friends with each other as well.

What is iGEM?
The iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) competition is the world’s largest competition within synthetic biology, and is hosted by Massachussetts Institute of Technolgy (MIT). The iGEM competition is considered the most prestigious competition for students in the field of biotechnology(1).
The competition started out as a month-long course at MIT, where the students had to design a biological system. This course grew to a summer competition in 2004 with just 5 teams, and since then the competition has expanded dramatically with more than 160 teams from universities all over the world in 2011(1).
The iGEM competition provides a kit with standardized biological parts known as BioBricks, that the teams can use for building the genetic machines. The teams can also submit their own BioBricks. Information about the BioBricks and the toolkit to make and manipulate them is provided by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . Over the summer, the teams work at their universities, where they use the provided parts plus parts of their own design to build biological systems that can operate in living cells(1).
iGEM is about manipulation of genetic material, where the only limit is ones own imagination. The iGEM competition has demonstrated a new way to arouse students interest in modern biology and to develop their independent learning skills.The project ideas are many and diverse, but overall they show great potential.
Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is a relatively new area of biological research that combines science and engineering. Synthetic Biology is about modification of organisms by engineering them to perform new and innovative tasks. An analogy, both conceptual"

Dr. Zhou: Much of the reason for the ""pilot"" area actually lies in the role of government. While protecting the intellectual property rights is to protect the benefits of universities, the cost of subsequent transformation is very high, which is related to the cost of patent and development. Foreign commercial interests are only granted to a company, and the risk of success or failure is shared. In our country, patents have not really transformed.
3. If the improved protein degradation method in our study is introduced, can it play a significant role in diseases such as malignant tumors in the future?
Dr. Zhou: If the improved protein degradation method in the subject is applied, the following problems should be considered:
a) Can protein degradation last functioning?
b) Are there any incidental effects of unknown after degradation?
c) To what extent can the degradation be? How do you control that?
d) Can the degradation cause cell idle?
e) Concerns about sensitivity and specificity
Try to think about the dynamics of the control network and choose a clear application point.
If these problems can be solved, this method will play an important role in the application of diseases such as tumors.
Speeches at Streets & Survey
To make our work responsible and good for the world, people’s attitude is an important factor. We did a survey of people’s cognition of traditional curing methods of tumor, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease and potential methods using PR PREDATOR. In addition to investigating this issue, we worked hard to engage with people by delivering speeches at streets. We inspired people by introducing our project in its future application and raised their awareness of preventing the fatal diseases mentioned above. The results of survey and details about speeches can be seen on our Education Page .
Through the survey and engagement with the public, we had a clear view of people’s attitude towards “target therapy” and the future application of PR PREDATOR. Since many of people involved had a positive attitude to our project, we would continue working on experiment and try to exert a greater influence in maintaining health.

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"lorescence fusion protein’s intensity of emission at around 520-530 nm wavelength under different taxol’s concentration treatments. The shape of experimental group emission curve and blank group emission curve are obviously different. That of experimental groups with different taxol’s concentration (final concentration: 0 μm, 0.5 μm, 5 μm, 25 μm, 50 μm, 100 μm, 250 μm and 500 μm) are basically similar except of the whole translation of wave band. Line graphs are shown here.
According to the picture above we can tell that adding taxol would influence the emission intensity of the fluorescent protein, which induces the shape and position changes of the intensity curve. Then we verified the influence of taxol to the fluorescent protein.
Because the interpreted variable is discrete, we use the Box Plot to describe the intensity of emission of microtubulin under the different concentration of the Taxol. According to the distribution of characteristic bands, we divide CPS value into four bands and use the Box Plot to describe them respectively. The specific four bands are as follows, 520nm-522.5nm, 522.5nm-525nm, 525nm-527.5nm and 527.5-530. And we get the following plot.
From the figure, we can see four boxplots. Each of them stands for a certain concentration of the TAX；the straight line in the box is the median of the data under a certain concentration, standing for the average of the light absorption value OD350 under this concentration. The upper line stands for the upper quartile of the data and the nether line stands for the nether quartile of the data. We can find that data have a big inner undulation under the concentration of TAX greater than 12.5, but when the concentration is between 5 and 12.5, the undulation of the data is tiny. In addition to this, the average of the light absorption value OD350 is high under the TAX’s concentration from 0 to 1 and the TAX’s concentration above 12.5.
2.0 - Theory of the one-way analysis of variance
By constructing the F-test statistics, we can use the one-way analysis of variance to study whether classification of the independent variable’s different levels can make significant influence on the variation of the continuous variable. If the levels have a significant influence, we can further give the 95% confidence interval of the dependent variable means under the different levels of the independent variable, and then we can analyze the degree of the different levels"

P. aeruginosa is a Gram negative bacterium and nisin has little effect unless high concentrations of the bacteriocin are used (i.e. 32 mg/L) (Giacommetti et al., 1996) or it is used in combination with other molecules. It will be necessary to test higher nisin concentrations (more than 25 U) alone or in combination with alginate lyase against P. aeruginosa biofilm to be sure if the biosensor based on L. lactis overexpressing nisin might  be useful to detect and kill the P. aeruginosa or it will be necessary to change nisin by another bacteriocin, for example microcin. We did not find nisin activity against E. coli (data not shown).
Patch Lab
PVA preparation techniques
    As previously mentioned on the methodology section, our patch consists of a multilayer matrix composed of: (i) Poly(vinyl alcohol), which serves as a protection mechanism of the complete system and also allows in/out oxygen transfer. (ii) petrolatum, which is a chemical that prevents the polymer to be directly in contact with the culture medium and also avoids the matrix  to be dissolved. (iii) Nutritive Agar + PVA, the former provides nutrients and medium for the microorganism, while the latter is added as a way to preserve the medium. (iv)Nitrocellulose membrane (0.22 μm) allows the diffusion of bacteriocin and alginate lyase, but avoids the spreading of the bacteria towards the injury.  (v) Autoadherible polymer, which holds the system hermetically. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water-soluble synthetic polymer produced via hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate to remove acetate groups. PVA film is a biomaterial that shows properties like inertness and stability, and it is considered safe and biocompatible in medicine and pharmacy (Muppalaneni and Omidian, 2013). In order to obtain the PVA film with suitable characteristics for our application; two experiments of polymerization were performed. In experiment 1, the polymer was dissolved in water; while in the experiment 2, HCl was used as a catalyst for the reaction of polymerization. In experiment 1 (no addition of HCl), all samples were able to form an elastic film, when drops of water were added the film tended to soften and with"

A screeching bird not far away reminded him of that. It sat on top of the slick, trying to fly away, but the stricky goo on his wings restrained him. Whatever imbalance the oil munchers caused, he was happy that those sights became rarer and rarer. Even though his younger self might’ve thought differently, being part of an oil specialized firemen unit felt like an honor. He liked his job.

For further information on the principle of protein-interaction PACE, please visit our special site (hier Link einfügen). Building up on the equivalent conditions to the random-mutagenesis PACE run, we used the same amount of glucose and arabinose for induction of the mutagenesis plasmids. In this case, we only used a strain with MP4 due to the observation of slightly more mutations in the random mutagenesis experiment. Since this PACE experiment was performed with selection pressure, we estimated for difficulties in the phage propagation during PACE, which is why the flow rate was decreased for enabling better phage propagation. Nevertheless, our plaque assays showed phage washout after only 38 hours. Regardless of these findings, plaque PCRs and sequencings were performed, using plaques from the last available time point. The sequencing results showed one mutation in each of the split sites, of which one mutation could have a functional input on the reassembly of both sites.

GeneVI (2-3) is under control of a that can be activated by the Cas9-rpoZ in context with the respective gRNA. luxAB accounts as a reporter for fluorescent readout of geneIII activation (3-4). The whole plasmid can be produced with different origins of replication (4-5) to modulate the copy number and by exchanging the geneVI part with the RBS.

during the French meetup in Paris in July.We talked and exchanged a lot about our respective projects. They             were linked on some points, therefore they offered to attend a conference organized by themselves. This conference             took place on the 26th of September, in Paris, and was entitled « What synthetic biology will bring to the future’             IGEM Paris Saclay was also part of it. Each of us invited a researcher to talk about his studies all linked with             projects including synthetic biology to face challenges of the future. As we could not travel to Paris to attend             the conference, IGEM Sorbonne broadcasted it via Facebook where we could listen and participate to the debate             which ensued. Thank you IGEM Sorbonne ans IGEM Saclay for giving us this opportunity!
The collaboration with IGEM Toulouse
was aimed to test some lab products. Their project involves the production of cellulose, which we would later             use for our lab experiments. Hence, after producing cellulose in their premises they brought it in Bordeaux.             This exchange was meaningful in a sense that it has permitted them to test their bacterial cellulose production.             In the other side, for us, it was the opportunity to try different source of glucose to produce the HMF molecule.             Once again, we took profit of this meeting to spend good times all together in Bordeaux.
Meetup
Paris:
We were invited to the 4th French meeting organized by the iGEM Pasteur team on July 4, 2018. Four of our team             members (Lorine, Yasmine, François and David) went to Paris to support the project. After a good breakfast offered             by the organizers, we attended the projects presentations of our colleagues from other French IGEM teams. The feedback             from the juries was a great opportunity to improve our presentations for the Giant Jamboree.
Lunch break provide us the ability to meet and discuss with the others iGEM team members. During the workshops in the             afternoon, we have discussed with scientists and exchange about diversified and interesting subjects. We were able to meet researchers in round tables (workshops) organized             in small groups. Various talks themes allowed us to defend ideas with people who have been invited by iGEM team             Pasteur. At night, we met in 'Place des Invalides' to continue to share and exchange about our experiences as iGEMers.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," various cell cultures.
To ensure we would not retain any native Arc functionality that might impact cellular activity in culture, we also designed a “minimal” Arc Gag protein based on homology with other known Gag domains, including HIV-1 and RSV. We used template-based structural predictions to model this minimal Arc Gag and its predicted assembly into higher-order structures. We expected this minimal Arc PNC to perform similarly to the full-length Arc PNC.
Purification Strategies
We have employed several methods of purification. Our purification methods for non-tagged PNCs are based on those found in the literature (Qazi et al., 2016;  Pastuzyn et al., 2018). Other parts use common methods such as arginine and nickel affinity chromatography.
The Arc proteins were initially purified using a sucrose gradient followed by a cesium chloride (CsCl) cushion. Both consist of two different percentages of either sucrose or CsCl, which isolates the protein nanocompartments in a specific region of the “cushion”. The sucrose cushion enables isolation of the “crude fraction” which contains the PNCs at a relatively impure stage. The second cesium chloride cushion further purifies the PNCs, which can then be used for experiments. We have also employed size exclusion chromatography after the use of the sucrose cushion instead of the cesium chloride gradient.
The crude P22 PNCs were isolated and purified in a similar way, except that the sucrose concentration was uniform instead of two separate concentrations. We have no not further purified the protein further but the next step is size exclusion chromatography.
The MS2 PNC includes a removable polyarginine tag on the N-Terminus. Although this was originally designed to enhance cell penetration, it also enables purification (Fuchs and Raines, 2005). Thus, the polyarginine system is also a one-step purification method.
Other parts (including anionic GFP, SP-Cas9, and DecS134C) have hexamer HIstidine tags on the N-terminus, allowing for nickel affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography.
Software Tool
In addition to our molecular wetlab work, we have converted our initial literature search into standardized protein nanocompartment datasheets to help other users choose a PNC that suits their needs. To help make this recommendation, we have designed a software tool to process user input and direct towards a datasheet PDF. The tool requires the sequence of your molecular cargo, the cell type you wish to target, and the approxiamte internal"

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

April 2014
From April 1 to 15: Team formation. We started the formation of our multidisciplinary iGEM team to make possible our project idea of a biotechnological company “Biopharma Technologies”; however, at the beginning, we were a team of only biotechnological and biomedical engineers.
From April 15 to 20: Fundraise
We started to fundraising for our Giant Jamboree trip, through snacks selling in our University and at some Congresses like the Biotechnology Engineering Congress.
At the same time, all the team was working in the company vision and goals.
Date: April 23 Event: Biotechnology Engineering Congress Members: Sofia Arreola, Rodolfo Valdés, Daniel Flores, Lizeth Sánchez
We attended this event organized by our University (ITESM) to speak with other biotechnology engineers about our project idea and to sell some snacks that would help us to fundraise our trip to Boston.
May 2014
May 14: Synthetic Biology’s Seminar. We created a Synthetic Biology's Seminary with our Technical Advisor PhD. María José Rivas to learn about the advances, techniques, definitions, and to choose and evaluate the first Biophrame Project, with which we would be participating on iGEM.
May 14 to May 20: Project ideas Our team met to propose ideas of possible iGEM first products/projects. In this meeting we realized that we needed to search people from other disciplines, such as Finances and Administration, in order to make ""Biophrame Technologies"" an integrative team.
May 22 to May 30: Growing up the team!
We were glad to integrate Carolina Salazar, Itzel Milanés, Sergio Nuñez and Jorge Parra to Biophrame's team, our experts in Finance, Administration, Image and Marketing.
With our new team members and advisors, we chose the ""Non Chemical Chitosan Production Process"" as the first Biopharme's product, because it was short term achievable, financially attractive, ecological, technically simple and over all socially relevant.
We started the division of task in order to develop the technical and financial dimensions of the project; so, at first we had only the financial and technical division divisions.

We wrote a MatLab program to calculate the maximum flow velocities. Codes were shown below:
MatLab Code:
ex_fast=[630,455,610]*90;
% align the data to um/s by multiply 10 and convert to 45μl/min
ex_mid=[180,160,180]*30;
ex_slow=[48,75,80]*10;

ex_mid_mean=mean(ex_mid); ex_mid_std=std(ex_mid);
ex_slow_mean=mean(ex_slow); ex_slow_std=std(ex_slow);
Note: ex_fast_mean is the mean value of maximum flow velocity of fast microfluidics channel when pumped flow rate is 45μl/min, ex_fast_std is its standard deviation, et cetera.

From the Public
We designed a questionnaire and conducted an internet-based survey on antibiotic resistance, antibiotic residues and asked participants’ opinions (especially safety concerns) on our project. In general, the public underestimate the harm of antibiotic residues in environments and industrial products.                         In total, we got 1285 valid responses. Whilst most (58%) participants aged between 18-25 (possibly university students), we also received responses from students under 18 (14%) and those between 26 and 40 years old (27%). In terms of their education background, 16% of participants major in life sciences or medical sciences, while 25% learn other sciences. In addition, over a fifth of them are engineers (22%) while the remainder 16% major in art. So we believe our sample space is sufficiently large and representative (Fig. 1).

This figure presents part of the results of our internet-based survey on antibiotic residues (AR). 1285 valid responses were received in total. (a) Most use antibiotics according doctor’s prescription, but abuse in hospital is also a prominent problem. (b) Many of the participants are aware of AR in nature, especially in surface water, e.g. rivers and lakes. (c) However, quite a lot people know little about AR in food and water. A surprisingly small number of people know the fact that antibiotics are widely found in drinking water, as indicated in the graph. (d) Most people think it is OK to use artificial bacteria in WWTPs or hospitals to degrade AR as long as there is certain mechanism is deployed to make the system safe, which is exactly why we designed a double-function safe lock to prevent HGT and leakage at the same time.
We first asked them how they use antibiotics. While three quarters of them use antibiotics according to doctors’ prescriptions, around 15% of them use antibiotics by their own willingness, with still others never use antibiotics. Antibiotic abuse is one of the major causes for antibiotic resistance, and this has gained much awareness from the general public. In our survey, we found that nearly 60% of all participants know the terminology and the mechanism underlies. To surprise, only 39 people ("

The insertion of the GOI is achieved by digestion and ligation and this classical cloning method can be quite cumbersome. Furthermore, the integration of the gene of interest in the expression vector by restriction enzymes and ligases can have a low efficiency as well as provide a high number of false-positive transformants (6).
Filamentous Fungi
Fungi are a diverse group of organisms, whose biological activities affect our daily life in many ways. The filamentous fungi are in particular of great importance in production of medicine, in the industry, in agriculture, and in basic biological research. Filamentous fungi produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, which are of interest in the pharmaceutical sciences as a prolific source of chemical compounds for the development of new drugs. Some of the filamentous fungal species are pathogenic to humans, whereas others have great value in the production of antibiotics such as penicillin. Fungi are therefore of great importance for the industry as well as for our daily life.
Growth of filamentous fungi
Under the right conditions, the vegetative growth of filamentous fungi starts with the germination of a spore. The spore germination leads to formation of hyphae (7). A fungal hyphae is a long tubular modular structure composed of individual cells (8). Hyphae extend only at their tips and are typically divided into individual cellular compartments by the formation of septa as shown in the figure below (9).
Filamentous fungi grow by the polar extension of hyphae and multiply by branching (10). The branched hyphae form a network of interconnected cells called a mycelium (7). The mycelium forms a radially symmetric colony that expands over a large area until growth is limited by for example lack of nutrients (7,11). The fungal mycelium appears to be a formless collection of corresponding vegetative cells. However, the various cells within the mycelium interact to form an ordered network with different hyphae or cells playing distinct roles in the acquirement of nutrients from the environment (7).
Aspergillus nidulans
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans is a model organism, and in contrast to most other aspergilla it has a well characterized sexual cycle and a well-developed genetic tools for manipulation (9,12). Furthermore, in A. nidulans the parasexual cycle has been extensively utilized. Parasexual genetics involves examination of recombination in the absence of sexual reproduction"

Imperial_College,2018,Team:Imperial College#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"FeCN is just a power supply. Also we are using Robert Bradley's potentiostat, but he needs it... so maybe we should ask for someone to sponsor us a potentiostat. After lunch, Siwat, Alberto and Thomas went to the science museum to do some linguistic surveys... A lot of people do not know the term ""Synthetic Biology"" and almost everyone confused plasmid with plasma.  What about doing something this friday as a team after work...the iGEM social! Options are: pub, dinner or park.  We decided for a custom made quiz day in the park on friday at 5 (the geekiest choice).  We are at Imperial after all... Also the outreach team at Imperial replied and they are on board.
Wednesday
Today we could not get into the lab at 9 because we got told off by the lab technicians... for reasons still unknown. We worked a bit in the lecture theatre. The lawn of cells grew on the agar plate with Pyocyanyn and Ferrocyanide inside. They grew fine. Also we penetrated with eletrodes but did not observe any GFP expression unfortunately. Maybe we still need to wait for it to be expressed.  Josh, Alberto and Luis perfomed the electrode in solution experiment. Below it's a picture of the DIY set-up: hopefully we have some practical engineers in the team ! We measured the oxidation state of Pyo and FeCN using the molecules absorption peaks over time, measuring with the Plate Reader. The results have not been analyse yet, but they look quite random (read stochastic). PCR to check construct 1 still didn't work. I wonder why can't we just sequence it? We'll have to do it anyway, right? Parts for construct 2 have been designed. Also picked TetR and RFP parts from the iGEM Distribution Kit 2018.
Thursday
In the morning, we checked the plate reader results, but no fluorescence was detected. BAD NEWS: DJ1901 IS KAN RESISTANT: problem is that also the construct is Kan resistant.  We did PCR, 6 of the 8 Amp promoters fro Construct 2.  transformation for the biobricks did not work from last night: we did not know if it was from bad competent cells. We therefore performed another Assembly with an Ampicillin resistant backbone. Also we did not see any fluorescence in our agar plate incubated with C1 and redox molecules.  We know that the voltage is the right one, but are we sure the solution is oxidising?

The new age of optics: Producing biological lenses and lasers to improve microscopy
Project Description
Limitations of microscopy
Microscopes have been around for hundreds of years and the technology behind these devices has been quickly developing over the past centuries. Especially fluorescence microscopy was an essential discovery for us biologists, since we are especially interested in what processes occur inside the cell. A popular approach to image intra- and extracellular processes is to use fluorescent tags to track a molecule- or gene of interest in the cell. These fluorescent tags can be imaged under a fluorescence microscope, allowing us to trace molecules and gene expression in a cell.
Fluorescence microscopy is popular technique that has been essential for cellular research over the past decade, and has helped us to find out several important basics of life. Even though most techniques are already very far developed, it is essential that we keep developing microscopy techniques even further. When we can image every process going on in the cell, we are able to use this for our own good. We can, for"

If the user wishes to work with a different MINT description, they can simply import that file here. Also within the Design page of Neptune is the INI file. The INI file contains detailed parameters for the features of the microfluidic chip. This file takes into consideration factors such as design rules, performance, and hardware constraints. It provides the capability for rapid prototyping designs with ease, since through the INI file, a user may edit all features on their chip of the same type at once. For example. If Dr. Ali (from the example above) realizes he made the channels of his chip too small, he can widen all of them all at once by simply editing this parameter in the Design stage instead of manually changing each individual channel with one at a time by hand in a CAD tool. The user can compile his MINT and INI files in the Design stage and move on to the Build and Assemble stages.
In the Build stage of Neptune, the user can select the hardware he or she would like to use for their system. The Build page guides the user through this process based on their design step in order to provide them with the most optimized hardware solution for their needs. When the user is finished, Neptune’s Build page provides them with an ordering list of all of the necessary components they will need to assemble and use their device. Once they have ordered and received these parts, they can proceed to the Assemble stage.
Neptune will guide the user through the process of milling out their chip (using the SVG file outputted from the Design stage), 3-Printing supporting hardware infrastructure (the files for which are dynamically generated and provided to fit the user’s needs based on their current design in this stage), and assembling all of their ordered components to complete their microfluidic system.
After the user has Assembled his or her microfluidic, he or she may control their device from within Neptune in the Control stage. On the control page, the user can connect Neptune to his arduino by opening a serial communication connection. He or she can then open or close valves or set a volume to be dispensed evenly over a given time for dispensers all with the click of a button.

Inducible Bacillus Promoters
Luminescence measurements
The bacitracin-inducible promoter PliaI was evaluated in the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE which contains the lux operon
. The promoter activity leads to gene expression and to the production of the protein luciferase. The luminescence produced by this protein can be measured with the plate reader Synergy2 ( BioTek ) (Fig. 1).

Data is derived from three independent experiments. The graphs show the mean value and the standard deviation. Curves were fitted over each other (t=0, OD600=0.3) and smoothed by taking the average of three neighboring values. t=0 is the time of induction.
All clones show a normal growth behaviour up to a bacitracin concentration of 10 μg/ml. At higher bacitracin concentrations, the growth curves decrease because of cell lyses. The promoter PliaI shows a basal activity of about 10.000 Lumi/OD600. After induction with bacitracin the Lumi/OD600 increases in a concentration depending"

We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ial growth, because the way that tumors grow is remarkably similar to mycelial proliferation: both incorporate substrate adjacent to their borders into their bodies, initially growing incredibly quickly but becoming “crowded out” by their own bodily projections as they grow ever larger.
We had to code a model into Python from the ground up. The first successful model that we devised was for unconstrained, 2-dimensional growth of mycelium. While this was an exciting development, we doubted this model’s utility for our purposes, because in our lab we’d been growing mycelium within molds (which are both constrained and 3-dimensional). So—could we tweak the 2-D model to more accurately reflect the lab’s objectives?
Luckily, the “3-tiered” growth pattern that we’d incorporated into our 2-D model provided the solution. The 3 tiers of the model were “grown”—sites that have grown mycelium—; “growthsites”—sites that will grow mycelium—; and “target”—sites that might grow mycelium. On each day of growth, each “grown” site has the opportunity to stake its claim on a “growthsite”/”target”. It becomes increasingly less likely that a new target site will be found by a grown site as the grown site finds itself more crowded by other grown sites (this accounts for the competition between hyphae in mycelial growth).
We’d found in the lab that 3-D growth generally does not occur in a mold until the mycelium has filled the base of the mold. Therefore, we inserted a provision that “target” sites could be neither “growthsites” nor “grown” sites until the area encompassed by the “grown” sites was equivalent to the base area of the mold. Only then could the mycelium grow upward. How could upward growth be modeled? Once the base of the mold had been filled, the model would change the parameters of the “target” sites: “target” sites could only be “grown” sites. This ensured that the mycelium could only grow on top of itself, and only upward. The competition provision—that a “grown” site could not secure a “target” site if that site had already been claimed as a “growthsite” by another “grown” site—was still intact during this new, upward period of growth. This was the most involved period of coding, and involved five separate attempts before a suitable sixth model was developed.
Results
The model has utility for anyone trying to grow mycelium within a mold. The user will input the size of"

All images were captured using the Webshell on 15.09.15 and are unedited.
Conclusions:
The first objective of the collaboration was to confirm the phenotypes of the bacterial strains and the expression of fluorescent proteins. Due to the technical limitations of OpenScope (see below), RFP could not be visualised. Hence a commercially available microscope was used to confirm RFP expression. In addition, GFP was reliably confirmed using the same microscope. Across the board, expression of the fluorescent proteins was as reported by Glasgow and W&M iGEM teams. This confirms the functionality of the plasmids.
After successful visualisation of fluorescent beads labeled with GFP (Fig. 1), it was expected that OpenScope would enable visualisation of E. coli expressing GFP. However, results indicate that reliable detection was not possible using the standard set-up (single LED illumination, GFP epi-cube). Possible reasons are:
The fluorescent beads used are far brighter than biological samples, and therefore can be visualised with low-brightness LEDs
Bacterial cells are widely dispersed on a microscope slide when prepared from a liquid culture. Fluorescence can only be detected in clustered bacterial cells and colonies, therefore OpenScope cannot resolve individual fluorescent bacterial cells
Replacement of the 100mW LED with the 3W LED allowed visualisation of samples with reduced fluorescence intensity in the case of the p126.1, p126.+p56.1 and p126.1+p80.1 cells. The 100mW LED was sufficient only to image the J23106+I13504 samples. Overall, the results suggest that in order to reliably detect fluorescence the 3W high-power surface-mount LED is more appropriate. However, this is still not sufficiently reliable to make OpenScope useful for fluorescence screening at this stage. In addition, the artefact (image of the LED itself) seen when using the 3W LED means that the uniformity of illumination must be improved.
RFP is more challenging to image, as it has a narrow"

Because it is a cell-free system, transcription is 10 to 100 times slower than in vivo [7], which could be an issue, as the protein may reach steady state at a much lower concentration than we need. However, it should also be noted that because it is cell-free, we do not have to account for dilution of the proteins and we do not have to add protease. Since degradation of proteins is so slow in this environment [23, 24], we can essentially ignore the degradation rates of the proteins. In our code, we set d_LacI and d_CP to 0, but we could just as well have removed r04 and r08 from the ODEs.

Genes 3-5, 4-5 did not show luminescence when we ran on electrophoresis there was no presence of the gene.
The remaining genes (1-3, 2-3, 3-3, 1-5, 2-5) showed low luminescence which proves a small presence gene in the plasmid expression. We will perform a repeat process with genes 3, 5, 6.
LAB Week 4:
Genes 3, 5, 6
An additional attempt to increase the gene by performoing fusion pcr.
The difference between the colony pcr methods is performed by splitting using enzyme reaction before increasing by PCR.
In pcr fusion, at first we perform PCR and only after that we perform splitting, ligation and transformation.
Picture 6:
running on electrophoresis gel to genes 3, 5, 6 after fusion pcr, to test for gene presence.
We can see a weak expression of the genes however a clear luminescence in the 1500bp area. It was performed by 2 repeats of each gene.

To keep things simple, the game was going to have standard “top trumps” style rules, with categories like “pathogenicity” and “antibiotic resistance.” More complicated words would be bolded, with a reference list explaining these words in an educational way. Although the project was not completed, it remains an idea that will be pursued in the future. You can see some of the designs below.
Mycobacterium NBB4
Myca is a soil bacteria that was first found in Sydney, Australia. It’s able to eat ethylene, a gas that causes some fruits to ripen, like apples, bananas and avocados.
Bacillus cereus
This rod-shaped bacterium loves starchy foods like rice, but can cause food poisoning if left to grow for too long. It can make spores that are able to survive cooking temperatures up to boiling point, and toxins which are highly resistant to heat and acid.
Lactobacillus acidophilus
This guy loves to grow in acidic environments, like in dairy foods, and helps to make its home even more acidic by fermenting sugars into lactic acid. It’s used to make some types of yoghurt and is considered a probiotic because of its health benefits.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Although it’s found naturally in our bodies, if this guy is in the wrong place at the wrong time it can cause serious disease. This bacteria is often found to infect burn wounds, where it thrives in the slimy eschar. It is also a serious problem in hospitals, because it can resist a lot of the drugs we try to use against it.
Pseudomonas fluorescens
This bacterium is found in both soil and water and is able to swim with the help of a tail, known as a flagellum. It is also able to fluoresce (glow) due to a pigment it produces called pyoverdin.
Staphylococcus aureus
Golden staph is found happily living on our skin and in our noses. Under the microscope these round bacteria like to cluster into a “bunch of grapes” formation. Unfortunately, as cute as it is, this bacterium can cause serious wound infections and is resistant to many antibiotics.

Collaboration
Lab safety have been brought up as one of the major issues of consideration since the very beginning of our project. However, there're no properly filmed lab safety education video accessible in Chinese. Therefore, we established a collaborating program with Shanghai Technology University and 11 other universities to produce a comprehensive series of Chinese voice-over safety education videos.

MNtallica: Cleaning Up Heavy Metal!
Mercury is a neurotoxic heavy metal with the ability to biomagnify, therefore it is a significant issue in public health and environmental studies worldwide. Its levels are continually on the rise due to copper, nickel, and gold mining activities, the industrial use of mercury catalysts, mercurial fungicides in agriculture, and the burning of fossil fuels. This has resulted in the pollution of many marine ecosystems and water reservoirs worldwide, the cleanup of which using current technology, is either not feasible or incredibly costly. This study describes the use of engineered recombinant bacteria to facilitate the biological remediation of the neurotoxin methylmercury and hazardous mercury ions from an aquatic target site into less toxic form. This synthetic microbe was incorporated in novel encapsulation technology within a cost-effective, scalable water filtering column. The employment of this device could rigorously change the practices used in mercury decontamination efforts as well as pave the way for the switch to biological rather than chemical processes. Furthermore, this technology can be applied towards bioremediation and biosensing of various other heavy metals and organic toxins in the environment.

Policies & Practices
Our Policies & Practices team had a holistic approach to addressing the public health concern of methylmercury contamination as it relates to the implementation of our device. Our team actively attempted to address problems associated with the application of our project and device. From early education and societal perception to small-business design and device implementation, UMN iGEM sought new ways to address our project from varying perspectives to better inform the design and launch of our project. To explore some highlights of our policies and practices team [insert navigation guide"
NCTU_Formosa,2018,Team:NCTU Formosa#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," project designs, we integrated all of them in a small demonstration farm outside our campus, using turmeric plants as test subjects.
     Our farm depends on a regulation system consisting of four parts: pest control, disease control, fertilizer control and irrigation. Click below to learn more about each!
Business Model
Figure1: Global herbal medicine market revenue in 2014-2024
Figure2: Global tumeric market analysis
Health products have seen explosive rise in demand in the past decade.
     Many of these products directly depend on agricultural output, a factor our combined system can amplify greatly. Currently, we are growing turmeric plants on our demonstration farm. Turmeric is used widely as a spice in food, and more importantly can be further processed into curcumin, an antioxidant prized for its anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, we decided that our target audience should be businesses involved in the processing of turmeric into medicines or supplements. We adopted a business to business model, acting as a supplier of turmeric to health product and biotech material companies.
Figure3: Global market of IoT farming
     We plan to contract out the job of producing turmeric to local farmers; we provide our facilities (bio-stimulators, sensors, irrigation systems) and they manage the production end. This business model provides a few key benefits to both us and the farmers. First, barring extreme weather conditions hindering crop production (a potential risk to any farmer), agreeing to a contract with us would provide farmers with a stable profit per harvest regardless of the demand of turmeric in grocery stores and farmers markets. Second, our product is going to big companies with reputation in the industry, providing a better chance at securing long-term income. Finally, business to business models allow for a greater deal of negotiation than conventional business plans, allowing us to secure more benefits for both ourselves and our contracted farmers.
Business Canvas Model
     In our business planning, we put our team as a role of green medical plants producer that meet the criteria of GACP (Good Agricultural and Collection Practice). Our target audiences (TA) will be those biotech companies and health products companies by B2B model. We will approach these TA by business promotion and visiting.  To build the contract farms, our company will cooperate with construction companies and sensor hardware companies. One of the most important activities is that we will first train those farm administers that willing to joining contract farming with our companies. Besides, providing a traceable products cultivation process is also the key activity for us to ensure the quality of products. In this business model, the revenue of our company is from selling"

On Torque and Tumbling in Swimming E. coli
Swimming efficiency of bacterium E. coli. Justification: Average thrust =0.41pN. In the Berg and Brown paper it states that the speed of the bacteria up an aspartate chemotactic gradient increases by 7%. Therefore in our model we shall use the following; thrust DOWN the Asp gradient =0.41pN, up the Asp gradient = 0.4387pN. Data was obtained from 32 AW405s, a strain which has provided the majority of our previous parameters but is not as motile as MG1655. The value was obtained at 23?C in viscosity 0.93 and 3.07 cP for motility buffer and motility buffer with 0.18% methylcellulose, respectively. The standard deviation is not used as the speed is fixed at 50?µm.s-1 . 0.57pN is the average thrust generated in strain HCB30 (a non tumbling strain). The thrust value was obtained when the imposed flow (U) U=0 at 23?C. O.41pN was calculated using the resistance force theory treating the flagellar bundle as a single filament"

Transcriptions factors, chromosome insertion, the 5- UTR, and the reporter gene itself all can play a role in the protein expression.  Although, the promoter region might be the most common and simplest way to modify protein expression in eukaryotes.
Although simple to use, Eukaryotic promoters are fairly complicated.  Their function is to call on a RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.  The ability of a promoter region to call in an RNA polymerase will determine its strength and the relative protein expression.  The are a number of factors involved in this process ,but it varies from promoter to promoter.

Method
As both viral and cytoskeletal promoters are used for prolific expression of genes we selected the following mix of viral and protein promoters: MMV, FiMV, CLCuV, actin, myosin and proflin. In order to characterize the viral and cytoskeletal variable promoters, a standardization of the CaMV 35s promoter was required.  This was accomplished by expressing both GFP and mCherry sequentially under the promotion of CaMV 35s. A testing ratio was then established by assessment of the relative fluorescence of the expressed GFP and mCherry genes. Once this ratio was established, the first 35s promoter was exchanged for one of the various variable promoters. This allowed for the same characterization of promoter strength via relative fluorescence expression.  To prevent downstream expression as a result of carrying over from upstream promoters, two Nos terminators were placed between the GFP gene and the control 35s promoter.
Further Study
Due to limitations resulting from the lack of previous synthetic biology application within plants, we were unable to obtain any results. We have successfully isolated the desired parts needed for assembly of the plasmid and have the backbone with the 35s promoter left border and Nos terminator right border.  Successful construct assembly of these parts is still needed for bacterial and plant transformation. Following promising transformation, fluorescence testing and characterization must be done.

    Human practice is one of iGEM’s most important features that makes the competition very different from the other. This year, Team Tsinghua-A organized a series of activities based on their own understanding of what human practice is. All the activities share some common characteristics.
    Interaction oriented——Team members engage all stakeholders by idea exchange.
    The thought of “all”——We want to create science culture for the whole society to help community members to stay creative and productive. Therefore, our activities include people from all generations.
    Balance between “rigorous” and “interesting”—— the nature of science is rigorous, while we can make it as interesting as possible to make science accessible for ordinary people. How to balance between those two aspects can be a meaningful question to explore.
    Tsinghua-A has been thinking about what their projects can bring to the world before they picked up the first pipette in lab. As one of our initial goal stands, we would like to make science a resource beyond universities and institutes and create science culture for our community. To reach this goal, we put forward our interesting project to the public and are curious to see what effect can be sparked out of the interaction. What can science bring to the public and what science gets in return is an interesting topic that we would like to explore.

Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Parts#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," periplasmic folder. MalE and MalE31 activate the system at different levels. MalE31 has similar trends to MalE but has a higher level of RFP expression. These results prove that MalE and MalE31 can both activate the CpxR system however, MalE31, which misfolds, activates it more rapidly and at a lower level of arabinose concentration compared to MalE. If the line of best fit is studied, it is seen that MalE has very minimal level of Cpx activation. Whereas, malE31 has a linear regression which flattens out as the system reaches its upper threshold of detection. Biologically, this could mean that the MalE31 is activated at levels that saturate the cellular chaperones and cause the system to reach its threshold level of proteolytic and chaperone activities. Another interesting pattern observed is the fact that when MalE is constructed with CpxR-I13507 on the same plasmid (Green), the cell RFP output is much lower compared to cells co-transfected with CpxR-I13507 and I0500-B0034 –MalE. This indicates that insertion of high copy plasmid also induces stress in the periplasmic region of the cell consequently inducing the activation of CpxR system.
Experiment 3: Characterizing the cpxR promoter's response to varying temperatures over different time periods
Protocol:
Top 10 competent cells were transformed with CpxR-I13507 and plated. 5 ml overnight cultures were made from 5 different colonies using LB broth with appropriate antibiotics. Each of these cultures were aliquoted into six different tubes containing 600 µL of culture. These tubes were then placed in hot water baths at 30 C, 37C, 42C, 47C. Measurements were taken every hour for 5 hours after placing the tubes in different temperatures at 555 nm excitation and 632 nm emission.
Figure 3: RFP output produced by the CpxR-I13507 system when the system is heat shocked at different temperature for different lengths of time. The RFP output was measured at 555 nm excitation and 632 nm emission frequencies
Discussion of Results and Conclusion
This graph shows that the CpxR system does respond to temperature activated stress. When the system is placed at 42 C the RFP output is much higher at t=0 compared to the system placed at 37 C or 30 C. This indicates that the system does get activated due to heat shock which matches the literature parameters. At 47"

MICROFLUIDICS
WHY MICROFLUIDICS?
IDEAS FOR MIXING
TESTING LENGTH & WIDTH
What is Microfluidics?
Microfluidics is the flow and mixing of microlitre volumes of fluids via capillary action, where the fluids are contained within wells and channels made of glass and polydimethylsiloxane gel (PDMS). Figure 1 shows how the cured gel creates an enclosure between itself and the glass slide beneath. Essentially, this forms what you call a “lab-on-a-chip” device.
Figure 1. Lab-on-a-chip.
Identifying Requirements
The implementation of our engineered biological system into a device required to meet the following criteria: Solutions have to mixed in the right order and the correct times and incubated for specified durations to allow any reaction to take place. We looked into microfluidics as a solution that could potentially meet these requirements. We also identified that an external pneumatic pump should not be used to drive flow in the chip as doctors would not have access to such a pump when using the chip in an ordinary clinical setting.
Figure 2. Photo of a microfluidics chip showing 3 channels.
A schematic diagram of the potential chip is shown in figure 3. The chip would require two inlets: one where the blood sample is deposited (Start chamber) and one where the stock solution is deposited (Middle chamber). The stock solution contains the siderophore-iron complexes that lipocalin in the blood sample would bind to. The two solutions would mix completely in the main channel before entering the end chamber where the bacteria will be contained. Once the mixed solution flows into the end chamber, it can stay there indefinitely until the bacteria takes up the siderophore-iron complexes and produces fluorescent proteins. As an extension of this project, an albumin chelator could be added just before the middle chamber in order to chelate albumin before it could come into contact with the siderophore-iron complexes.
Figure 3. Schematic diagram of a potential microfluidics chip for detecting lipocalin.
Why Microfluidics?
Not only did microfluidics enable our device requirements to be met, but also offered several additional advantages such as:
Ease of use: in order for the reactions to be carried out at the right times, one need only add the blood sample onto the chip in order for it to work.
Low cost: a single chip only costs a few cents"

Sabrina Krenn - The organizer
Sabrina is our organizational talent who always manages to keep a level head. Through excelling in getting everything/everyone together she figuratively became our humanized Multi-SpyCatcher! However, she also finds time to put some great effort into our wiki page. In addition to her organizational tasks she takes on some voluntary work in higher educational politics as well as clubs. Sabrina was born and raised in Augsburg, Germany and came to the FAU in 2011. At the present, she is finishing her Master's program in Cell and Molecular Biology.
Adrian Rieck - The allrounder
Adrian plays a major part in many fields: finding sponsors, research, lab work – simply everything! During all these things he stays in a positive mood and keeps his controlled chaos in check, even though sometimes this postive mood swings into desperation – which seems to be the norm for lab work. In his free time he often visits Ireland and the open ocean, even if only mentally. Adrian was born in Erlangen and raised in Kempten and came to the FAU in 2010. Right now he does his masters program in Cell and Molecular Biology.
Vladyslav Vyshnevskyi - The quiet one
Vlady isn't very noticeable, but he is always present. During lab work he remains calm and never loses his deep concentration or his share of pessimism. Since he enjoys correcting other people's mistakes, he gets the task of improving our occasionally subpar English writing. He contributes to our interdisciplinary team, having acquired his B.Sc. in Integrated Life Sciences and currently attending the masters program in Cell and Molecular Biology.

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the forward forward reaction by different mechanisms. No matter which theory we use to explain the phenomena, we emphasize that the two binding processes of one lox site are not identical. The first binding process contributes to the second one. Therefore, either the steady-state treatment of the first binding and dissociation or the kinetic proofreading by a modification is reasonable.
3.3 The time-sharing process module reduces crosstalk and resource cost
The greatest hallmark of our processing module is that it can enhance the utilization of resources. The processing module we designed in essence is a time-sharing system. In computer science, the time-sharing system can share computing resources among many users. The users in biology are the various environments. The time-sharing processing module allows the engineered cells to interact with multiple environments. With this module, cells can achieve different functions at different times.
We can make some comparisons between the time-sharing system and a simultaneous processing system. The latter wastes many resources to maintain or inhibit the unnecessary functions when the cell are running other functions, if these functions don’t need to run at the same time. Such a burden to cells may even cause growth defects since competition of resources can affect normal pathway in cells. Moreover, the more regulators we put into the cell, the more likely crosstalk will occur, which will result in a faulty response to the signals.
4. Simulation and Sensitivity Analysis
After describing the biological processes, we wanted to characterize our designed processing modules by simulation. Before the simulation, we integrated some information about non-induced promoter strength we got from the wet lab. We found that some promoter properties did influence the cell's state directly. To take the intrinsic noise into consideration, we simulated the stochastic time course trajectories of the state of a chemical reaction network using Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie, 1977). We analyzed our two designs respectively. Before the wiki freeze deadline, we got some qualitative and quantitative results of design 2, which verified the validity of our models
4.1 Parameters
The parameters we used in our model of the two designs were mainly from two resources. Parameters in the processing module of design 1 were from the repressilator model in BioModels Database . And parameters used in design 2 came from parameter page collected by ETH Zurich iGEM 2013 . And we adjusted some parameters by more reasonable consideration and some promoter tests. We adjusted the protein half life from 10min to 40min and adjusted the relative strength among the promoters we used according to our experimental results (Fig. 3).

2. TetA Improvements
Usage and Biology
The tetracyclines (Tcs) is a group of antibiotics that have been widely used since the 1940s against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to Tcs has many mechanisms including the active efflux system of tetracycline, target gene mutations, enzymatic degradation of antibiotics, decreased drug permeability and so on. The tetracycline efflux pumps are encoded by several genes, including tetA, tetC, tetE, tetG, and tetH, which have been reported a major mechanism of Tcs resistance.
Design
Here we improved tetA (BBa_J31006) by codon optimizing for Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, which could result in Tcs resistance by encoding membrane-associated proteins that pump Tcs out of the cell, reducing intracellular drug concentrations and protecting intracellular ribosomes.
Here we entrust Genescript to help us do the optimization. In this case, the native gene employs tandem rare codons that can reduce the efficiency of translation or even disengage the translational machinery. We changed the codon usage bias in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 by upgrading the CAI from 0.69 to 0.92. (Fig. 2) GC content and unfavorable peaks have been optimized to prolong the half-life of the mRNA. (Fig. 3) The Stem-Loop structures, which impact ribosomal binding and stability of mRNA, were broken. In addition, our optimization process has screened and successfully modified several negative cis-acting sites.

By researching GMM legislations and comparing those legislations between countries, we aimed to understand the depth and diversity of laws, and also the impressions of GMOs in each country and area.  We compared the following 6 contents of GMM legislations.
What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?  The institutional bodies that enforce the laws regarding the use of GMMs differ a lot across the world. In many countries in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually the large organizations are in charge. On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialized committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.  In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology, but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.
Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?  We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organisation, which usually also acts as an information center in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.  The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. Competent authorities in the European Union and The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety in Indonesia have similar roles.  Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centres might be present to help the ministries make decisions, nonetheless.
What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?  The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production.

As first attempts go, we consider our Simcha Lab a success. See our blog Camp Simcha Laboratory to learn about many of our exciting activities. Whether the campers were figuring out that they could use a plasma globe together with current-conducting play-dough and LEDs to create a mesmerizing circuit of flashing lights, or going bird-watching, bird whistles in hand, all the great moments amounted to an exciting first run for the Science Laboratory. We also passed the biggest test of success: The camp invited us back for the second session! Unfortunately the NYC iGEMers needed to return to the Cornell lab, but Shlomo stayed on, and is being assisted by two great staff volunteers. Going in we knew there would be an avalanche of interest in science. Thankfully, we had a great group running the workshop and dozen of projects, product of much scheming back home.
So much scientific research is being done to discover new therapies for children and adults suffering from disease. We were glad to be able to use laboratory science itself as a therapy for these children and young adults. We were so pleased that the campers really seized the opportunity to think scientifically and have a great deal of much-needed fun.
In future sessions of the Science Lab, we plan to increase the number of projects on hand, because, unfortunately, for the trial-run our supply far outstripped the demand. All the projects deserved more thorough explanations for all demonstrations and activities. Kids choosing projects before camp begins would enable us to individualize each campers experience. Together, improvements like these assure our workshop accelerates in excitement from the great trial-run. Because of the campers’ burgeoning interest, the Science Lab will ultimately become a smash-hit for the ages.

DNA and proteins are very small and cannot be seen by the naked eye. To control the success and the results of the upstream and downstream processes, analytical methods are necessary that give reliable results to make DNA or proteins in any way visible for you. The analytical methods we used in our project can be found in this section.
Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
This analytical method can be used for separation and identification of proteins according to their electrophoretic mobility. The mobility is a function of length of"
INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Supports_-_-_TEXT.html," multidisciplinary (microbiology, biocatalysis, bioprocesses, separation techniques…); it works on uniting Systems Biology, Processes and Engineering, and has a triple engagement centred around Research, Training, and Transfer and Exploitation. With the ambitious aim of federating competence “from gene to process” while combining scientific excellence with economic and social pertinence, LISBP is crossing divisions, applying a multi scale strategy, and building networks in the local and international environment.

MetaToul is the Metabolomics and Fluxomics Platform of Genotoul, an organization that coordinates all life sciences research platforms in the Région Midi-Pyrénées. It brings together expertise and means (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS)) in the field of global analysis of metabolism. MetaToul provides to the scientific community the concepts, tools and methods related to these kind of analysis at the level of a biological system (cell, tissue, organism).
Toulouse White Biotechnology
Toulouse White Biotechnology (TWB) is a preindustrial demonstrator whose goal is to speed up the development of industrial biotechnology by facilitating exchanges between public research and industry. It contributes to the expansion of a bioeconomy based on the use of renewable carbon in the fields of chemistry, materials and energy.
By creating its partnership foundation in 2009, with the support of France's largest companies, INSA Lyon demonstrates the quality of relations it has developed over the years with its economic partners, and positions itself clearly in a strategy of corporate cooperation. From 2010, the INSA Lyon foundation and one of his main economic partners, the Biomerieux compagny, allows us to give life to our projects and to place us among the best competitors on the international scene of synthetic biology. So it is together again with theses unshakeable partners that we hope to reach the top of the podium in 2017.
Sunwaterlife is a French start-up located in Toulouse, designer of an innovative water purification system. From a contaminated or salted water source, its sun power supplied system can produce up to 3000 liters of drinking water per day. With the size of a suitcase, it is an eco-friendly self-sustained solution, able to provide drinking water for schools, clinics, villages or in case of sanitary emergency in developing countries.

Northwestern,2014,Team:Northwestern#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," PCR practice on old dNTPs. David and Tiffany lysed the E. coli and Sharon measured the biomass of strep throughout the day. Lastly, Adam and Sharon researched on GC-rich RFP that would be compatible with strep.
7/25 Abdullah and Mitch continued working with Pseudomonas by lysing them. David and Tiffany continued working with E. coli along with Kristi to perform a Bradford assay with the lysed cells. David and Tiffany also aliquoted the new E. coli lysates whereas Sharon aliquoted the old E. coli lysates. Adam, meanwhile, finalized the track selection and worked with Kristi to make LB plates without Amp for the environmental strains. David and Kristi did the PCR test digest and David was also involved with Sharon with cell free protein synthesis. At the end of the day, we all worked on making a powerpoint for the meeting on Monday with the professors.
Week 8
7/28 We obtained new environmental strains from the Lakefill in the morning to grow in a LB media throughout the day. David and Tiffany reran the test PCR with diluted DNA to check the quality of our dNTPs and Taq polymerases. After running gel electrophoresis, we gathered clearer bands than the first run through. Adam transformed and plated the backbone plasmid for our g-block into e.coli DH5a cells. We then made LB/agar and LB/agar/cam plates to plate our environmental sample and plasmid backbone, respectively. In our meeting with the professors, we were advised on how to better our results for cell-free protein synthesis.
7/29 Mitch and Sharon early in the day harvested strep while Adam and David made NE buffer. Abdullah and David made environmental plates with water from the thermo-insulated pond whereas Sharon and Kristi made strep lysates. Abdullah and Tiffany measured the pH of N Europea and David along with Sharon PCR’ed the g-block. Joe stopped by to talk about codon optimization with Abdullah, Sharon, and Tiffany.
7/30 Abdullah and David cut the PCR g-block, ran a gel and extracted it which failed. Adam grew backbone from colony in a tube and miniprepped. Mitch and Tiffany cut the backbone, split 2 aliquots, dephosphorylated, ran gel and extracted it. Kristi and Sharon ligated g-block into backbone and transformed into DH5 alpha while also carrying out cell free protein synthesis in strep.
7/31 With not much wet lab work to do, we cleaned up the lab and restocked whatever was needed. We made ISP"
