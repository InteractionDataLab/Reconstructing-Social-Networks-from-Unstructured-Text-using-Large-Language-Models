Today we measured GFP for the Measurement Interlab Study.
Cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended in ten folds the culture volume with a phosphate buffered saline (58 mM Na2HPO4, 17 mM NaH2PO4, 68 mM NaCl), as performed by Scholz et al., 2000. Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 were purchased from Panreac. NaCl was purchased from Fisher Bioreagents.
A GloMax-Multi Detection System form Promega fluorometer configured with the Blue optical kit (&Lamda;ex=490 nm, &Lamda;em=510-575 nm) was used to measure fluorescence. For measuring fluorescence 250 Î¼l of each sample were placed in a black 96-well plate. Each sample was measured three times and an average was displayed on the screen.
A Biowave CO 8000 from Biochrom spectophotometer was used to measure absorbance at 600 nm. For measuring absorbance 700 Î¼l were placed in a cubet and measured one by one in the spectrophotometer.

1. Certification of the CbtA toxicity towards bacteria, which stagnates the growth of bacteria.
2. Demonstration of CbeA growth-promoting effects towards bacteria.
3. Certification bacterial normal growth on condition that CbtA-CbeA co-existence.
4. Verification of CbtA reversible toxicity blocked by CbeA.
Introduction
Geneguard system is the most important system in our project ( What is Genegraud system? ). For the verification of the system, we designed the characterization construct shown in Figure 1, and we named it as pET23a-TA.
Figure 1. Characterized construction of TA.
We used the lactose operon in pET28a so that the expression of CbeA (antitoxin) can be induced by IPTG. What is more, after referring to the structure of BBa_I0500 , we added AraC and pBAD, so that we could also induce the expression of CbtA (toxin) by L-arabinose. So the construct can be simplified into Figure 2. We can know from the structure that the addition of Laracinose and IPTG can enhance the expression of CbtA and CbeA, respectively.
Figure 2. Simplified characterized construction. Addition of L-arabinose and IPTG can enhance the expression of CbtA and CbeA, respectively.
Experimental Design
The plasmid pET28a-TA and the vector pET28a were transformed into BL21(DE3)-pLysS. After digestion and sequencing. Two groups of bacteria with the two plasmids transformed were named TA group and Vector group, respectively. Three experiments were designed to verify the function.
plate streaking and monoclone growth observation
According to others' work [1], we selected the appropriate concentrations for inducers and did the pre-experiments to confirm them. Medium with different types of inducers were made and we observed the growth of the bacteria in them.This experiment was carried out by BIT-China ( read more )

Project Overview
We try to develop new medicine for therapy of leukemia which is more free from side effects.
For this study, we are going to use Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism to establish transgenic fly carrying responsible genes for human leukemia.
Introduction
Drosophila melanogaster has been used for a genetic study as model organism for a long time and brought us much discovery. And we are sure  that the benefit continues from now on.
Therefore we KIT-Kyoto team aim at the production of the disease model Drosophila which expresses the responsible gene of MALT lymphoma that is one of leukemia that we were not able to achieve in a meeting of the last year. It is thought that we can contribute to elucidation of the mechanism of this disease and the development of the therapeutic drug by promoting this project.
In addition, we think about what we can do in order to continue researches using Drosophila melanogaster in the world. The structure and behavior of the gene cluster are often found by pushing forward the study about genes systematically and cooperatively.
So, this year we aim at the design of the parts with which a study that we use the Drosophila can expand in iGEM in future.
If these projects are realized, the study using D. melanogaster will step forward to the new one step again.
Results
BBa_K758006(UAS-EGFP)
We transfected this plasmid to Drosophila culture cells under two different conditions. We also transfected pAct5C-GAL4 plasmids which express GAL4 proteins in a culture cell line but not in other cell line.
If the BBa_K758006 was assembled accurately, this plasmid expresses enough EGFP by activation of GAL4 protein. So the cell line that were co-transfected with pAct5C-GAL4 shows strong fluorescence, than the one without co-transfection with pAct5C-GAL4.
Then we conducted experiment mentioned above. We made two groups of Drosophila culture cells. One group had been transfected with BBa_K758006 and pAct5C-GAL4, and the other one had been transfected with BB"

Timeline
Week 6/19-6/24  Create the various constructs using the parts we have finally made plasmid preps of using GFP.  Once we can prove that the construct in fact worked we will test them using the RFP, EYFP, and BFP.  This way we will know how to order the various fluorescent proteins using various promoters and RBS.
Week 6/27-7/1 Figure out how to use invertases and figure out how to incorporate them into our various constructs.  Trouble shoot any problems we run in to and fix them.  Then we can try to flip the gene with the invertase and see if it actually works.
Week 7/4-7/15 Start to organize all the parts in the order in which the comp team has chosen to build them.  It will be our task to figure out how the part will work together and what we will need in order to allow the process we want it to do to happen.
Week 7/15-8/1 Finish up the desired construct and possibly explore other forms using the TB gene.

Unfortunately, as I had not used the Qiacube I ended up throwing out the gel extractions of these parts.  Therefore, the parts had to be redone.  However, from the gel we observed that the EYFP and ECFP were in fact cut in the restriction digest.  Unfortunately,  it did not seem like our GFP plus terminator worked.   We could have better adjusted if we had negative controls with the uncut parts.  The next morning we transformed:

Week 1: May 1 - May 3
This week we attended the appropriate safety courses required by our University to work in the lab. Besides that, the undergraduate supervisors presented about the principles of Genetics and Synthetic Biology to the new team members.
Week 2: May 6 - May 10
This week we participated in a general molecular biology workshop to refresh our memory of techniques used in molecular biology.
Week 3: May 13 - May 17
We continued the molecular biology workshop. This week we also divided up into our respective groups for the project and decided research priorities.
Week 4: May 20 - May 24
This week we started to perform literature searches for our element of the project. Our goal is to find a way to link the transcription activator-like effector (TALE) and ferritin elements of the project. We have decided that using a two part system is optimal as this would allow the ferritin subunits to self-assemble without having a TALE protein attached that could potentially interfere with this process. In order to accomplish this we have decided to use coiled-coils. The synthetic IAAL E3 and IAAL K3 coils (Litowski and Hodges, 2002) have been selected to accomplish this. These coils make use of hydrophobic regions composed of leucine and isoleucine to bind to each other (Figure 1). The specificity of these coils is conveyed by the presence of glutamic acid and lysine residue that limit the binding to the formation of coil heterodimers.

1.1 Preparation of electrodes. We use carbon felt as the material of the electrodes which are cut to 2.5 cm X 2.5 cm dimension for anode and 2.5 cm X 3 cm (width X length) dimension for cathode. Steep the electrodes with acetone and 1 M hydrochloric acid for 24 hours and 12 hours respectively. After this step, electrodes are fastened to the copper wire with glue. The proton exchange membrane are steeped with 1 M hydrochloric acid overnight. 1.2 Assemble the chambers. Seal the assembled electrodes to the cover of the cell. Fix anode and cathode chambers together with clips and screw down the covers with electrodes. ATTENTION: DO NOT ASSEMBLE THE PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE OR THEY WOULD MELT UNDER HIGH TEMPRATURE. 1.3 Sterilization. Autoclave to sterilize the devices and internal components at 121 ℃ for 20 min.

Our project
Paving the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic tools
Our aim is to develop a diagnostic technique based on an artificial, randomly selected and modified peptide. This peptide is capable of detecting the presence of fungal pathogens in a sample collected from a patient. Briefly, our approach is as follows. Through a yeast two-hybrid assay (screening method for protein-peptide interactions) we will select for peptides that show affinity towards surface proteins from different fungi (e.g. Aspergillus nidulans, A. fumigatus, Candida albicans or C. glabrata). After confirming the interaction between the surface proteins and a given peptide, we intend to attach a molecule to the peptide marker. In our project, this molecule will be a fluorescent protein, but in principle it can also be an immune system activator which is then recognized by the immune cells (macrophages) or a chemical moiety that adds novel functionalities or increases the peptide stability.
Why peptides?
In comparison to antibodies or antibody fragments, synthetic peptides are small (10 to 20 times smaller than an antibody), easily synthesized, modified less expensively and show higher diffusion rates in tissues. We expect that a diagnostic method based on small peptides is more accurate and cheaper than other existing methods and also has the potential for in vivo diagnosis. This could extend the list of existing methods. Furthermore, the adaptability of our approach allows other laboratories to follow it to generate and refine their own peptides with specificity towards their proteins of interest, instead of ordering antibodies. The possibilities of our project are illustrated in figure 1. A large antibody is unable to bind to a protein which is localized in the cell wall (Figure 1A), because of steric hindrance. By contrast, our “PepTag” has, compared"
KULeuven,2008,Team:KULeuven_-_-_TEXT.html,"The most important assets of our project are the different control mechanisms. Since these are very much dependent on kinetic and other constants, Dr. Coli heavily relies on proper modeling . Our Dry-Lab team has spent its summer setting up a computational model of Dr. Coli to completely simulate his actions. We constructed models of all the subsystems (components) in both CellDesigner and Matlab. All these subsystems have been characterised by their ODE's and have been simulated thoroughly. Together they form our full model of Dr. Coli. These models are only capable of simulating the behaviour of one Dr. Coli cell, so we implemented our own Software Tool that can work with multi cellular models .
After building the model frame, it was time to add the physical relevance to it. Kinetic constants were searched for and investigated by means of previous iGEM teams (e.g. ETHZ 2007 ), the parts characterizations on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and popular biological literature databases such as Hubmed , ... Our own contribution would revolve around data analysis of the produced parts.
Working with concepts as modularity and abstraction, we worked out every subsystem (Output, Memory, Filter, ...) to eventually merge them all in our full model . By trial and error the system was adapted to achieve desired output quantities (amount of molecules, proteins, ...) given a representative input.
To take it a step further, a multi-cell model was build, to analyse crucial steps in cell division (e.g. Memory inheritance). A diffusion model was made to investigate HSL diffusion towards neighbouring cells and see what effects this generated on their Invertimer system.

Fig. 1: Circuit for Decoder.
The presence of blue or red light leads to the activation of LovTAP and to the deactivation of Cph8, respectively. As a result the expression of lacI and tetR being controlled by the tryptophan repressor promoter and the red light promoter is terminated.
The intermediate NOR gate represented by PL TetO/LacO is only active in the absence of TetR and LacI and controls pabAB, the formation of the violet pigment and cI. cI ensures that the other ouputs are repressed.
For the two cases where only one light-input is present merely one hybrid promoter is not repressed leading to the formation of the red or green pigment.
Hybrid promoters
Fig. 2: Conserved regions of PR and PL.
In our case we want the decoder ( construct 1 construct 2 )  to have NOR logics. Therefore we designed 3 different hybrid promoters (all in all 4 variants), all of them derived from the λ-phage promoters PR and PL [Cox2007]: <partinfo>BBa_K909011</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K909012</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K909013</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K909016</partinfo>.

Workshop for the Finnish International Biology Olympiad team
The International Biology Olympiad (IBO) is a competition organized for talented upper secondary students who are interested in biology. The team is selected based on a national exam that any upper secondary student can participate in. The next event is held in Iran, in 2018, and the team training began in early August, 2017. After the team had gained some laboratory experience in Aalto University laboratories, we gave them two presentations: a presentation about our project and another about Mathematical Modelling in Biology. The topics that we covered were history of computational biology, logic ports in the context of biological systems, ordinary differential equations and a case study of dynamically modelling differentiation of T-cells. We hope that our presentations were interesting and useful to the team and wish them the best luck in the Olympiad! Our presentation slides can be found from here.
Turku
Our last visit before the Giant Jamboree was at the University of Turku where we had organized an event 19.10.2017 with Eva-Mari Aro, Pauli Kallio and Eevi Rintamäki. We presented synthetic biology, iGEM and our own project as a lecture, where the main point was to get the students and teachers enthusiastic enough to form Turku’s own team in the future, since currently we are the only team in Finland. The event was promoted to bio students by Pauli Kallio and one of our sponsors, The Union of Professionals in Natural, Environmental and Forestry Sciences Loimu. We provided a flyer to help promoting. Since Turku city actually has two universities, there might also be a possibility that University of Turku might form a team with Åbo Academi. Only time will tell.
We discussed with a few very interested teachers and some of the students seemed also pretty intrigued by the idea, so hopefully this attempt will prove successful in the future. We shares some of the Biotechweek balloons, collaboration postcards and patches in the"

DNA Fingerprinting with ASIJ Summer Passport Program
June 21st, 2018:
During the ASIJ Summer Passport program, iGEM students helped to educate middle school students taking a forensic science course about utilizing fingerprints for crime investigation. We talked about the use of gel electrophoresis and explained the function of restriction enzymes and electricity for the experiment. Finally, we let everyone in the group use the scientific procedure to discover their unique fingerprints.
Talk with Dr. Kagimoto
June 4th, 2018
The iGEM team met with Dr. Hardy Kagimoto, founder of the Japanese biotech company Healios. During our meeting with him, we learned about the possible future implications of iPS cell technology and the development of this new industry in the context of Japanese regulations. We were inspired by his work and wanted to know how we could also contribute to this field of research. The talk with him was our initial inspiration for starting this project.
GOA Online Presentation
September 17, 2018
iGEM students talked to Medical Problem Solving I students on Global Online Academy (GOA) about future treatments with immunotherapy, gene therapy, and cell therapy with iPS stem cells. GOA is a collection of online courses that are in schools in over 24 countries, allowing us to reach a broad and multinational group of students. In our presentation, we implemented a case study with A1AD Deficiency to showcase our use of CRISPR editing in our iGEM project and future use of organ buds.

Results of the directed AID mutation
We received the fused plasmid (TAL-AID) (also submitted as BioBrick to the registry: BBa_K747102 ) from iGEM Team Freiburg. This plasmid will be co-transfected with our antibody constructs to check whether it is functional.
This experiment is an important step towards directing the mutating agent AID into our antibody construct instead of causing mutations to the whole cell genome.

Survey
We helped the TU Munich to improve, optimize and standardize the Parts Registry BioBrick section by filling out their questionnaire. We agree that the Parts should be submitted in a similar manner and we suggested that it would be better if the BioBrick could be uploaded in a vector with a nice table with short summary on the side. We also think the Registry could improve the submission of BioBrick by allowing sequence upload in a genbank format.

The new PCR product we ran today was run on a gel an strong bands were seen where we expected to see them. This helps to confirm our Gibson was successful and we hope to send in these DNA 2.0 chromoproteins with the flag lumio his-tag for sequencing tomorrow

The gel from the re done PCR shows the strong band at the correct number of base pairs helping to strengthen the thought that our Gibson was successful on these chromoproteins
●
We started looking at how pH changes affected our chromoproteins. We performed a serial dilution to obtain a pH range from 1 to 14 at each integer value. We then pipetted some of our purified AE-blue+CBD+tag onto a well plate lid and mixed with each of the pH solutions in different wells. The pH of 1 and pH of 14 changed the blue chromoprotein to a clear/yellowish tint but the other chromoproteins did not change color they faded a bit because of the added water diluting them. We think because we did not see any color change other than at pH of 1 and 14 that the serial dilution was maybe not correct and we will look into that tomorrow. One interesting thing to note is that when the chromoprotein is mixed pH 1 HCl it loses its color but when pH 14 NaOH is added it regains its color. This could be an interesting observation to explore in the future.
Before pH testing
Here is a picture of the chromoproteins before we added acid or base to them. The number in each well indicate the value of pH we are adding to each well
After pH Testing
This pictures shows what happened after we added the pH indicated in each circle to the chromoprotein. We plated 20 ul of each chromoprotein and added 10 ul of the pH solution. At the pH of 1 and 14 changes were seen but not at the other pH's this makes us think our serial dilution was"

Help Tianjin with the Modeling
From July 24 to 26, team member from the Tianjin visited us in Beijing. During the three-day stay here, we discussed about our ideas, our projects and team and team management.
Then we helped Tianjin-IGEM in their programming. In their modelling, they want to make the model visible by stimulating their processes using Matlab. So we help them abstract calculation process from real reactions.
The basic method is Monte Carlo.
Participate in CCIC
During Aug 14th-15th, our team participated in CCIC(Conference of China iGEMer Committee) in PKU. We gave ‘peer’ review to other iGEM team and gained feedback from others. We enjoyed the process reaching out to other teams, asking for advice and talking about ideas. In the CCIC, the young, ambitious and creative synthetic biologist got together and had fun with each other.
Try out Team Tsinghua's Prototype
This is our feedback after trying out their product
Tsinghua Team has made a very interesting device. It looks a mysterious, with two boxes, a 96-well plate and many wires. And it needs a computer when it works. After a short introduction I learned how to use it. Their software has a funny flash at the beginning and a friendly interface. There are two main functions their system can achieve.
The first function of their device is very imaginative – their device can store information in bacteria. I can choose a small-sized file and then the program will encode the information into the bacteria in the 96-well plate. Since this process would take a relatively long time, I just loaded the file but didn’t wait for the cells to grow up.
The second function allowed me to encode the information by myself. I can choose the time and the color of the light and change these parameters at different time. And for every well it can receive a different pattern of light input. Then, the 96-well plate will receive a set of light input, which may transfer the information to the bacteria. Besides, I think this light change can be used as a light inducer which may activate gene expression or change the state of a photosensitive protein. That is, we can conduct many different experiments in one 96-well plate. So, their device can be a useful tool not only in information encoding but also in many other fields, like synthetic biology or optogenetics"
METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Second step for building the standardized template was to get the     phylogenic information about the parts development process which includes     the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.
Additionally, the “group favorite” and “starRating” fields are also     important for individual evaluation of the parts, which doesn’t get     the deserved attention from the iGEM groups. “Group Favorite” defines     the confidence on the part by the designer group. “StarRating” defines     the related part in terms of popularity and usage efficiency among the     groups. According to our observations, most groups are not aware of     either of the fields or they are used incorrectly or ineffectively.     For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and expected results the StarRating should be at least     2 stars, but for most of the parts in 2010 distribution, it is very     difficult to observe a part whose “StarRating” is above one. For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”
Second step for building the standardized template was to get the     phylogenic information about the parts development process which includes     the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.

    Considering this design principle, we designed the gene circuit of warrior I and warrior II as follows.(Fig.2)
Fig.2 Improved gene circuit
    By combining the experimental data(See details at Orthogonality test ), we can find C4HSL can specifically bind to RhlR and then the complex binds to Prhl so that TetR can be expressed. Then TetR can bind to Plux/tet and inhibit the expression of LacI. By this circuit, we can see that even though C4HSL-RhlR can stimulate the expression of LacI by binding to Plux/tet directly, its stimulation of TetR at the same time can counteract this effect and so warrior I won’t response to C4HSL secreted by himself.
III Evaluation of orthogonality by model
1.Definition of gene circuit's orthogonality
    Like in the Orthogonality test of experiment part, gene circuit of two warriors is orthogonal when the AHL molecules secreted by warrior I can just activate the promoter inside warrior II, but cannot activate the promoter inside itself and vice versa.
2. Evaluation of gene circuit’s orthogonality in our model
    Here we use RFP intensity for simplicity (More details why we detect RFP intensity but not OD600 directly in the model can be seen at Fluid Model ) to indicate the level of LacI inside cell and thus its intensity inside each bacteria can be used as a relative measurement of the killing effect of warriors.
    Therefore, we can know the orthogonality in real time by measuring the change of warrior I’s RFP intensity with time with or without warrior II. (According to the experiment results,warrior II can just respond to C4HSL , so it is in accord with the orthogonality requirement and we do not consider the response of warrior II)
IV ODE, parameters and its resource
Note: This is part of fluid model to help us solve this specific problem. There are also small changes in part 6 to adapt to our experiment results. Detailed explanation can be seen at Fluid Model. Subscript 1 indicate warrior I, subscript 2 indicate warrior II. AHL1 is C4HSL and AHL2 is 3OC6HSL.

2. AHL1(Produced by warrior I) molecule concentration inside cell (molecule/cell)
3. AHL2(Produced by warrior II) molecule concentration inside cell (molecule/cell)

Duke,2017,Team:Duke#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to create more thermostable Griffithsin protein.
ZDOCK is a docking package from the University of Massachusetts that predicts the interactions between different proteins and small molecules. The ZDOCK algorithm predicts the top 2000 positions where the ligand or small molecule should bind noncovalently to the protein of interest. These predictions are ranked by other algorithms RDOCK and CHARMM by their energetics and structural stability. The output of this model gives the PDB or protein data bank files of the top 10 predictions. For the purposes of this project, the thermostable monomer and dimer predicted by Yasara were docked with gp120, the envelope glycoprotein on HIV. The top three structures were then docked with different Zika and HIV antibodies to predict the interactions and structure of immobilization in the lateral flow assay. The comparison of how the griffithsin and its thermostable variant bind to the antibodies and envelope proteins will suggest if the mutated residues impacted biological activity of the GRFT.
Lastly, PyMOL, a common protein visualization system,  perform basic molecular dynamic simulations and image the docking interactions. For the purposes of this project, PyMOL was adopted to make movies of the protein structure and color the molecule to make understandable models for presentation.

Preparative digest previously to ligation (production of the ""caffeine synthesis device""). To do this, we want to ligate the second and third expression cartridges consecutively on the first one. Since the length of the expression cassetts is almost the same as the vector backbone (pSB1C3), we make also use of the restriction enzyme Eco53KI which cuts that backbone, thereby enabling a satisfying separation on the agarose gel.

When MLS is added to the N terminus of GFP, the GFP was directed to the mitochondria in the cells, giving patches of GFP signal that overlapped with the signals from MitoTracker®. When MLS is not added to the GFP, the GFP signal can be seen scattered all around in the cell. Scale bar = 10 microns

It showed that the BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial GFP construct had linear relationship of green intensities and red intensities while the GFP generator had no relationship. Pearson's correlation coefficient (rp) and Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) were determined using the Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin (French et al., 2008) for ImageJ with a threshold of 0 and listed for each image.
Figure 3. Mean Pearson correlation coefficient(rp) and mean Spearman correlation coefficient(rs) were shown in bar chart. Using ImageJ software and plugins, the Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman correlation coefficient were generated. For every batch of transfected cells, four samples were used for quantification. Experimental BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial MLS-GFP: Coefficients were close to 1, good colocalization ; GFP: Coefficients were close to 0, poor colocalization. Error bars show standard deviation.

How the Model Works
Given a specific metal that the user wishes to filter from the water, they can input the concentration of metal ions in the water which they are filtering and the amount they wish to reduce the concentration down to. From this they have the ability to alter the flowrates and volume of the reactor vessel in order to find out the most suitable conditions for their purpose.
Our filtration system involves genetically modified E. coli that have a finite number of pili, therefore, a limited number of binding sites. This method of extraction leads to the inefficiency that as ions are bound by the pili there will be a reduction in the number of unbound pili remaining able to bind to the rest of the ions flowing through. This model incorporates this to find the most efficient time to change the filter, which helps to avoid water flowing through without enough pili to bind to the ions. It includes proportions based on the initial concentration of the metal ions in the water, the volume of the reactor chamber, and the flowrate of the system to help provide potential users with information to help implement this unique filtration system effectively.
Output concentration is the ion concentration which leaves the reactor.
Example Graphs and their Physical Explanations
Example 1
Figure 1: Example Graph 1.
Using a small metal binding reactor, like the one in our prototype (which has a volume of 1.5L and a pump which allows for a flow rate of 0.07L/s) we will find that if we pump through a zinc solution of 10g/L with the intention of reducing the concentration to below 9g/L, then an inverse exponential decay curve is produced for concentration over time. This is because initially there are lots of unbound pili able to bind to the zinc ions and so a higher proportion of zinc ions is taken out of solution. As more pili become bound"

The success of our project was due to the great work of many people. First of all, the idea came from our colleague Monika             Pranjic, who was working with this project due to her project lab together with other colleagues - Daniel Moser,             Martin Stefanec, Daniel Nicolas Hofstadler, Ingo Sequens and Nico Teuschler.. As a lot of technical and computational             knowledge was prerequisite to execute our project, we decided to join our teams together to form the iGEM Team             NAWI_Graz 2017.

Berkeley_Software,2009,Team:Berkeley Software#RichardNotebook#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," was to set the GraphScene's LayerWidget's size to the JScrollPane and to account for the JScrollPane's insets.
Update: As you can see from the screenshot to the right, the prototype for the visualization piece is ready (for the most part). Joanna got the thumbnail widget to tell the workspace widget to create a movable version of whichever icon you click on in the thumbnail pane. The workspace icons can be re-ordered by dragging them around, and the icons rearrange themselves when you resize the window. The hardest part about getting the workspace widget working was figuring out how to get the desired behavior with the tools in the Visual Library API . The documentation is so-so; some of the methods don't have any *real* documentation at all. Luckily, you can look through the sources with their Mercurial repository browser; it's a huge help for figuring out how some of the methods work. As such, I'm finding myself creating a lot of custom classes, to the point where I've written my own factory class to house all of the extra handlers I made.
Now that the core of the visualization piece is almost done, all we have to do is hook it up to the language that Lesia and Adam are developing, and polish up the interface. In particular, I need to improve the drag and drop behavior, and add more features (summary info pane at the bottom, menu/toolbar at the top, and a better parts browser in place of the thumbnail pane).

Week Five - 6/29
Another week, another (late) entry. Spectacles (the working name for what I called the Visual Workspace last week) is starting to come together nicely now. I've fixed most of the bugs so far in the workspace, and Joanna is working on hooking up Spectacles with Eugene. The drag and drop in the workspace is a bit more user-friendly now. Before, the icons would stick to their grid positions and not follow the mouse; now the icons follow the mouse most of the way before snapping to their grid positions.
We still need to add tabbed workspaces for better interaction with Eugene, as well as a right-click menu and properties editor. The hardest part about adding tabbing is the management overhead- Spectacles has to keep track of and clean up after all open workspaces. The workspace scene code will have to change significantly to make tab management easier.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Another topic of this discussion was the assembly of BioBricks, especially we talked about what has to be considered in combining different parts with different properties, advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, we answered several general questions about iGEM. Especially an introduction to the acquisition of sponsors was very helpful for the iGEM team Düsseldorf. Therefore, we shared experiences about how to approach companies and how to motivate them to become a sponsor. In addition, we discussed different legal issues associated with sponsoring in Germany. Due to some legal restrictions, it is essential for us to have contracts between our sponsors and our university. We gave them our sponsoring material as an example they could refer to while creating their own. After the visit we stayed in touch and continued our exchange for example on how to get started with the wiki. We met again in person at the German iGEM meet up in Marburg, where we had great discussions and many new ideas. We identified the lack of public awareness about synthetic biology as a major challenge. Initiated by the iGEM team Düsseldorf we joined the idea to create a postcard about synthetic biology. The goal was to spread knowledge and awareness about synthetic biology across Germany.

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Modules#In vivo_-_-_TEXT.html," cultures were grown for approximately 13 hours under the previous conditions but some were exposed to blue light (470nm) while others were maintained in dark. Finally, the cultures were spun down and compared as follows: the RFP pellets obtained under blue-light versus dark condition, and wild type samples versus mutant samples.
Results
In a first approach was observed that wt and trpR mutant cells co-transformed with LovTAP under J23102 promoter grew in dark and light, produced very low levels of RFP protein in comparison with the control sample (wild type cells with only the reporter construction, trpL+RFP). Besides, there was no a visible difference between dark and light conditions, which is the expected behavior under high expression levels of LovTAP. Considering this result we decided to continue the co-transformations procedure without considering the LovTAP construction under J23102 promoter.
Using LovTAP with promoters J23105, J23114 and J23117 (in order of high to lower strength), we obtained the following pellets that are show in the next images:
Testing LovTAP with trpL+RFP reporter system in plasmid pSB1C3(without the double transcriptional terminator). The figure shows the pellets obtained from the cellular cultures. The non aligned tube at the right is a sample of WT cells harboring only trpL+RFP construction.
Testing LovTAP with Lausanne trpL+RFP reporter system in plasmid pSB1A2. The figure shows the pellets obtained from the cellular cultures. The non aligned tube at the left is a sample of WT cells harboring only trpL+RFP from Lausanne team construction.
According to the images trpR mutants seem to have a lower RFP expression levels versus WT both in dark and light conditions. This is a surprising result because it was expected that showed higher levels than WT as they don’t have the possible crass-talk with trpR native E.coli repressor. Maybe there is another process of trpL repression independent to LovTAP and trpR.
Both trpL-RFP reporter systems give similar results. Comparing blue-light versus dark exposed samples there seems to be a small difference visible by naked-eye, with higher levels of RFP protein in dark state samples. Maybe the small difference observed between light and dark conditions is because LovTAP protein levels are very low to considerably repress the trpL promoter. As well, the long half-life of the RFP protein could be masking a significant difference between both states.

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

SCU-China,2018,Team:SCU-China#practice#collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," is the first time for them to participate in the iGEM competition, there are many problems and obstacles in their experiments. Thus, it is necessary for them to get familiar with regulations of the competition as soon as possible for the purpose of researching in a more directional and objective way. So, we explained the concept of laboratory safety, Interlab, some technical methods and precautions commonly used in the experiments. And we also shared our experiences of experiments with them, such as what to do when you get an unexpected result During the lecture, the members of the CDHSU listened to us very carefully and asked us in detail about what they did not understand of the video, such as the laboratory safety levels. At the same time, we found that they had some mistakes in the aseptic operation. So we reminded them of the importance of the aseptic operation, for it is the basis of successful experiments. We also gave them some failure examples. Then it came to the Gibson assembly and the golden gate assembly. For most of the students in CDHSU, it was the first time for them to get to know these two technologies. But they showed great interest and came to understand the main methods and functions. They also tried to compare their strengths and weaknesses critically. After that, they shared what they had got in this lecture. Although some complicated gene circuits were still somehow beyond their understanding, they got to know how to start an iGEM project after our patient explanation. We had a sense of achievement that this lecture did help them to some extent. On the other hand, through the communication we also realized that we should pay more attention to the simplicity and operability of our project -- CRISProgrammer. After the lecture, we went to their lab, observed their experimental operation and put forward many constructive suggestions, such as the plates cannot be completely exposed to the air at any time. Also, we obtained more detailed information about their project, which enabled us to give them reliable advice later in the further cooperation. Due to the lack of certain experimental equipment, the CDHSU came to our laboratory to use the fluorescent microplate reader to test their products. In September, we guided them to fill in the registration information and gave them a part in the Interlab section, which is described in detail in our collaborations. The lecture in July was the beginning of the contact and cooperation between SCU_China and CDHSU, which also spread the spirit of iGEM and made contributions to the inheritance and development of iGEM.

Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," plates. Since protoplasting is failing, we will turn to agrobacterium for G. lucidum transformation in the future. We will also check for homology between the promoter gpd in G. lucidum and Cochliobolus to make sure we are using DNA that can be expressed. Our new strategy will be to insert genes after Cochliobolus gpd by cutting into that region in the genomic promoter to transform. We also created glycerol stocks of pC13BM and pC13BK cultures and miniprepped them to submit for sequencing. We set up new cultures of colonies from transformation of pC13BC, pC13BV, and pC13CE, and ran colony PCRs of them (using our brand new tube of Q5 polymerase!) to check for inserts.
Today in lab we gel screened a bunch of old minipreps to see if they were still viable and made cultures of the Anderson promoter + T7 polymerase in pSB1C3. We digested the lox site constructs in order to ligate with pC13BN. In a meeting with Professor Turgeon we decided that we would leave G. lucidum behind for now and work with Cochliobolus, which her lab transforms regularly and has more expertise with.

We digested, ligated, and transformed to create pC13DD. We ran a PCR to append cut sites to pSB1C3 for digestion and ligation with holin. Gel results indicate that pC13P miniprep, pC13P SpeI/PstI digests, PgpdA PCR for Gibson and the pA13BE BamHI/KpnI/SacI digest are not viable, but the pC13F PCR for Gibson might be okay. pC13BF transformation failed as well. The pC13AZ cultures were digest screened; results were good, so they were sent for sequencing. pC13P was plated and pC13E was cultured. We submitted pC13AF (colony #2) for sequencing. The Q5 PCR from yesterday--pC13CV, pC13I and pC13L--was a failure. We suspected that something is wrong with our reagents. Use the new dNTPs from now on!

We also need to figure out the arrangement on the 96-well plates.  It will require either reducing the number of strains of yeast tested against each other on a single plate or reducing the number of methionine concentrations.  It appears to be a good idea to do the former first so that we can observe a good sweep of activity across several concentrations.

Nothing can be more impressive than take a visit to bio-lab and do something yourself. Thus we invite students in junior grades from Tsinghua University to visit our lab and to draw whatever they like using a kind of engineering e-coli that can produce violacein. By these way, most students set up their first impression of bio-lab and engineering bacteria.

Description
This page outlines the description of our RIOTSensor collection and submitted parts. For other details, please visit the respective subpages of our wiki.
Description
The design of RIOT sensor 10  (BBa_K1897028) and 11 (BBa_K1897029) have higher sensitivity to lactate and lower basal expression as compared to the natural promoter and its modified version, lldRO1-J23117-lldRO2, designed by team ETH_Zurich 2015 (BBa_K1847008). However, to evaluate whether which design is optimal for biomolecule delivery systems, further characterization is required. We replaced the reporter gene sfGFP by Alanine Racemase (ALR, BBa_K1172901) by PCR overlap using appropriate primers and generate a RIOT sensor collection (Fig 1).
Figure 1: Design of the RIOT sensor collection
This collection is a combination of three promoters and three ribosomal binding sites (RBS) of different strengths. The promoters consists of a modified lactate sensor p70 (BBa_K1847008),  a shorter version of the promoter region for wild-type lldPRD operon (BBa_K1897037, derived from Part BBa_K822000) called p62 and a constitutively expressed promoter J23100 (BBa_K314100).
Alanine Racemase (ALR) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of L-alanine ⇌ D-alanine. D-alanine is an essential amino acid that is required for bacterial cell survival (Walsh, 1989). One of our goals is to make the RIOT sensor activated in the presence of high lactate concentration, which enhance the survival of the bacteria in tumour environment. Detailed working mechanism of RIOT sensors can be found at the Introduction page. When being integrated into the whole system,"

Dehalogenase
    Reductive dehalogenases are enzymes which are characterized by the ability of dehalogenation with electron donor.
    They originated from organohalide respiring bacteria and contribute to the global halide cycle. These enzymes are usually membrane-associated, oxygen-sensitive and cobalamin (B12) dependent[1].
    Published in Nature in 2015, a paper succeeded in heterogeneously expressing and characterizing a novel reductive dehalogenase, RdhANP, soluble and oxygen-tolerant in vitro. As the authors have tested, RdhANP catalyzes the reduction of ortho-halogenated phenolic compounds using NADPH under aerobic conditions[2].
Cobalamin B12
    Cobalamin or vitamin B12, is an essential vitamin that is widely used in medical and food industries.
    B12 production in B. megaterium has served as a model system for biotechnology. Some usually used engineering strategies including overexpression and up- or down-regulation of the genes associated.
    In B. megaterium, B12 is synthesized via a branch of the modified tetrapyrrole pathway, with other branches leading to the production of heme and siroheme[3].
Bacillus megaterium
    First being described over 100 years ago, Bacillus megaterium has been increasingly gaining popularity in the field of biotechnology over the recent years. It has several remarkable advantages compared to two commonly used heterogeneous expression hosts, E. coli and B. subtilis.
    To begin with, unlike E. coli, B. megaterium is stained Gram's positive and doesn't contain endotoxins in its cell wall. Then, in the light protein expression, it has been reported that B. megaterium doesn't produce alkaline proteases such as those in"

Laccase Secretion Efficiency Model
Introduction
According to our project modules, we try to categorize our modelling into three parts.
The first one is from the Laccase Module, where we attempt to characterize our laccase construct from previous iGEM data.
The second one is from the Alkane Metabolism Module. We are fitting the kinetic parameters of fumarate addition mechanism to observe the activity of ASS and observe the rate of conversion from alkane to succinate.
While for the MFC module, we focus our modelling to establish data to find the optimum concentration for Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 growth, as well as estimating the voltage and power density that can be produced.
 
Laccase Module
As there is little documentation about the usage of laccase from E. coli, we rely on the literature reviews [1] of laccase secreted by fungi to correlate with the number of alkane and alkene chains that can be formed. Using simple calculation, it can easily be translated that 2900 alkane chains (30%) and 900 alkene chains (10%) should be formed after polyethylene is treated with laccase for every centimeter squared.
Using UCL iGEM 2012 team's [2] findings on polyethylene degradation, we assume that the rate of degradation will eventually be linear with 0.9 PE molecule degraded per second, of which 28 molecules of alkane and 9 molecules of alkene will be formed in 100 seconds. Using the weight and the density of polyethylene, there would be 3.86×10-12 mm3 or 82,000 polyethylene molecules degraded within one day.
To improve BBa_K863006 obtained from the Bielefeld iGEM 2012, we try to characterize it by adding OmpA and his-tag. However, due to time constraint, our wet lab experiment could not acquire any valuable data and the modelling team will only rely on literature findings.
OmpA itself is a major protein that can be found in the outer membranes of most gram-negative bacteria, including"
Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," lowest concentration of EDC. As you can see in the tubes 1 and 2 we did not get a bacterial growth, but in 3-10 tubes we did. Therefore, we chose to work with the concentration of tube 4 for the rest of the experiment where we use EDC with azobenzene and bacteria.
Synthetic biofilm formation
After mixing azobenzene with bacteria, we exposed them to 530-560 nm wavelength and we saw the “sticky” bacteria aggregate to form a biofilm.  The quorum sensing molecules, AHL can diffuse faster between them leading to a faster information exchange.
left: E.coli sample with azobenzene, right: E.coli sample with-out azobenzene
The dipole force between azobenzene rings are more powerful than the natural negative repulsion of bacteria.
We are the first people ever to demonstrate this technique. Our vision can help many researchers study the kinetics of biofilm formation in real time.
Signal focusing by azobenzene
Quorum sensing bacteria release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers (AHL molecules) that increase in concentration as a function of cell density.
By making the bacteria aggregate, they exchange AHL molecules faster, which speeds up the detection process.
We engineered E. coli bacteria to emit light at a wavelength range of 530-560nm (green) when they detect the desired substance. The green light is absorbed by azobenzene, photo-switches to its “sticky” form causing the bacteria clump together forming a reversible synthetic biofilm.  The AHL molecules diffuse quickly to all the other bacteria and they all produce green light, which can be seen by the naked eye.
Azobenzene aggregate Nano-Particles (NPs)
We established our iGEM azobenzene biological conceptions based on the Nano-word. We collaborated with Weizmann institute to test azobenzene molecules. We have seen that azobenzene can aggregate various NPs like iron oxide, gold and big particles like silica (see reference and TEM figures), and based on this behaviors we established our vision to use azobenzene as a photo-induced molecule to aggregate bacteria forming a synthetic biofilm.

FAT BUSTER - Artificial Futile Cycle
Abstract

Future Work
Characterization
While a low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism.
In terms of fat storage, conversion of carbohydrates or protein into fat uses ten times more calories than simply storing fat in a fat cell. This brought our attention to one method of burning calories - increase energy expenditure by converting fat into glucose. However, mammals cannot convert fatty acids into carbohydrate due to lacking glyoxylate enzymes, while plants and bacteria can. We intend to introduce glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells and create an artificial futile cycle.
While the consequences of introducing such a nonnative cycle are not fully known, Dean et al. (2009) at UCLA recently introduced glyoxylate shunt into mammalian liver cells to investigate fatty acid metabolism. They observed that although fatty acids could not be converted into glucose in normal mammalian cells, human hepatocytes expressing the glyoxylate shunt have increased fatty acid oxidation and mice expressing the shunt were resistance to diet-induced obesity.
In addition to introducing a constitutive glyoxylate shunt, our team plans to elaborate the UCLA study by introducing an inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. This inducible system prevents the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while greater fatty acid uptake at high circulating concentrations can be facilitated. Fatty acid uptake will be quantified to compare the activities in wild type cells, cells expressing the shunt constitutively, and cells expressing the shunt in an inducible manner.
So, to sum up, we envision developing an inducible glyoxylate shunt that will serve to generate an artificial futile cycle in human liver cells. We hope our work will point to a future where obesity patients can increase expenditure of calories and thus alleviate health complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Notebook#History_-_-_TEXT.html," 7th of September, we organised a symposium where we invited, among others, neighboring iGEM teams. On the 10th and 11th of September we visited schools to teach children biochemistry using colorful sticker game. We also designed the educative ""Strains"" card game, hoodies, T-shirts and posters, and prepared the presentation for the Giant Jamboree. The whole team contributed to editing the wiki pages before the wiki freeze on the 18th of September. Adding an extra touch to the wiki, we constructed a wiki game. And finally, between the 24th and the 28th of September, we are taking part in the Giant Jamboree!

Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the wrong direction. Therefore, we incorporated these terminators into the constructs for this part of the project. The KanR gene confers resistance to the antibiotics, kanamycin. Therefore, we selected for the vector in both DH10-beta competent E. coli and our cyanobacteria using kanamycin. We linearized this vector by cutting with both EcoRV and SalI; by cutting with two enzymes, we minimized the chance for spontaneous re-ligation. We intended to use this vector to characterize circuits pairing our novel promoters, psbA2 and idiA, with our sucrose genes, cscB and sps (sps did not get characterized in pAM2991 due to DNA synthesis issues but is referenced on the Project Description page).
This vector is a suicide vector with neutral site II (NSII), and works in the same way as pAM2991.
Gibson Assembly Overlap Design
We decided to approach construct insertion into vectors using Gibson Assembly to improve efficiency. For Gibson Assembly, we had to design overlaps between adjacent DNA sequences. Each overlap is 30 base pairs long, and was incorporated into the original DNA synthesis.
pAM2991 Overlaps
For pAM2991, because we only had to insert one construct at a time the overlaps were relatively easy to design. The 30 base pairs at each end of the linearized vector were added on to the ends of the the target gene (either cscB or EYFP), such that the promoter in the vector would be at the start of the gene.
pAM1414 Overlaps
For pAM1414, we also only had to insert one construct at a time. Therefore, the overlaps were relatively easy to design again. The 30 base pairs at each end of the linearized vector were added on to the ends of the the target promoter, such that the gene in the vector would be at the end of the promoter.
pAM1579 Overlaps 
For pAM1579, we had to insert four constructs at a time: two genes and a promoter for each gene. The order of the constructs after assembly is the cscB promoter, the cscB gene, the sps promoter, and the sps gene. For the cscB promoter, the first 30 base pairs overlap with the last 30 base pairs in the linearized pAM1579 vector. For the sps gene, the last 30 base pairs overlap with the first 30 base pairs in the linearized pAM1579 vector. For the overlaps between adjacent constructs, the same pattern was followed for"

Outreach
     Reproducibility is one of the pillars of science, it allows separate groups of scientists to perform the same experiments and come to the same conclusions. Despite the importance of reproducibility, studies 1 and 2 show that oftentimes the conclusions published in high-impact science journals are not reproducible. As iGEM is a synthetic biology competition, we wanted to find out if synthetic biologists also encountered similar problems. We reached out to scientists to ask for their thoughts on reproducibility, and whether or not an online protocol database would help to increase reproducibility in science. The survey was emailed to 155 recipients, the majority of whom were iGEM advisors and student participants. A link to the survey was also posted on the iGEM facebook page. In total, 55 responses were received, and were used to aid our design of ProtoCat.
     We asked participating teams about their experiences with the protocols that iGEM provides on their website. Surprisingly, 78% of teams encountered issues with, or had to make adjustments to one or more of the iGEM-provided protocols that they used. Even though the iGEM-provided protocols are classic molecular biology protocols, and among the most commonly used in the field, a large majority of users had problems with them. With this information in mind, we wanted to gauge the appeal of a software like ProtoCat. We asked scientists whether or not they could see themselves using a multidisciplinary, online protocol database, with 73% indicating 'yes', 27% indicating 'maybe', and none indicating 'no'. Given the positive responses, we felt certain the ProtoCat would be appealing to scientists searching for protocols.
     Respondents provided plenty of ideas such as giving users the ability to search for, review and rate protocols. We implemented as many of these as we could, placing particular emphasis on creating an efficient and easy to use search engine as many it seemed to be the most important part in the respondents' minds. More information on the results of the project can be found here ."

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," is called a “helper plasmid”.
A phagemid carrying a DNA message is referred to as a “messaging phagemid” and will be transmitted from sender cells that carry a helper plasmid
DNA of arbitrary length can be transmitted: M13 viral packaging occurs at the cell membrane, where the viral particle forms around the DNA as it is packaged and slowly secreted, forming a long filament. This allows DNA of arbitrary length to be packaged [7].
Sender cells continue to grow: M13 is not a lytic bacteriophage. Since M13 viral particles are secreted through the cell membrane, infected cells are able to continue living and dividing, albeit at ½ to ¾ their normal rate [7]. Because of this, cells sending a DNA message need not commit suicide to transmit their message!
Only F+ cells can be infected: Infection by M13 bacteriophage requires attachment to the E. coli F pilus. Therefore, only E. coli cells carrying the F plasmid (F+ cells) are susceptible, while F- cells are not.
The basic scheme of DNA messaging is seen in Figure 3. This method was established in 2012 when Ortiz and Endy demonstrated transmission and receipt of a DNA message encoding GFP and ampicillin resistance, as well as a separate message encoding T7 RNA polymerase [6]. Their proof of principle demonstration indicates the viability of DNA messaging and suggests extension of the method to diversify potential communication programs.
Figure 3. Sender cells contain a messaging phagemid and a helper plasmid, which allows them to secrete viral particles. Receiver cells must be F+.  When the two cell populations are co-cultured, DNA messaging takes place.
The Idea
We are fascinated by the idea of DNA messaging. Since this intercellular communication method [6] is so new, there is room for advancement of the method. We have identified ways to advance the system. We believe that in advanced DNA messaging, a DNA message should be:
Controllable: A DNA message should not necessarily be constitutively transmitted, but should rather be controllable by a particular stimulus.
Modifiable: Established methods of DNA recombination should be available for modification of a DNA message by senders or receivers. In particular, recent advances in DNA digital memory and logic [X,X] should be incorporated into DNA messaging.
Retransmittable: A receiver cell should be able to retransmit a DNA message following modification.
We developed designs, models, and experiments to approach these goals.
* It should be noted that modification of a DNA"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," gene was a point mutation from G to A at position 720. Thereby the glycin at the place 160 chance to aspartic acid. We use this model to modify our strain VibriClone. At position 158  in recA of V. natriegens is a glycine. Through an alignment, we have found out that this is homologous to that in E. coli. To get the same kind of function loss, this glyin needs to be changed to an aspartic acid.  For the modification of recA we build an unselected cassette from the gene with a point mutation. To achieve that two primers bind at the future mutation place, one forward and one reverse were created. In addition two more primers with a gap of 3000 bp to the other both were ordered. The results are two fragments which end at the point mutation. By a fusion PCR with only the outside primers, you get the hole fragment containing the recA with the desired mutation.
All in all with these mutation we make VibriClone fine for all of us to use for cloning without recombineering of an introduced plasmid with the genome and between two plasmids.
KatG
Another feature, which would improve the applicability of V. natriegens as a cloning chassis, would be to engineer cold resistance, due to fact that we all are used to store our plates of E.coli in the fridge. It has been shown for other vibrio species that cold sensitivity is triggered by toxic peroxide present in media, which is normally removed  for example in E.coli by reactive oxygen species detoxification systems. Therefore our approach is to introduce such a system into our cloning strain, in order to transfer that tolerance, which enables keeping the working procedures from E.coli. It was shown, that catalase supplemented on agar plates could improve the viability under cold conditions. Nevertheless a more usable approach would be to include this tolerance within the strain itself. Several approaches exist to realize this goal, for instance increasing the glutathione pool within the cell or by introducing a plasmid  with an encoded catalase, such as KatG, KatE or the ahpCF operon.
We decided on introducing KatG into the genome, due to previous results, which were reported by Weinstock et al. They could show that KatG heterologous expressed from plasmid extends the time for fridge storage up to 3 weeks, which would suit for the needs for a cloning host. For integrating the katG into the genome, we combined introducing katG"

Influenza virus A's subtype:
Any permutation of Hemagglutinin(HA) subtypes 1~16.
Any permutation of Neuraminidase(NA) subtypes 1~9.
The gene sequence of Hemagglutinin (ex:H1) might have mutated. So we want to find some part of Hemagglutinin that has a commom structure (region), and use a kind of antibody to bind to that part of the structure.
There are many problems inherent in developing a good protective anti-viral vaccine. Among these are:
Different types of viruses may cause similar diseases -- e.g. the common cold. As a result, a single vaccine will not be possible against such a disease.
Antigenic drift and shift -- This is especially true of RNA viruses and those with segmented genomes.
Large animal reservoirs. If these occur, reinfection may occur after elimination from the human population.
Integration of viral DNA. Vaccines will not work on latent virions unless they express antigens on the cell surface. In addition, if the vaccine virus integrates into host cell chromosomes, it may cause problems (e.g. a problem with the possible use of anti-HIV vaccines based on attenuated virus strains).
Transmission from cell to cell via syncytia -- This is a problem for potential AIDS vaccines since the virus may spread from cell to cell without the virus entering the circulation.
Recombination and mutation of the vaccine virus in an attenuated vaccine.[1]
So we want to use a kind of antibody (consistent) to catch the influenza virus A(inconsistent).
Goals
Use antibodies to catch the virus.
Prevent humans from getting infected with Influenza A virus.
Detect infection fast (Diagnosis).
Select an appropriate antibody
Select an appropriate antibody to bind to Hemagglutinin.
Hemagglutinin (Target):
Functions:
Allowing the recognition of target vertebrate cells, accomplished through the binding of these cells' sialic acid-containing receptors, and
Allowing the entry of the viral genome into the target cells by causing the fusion of host endosomal membrane with the viral membrane.[7]
Mechanism:
HA binds to the monosaccharide sialic acid which is present on the surface of its target cells. This causes the viral particles to stick to the cell's surface. The cell membrane then engulfs the virus and the portion of the membrane that encloses it pinches off"

Overview
Our team has been focused on targeted gene expression in certain cells for a long time. While this year, we had a thought of whether the delivered genes’ localization occurred in different areas in cells themselves? We hope to provide new strategies to cure relevant diseases in this way. With such a question, we first learned about neuronal diseases caused by abnormal neurons as a special kind of polar cells. Next, during the talk with neurologist, specialists and other iGEM teams, we knew that it was possible to provide a new strategy to cure some diseases in this way and asked them for some details about the subject and experiments. The practices were closely integrated with our project as we improved our experiment design according to different experts and stakeholders’ opinions. Besides, we went to Nanjing Foreign Language School in Chinese Brain Health Month to hold a communicating lecture to inspire high school students’ interests of curing diseases using targeted protein expression with improved elements, synthetic biology and iGEM.
Integrated Human Practices
In this part, we discussed our goal, design and execution with as many experts and stakeholders of the general public as possible, so that we could get their opinions and ask for their advice in order to shape our design and improve the experiments as best possible.

At the very beginning, we came to Nanjing Brain Hospital and had an interview with a rehabilitation teacher and a head-nurse there. Where we went was children’s intensive care ward in Brain Hospital. In a colourful and warm environment there, medical staff introduced the present situation of brain hospital and neuronal diseases. As the earliest national neurology hospital, it has more than 800 thousand outpatient visits and 18 thousand inpatients per year. There was one case of ‘Fragile X Syndrome’ in their hospital, a kind of neurological disease with high incidence in North America, characterized by erroneous localization of mRNA and proteins in neurons. In such case, we started with this disease and tried to construct new combined targeting elements effective for the mis-localization.

Peking,2014,Team:Peking#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," enhanced if the average distances between E.coli and cyanobacteria were reduced. Therefore, we introduced two improvement methods, Binding and Gas vesicle, to curtail this distance. The binding was accomplished by anchoring a protein that binds to Microcystis.aeruginosa specifically. Gas vesicle, kindly given by the OUC-China iGEM team, consists of a low-density protein complex that can make our E.coli float up to the water surface.
Then, except for treating the remarkable biomass of cyanobacteria, the toxins secreted by cyanobacteria contribute to other serious environmental problems. Thus we targeted to degrade the microcystin, one of the algal secreted peptide having hepatotoxic effect. We implemented a protein MlrA that can decrease its toxicity significantly.
Finally, our transgenic E.coli should be cleared away after completion of killing and degradation work because of biosafety concerns. Therefore, we used holin, a hole-forming membrane protein, and endolysin, a muralytic enzyme, to construct a suicide system which will be triggered when M. aeruginosa are killed and the concentration of specific inducer molecules decreases.

The code for matching the awards is slighly more complicated, since the awards are saved in the data-list and we want to reduce the data-frame. This is the pseudocode for the functions:
iterate through all awards to be included {  (re-)set a vector for deleting those items from the data-list  iterate through all the teams in the data-list {   if the award matches one of the team awards:   - expand the vector for the teams to keep with the name   - expand the vector for the teams already matched  }  delete those teams from the data-list, that were already positive in order to save runtime } reduce data-frame according to the matching result
All the filter functions and corresponding layout elements were put together in one file to easily copy and paste them to the different apps.
Incomplete data
During the testing of the filters it was found, that there was no best team in 2007. After further investigation we found out, that the 2007 awards were on a different page than it was from 2008 onwards. Thus another scraper had be written and integrated into the pipeline in order to cover this page, too. This took a bit longer than for the other results pages, because its structure is entirely different from the standard one.

This data from the lab suggests that there is not a high change in RFP for the pDusk system between dark and light conditions. When plotting the computed response of RFP for increasing light intensity in Figure 13 we see, however, that pDusk has a steep decline in RFP levels from complete darkness to very low light intensities. There could be two potential reasons for such a result. First, despite all efforts in creating dark conditions, the experiment could have been contaminated with low light intensities. This would explain why there is no significant change visible in the experimental data between different conditions. To confirm this, additional experiments would need to be conducted. Secondly, a more in-depth parameter sensitivity and robustness analysis could also reveal potential causes of the discrepancies between model simulations and experiments conducted under darkness. This could lead to an understanding of how to engineer the promoters in pDusk to amplify the wanted the response.

At first, we used newspaper as drawing papers. However, we found that newspaper has high levels of intrinsic fluorescence and is not suitable for BioArt (Fig.11). Indeed, pictures drawn with bio inks on newspaper were dull and not clear. Therefore, we tried to find the proper paper for BioArt. As shown in Fig.11, ‘‘Kimwipes’’, a type of cleaning tissue commonly used in laboratories, did not show almost any intrinsic fluorescence. Why do some papers have intrinsic fluorescence? It is well known that lignin, commonly derived from wood, has a strong intrinsic fluorescence, and some papers are rich in lignin. That is one of reasons why some papers showed high levels of intrinsic fluorescence. On the other hand, little lignin is contained in Kimwipes. Therefore, we concluded that Kimwipes is the best drawing papers for BioArt with the E.coli Pen.

Isothermal Assembly
We performed an isothermal assembly in order to insert omega+zif268 into the plasmid containing the spec backbone.
The concentration of the plasmid (previously prepared) was 157.4 ng/ul.
The concentration of the w+zif268 was 54.3 ng/ul.
Using our isothermal assembly protocol we determined we needed:
0.63 ul backbone (length: ~2.2 kb)
0.59 ul w+zif268 (length: ~0.7 kb)
2.78 ul water
15.0 ul isothermal assembly solution
Transformation of electro-competent E. coli
We electroporated our cells so they would take up the plasmids, using:
1.0 ul DNA
40.0 ul cells
500 ul LB
We plated the cells, using this protocol , on spec plates, one of which contained 50 ul of cells and the other 150 ul of cells. The cells have been incubated at 37*, and will be left there overnight. Cells that have taken up the plasmid have spec-resistance and should be able to survive. Tomorrow, we will be picking colonies and performing PCR on them to determine whether they contain w+zif268.

Biological Anti freeze Bacteria which produce anti frost agent, induced by low temperatures, the agent could be degraded if temperatures rise again.
Air refreshener Ideal situation: the bacterium would take up CO2 (just so that problem will also become less :P) and release some nice smelling, non-toxic compound (maybe vanilla)
Bacterial (gas) filter (previously gas pump) Have bacteria in some sort of rigid structure (like a platinum / magnesium plate with microscopic pores) and produce some … this is is very bad idea, now that I'm writing it. The original train of thought of thought was as follows: create vesicles susceptible to a certain gas on one side of the bacteria and having the vesicles transported through the other side and releasing them(using a re-uptake mechanism for the vesicles). Effectively creating a selectively permeable gas filter. This is however a bad idea because gas diffuses and it's next to impossible to find a structure that is both selective and non-porous to gasses. On top of that coordinating the movement of the vesicles through the dense packed inner world of a bacterium is a project in itself. Amongst other reasons (size/controlling the expressed location of the entry / exit points).
Bacteria creating (carbon) nanotubes. While microscopic structures in cells are not uncommon (think neuronal axons and other micro tubulea) the mass production of nano tubes is still tedious. However they do play a major part in most of nanotechnology advances. Having bacteria to produce them and then being able to harvest them (without breaking the structures) would be a good idea. Also carbon nanotubes can conduct electricity (outer-layer electron movement?) which might provide chances of more tight integration of silicon-based computers and bacterial systems.
Alcohol content control by apoptosis Right now alcohol content is controlled either by sugar availability, alcohol cytotoxicity, or manual killing of the yeast at a certain alcohol level (the idea could be applied to other fermentation products as well). It would be useful to have a system in which you could decide beforehand to which degree the yeast will grow, this could be done by getting the yeast to recognize a certain ratio between alcohol and a second substance and kill themselves once that ratio is reached"

We emphasize here that the PAM sequence is on a single-stranded part of the amplicon (the one complementary to the large loop of the probe): therefore, such single-stranded PAM can only be present on the amplicon, and not on the probe itself (as would have been instead if the PAM was on a double stranded part).

The sign | indicates the position where the gRNA binds to the point on the amplicon where each new ""copy"" of the amplicon is considered to start (i.e. the point where                             the 3' of a ""subunit"" of the amplicon and the 5' of the successive subunit are linked together).
More specifically, we can notice that in this design the spacer coincides with the reverse complement of let-7a, with the exception of the two mismatches and of a missing A at the beginning. The template of the gRNA for Cas9                             would therefore be:

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," The catalytic activity of esterase gene, regulated by a library of ribosome binding sites was measured using cell-free expression system in bulk or CAT-Seq approach and compared side by side. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized BBa_B0034 corresponding to mean strength of 1.
It’s known that stronger ribosome binding sites increase the yield of translated proteins and in therefore increase the number of catalytically converted substrate nucleotides. This increase of nucleotides is inversely proportional to the assigned mean methylation score of the sequenced DNA template. Based on this fact, the activity results can be extracted from mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) and correspond to ribosome binding site strength. The catalytic activity sequencing results were compared to earlier, in standard sized reactions measured RBS strength results. The comparison once again concludes the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The ribosome binding site strength, extracted from the DNA sequence in a form of reference nucleotide count correlates with measurements made with accurate standard assays. These results display the validity of CAT-Seq as a method for screening the strength of regulatory sequences and its ability to assign accurate phenotype to genotype linkage.
Toehold cross interaction assessment
Toehold regulatory sequence library constituted of the different toehold and trigger pairs was constructed subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information was sequenced with Nanopore. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count in the sequence) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different regulatory sequence were filtered and extracted.
Figure 3. The evaluation of Toehold-Trigger riboregulatory sequence orthogonality using CAT-Seq. The catalytic activity of esterase genes, regulated by different Toehold switches were measured using CAT-Seq. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded regulatory construct DNA template was filtered and essigned. Low methylation scores correspond to actively expressed protein and are only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present verifying the already measured orthogonality of regulatory parts.
The Figure 3 displays the mean methylation (reference nucleotide count) scores assigned to each barcoded toehold-trigger construct read. Based on the results, low methylation score is only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present. This means that esterase was expressed and catalyzed the conversion of substrate nucleotides. These results correlate perfectly to the standard (not in droplet) measurement results. Based on"
