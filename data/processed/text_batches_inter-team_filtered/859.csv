William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#Outreach DB#database csv_-_-_TEXT.html,"3) Incorporate feedback into project</ul>"",Integrated Human Practices,Received valuable feedback.,2 experts were consulted.,""The Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) is the bioveterinary research institute of the Wageningen University & Research. Located in Lelystad, it is commissioned by the Dutch authorities and carries out research related to vaccine development, diagnostics and animal health in general. On the 10th of July, we gave an elaborate presentation on our project, during which we discussed the setup and story with the people at CVI.
They mentioned that the Zika virus can slumber in the placenta, which might be an interesting side-topic for our application. They also said that the current antibody dipstick tests for HAT are of bad quality since confirmation tests are always needed. Furthermore, the interpretation of the result is subjective and depends on the researcher, hence there is a high chance of false positives or false negatives. One way to solve this is to quantify our results, making it more objective. In addition, a cold chain is currently needed while delivering the tests, and tests that can avoid the need for a cold-chain would be very beneficial. The delivery on site is very important, so the on-site test is definitely of value. A drawback in detecting antigens instead of antibodies is that we need to test for viruses in blood, which is difficult but not impossible. This is not so much a problem for HAT. An alternative application that they mentioned was sheep, where a virus (Cache Valley virus, CVV) causes abortion of the lamb. This can spread to humans so a new diagnostic would be valuable. Moreover, Trypanosoma is also a problem in cattle, which might also be an interesting side-story.
We also asked them about vector monitoring, regarding our previous decision of not making it our main story. They told us that for vector monitoring the rapid characteristics of our device is not needed. Furthermore, with PCR you can detect any virus you want whereas our system is specific for one virus. Hence, we made the right choice in focusing on human screening.
"",,""Met with Prof. dr. Wim van de Poel and dr. Jeroen Kortekaas to discuss project; they mentioned several drawbacks of both current diagnostics, and our diagnostic. Moreover, we got more confirmation that focusing on human screening is more relevant than vector control.

Warsaw,2012,Team:Warsaw#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," great deal in gene therapy. Delivering certain genes right into the malfunctioning cells would be a tremendous help in treatment of complicated diseases.
First step
In the first step of our project we designed a few BioBricks adapted for Bacillus subtilis. We decided, that even if some basic parts are available in partsregistry, we would create a few more to expand the amount of BioBricks for this bacterium. Therefore, we designed:
Two new promoters for Bacillus subtilis
Three new RBSes for Bacillus subtilis
One terminator for Bacillus subtilis
We believed that these parts will be useful for creating constructs designed for Bacillus subtilis in this year's project of ours and in the future projects based on this bacterium.
We performed all designing work in Clone Manager software, which we found easy and useful.
Then, we designed parts especially devoted to our project. Our goal was to create two main constructs: the first one should allow Bacillus subtilis to enter mammalian cell. To give Bacillus this ability, we decided to use listeriolysin, a protein naturally existing in Listeria monocytogenes. To confirm that Bacillus entered the mammalian cell we used GFP protein, which would give us a fluorescent signal, easy to notice by using fluorescent microscopy. We designed our construct like this:
The listeriolysin gene was taken from the BioBrick BBa_K177026 . Listeriolysin is a protein considered to be the virulence factor of Listeria monocytogenes, because of its pivotal role is the process of pathogenesis of these bacteria. Since both L. monocytogenes and B. subtilis are gram-positive bacteria, we believed that the expression of listeriolysin will be much better in B. subtilis than in the gram-negative E. coli.
Our plan was to test all our basic parts in this construct, by creating few parallel versions, using different promoters and RBSes and choose the best version.
While doing that, we were also preparing construct which could replicate and be expressed in both bacterial (E. coli) and mammalian cell. We based our plasmid on pSB1A3 plasmid backbone and ligated into it the CMV mammalian promoter (designed and sent to us by Slovenia iGEM Team) with mammalian RBSes (we wanted to test both J63003 and K165002 Kozak sequence) and RFP (to confirm expression in mammalian cells). To confirm expression in E."

Repeating this step for 3 times, and then cultivated the culture overnight to ensure saturated induction and interaction between different modules. The results were tested by flowcytometry, controls that constitutively expresses GFP and RFP are used to determine the red cell region and green cell region(fig 19). Flowcytometry data of the first stage system is analysis by counting the cells that falls in both of the regions.
Fig 19. The RFP, GFP controls and definition of different states areas. The Y axis denotes the strength of RFP fluorescence, and the X axis means the strength of GFP fluorescence. Fig 19a is the result of RFP control, so we enclosed a polygon area as the state of RFP in Bistable Switch (CI side). Fig 19b is the result of GFP control, depended on which we defined the area as the state of GFP.
Taking advantages of the defined enclosed areas, we can count the cell number in either states of Bistable switch. And this is a criterion to assess the quality of assembling. We have tested a number of assemblies and different combinations of various concentrations of arabinose and salicylate.
At last, the best results are from the assembling system, which is made of AND gate on pSB4A5, Bistable on pSB1A2 and CI on plasmid pSB3T3, with the RBS of J44001. The concentrations of inducers are 10^-4M arabinose and 10^-6M salicylate.

The Y axis denotes the number of cells in the defined enclosed areas (figs on the left side for GFP area and figs on the right side for RFP area). The X axis means the strength of G(R)FP fluorescence. Fig 20a: control group, without inducing. Fig 20b: arabinose single inducing group, the concentration is 10^-4M. Fig 20c: salicylate single inducing group, the concentration is 10^-6M. Fig 20d: arabinose and salicylate double inducing group, the concentration of arabinose is 10^-4M and of salicylate is 10^-6M

The bacteria did float during the repeated trial and the result is shown in Fig. 12(b). They also kindly provided us with the gene circuit and we also redid the experiment to confirm the viability.
Figure 12. (a) Schematic presentation of the Gas Vesicle formation. Two proteins, GvpA and GvpC, are expressed in E.coli at the same time. Then, they can polymerise in to a protein complex gas vesicle which has a lower density than water so that E.coli can be floating in the water. (b) The E. coli cells were observed to float during the repeated trial by the OUC-China iGEM team.
By equipping the bacteria with gas vesicle, we can help make our project become more feasible in the real ecosystem.

We performed three serial dilutions of 100uL of TinselPurple. We then plated 20uL of this on a quadrant of a plate. We determined the concentration of the cells was too great, due to the formation of lawns as opposed to countable colonies, and that a fourth dilution at a .000X will generate the most desirable growth. We also determined that each dilution did need to be plated in a lawn format on individual plates.

Nordic iGEM Conference
In the collaboration with Uppsala's iGEM team, we organized and hosted a meet-up for 60 students from eight Nordic iGEM teams. Teams participating in the Nordic iGEM Conference were Oslo, SDU Danmark, Aalto Helsinki, Linköping, Copenhagen, Gothenbug as well as Uppsala and us, Stockholm. We also had a pleasure to have Randy Rettberg, president of the iGEM foundation, with us during the conference.
Our Nordic iGEM Conference was a three-day-long event. We had a mini-Jamboree along with the project presentations and a prize – the famous Golden Pipette. There were also workshops, fabulous dinners and a great bar-crawl in Uppsala. It was a great experience, and the Nordic iGEM Conference will be certainly repeated next year.

BGU Israel
Together with BGU Israel we have worked on a possible affibody-based application of their idea for cancer therapy. Their system is delivered to mammalian cells with Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and triggers expression or knockout when two cancer-related promoters are simultaneously highly active. One method of the therapy could be to specifically target cancer cells with a toxin. Since affibody molecules can be engineered to bind almost any protein with high specificity and affinity, it might be possible to direct these toxins towards cells that express affibody molecules on their surface. To try this concept, we decided that"

Impact of the Lox array on the transcription
The Lox array was the most difficult region to construct. As it is a very repetitive sequence with numerous dyad repeats, it is tedious to synthesize, amplify and assemble. That's why we created biobrick BBa_K1678005 . It contains the promoter followed by the four orthogonal Lox sites. We sequenced this biobrick to confirm that it contains no mutation.
We characterized this new biobrick's function by assembling it in pSB1C3 with the part
BBa_K516030
which contains a RBS, the mRFP coding sequence and a double terminator. For comparison, the biobrick
BBa_J23119
was assembled with the same mRFP cassette on the same vector.
As in prokaryotes the 30S subunit of the ribosome binds directly to the RBS, the LoxP array does not theoretically interfere with translation. It can however interfere with the transcription.
During the transcription, the RNA polymerase has to go through the LoxP array, which is made of repetitive sequences that are likely to form a hairpin. We show that this has an impact on the transcription efficiency (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, p-value < 10-6). However, it still allows for strong protein expression as the average expression level was equal to 91% of the expression level of the BBa_J23119 promoter. The fraction of RNA polymerases that go through the Lox array should be more than enough for our design.
Using standard biobrick assembly, three plasmids were constructed and transformed into E. coli:
The promoter directly connected to the mRFP sequence (RBS + ORF + Terminator),
The promoter connected to the Lox array, connected to the mRFP sequence,
The promoter alone, without any fluorescent proteins as a negative control.
The cells were diluted to an OD600 of 0.01, grown to exponential phase and the fluorescence was measured on a TECAN plate reader when the OD reached 0.3. The excitation wavelength was 585 nm and the detection wavelength was 615 nm.
Expression of the proteins
A ""mother cell"" with our differentiation system integrated in the chromosome was grown to exponential phase and its fluorescence was measured when OD600 reached 0.3. As a negative control, a cell without fluorescent underwent the same treatment.
Excitation wavelength: 585 nm.

Tongji_Shanghai,2016,Team:Tongji Shanghai#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Team SJTU2016 is found. During the previous 2 months, we collect remarkable project from all of the teams in the season of 2015 and some even further, and summarize the basic principle of genetically engineering. We shared these precious files with Team SJTU at 12.28 to help them have a quicker and better start, avoiding the repeating work.
Both our team and SJTU have the part of mathematics model building, so we have some collaboration with each other. Concerning the heat treatment, Pro.Xuemin Xu, also known as vice chairman of SJTU, is the specialist in this field. Coincidentally, one team member of Team SJTU had had her class of heat treatment. He provided us the relevant articles, and helped us to build the path of this model. Meanwhile, the SJTU is working on relation of the ADH, GAL, CUP promoter and expression level of protein downstream. One of graduate student is right working on the problem of GAL promoter, so we make contact with both of them and build a bridge.
In addition, we help with testing their new system iMPA an inventive idea about promoting convenience and efficiency. Link below shows our test feedback
Feedback for iMAP
NYU-Shanghai ~ Tongji
At 6.5,2016 our team visited team NYU-Shanghai for changing ideas. NYU-Shanghai raised the project using a 10bp micro-RNA with hairpin structure linked with fluorescence to indicate certain sequence of gene. Since we had done the work of overview the previous project, we noticed that one team in 2015 have already done the same job. We raised it to NYU-Shanghai, helped them to justify their projects.
NCTU_Formosa ~ Tongji
We received Her2 related bioparts from NCTU.
We are trying to improve the efficiency of the golden nanorods by improve the selective efficiency. NCTU igem team advise us to using antibody her2 to help the material target the tumor cells, and give us some plasmids of her2 to help us.We appreciate their help and would be glad if we have more time to add antibody to our material.

Proof of concept
To prove our concept that See our final results here!
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can  control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The number of the copy numbers are shown in the table below:
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold of plasmids number to meet different needs.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have choose:
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed there circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
And then after passing a period of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration under on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship of the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter providing an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Kill gene is replaced by RFP to stand the in-promoter’s status.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.

Interlab Study
Description
Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component to all engineering disciplines including synthetic biology. However, repeatable measurements are difficult to achieve in different laboratories. This year the aim of interlab study is to make the measurement tools more available since the fluorescence data usually cannot be compared due to the reason that they are reported in different units and different scientists process data in different ways. The InterLab protocol aims to address these issues by providing researchers with a detailed protocol and data analysis form, which yields absolute units to measure GFP in a plate reader.

Conclusion
It can be seen that for some devices have obvious errors which indicating a lot of variation in the results. In general, the ratio decreased over time for all samples.
During the experiment ,the result is better when culture the cell in  amber falcon tube than that in the normal tube covered with foil.
The standard curve is not very linear, some data made the curve a little crooked.
The plasmid test device 1 had the problem to transformation and is difficult to culture the E.coli contained it. We have sequenced all the plasmids and compared with the map on the item official web site , then we found out that"

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the concerns by the international community are rising, there is still few efficient way to cure such problems.
Though many contributing causes of hearing problems [3] have been identified and new therapies (e.g. electrical devices, medication) keep coming up year after year, the majority of people with hearing impairment still cannot be cured (Here, “cure” means “one can have similar level of hearing ability to common ones”) due to these limitations:
Hearing-aids: Long-term risk (amplified sound may induce greater damage to inner structures).
Cochlear implant: Only for patients with neural residue; high cost; long-term risk (damage for different hearing frequency range, especially for frequency below 1000Hz)
Medication: Normally use traditional Chinese medicine; long treatment cycle; unclear mechanisms; less effects, only used for short-period hearing loss.
Operation: Not recommended. Less effects; high risk; high cost; potential to cause sequela.
Thus, we started to think that we can use genetic methods to change mini-structures on ear cells to see whether there may be effects expected to shade light on several kinds of hearing problems in future.
Objectives
Our Human Practice plan set out 3 central objectives:
Improve awareness and understanding of Hearing loss
We educated people with synthetic biology concepts in a multi-dimensional manner. We are well aware of that education is the only way for us to try to change the life for children living in hunger and poverty. We taught pupils and middle school students in rural areas about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. We hope our teaser of the world well beyond the boundaries of China may give them the power and vision to fight for a better life.
Our team member Zhenming Yu is teaching synthetic biology and iGEM to students in Liangshan, Sichuan.
We also gave lectures to high school students attending Summer Camp in SUSTech.
Investigate social reality of Hearing loss
After learning from many specialists, we designed and distributed questionnaires and booklets for investigation, spread, science popularization and call on awareness, which addressed the importance of our project.
More importantly, we tried to organize commonweal activities and cooperate with accessibility smartphone app developers to further improve our human practice.
Our collaboration with the developers of the accessibility app ""Deaflife""
Increase our own social reach and personal values
By organizing our Human Practice activities, we harvested new knowledge, which played crucial roles in improving ourselves as well as our project. Furthermore, we spare no effort enhancing the social awareness on the caring of people with hearing loss from different aspects. We hope that we can"

This subgroup took over the most of the molecular biology experiments including: interlab, parts production and experimental verification of the first plasmid. We have separately verified each part of the final pathway and obtained convincing results. Moreover, we have additionally built and validated the pathways for biosafety.

I.Light control system
We have done the experiments to examine the function of our light control system. Our light control system aims to switch between expression states to express different proteins according to different lights. There are two components: light-controlled promoter and a Not Gate. Firstly, we will show the light controlled promoter works and then add a Not Gate to prove that the whole pathway can work.
1.Light-controlled promoter —CcaS/R system+PcpcG
Since our light controlled promoter PcpcG is regulated by CcaR ,which can be phosphorylated by CcaS, and CcaS is the protein that can sense the light(activated by green light and ceased by red light)[1]. We must express this two proteins before use the PcpcG promoter. To test this system, we use GFP as indicator.
Firstly, we transformed four plasmids to E.coli and added IPTG to induce the expression of  the CcaS and CcaR. Then, we examined the GFP expression.

Population Dynamics
Introduction
The fact that in our project we are removing members of the bacterial population, making them sporulate, but not germinate again, will clearly effect the population dynamics of the growth of B. subtilis in a competitive environment such as the soil
We needed to make sure that we do not kill off our entire population.
Thus we required a method to be able to tune our system, so that we can have a large enough percentage of metal sequestering spores to make a positive environmental impact, but also a small enough percentage, so that the population will continue to live and grow.
To achieve his aim, we needed to tinker with the delicate balance that Bacillus normal maintains between its differentiation states of spores and vegetative cells.
Novelty in this sub-project
The novel part of this sub-project is to model the dynamics of a bacterial population, on the cellular level, as well as integrating this agent based model with biochemical models. Furthermore our simulation is able to run on distributed systems, making use of a large number of computers at once.
Modelling
See Population Modelling
This section of the project is a model simulation, which describes a high level working of our complete system. It also includes detail from other models, as it uses these in its decision making processes. The model has been developed in the Java programming language, but also uses other technologies including running CellML models.
Other Presentations and Diagrams
For the population simulation we will be looking at a simplified model of a bacteria's life cycle.
A simplified normal life cycle may be:
Whereas our modified life cycle would have an additional state, where some spores cannot germinate. Notice that cells can enter the Metal Spore stage, but not exit it:

Scientific Talks
We were able to attract speakers from the world’s most renowned universities. These leading researchers are shaping the field of synthetic biology. Learning about their latest findings allowed teams to incorporate new ideas into their iGEM projects. The lectures covered topics such as biophysics, medical imaging, structural biology and biosensors. Most speakers stayed at the Meetup location for fruitful discussions with the attendees after their lecture.

Research in the Hecht group focuses in two areas: synthetic biology and Alzheimer's disease. Although these fields may seem quite different, they explore two facets of the same problem. Synthetic biology requires an ability to devise novel proteins, which ultimately comes down to designing amino acid sequences that fold into a specific 3-dimensional structure. Conversely, probing the molecular underpinnings of Alzheimer’s disease requires an understanding of why proteins fail to fold properly and aggregate.

Scope statement
The scope statement is divided in two main chapters: the project presentation and the project requirements. In that entrepreneurship part, our goals are:
to define clearly the context, the purpose and the organization of the project,
to describe all the functional and technical specifications that our product must meet.
Once all that points mentioned, the reflection about the design of the product can begin.
Chapter 1 - Project presentation
Context
Cholera is a diarrhea-causing-disease that has affected the entire world through many epidemics throughout history. Today it still strikes developing countries, war-torn countries or those affected by natural disasters. It is contracted after ingestion of water contaminated with the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The main cause of a cholera epidemic is the lack of drinking water and sanitation resources in affected countries. According to the WHO, between 1.3 and 4 million cases are reported worldwide each year and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths.
Rehydratation is a very efficient treatment to cure the patients, however some people can not get this treatment early enough because they live in remote areas or can not have access to drinkable water. Thus a solution to treat water in these areas has to be found. Current preventive solutions (sterilizing filtration, water treatment by chlorination, etc.) are expensive or difficult to set up.
Purpose of the project
Our team wants to make a new system of detection and purification of water contaminated with the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae. This device will consist of two elements:
A sensor to detect the presence of V. cholerae in water consisting in engineered Vibrio harveyi.
An effector to secrete a cocktail of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) consisting in engineered Pichia pastoris. In Nature, these AMPs are successfully used by the crocodile immune system against bacteria. The peptides used in our system have a broad spectrum of action and are particularly effective against V. cholerae.

The assembly plan of the Sensing system.
Background
Communication using quorum sensing
Quorum sensing (QS) is the communication tool of bacteria. It is usually done through secretion and detection of small signal molecules or proteins. Depending on the bacterial density, these molecules can trigger a change of behaviour, i.e. invoke a function only when there are enough bacteria present in that one area. Quorum sensing can control several things, from biofilm formation to bioluminescence. The most commonly known and most explored QS system is the Lux system, which was originally isolated from Vibrio fischeri, where it controls the production of luciferase, an enzyme that aids in the production of a yellow light.
Using the pathogens own quorum sensing system to detect and track its source
When we decided that we wanted to fight pathogens it became obvious that we needed a way to detect and track them. After doing some research, we decided that this could be  done by hijacking the pathogen’s own quorum sensing. Naturally, the first thought that came to our minds was to use the Lux system from V. fischeri. However, this had been done before in 2008 by Heidelberg and it also did not provide the specificity that we wanted for our system. We decided to dig deeper and see if we could find a more unique quorum sensing system. Among some potential candidates was Yersinia enterocolitica, which uses a quorum sensing system called the Yen system.
The Yen system
As it turns out Y. enterocolitica has a homologous quorum sensing system to the famous Lux system, the Yen system. From this system we chose to steal two parts. A recognition region, the yenbox, fused together with a promoter and an activator, YenR, that can recognise and interact with the yenbox. When YenR binds to the yenbox it induces the expression level of the promoter fused to the yenbox. Later, in the presence of Y. enterocolitica, its signaling molecules, 3-oxo-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (OHHL), will start flowing into our system, interacting with YenR. When binding occurs between OHHL and YenR, YenR will lose its active shape and thereby its ability to interact with the yenbox. The induction will then be lost and the expression level will return to its base level. [1]

And at the end of the talking with Professor Zhou, she jokingly invited us to join her research team about gene technology legislation after we finish our competition in MIT, and actually she really need some people to help her in biology knowledge. May be one day will do something real in advocating legal change in gene technology with support from Mrs Zhou for her outstanding experiment in Guangdong Higher People's Court being a judge.
D. Critical Thinking about Law Related to Gene Technology
Huang Jun, professor of Sun Yat-sen University, led a project team to modify Human embryonic genes to treat β thalassanemia disease by Crispr-Cas9 Technology, which maybe be used to eliminate genetic diseases in the future vastly. In theory, it can also be used to change the color of eyes or intellect etc, and ensure these changes can be passed on to further generations.
What was beyond expectation is that this paper caused enormous ethical issues on a global scale. Many China’s biologists give strong support for it, while it also strongly criticized by many foreign biologists who call for banning the research of editing the human embryonic genes especially in those countries had lax regulation in law.
Prof. Rao Yi, a former dean of the Life Sciences School at Peking University, said that Chinese scientific research needs a more effective ethical regulation urgently. He said that “The more you have in technology, the more we are exposed in danger.” The idea of Chinese researchers is “We correct the mistake after doing the wrong things. But it maybe ignores the process of conceptual discussion.”
Human rights of unborn baby
Image there is a couple doomed to give birth to a baby with a genetic defect due to their genotype and after having gene detecting they decide to edit their embryo so as to have their own healthy baby.
And now here comes the question, should we ignore the embryo’s rights and interests if we fail to edit its gene? Well in many counties embryo is not recognized as people and it’s legal to perform abortion operation so you may be thinking that we can make it legal to perform gene editing in embryo. There is not standard answer for this question since you may come from different countries and have different culture background. But currently we regard it inhuman to do experiment in normal embryo and that is why Doctor Huang in Sun yat-set University choose the embryo with 21-trisomy.
Let’s think about another condition and question. Image the couple find that their"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," extra awareness. This confirms the problem of resistance and proving how actual the problem is.
One of the main issues there was with our product, according to Laura Jakobsen, was the absorption capacity of the silk. Burn wounds have a tendency to leak a lot the first few days after the incident. This is an important aspect we should look into if our Bacto-Aid should be used for treating burns. Despite this current limitation of our product, she did see a potential for it as a bandage applied after lymph node removal surgery in the inguinal region. It is a particularly problematic healing region due to the constant pressure it is undergoing (a patient has to sit) and due to the serum accumulation. Serum tapping is an important aftercare that has to be done regularly. It consists of removing the serum produced in the limb, which lymph nodes typically would transport away, manually. It is therefore a highway to infections in this region due to the missing lymph nodes (which also is a center for the immune system), regularly breaching of the skin (barrier to foreign bacteria), and it is a moist area where many types of bacteria from the normal flora of the skin are resident. Bacto-Aid could create a barrier that has antimicrobial effect and thus protecting vulnerable patients from any further complications.
Interviewing Hans Jørn Kolmos
Hans Jørn Kolmos is a professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark. He is an expert in the history of the use of antibiotics and he is familiar with the status of the resistance problem. We had a great talk , where he told us that the media have a tendency to worsen the situation. The Danish documentary “Når penicillin ikke virker"" translated to: ""When Penicillin does not work” shows the problem in a realistic perspective. We talked about how to tackle the problem and he said: “Nature is smart. Humans have only been here for a few millenniums and microorganisms have been here for billions of years. It would be foolish to believe that we could outsmart nature in a 100 years”. He also said: “we could limit the distribution of antibiotics by following these three steps 1) isolate the potential bacteria 2) ask the question: is the isolated bacteria the reason to the infection or is it something else? 3)  evaluate whether antibiotics can be used against the infection”. As a future plan, or a perspective for our project, he said that the bacteriocins could be used as a local treatment. The ones we have researched, could probably be integrated in an oint"

Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Grna testing system_-_-_TEXT.html," a high cost, not affordable for everyone.
Digestion with T7 endonuclease: this strategy is similar to the restriction enzymes one, yet it uses the T7 endonuclease. This endonuclease cuts where it finds heterodimers. When Cas9 cuts, due to the non-homologous end joining DNA repair mechanism - NHEJ -, plant cells introduce indels. After a PCR amplification of the region, heterodimers can be obtained from a denaturation and reannealing step. When they are annealed, they might bind with a strand which is not exactly complementary, producing heterodimers that T7 can cut. Therefore, in an electrophoresis gel, a high molecular weight band will be observed if there is not a cut, while, two shorter bands will appear if T7 endonuclease cuts and so, Cas9 is well working.
Problem: the T7 endonuclease is outrageously expensive. Buying it may imply even a higher cost, not affordable for everyone.
In order to provide an efficient solution to the drawbacks explained above, we have engineered a gRNA Testing System. In this strategy, we use Nicotiana benthamiana due to its fast growth and all the benefits provided by a model plant. Our methodology is based in the GoldenBraid Assembly System, that allows us to get a modular and standard system, two of the mainstays of Synthetic Biology field.
OUR DEVICE
The fragment of genome that we are going to target in our plant is inserted in the Testing System following the concept of modularity. Based on Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection and using a reporter gene in our device, we will be able to know how efficient the provided/designed gRNA is.
This is a simple caption.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet adipiscium elit.
First of all, plant breeders have to carry out a genomic DNA extraction of the plant they want to modify. Next, they need to amplify the region they are going to target. The targets needed to this amplification are provided by our Data Processing Software. The amplified target sequence is introduced in N. benthamiana as part of the device with the luciferase reporter.
This device is introduced in the plant along with the corresponding gRNA and Cas9 construction. If the gRNA works on the desired variety, we will be able to detect it easily with a luciferase assay.
Our system is designed to allow the detection of luminescence. Thus, a luciferase assay is used to study gene expression rates, since it is fast and"

Cultures were grown from the resulting colonies and screened for biobrick parts with the standard VF and VR primer combination. The amplicons were electrophoresed and the size of fragments were referenced to the expected sizes of the fragments for the respective parts.

Sequencing Parts
The parts were sequenced in the pSB plasmids to confirm their integrity by Sanger method using the sequencing facility at The University of Pretoria. The reactions were set up using BigDye 3.1, its buffer and 150 ng of the respective plasmids as template. Forward and reverse reactions were run using VF and VR primers. Unfortunately when analysing the sequence data it was found that the Cre generator (BBa_K1768004) construct contained two significant mutations in the coding region of the construct. The seven bp deletion causes frame shirt and would render the recombinase protein deactivated. The other gBlock fragment sequences were correct with no mutations.
Figure 4. Chromatogram showing the two deletions in the Cre construct from two different sequenced constructs.
Due to time constraints the project will regrettably be completed after the jamboree. The original synthesised gBlock for the Cre recombinase will be re-cloned to create a functional plasmid set for the characterisation of the various switches proposed.
Future
In order to assess that the excision switch and inverter constructs function as expected an experiment will be conducted where the Cre protein expression is activated and thus characterise the behaviour of the biobricks.
E. coli colonies containing both the Cre protein and the Recombination switch plasmids will be selected. The respective vectors contain Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin resistant genes and will be cultured under these selective agents in LB media. A series of 5 aliquots of the culture during log phase growth will be induced. These will each containing a different concentration of IPTG (0.1-1.0 mM). The presence of IPTG activates Cre expression through pLac promoter, which in turn leads to recombination. The expected result of recombination will be the expression of RFP.

Lactobacillus
Our goal was to create a genetically modified Lactobacillus with the ability to secrete the protein p1025. This task would provide the opportunity to contribute the first Lactobacillus parts and devices to the registry, and expand the scope of our iGEM into lactic acid bacteria, which could have numerous applications in health and food technology. This, however, provided many challenges due to our unfamiliarity with this bacteria and a lack of standardized protocols that we enjoy with other laboratory bacteria.
Expression System
First, we had to design an expression system for the secretion of p1025 in Lactobacillus. This included building a signal sequence and promoter for Lactobacillus bacteria, parts which were not in the registry yet and nobody had any experience with. By fusing these parts with the coding region for p1025 we planned to create a viable expression system.
The signal sequence is a short signal sequence recognized as a secretion tag by several Lactobacillus strains. Our signal sequence was isolated from the 5' end of the prtB gene in Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which codes for a lactose digesting protein that is bound to the surface (Germond JE et al.; Appl Environ Microbiol. 2003). As the attached protein is being secreted, the signal peptide is cut off. Using a cleavage predictor, we extended the protein in order to prevent the cleavage of our p1025 peptide. This part was constructed to use the modified Silver BioBrick prefix and suffix to allow for protein construction.
The promoter was constructed by isolating the genomic DNA of Lactobacillus and amplifying a native lacS promoter from the genome. The ~200 bp promoter device includes the ribosome binding site, since the part we amplified was from the start of the promoter to the beginning of the coding region. This part uses the standard Biobrick prefix and"

we bumped up to 16 uL/min (Lewis paper recommendation)
this 12.8% w/v dope is not concentrated enough to spin
a fiber would come out, but it's too fragile to pull over to the godet
So now, we're left with ~2 mL of 14% w/v silk

Lastly, the reaction volume was completed to 50 mL by adding 20 mL distilled water (pH = 9).
For the actual generation of the d-AuNPs the flask was then incubated at 50 °C, covered in aluminium foil with continuous shaking for 3 to 8 hours. After 3 to 8 hours shaking, a reddish colour was observed on the solution that is characteristic for the correct size nanoparticle formation. The solution was observed every 30 minutes to check for red color formation.
Transmission Electron Microscope analysis was performed to check the size and size distribution of the d-AuNPs. the suspension of d-AuNPs in distilled water (ratio 1:4) and sonicate it for 5 min. Then, after plasma treatment this solution was be transferred to a copper grid for imaging. The correct size of the d-AuNPs be in the order of 10 nm.
We observed d-AuNPs in a relatively low concentration. The size distribution is ranging from 8 nm to 13 nm, which is sufficient for d-AuNPs analysis for prescreening.

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt
The newly generated d-AuNPs are tested for their stability under different salt concentrations. 20 µL of the d-AuNPs solution, 20 µL MilliQ and 20 µL NaCl solutions (range from 0 mM to 2000 mM) were added in one of the 96 wells on the 92 wells plate. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The plate view is shown.
The aggregation of d-AuNPs occured at a final NaCl concentration of 100 mM. In comparison with the old d-AuNPs batch, they aggregate at a lower salt concentration indicating that they are less stable. This observation can be explained by the time that the gold nanoparticles were in solution. During the generation, dextrin solution was added. The incubation time was approximately 8 hours and in this time the gold nanoparticles were capped by dextrin. The dextin makes the gold nanoparticles more stable. However, when the gold nanoparticles stay in the solution for a longer time, the remaining dextrin can adhere to the gold nanoparticles, making them more stable.

Design of the system
To memorize a dynamic changing process of one signal or serial signals(Fig.1), we have proposed an idea of constructing a unique memory device with sequential memory structure, called MemOrderY, to record one changing signal in multiple time periods. Besides the signal we want to record, the Target signal, a Clock signal with the manner of oscillation is brought into the system to provide the circuit with the information about time. And we have chosen serine integrases to build the main parts due to their diversity, orthogonality between each other and high efficiency. Here, we are going to illustrate how we design the simplest version of this memory device, the two-signal system, which records one changing signal in two time periods.
Figure 1 | The overview of the input and output. A serial signal shown as blue lines is recorded in different time periods shown in light grey, obtaining the corresponding data. Two-signal system can only record in the first two grey blocks.
Overview of the whole circuit
As you can find in Fig.2, the whole circuit of two-signal system is made up of three parts: logic gates, sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules. Logic gates are where the signals from Target and Clock signals are processed. And sequential memory structures control the whole memory schedule, being the core part of this project. Integrases labeled with numbers belong to this part while those labeled with English letters belong to next part, basic orthogonal memory modules. IntA and IntB are true executors of signal memorizing, and designed to record the signal in early and late time period respectively.
Figure 2 | The overview of the circuit design. Each integrase and its related attB/P sites are shown in the same color. TF, Transcriptional facters; Int, Integrases; C, Clock; T, Target.
Notice:
You may be confused with what we have said in the description and above about the usage of serine integrases. In fact, in this project, serine integrases are not only used as memory devices based on DNA level in basic orthogonal memory modules, but also used to build the sequential memory structures which control the memor"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Description Alkl_-_-_TEXT.html,". It is hoped that once the alkane can ultimately enter β-oxidation, it will subsequently enter the TCA cycle by the cell’s natural processes so that it can serve as a carbon source for Shewanella to generate electricity. However, some of the aforementioned proteins are actually made from subunit peptides. Therefore, to enable such a metabolic pathway, theoretically a total of 9 genes are necessary. The genes AssA1, AssB1, AssC1, AssD1 code for subunits that form alkylsuccinate synthase, assisted by AssE1 that encodes for a chaperone-like protein. AssK1 encodes for CoA transferase. McmSS and McmLS code for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. And finally, Dalk_1740 codes for Carboxyl Transferase. The original plan was to transform all of them into Shewanella but the complexity of the genes posed a major challenge, one which we intend to solve next year.
Therefore, by engineering AlkL and the alkane metabolic pathway into Shewanella, we hope it provides a bridge between PE degradation and exo-electrogenicity.

AAR reduces cellular fatty acyl-ACP from bacterial fatty acid via into fatty aldehydes. ADC then removes the carbonyl group on the fatty aldehyde, resulting in an odd number alkane chain one carbon shorter than the original Acyl-ACP fatty acid. In turn, both of the enzymes convert fatty acids into an odd number alkane by means of a constitutive protein expression plasmid.
Click here to read our submission on the Parts Registry experience page for the characterization of the Petrobrick.
Experimental Design of Characterization
It was noted that the alkane production is enhanced when growing expression strains using the optimized growth conditions developed by the 2011 University of Washington team, so we followed the protocol to the best of our ability. After analyzing their results, we decided to reproduce the experiment specifically to test for the production of C15 alkanes, which were the most abundant.  In order to do so, four samples of empty E. coli cells grown in TB media were injected with known concentrations of C15 alkanes (obtained from Sigma-Aldrich).
They were used as control samples with the corresponding concentrations: 1 mg/L, 10 mg/L, 50 mg/mL, and 100 mg/L. After injecting the cells with the known C15 alkanes, the cells were then incubated for 48 hours in M9-Glucose media to ensure nothing else changed in the development of the control samples. After incubation, Ethyl Acetate was used to extract 200 uL of the alkane samples to be analyzed with GCMS. Gas-Chromotography Mass-Spectometry (GCMS) was used to create a standard curve of the four known concentration and their corresponding peak areas.  For the actual samples, the Petrobrick-transformed dh5a E. coli cells were grown in TB overnight. After growth, the cells were spun down and re-suspended in M9-Glucose media for 48 hours. Ethyl Acetate was used to extract the produced alkanes. 200 uL of each of the samples were used for GCMS analysis.

To elute the DNA, 50-100 μl of buffer EB was added to the center of the rotary column CP3 for 2 minutes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (~ 13,400 × g) for 2 minutes. Note: If the volume of the elution buffer is less than 50ul, the recovery efficiency may be affected. The pH of the elution buffer has a certain effect on the eluate; buffer EB or distilled water (pH 7.0-8.5) suggests elution of plasmid DNA. For long-term preservation of DNA, it is recommended to elute in buffer EB and store at -20 °C because the DNA stored in water undergo acid hydrolysis. Step 11 is repeated to improve the efficiency of the recovery of the plasmid.
9. Transformation of Lactococcus lactis
    1)  Preparation of the cells:
         Day 1: Inoculate 5 ml of G/L-SGM17B medium with L. lactis glycerol stock from -80 ℃ and grow at 30 ℃,
without aeration, overnight.
         Day 2: Inoculate 50 ml of G/L-SGM17B with pre-culture in a dilution of 1:100 and grow at 30 ℃, without
aeration, overnight.
         Day 3:
- Add 50 ml full-grown culture to 400 ml of G/L-SGM17B medium.
- Grow the culture until OD600 is 0.2-0.3 (ca. 3 h).
- Spin down cells for 20 min at 6000 x g, 4 ℃.
- Wash cells with 400 ml of 0.5 M sucrose, 10% glycerol (4 ℃) and spin down at 6000 x g (centrifugation speed may need to be increased during successive washing steps).

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Bioelectric-Interface#Discussion_-_-_TEXT.html,"-based biosensor. We have obtained encouraging results, where transformed cells show faster voltage change compared to controls, showing a good potential for our system to serve as a reliable bio-detector generating data which would be easy to obtain and link to a computer system. With its potential for automation and miniaturisation, this system offers a potential advancement in the field of biosensors. We are intending to further test this idea by using cells with arsenic promoter linked to the sucrose hydrolase gene. In such a system, detection of arsenic would induce expression of sucrose hydrolase, necessary for the growth of E. coli K-12 in media containing sucrose as the sole carbon source.
Conclusions:
We managed to obtain, BioBrick and submit the napC, cymA, ccm and mtrA genes
We have tested ccm, cymA and napC using haem staining procedure and obtained positive results
We have mutagenised the internal PstI side in mtrA
We had some success in cloning the mtrCAB and S. oneidensis ccm genes which may enhance the efficiency of the system
We would like to clone these genes into the pSB1C3 vector to create a functional BioBrick ( BBa_K917007 ). However, the longer products (mtrCAB and ccm genes) seem to be more problematic to clone, with the digestion/ligation step being the limiting factor, despite using several alternative techniques (A-tailing with Taq and TA cloning, fusion PCR).

Biosensor Design
A handy tool for everyone
The term ""biosensor"" is widely used for sensors that are based on biological sensing elements. With these, the targeted detection of specific substances (referred to as analytes) is possible. Biosensors have the potential to be used for a wide range of analytical purposes ( Turner 2013 ). Furthermore, they can be cheaper, more sensitive and more specific than conventional detection methods like chemical sensors ( Kaur et al. 2015 ). Consequently, biosensors are a field of active research and especially popular in the iGEM competition ( Choffnes et al. 2011 ). Teams tried to use various different approach for implementing biosensors against toxic agents, hazardous chemicals, drugs, diseases and environmentally dangerous chemicals.
However, some issues remain: As great as the potentials of biosensors are, the hurdle of field applicability has in most cases not been overcome. This is because most biosensors make use of living, genetically modified microorganisms (GMOs) ( Daunert et al. 2000 , Lei et al. 2006 ).  The application of these whole-cell biosensors is often not possible due to legal issues and safety concerns, as it must be prevented that genetically modified organisms are released into the environment. Moreover, these sensors are often not very user-friendly, as they have a limited shelf life and their application outside the laboratory is complicated and requires special equipment. Another disadvantage of using living cells as a biosensor is that the diffusion"

Introduction, Sharing and Discussion
Presentation for High School Summer Camp
   During the summer vacation, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University held a Summer Camp for high school
students in China, introducing biology related researches and activities to them. SYSU-Software also grasped this op-
portunity and attended to this camp, presenting an one-hour introduction about synthetic biology and iGEM competi-
tion to them.
   Considering what they have learnt in senior high school, we organized our presentation as a small lecture, from
DNA, RNA sequence and genetic engineering to the principles and target strata in synthetic biology. Our presentation
explained three main factors that led to success in synthetic biology: standardization, decoupling and abstraction. We
emphasized the importance of standardization, which enabled the biologists to create circuits having specific functions
with “Bio-bricks” like building constructions with bricks. This principle was also most familiar with these students be-
cause they had learnt something about genetic biology, and noticed the deficiencies in digested operation if restriction.
sites unspecific between gene parts. Although the other two principles, decoupling and abstraction, was hard to image
their roles in synthetic biology for these students, we believed their main idea would help students when they had to
face some complex problems in the future.
   We also introduced the target strata in synthetic biology, including sequence, part, device and system. From se-
quence to higher stratum, we thoroughly explained how a intact synthetic system form, and mentioned standardization
again. At last, we presented a brief introduction on iGEM competition, including its history, tracks and awards. We also
introduced the software track and what we have done in this track.
   After the presentation, many students showed their interests in synthetic biology and iGEM. One of them even said
that he was excited because he had played LEGO for years but had never imaged functions in creatures can be built
like the toy bricks, and he wanted to know more about synthetic biology and iGEM.
Mini lecture to 2016 freshmen
   We presented a mini lecture for 2016 freshmen shortly after the start of the new semester, in which we introduced
iGEM competition, synthetic biology, our team project as well as our Human Practice activities, especially the game
Genexplorer. We exemplified GFP to illustrate four basic elements in synthetic biology and how they work in real bac-
terium.

Georgia_State,2017,Team:Georgia State#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"bird–horseshoe crab egg interaction. Eleven species, such as the more familiar red knot(featured to the right) and the dowitcher, rely on horseshoe crab eggs for sustenance during their migration along the Atlantic Flyway (Castro and Myers 1993). Migrating birds require an estimated 539 metric tons of eggs to full the trip to the Arctic summer range(Castro and Myers 1993). To bring this into better perspective let's  consider the aforementioned red knot species.The red knot species depends so heavily on the abundance of horseshoe crab eggs that with this species depletion this bird over the last 20 years has seen a population decline from over 100,000 to less than 15,000.  Thus, the red knot is now a species nominated for protection under the Endangered Species Act. Horseshoe crabs are therefore a critical species. The horseshoe crab links an array of prey (bivalves and polychaete worms) and predators (fish, turtles, and birds), utilizing both autochthonous and allochthonous production from pelagic and benthic food webs (figure 2; Carmichael et al. 2004).

Commercial Fishing
The best bait to attract eel and whelk, best known as conch, is horseshoe crabs(Jay Odell, 2005). During the 1990s, the harvest of the horseshoe crab increased coastwide, with a peak of nearly six million pounds in 1997(Jay Odell, "

The interviewed experts endorsed our project and explained that PHAs represent an innovating example of the delivery of sustainable products through cutting edge technology. They suggested the group to focus on the properties, design and potential applications of PHAs instead of tackling the production price. Furthermore, they emphasised the manufacturing challenges of producing PHAs, which are the major hurdle preventing their wide scale adoption: the scalability.

Assessing Feedstock and Downstream Processing
It was also discussed the topic relating to the present obstacles in bioplastic production, according to them feedstock resources and downstream processing are the key problems that must be addressed immediately. Feedstock is an environmentally sustainable way to sequester carbon source. Additionally, the interviews added the attractiveness of using underutilised products from industries as raw materials, because they are more budget friendly since they are usually under-priced, however, it needs to be built on an effective logistics strategy in terms of the usage as well as the consistency of the components in the by-product itself. The downstream processing is one of the biggest bottlenecks in the process, for this reason having a method for delivering the bioplastic without the necessity of disrupting the cells would increase the efficiency of the overall production and potentially can lead to the implementation of continuous-batch fermentation which could run for more hours and the carbon source and the product can be simultaneously added and removed, respectively.
Implementation and Impacts in our project
First, the use of whisky by-products as raw material is supported by the consistency of their elements. Second, the logistics of using them can be more achievable as they are the product of a local industry. The in-situ secretion system constitutes a potential method for reducing the use of hazardous chemicals in the process hence reduces the environmental impact of the PHBV production. Moreover, the potential use of continuous-batch fermentation can contribute to the overall efficiency of the manufacture. The cost of the bioplastic production is not the most important factor, due to the necessity of shift from oil to bio-based raw material. We took their advice of looking more into the properties and we decided to only focus on PHBV production because PHBV is a PHA copolymer with a larger thermal processing window, thus less brittle than PHB.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in i"

These results only signify improvements from the last set of minipreps for parts E0110, E0130, C0132, pRS306, and Z0842.  Clearly overestimated the amount of DNA and used too much liquid for elution.  This overestimation could have stemmed from the fact that 1-1.5 mL of each culture was used for making glycerol stocks, thus reducing the number of cells going into the miniprep.  However, one should note that there were rather sizable pellets after centrifuging the overnight cultures.  Thus, it is possible that, due to the 18 hours in the incubator, many of the cells may have been dead when the miniprep began, which could have played a role in lower-than-anticipated yields.
Realized that P0501 and P0560 had been forgotten in this second round of minipreps, as no cultures of these two parts were made.

We were able to get the oxidation and reduction peaks AND beutiful cyclic voltamitry curves. She also suggested that we should try to use grow cells in the plates as a way to get rid of the oxygen, we can try later.   Sadly, PCR did not work again for RFP TetR so we need to redo it. (T_T)

Alberto is stil sick. Thomas flight from Austria has been delayed. GG did not work, again...
Wednesday
Today we arrived quite late in the lab to be honest. Alberto and Thomas are back.  Josh and Alberto designed a new plate reader layout and experiements to characterise the constructs. Lidia met Marko to discuss about the BASIC protocols and designed protocols for the promoter library characterization. Perhaps we can use the DNA Foundry to combinatorially characterise the library, very automated and high-throughput! At 5 p.m. meeting with Tom. T.O. on the plate reader results:  ""Good evidence that sulfite is causing reduction of pyocyanin in solution, if you have enough of it"".  But what is it then that causes the ring of death around the electrodes ? Also it's time to start assembling the biocontainment construct. Regardind the agar experiments, we need a way to quantify the oxidation/reduction level of Pyo locally around the electrodes. Can we measure the absorbance of a plate directly ? Josh argues the there would be too many refractive interfaces messing up with the measurements.
Thursday
Wet Lab: We have the results from the spotting plate experiments. The cyclic voltammetry showed a peak for sulfite. Therefore it is likely that the bacteria are implicated in the redox process. Josh argues that ""this is a ferrocyanide-driven, pyocyanin-mediated redox reaction"". The amplification of the iLOV gene is not working. Amplification of the backbone is working at specific temperatures but it varies everytime we run it. We need to try it again tomorrow. Alberto set-up the plate reader experiment measuring oxidation of Pyo over time, in solution with FCN(R) and sodium sulfite. Dry Lab: Danny gave us some gold electrodes. The modeling guys finished the PCB circuit. Also we can use AgCl to link the PCB to the circuit. Also a lot more maths and a lot more of learning maths to"

Background
Our synthetic pathway produces Hydrogen. Our chassis fixes Nitrogen, which is influenced by Hydrogen availability. Therefore, we were keenly interested in finding out how our synthetic pathway would interact with the host metabolism. After some exploratory consultation, we determined Flux Balance Analysis was an effective tool for this.

Introduction
Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) can serve to explore the fluxes of a given metabolic reconstruction. In this case, we wanted to determine the level and extent of interaction of our added pathway with the core metabolism. Since our chassis, Rhizobium etli, has two ""flavors"" (free living organism & plant symbiont), we were curious as to weather our transgenic system would remain functional under symbiont form. Moreover, since a key aspect of the project was Nitrogen fixation, we wanted to ensure said pathway was as functional as it could be. And on top of that, we have to remind ourselves that our chassis is a symbiont to the photosynthetic plant Phaseolus vulgaris (the common bean), which maintains the niche in exchange for nitrous compounds.
In other wording, our chassis looks like this:
Nice, right? He have the carbon sources in green, the nitrogen compounds in cyan, the hydrogen species in blue, and our pathway in red.
Furthermore, key researchers at our University warned us against the project due to the widespread presence of endogenous hydrogenases (the word ""impossible"" was often"

Background
The diagnostic tools currently employed to detect fungal pathogens:
The diagnostic methods employed to diagnose fungal infections at present vary in performance as each type of pathogen has a greater proclivity for being detected by some tests than others. However, microscopy has always been the mainstay as far as diagnosis of fungal infections is concerned. We look forward to improve the diagnostic capabilities of conventional microscopy by enhancing specificity and visibility through the application molecular biology.The following table was compiled from Fungal Infection Thrust .

Detection by Polymerase Chain Reaction
The table above denotes a summary of the techniques used at present to detect the leading fungal pathogens in world. Note that the column titled ""DNA detection"" is a  term that mainly involves the use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)to detect pathogens. Although it is touted as a reliable technique, it has several disadvantages such as high cost, requirement of laboratory settings of high standards and false positives due to detection of pathogenic DNA EVEN AFTER"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Practices#DualUse_-_-_TEXT.html," fruitful internal team and external discussions with experts on this topic. We further initiated a discussion about the importance of the issue with our team advisors and instructor. This discussion can initiate the education of following teams. We propose the implementation of definitions and risk assessments in the iGEM safety page to improve the awareness and education of future generations of iGEM teams.
Safe experimental design
While the ingredient is legally available without restrictions in Germany, we still handled it as potentially dangerous substance. We deposited it in a locked poison storage with limited access. Documentation of the usage of the substance was initiated. All participating coworkers were informed about the potential risk of the substance. We discussed the handling with our team advisors and supervisor.
Regular oversight
In our weekly team meeting the upcoming publication of the substance and details about our sensor were discussed in hindsight to potential dual use risk. Experts were contacted, such as the ethics committee at our university, the iGEM safety committee itself and of course our supervisor. Regular oversight by an institution is not yet established.
Minimizing potential risk
We found restriction of publication in this case not to be effective to minimize the risk, since we do not provide the knowledge of how to obtain or synthesize the ingredients of the date rape drugs. Said information are obtainable astonishingly easily, therefore our call for awareness and providence of knowledge to create a biosensor contains more benevolent content than potential risk.
Documentation and communication
We documented not only the use of the chemical, but also our concerns about biosecurity issues. We contacted the ethics council of our university that unfortunately is not yet established for biotechnological research. The interview is available in our report. We further contacted the iGEM safety committee for advice on publication. Mrs. Kelly Drinkwater, member of the iGEM safety committee, agreed on our proposed publication.
“I looked up GHB and GBL on Wikipedia and it's very easy to find information about these two molecules, including the fact that one is a precursor of the other, and even some scientific references about how to synthesize them. Because this level of detail is freely available, I don't think the documentation of your project has any risk of facilitating the misuse of GHB for harmful ends. The level of detail you provide about these molecules is entirely appropriate. (Of course, you might have some commentary about the legal status of GBL compared to that of GHB. As you point out, it is a little odd that GHB is regulated so much more strongly than its precursor molecule.)”

Adaugo
Secretary
Hey there!                      My name is Adaugo. I mostly go by Ada because it is less of a mouthful and easier to pronounce. To introduce myself, I will give you a glimpse into my life because what better way to introduce myself? -Or maybe I just do not have any better ideas;). I am a Christian, and I am Nigerian. I study Chemical Engineering, and I like dancing, though my choreography is always out of sync. I like cooking good food, and I like eating it even more. The more people there are, the merrier. When cooking for myself, I mostly stick to pasta and rice- less hassle, or maybe I am just not very adventurous with food. Oh and by the way, I happen to be the secretary of this awesome iGEM team:).
Thijs
Lab rat
Hello, I am Thijs I study molecular biology and philosophy. I just finished my bachelor degree and next year I hope to start with my master in molecular biology. Since I got some extra time this summer and because I want to learn more about biomolecular research. I am part of the research group of our team and will help with the lab work.
Ivar
Designer
I studied Experimental Physics and Biology and gained my bachelor's in physics. Almost done with the Top-master program in Nanoscience, my interests have always been broad. I play badminton in my free time and I have my own company in game development. I like cheap tasty food that is quick to make but I will make a real effort for special occasions. iGEM sounded like fun so I figured I would join, which is the best way to make decisions in your life.

ETH_Zurich,2016,Team:ETH Zurich#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," are destroyed through inversion, Bxb1 mediated recombination acts as a one-way switch.
REPORTER AND-GATE:
The constitutive promoter, which is now placed upstream of the reporter protein GFP, is additionally under the control of another esaBox, the binding site of EsaR.
Now that the system has learned to respond to the associated stimulus, namely the AHL alone, the expression of GFP is induced whenever the stimulus, i.e. EsaR's ligand, is encountered again.
BIOLOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION: CRISPR/Cpf1
An alternative to a recombinase-based switch is the usage of the 2015 characterised CRISPR/Cpf1 system 14 . Instead of cutting both DNA strands at the same position, Cpf1 cuts the DNA with an offset of four or five nucleotides, thus producing single-stranded overhangs. It is suggested that this is advantageous for genome editing via non-homologous end-joining 15 .
Cpf1 is potentially capable of creating an AND-gate controlled one-way switch with finally the same functionality as the recombinase-based switch.
For this, a reporter construct needs to be stably integrated into the genome of E. coli whereas Cpf1 and its guide RNAs are expressed from a plasmid.
SENSOR AND-GATE:
At a site of inflammation, nitric oxide activates NorR and triggers the transcription of Cfp1. The transcription can only proceed if 3-OH-C6-HSL is present. The HSL makes the repressor EsaR dissociate from the regulatory element (esaBox) on the DNA and thus annihiliates its roadblock activity. The guide RNAs are expressed constitutively at a high level.
LEARNING:
Once Cfp1 is expressed, it is brought to the cleavage-sites by the two distinct guide RNAs. There, Cfp1 cuts out the mNectarine gene while creating sticky ends. These will then be ligated by endogeneous ligases via NHEJ which reconstitutes the GFP gene.
REPORTER AND-GATE:
In a final system, the gfp gene would be under the control of a constitutive promoter regulated by an esaBox, the binding site of EsaR.
After the system has now learned to respond to the associated stimulus alone, the expression of GFP could easily be induced by just exposing it to the stimulus again, e.g. EsaR's ligand.
BIOLOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION: CRISPR/Cas9

These students not only include students from local community, but also comprise of students from all around the nation visiting this prestige university.
Public engagement
1.Survey
i.Education background
We can have a clear view of the education background of the respondents: more than half of the respondents have an undergraduate degree and nearly forty percent of respondents have received above high school education. Respondents who have received good education have a better understanding of the significance of what our team are trying to achieve, so the data we collected from them can be convincing and usable. Moreover, it is meaningful that we have successfully drawn attention of these people to our project.
ii.Perspective on increasing green-house gases
Initially, more than eighty-five percent of people think human beings should not only facilitate the energy-saving and emission-reduction, but also figure out new method to accelerate the recycling rate of the carbon dioxide in the air. None of them choose the option that humans don’t need to do anything when facing the environmental problems cause by the excessive emission of carbon dioxide. This, has obviously indicated that people now have a clear understanding of the current situation that the constantly increasing carbon dioxide in the air lead to serious influence on environment. Sequential problems cannot be predicted, but it is quite unanimous that we need to take action to prevent some detrimental influences from emerging and to render more people to realize the necessity of finding a new way of solving the problem.
iii.Perspective on public’s effort on practicing low-carbon lifestyle
The proportion of respondents who choose the option “the public are lack of awareness” and the proportion of respondents who choose the second option “the public are in a transition period to the low-carbon lifestyle” are close, which reflects a contradiction that deserves attention from our team. Respondents clearly have different ideas on this question. The statistics indicate the current situation in China is that there are still many people lack of awareness, but most people are those who aware the importance of protecting the environment and the necessity of leading a low-carbon lifestyle and seldom take action to pursue the green lifestyle. It is optimistic to think we are on our way to the low-carbon life style. There is still a long way to go.’
iv.Trip mode
Thanks to the convenient and cost-effective public transportation, more than half of the respondents choose to use them in daily routine. It is even more pleasing to notice that more than eighty percent of the respondents choose the way that we like to called low-carbon. Although the truth is the number of private cars are still increasing, we can"

Gel separation and purification:
Each 50 uL sample received 10 uL of NEB 6x loading dye and was run on a 1% agarose gel alongside uncut plasmid and O’Generuler 1kb Plus (Thermofisher). The gel was analysed on a [name of gel machine] and the lines of linear plasmid were cut out and placed in premeasured 2 mL eppendorf micro centrifuge tubes and weighed again. Gel purification was completed with the QIAprep Gel Extraction Kit, following the protocol provided with the kit. The average concentration of the DNA from the gel purification was about 14 ng/uL, much less than wanted for the next step.
Gibson assembly:
5 uL gibson reaction were performed with 2.5 uL of gibson master mix and with rest having equimolar amounts of linear vector and gene. The reactions were placed in a 50 degree dry bath and left to react for 1 hour.
Transformation:
The 5 uL of DNA from the Gibson reactions were then loaded onto Millipore (type VSWP) drop dialysis film with 0.025 μm on ~40 uL of ultra-pure Milli-Q water for desalting over the course of one hour. 2 uL of dialyzed DNA along with 30 uL of electrocompetent BLR cells were transferred to Bio Rad 0.1 cm gap Gene Pulser cuvettes for electroporation and kept chilled. Electroporation was conducted with a Bio-Rad MicroPulser Electroporator set to pulse on the bacteria setting. After electroporation, the cells were immediately transferred to 200 L of TB and placed in a 37° incubator to recover for an hour. The cells were then added to LB agar plates with kanamycin and spread with ~10 sterile glass beads per plate. The beads were then dumped into 70% ethanol and the plates were allowed to dry in the incubator at 37 degrees for 30 minutes with the lid side up. The plates were then flipped lid side down and incubated at 37 degrees overnight.

Compared Hv1a with Hv1a-lectin, the remained leaves area in the Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a, which means the repellent efficiency of Hv1a-lectin is higher than that of Hv1a. It shows in figure5.
To use the p-value as an indicator of statistical significance, we compared Hv1a/Hv1a-lectin with the negative control; it shows that the remained leaf disk area of Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin are significantly different from negative control, shown in figure6.
To sum up, the Hv1a and Hv1a-lectin work well in vivo. The effect can be roughly ranked as:
Hv1a-lectin > Hv1a > E. coli > Negative control

During the review of the material, many students commented they were surprised by the urgency of this issue. They had never heard of the problem of modern antibiotic research before, which was a bit surprising to us.
The students got the chance to work out a new topic with high-level information in a short amount of time and had enough insight to engross in an intense and heated discussion. They summarized that the problem of antibiotic research is indeed an urgent matter and suggested that all involved parties had to start a better communication, be more open-minded and most important - invest more money to break down unnecessary barriers.
Figure 2: Brian giving a introduction about antibiotic research to participants of the 2017  “Jugend Forscht” science competition
Opening our team for a small group of highly interested people did not only inspire us to continue our engagement in educating people but also showed all participants how easy participation could be. Driven by this enthusiasm, we wanted to go to the next level and reach a broader mass of different people.
Reaching the broad mass
This year the University of Tübingen organized a special event called “Tübinger Fenster für Forschung”, an open international platform where young and experienced researchers can present their work to the public. We took this opportunity to present our team, our project and the iGEM initiative and to come into contact with people who were new to synthetic biology. We had a few fascinating conversations about genetic engineering in the lab and everyday life. Furthermore, people appeared to be very interested in our previous projects and our achievements over the last years.  Additionally, Michael Krummhaar presented the topic synthetic biology with his presentation called “Buy a Nokia - get an iPhone” on the science slam embodied in this event. The audience was astonished that genetic engineering is that easy and can be done by young students.
This event showed us that the public doesn’t know much about synthetic biology or genetic engineering and was surprised to hear how much can be done with these methods. Nevertheless, everyone we talked to was very interested and fascinated by our project. There should be more such events to make synthetic biology more popular and open the eyes of people who never deal with science in their daily life.
For this reason, we found ourselves interested in forming a long-term cooperation with “Jugendforschungzentrum Nagold"" (JFZ). This is a hub for students in the age from 12 to 19 getting the chance, the facilities and the support to discover and develop their fascination for science and technology.

LifeStraw:
When thinking about how we could package our E. coli, we came across LifeStraw UK. They make a plastic straw, designed with a filter inside that stops bacteria from getting through when you use it to drink water. We thought - by using this structure - we’d have a good way of storing our bacteria, as they could be placed in a casing within the pre-existing filter; it would allow the spiRNA to pass through due to their small size, but not the E. coli. This filter could be placed in any container of water.
Army:
In order to gain more of an insight into the difficulties of accessing clean water and keeping up good sanitation in less developed countries, we got in touch with our local army medical squadron (‘225 Medical Regiment’). They were able to tell us about what measures have to be taken in order to prevent any spread of illness when out on duty, including with cases of cholera and shigellosis. This really helped us understand how our idea could fit into becoming a prevention in the real world. After talking to them some more we found out the army like to transport goods from charities to where it’s needed such as mosquito nets, and we thought perhaps this could be one solution to our distribution problem. However, there was a problem that we hadn't though of; a high percentage of the goods given away are either sold at markets or just left unused. So we had to come up with a way of stopping this from potentially happening to our prevention - what could we make that would be unimposing, ethical, and of little resale value?
We discussed this further, and the people we were speaking to suggested a water bottle would be a great way of solving this, as they are needed by many in order to store and carry water – they’re even fought over. So, if we were to put our filter design and the water bottle idea together, we would create a product the people in developing countries would use: a water bottle with a removable filter that could be placed onto any other bottle. Whilst the original bottle may potentially be resold"
