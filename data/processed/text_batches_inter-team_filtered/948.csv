Teaching Synthetic Biology to High School Students
A common misunderstanding held by proponents of organic food, is that once genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are incorporated into our food supply, they will become undetectable, and cannot be differentiated from other foods. To educate their peers, students in the Biotechnology Academy at Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco offered to teach their fellow students in the school’s ecological Green Academy how to test for, and recognize, genetically modified food ingredients. Additionally, we taught our peers about some of the beneficial real-world applications of GMOs.
Our educational program included a pre-learning survey, direct instruction by our biotechnology teacher, George Cachianes, and a series of three lab exercises in which the iGEM/biotech students taught the Green Academy students how to recognize genetically modified foods using common biotech lab techniques. Afterwards, a post learning survey assessed the knowledge of the Green Academy students to see if their attitude and knowledge about GMOs had shifted.
Pre-Lab Survey
A pre-lab survey measured the Green Academy students'knowledge of, and attitudes toward, genetically modified food. Before the lectures and lab activities, the majority of the student had heard of genetically modified food crops (77.8%) and could identify corn as a crop likely to be genetically modified (66.6%). 85.2% of the students felt that GMOs should be labeled. About half of the students (48.1%) said they would avoid"

East_Chapel_Hill,2017,Team:East Chapel Hill#Collaborations-Siyu-color1_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.
Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill : Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night.
Reddit Synthetic Biology Forum
Along with the iGEM teams of Duke and Gaston Day school, our team created a subreddit to initiate discussion about synthetic biology. Our team and the Duke and Gaston Day teams function as the moderators of the Reddit thread called r/iGEM_Exchange. Read more about our synthetic biology forum on our human practices page.
Building with Bio Revamp
At the Southeastern Mini Convention, we got the chance to discuss potential collaborations in the Human Practices division with Gaston Day School and Duke. Since Duke’s project relates to developing an accessible and easy to use test for Zika in its primary stages, we all thought it would be a good idea to collaborate with Duke and work on revamping the Building with Bio kit for Malaria since it was a little outdated and not pertinent to the more pressing issue at hand: the Zika virus. For those who are unfamiliar with Building with Biology, it is a company that develops innovative resources designed to engage the public with a wide array of activities relating to the STEM field. The kits are assembled by a team of science educators, researchers, and scientists who are passionate about bringing modern day topics related to science, technology, and their societal implications to the discussion table so that the public can have these important conversations. Building with Biology’s mission is very similar to the our Human Practice’s mission: which is to go beyond the laboratory and delve into the underlying issues of projects in a social/environmental context. We worked all night and morning to research and rewrite the material"

She suggests that we should not consider the detected increase of the concentration of cGMP as the end of our experiment. We must do more experiments to show what positive changes that will happen to cells and body functions after cGMP increases. Because of over-expressing the gene of sGC and silencing PDE5A, the concentration of cGMP is bound to increase if our experiment is successful. While doctors and patients don’t care about the increase; it is whether the changes in cell and body functions relief of the symptom of myocardial ischemia or not that they take considerable interest in.
In addition, as we know, the lentiviral vector can integrate gene into chromosome randomly, indicating it can transcript anytime. There still remains some questions of biosafety to be answered. For example, we should do deep discussion about how long the RNA interference will last for and whether the interference is reversible or not. In addition, if PDE5A is silenced for too long even forever, how do we assess the side effect like the apoptosis?
If successful, this new therapy can help to save time and money for patients who suffer from myocardial ischemia. Those patients will not need to take medicine every day because the new therapy has more lasting and steady-going effect. Additionally, those who live in outlying poverty-stricken areas don’t have to go to major hospitals. Moreover, it can also be helpful for patients to get rid of a series of side-effects resulting from drug tolerance, drug adverse reaction and so on. Therefore In this way the pain of patients and the pressure of their families can be relieved a lot. As Dr. Guo says, we really hope to make differences to those in need!
(Talk with nurses)
b.Interview Summary of the Interns
Actually, gene therapy is a trend we must follow up. It is a great innovation to combine gene therapy with synthetic biology, where scientists use biological information technology to design and stimulate firstly. With the help of modeling, great achievement will be made in the experiment, while the experiment would feedback to modeling and stimulating. Additionally, we have to say that some existing clinic treatment methods used in myocardial ischemic have lasted for decades, especially the drug, which mainly relieves the symptom, not radically solve the underlying problem. Thus, there is a great necessity in developing a different technique, even though there is a long way to reach remarkable breakthroughs.

Monday, July 2, 2012
Kevin completed another component for an animation. Hannah ran a gel to assess the length of the plasmids in the colonies she cultured from her CBAR reaction for the Multiple Start Codon Project. To test the stability of some of her plasmids, she transformed them back into DH10B cells. Chris grew up cultures with the desired colonies for sequencing to ensure there was enough sample.
Tuesday, July 3, 2012
Chris mini-prepped cultures to get plasmids for sequencing. Hannah inspected her cultures for their RFP expression, which was present. She used these plates to culture broth in preparation for sequencing. Victoria and Kait looked through some of the teams stocks for primers that could be used for sequencing the construct for the Codon Optimization Project. Sequencing primers were acquired for the Multidirectional Promoters Project.
Wednesday, July 4, 2012
Hannah inoculated cultures for the Multiple Start Codon Project. Victoria checked her plates for signs of expression of mCherry. The broth cultures for mini-prepping and sequencing still required another day of growth. Kevin made some progress with an animation for the team.
Thursday, July 5, 2012
Chris mini-prepped cultures for sequencing, but the yields were still low. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander mini-prepped their cultures in preparation for sequencing. Hannah also ran some mini-preps to prepare samples for sequencing. Kevin worked more on the animations and was shown a better way for making Chemically Competent cells.

Abstract

Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

This shows the process that occurs with the T7 System. We induce the Lactose inducible promoter with IPTG as it mimics the lactose and cannot be broken down by the cell. This allows it to continually perform transcription on the construct embedded in the genome of the BL21(DE3) and thusly constantly produce the T7 RNA polymerase encoded by the gene(3).This T7 RNA Polymerase binds to the T7 Promoter and starts transcription on the construct within our plasmid pSB1C3. This then creates the mRNA which will undergo translation and produce the protein encoded by the gene due to the E. coli RBS on the construct. Part BBa_I712074 .

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

These curves further proved the function of our system.
Figure 11. The flow cytometry results shows the distribution of the cells in fluorescence intensity. BV421 represented the blue-fluorescence intensity, while the FITC-A represented the green-fluorescence intensity and Pe-TxR-A represented the red-fluorescence intensity. The horizontal axis shew the fluorescence intensity, while the vertical axis shew the number of bacteria cells.
Figure 12. The spectral response of the complete RGB system. “%maximum induction” is calculated as the fold change of response divided by the maximum fold change across the spectrum.
For more precise control and prediction of the colors we could generate, we needed to know how the three light sensors responded to lights with different wavelengths and intensity and how the fluorescence changed with time. We firstly use flow cytometry[6] to measure the spectral response of the RGB system. From the figure 10 we could see the distribution of the cells in fluorescence intensity. BV421 represented the blue-fluorescence intensity, while the FITC-A represented the green-fluorescence intensity and Pe-TxR-A represented the red-fluorescence intensity. The horizontal axis shew the fluorescence intensity, while the vertical axis shew the number of bacteria cells. The figure demonstrated the variation of fluorescence intensity where cells were most concentrated with the wavelengths of light. The red- and blue- light data were consistent with our prediction. However, the green-light data was not so satisfying, which was probably because without NOT gate, the green-light circuit had leakage and produced fluorescent proteins even not induced by light. What’s more, the different culture and light-inducing conditions of bacteria on the plates and 96-well plates might also cause the slight inconsistency.(For more details of our optimization, please see HARDWARE )
Figure 13. The curves show the relationship between the input light and fluorescent intensity.
From the flow cytometry results, we knew the correspondence between color and wavelengths of light. We then controlled the intensity of the input light to see the change of the fluorescent intensity over time. The figure 12 demonstrated that the stronger the input light was, the less fluorescence would be. The phenomenon was probably because that under relatively low light, the light sensor could be induced and under relatively strong light, the light can aggravate the burden of the bacteria and thus harmed the growth of the bacteria and reduced"

The qualitative behavior of the dynamical model proposed for the square wave generator is generally dependent on the parameters of the system. Thus, the dynamical response of the system in-vivo would depend on the system parameters. To streamline the design process we need to understand this dependence of the system on the system parameters. The most natural way to do so is to conduct bifurcation analysis against the system parameters. Under such a framework, the system parameters are varied and the qualitative behavior is tracked, and when the system undergoes a change in behavior, we have arrived at a bifurcation point. For instance, varying a certain system parameter might cause the system’s steady state value to change is behavior from stable to unstable, and the system might start to exhibit oscillatory behavior; such a bifurcation is referred to as hopf bifurcation. Further, if the oscillations are stable, we have supercritical hopf bifurcation. For our purpose, we are tracking hopf bifurcation for the square wave generator. There is a two-fold reason for this: we want to identify parameter ranges that lead to oscillations and we want to quantify the extent of ‘squareness’ in these oscillations.
We performed the bifurcation analysis with respect to two system parameters, cooperativity and the the degradation rate. Intuitively, we can predict that higher cooperativity might lead to response with more square like behavior, thus we have included cooperativity in the bifurcation analysis. For the sake of ease, we assume a symmetric system, where all the repressors have the same cooperativities and degradation rates.  The results for the bifurcation analysis are shown in F"

Detection Module
We found out that conformational changes of the dCas9 during protein activation and action are an useful approach to create a detection system. Even though Cas9 naturally targets only DNA molecules, we found a PAMmer strategy to detect single stranded RNA, ideal for targeting PCA3 Prostate Cancer biomarker. To create a diagnose system we select a dCas9 chassis and analyzed hotspots, defining a two protein insertion strategy.
Advantageous Detection
Our modified dCas9 detection approach has the advantage of being an useful system for detecting any nucleic acid molecule. By creating a new sgRNA the system could detect an specific DNA molecule of interest and we could also target RNA based on the PAMmer strategy, where a small DNA fragments complement the single stranded RNA. Finally, the system is ideal to set a detection output because of the hotspots found in the dCas9's sequence that could accept protein insertions.
Background
1. Cas9 conformational changes
We decided to base our detection module in the CRISPR/Cas9 system due to its versatility to detect different targets. The CRISPR system is based on two molecules, one Cas9 protein with nuclease activity and one sgRNA that activates the protein; this sgRNA is the key component also due to that it complements the target thanks to a 20 nucleotide variable region (Sternberg et al, 2015). Our system is adaptable then to target different nucleic acids just designing new sgRNA but using the same Cas9 protein.
Noticing this useful system we started to study the Cas9 protein by structure and activity. We focused in how the sgRNA activates the Cas9 and found out that the protein has three states depending on the presence of sgRNA and target, as detailed in Figure 1. The Cas9 has a defined conformation in an inactive state and it changes its conformation when the sgRNA is bounded due to interaction between the recognition lobe (REC) and the sgRNA; upon activation the nuclease domain HNH moves to cleave the nucleic acid as a final conformation"

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Description#test_-_-_TEXT.html," to express inhibitor gene, and an in-promoter which                                 is repressed by inhibitor to express killer gene. Under normal circumstances, for                                 plasmid concentration being high enough, our killer is repressed by inhibitor whose                                 concentration is connected with plasmid numbers. However, considering the effect of                                 plasmid segregational instability, the plasmid numbers will decrease, so as the                                 intracellular inhibitor protein. The inadequate inhibitor cannot completely repress the                                 expression of downstream killer gene, and all those slackers will be killed.
Previous work done by others

Previous work realize the plasmid maintenance                                 through making the plasmid encode essential factors for the host.
font-family: 'Slabo 27px', serif;
Resistance screening and auxotrophic bacteria are dependent on the selecting process [1].                                 The plasmid-free bacteria cannot survive under specific selections, such as antibiotics.                                 However, it’s not applicable for industrial fermentation. What’s worse, the unlimited                                 use of antibiotics has raised worldwide concern due to its potential risk which may cause antibiotic resistance,                                 degrade the capacity of the immune system and finally develop to a big social problem.
font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;
According to the natural mechanisms for plasmid maintenance, many new strategies are                                 developed, so called plasmid addiction system (PAS) or post-segregational killing                                 system (PSK) [2]. However, these mechanisms are still under exploration and the                                 capacity of plasmid maintenance is not ideal since most of them can only ensure                                 at least one plasmid remains, can’t truly realize the quantitative control as we hope.
What’s the difference
 Quantitative control
Most existing methods for enhancing biosynthetic performance are stuck                                 at the level of resistance screening or relying on natural mechanisms                                 for plasmid maintenance. These method have the same problem: there is                                 no clear definition for high- and low-performance variants, or said differently,                                 those methods can’t define a number or a range as the threshold of plasmids’ concentration.
In our project, we can not only set a threshold to control the number of plasmids, but also                                 regulate it as we need by using the different biobricks. That is what we say—quantitative control.
 No human intervention
There is a step called spawn rejuvenation in the existing large-scale                                 industrial production procedure.                                 It’s useful to maintain the microbial population structure, but costs plenty of time and money.
Our design has great potential to simplify the process of spawn"

Two team members form Göttingen came to Groningen to work on the DNA microarray for the transcript analysis of their mutant strains. They arrived here on the 30th of July and then started doing experiment on the second day. We have a supervisor Mirjam, a PhD from Oscar's group. And one of our team member also helped them during the experiment. They would like to know how expression changed in the mutant strains in comparison with the wild type. The first two microarray for the two mutants were finished scanning on Friday. Then they repeated the experiment again including the dye-swap comparison. The whole experiment was finished no Sunday. During this period, they enjoyed the Dutch food, the Dutch beer and the Dutch weather as well! We shared our ideas about projects with each other and they introduced their experience about advertising their team to sponsors with a handy booklet. As a gift, they offered us a sample of the booklet. We believed that would be a help for us and hope them to get information they need from microarray experiment.

About iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method.

The aim of our project is to construct a learning platform in C.elegans. This platform should be able to provide us the ability to observe and control the neurons’ activity in order to study the process of behavior formation and finally figure out the neural-network level roots of learning ability.
To achieve this goal, we first need to link neuron activation with behavior change.
The neuroscientific research [1] of C.elegans revealed that a pair of olfactory neurons of C. elegans, namely AWA and AWB, play the important roles on determining the preference to different odorants. For example, the attractive odorant diacetyl is detected by the receptor protein Odr-10 in AWA neuron and the repulsive odorants is detected by the receptor protein Str-1 in AWB neuron. However, transgenic worms that express Odr-10 in AWB rather than AWA will avoid diacetyl. That gave us the inspiration that expression of other exogenous receptors on these two neurons can also lead to their preference to certain substances.
To figure out how the olfactory neurons affect behavioral change, we applied two hypotheses:
the neurons are equivalent when equipped different types of receptors;
if the stimulations are not sensed by other receptors, we can control the preference of nematodes towards different stimulations by changing different receptors on these two neurons.
Fig 1 Hypothesis for neuron activation control behavioral change
These hypothesis were supported by the experiments done by other scientists, the experiment showed that we can transfer an exogenous receptor onto the neuron using a promoter that express in one of the pair of neurons , and the transferred receptor will lead to avoidance (AWB) or preference (AWA). That is to say, if the stimulations are not sensed by other receptors, we can control the preference of them towards different stimulations by changing unique receptors on these two neurons. Because of these, we can apply our receptor to these two neurons to achieve our aim"

The strategy  for the function of engineered CEN.PK2-1C  stains lacks △ far1+△sst2, △sst and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 were divided into the following parts;
(1). Testing the inhibitive effects on the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C, whose cellular period can be stopped at the G1 stage by  α factor.
(2). Expression and identification of Pfus+RFP+cyc1t+PRS42K in engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2.
Antibacterial circle
The plan and method
The growth of CEN.PK2-1C is inhibited by α factor,We want to  test the function of △sst2, △far1+△sst2 and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 by comparing with CEN.PK2-1C .
(1)The influence of the growth of bacteria caused by different amount of α factor in the solid plate.
(2)The observed difference among the function of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains, △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2  acted on the growth of Cen.PK2-1C, △sst2, △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2 impaired  by different amount of α factor.
The results and discussion
(1)The bacteria strain of CEN.PK2-1C stops growing in G1 due to the effects acted by the α factor and antibacterial circle appears in the panel.
(2)△sst2 strain (sst2 is knocked out successfully) and the sensitivity of △sst2 strain to α factor will be increased. Meanwhile the larger antibacterial circle will appear when the amount of α factor is reduced"

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Our solution_-_-_TEXT.html,"brane anchored hydrolase
Fusion of the hydrolase to a truncated form of the YiaT membrane protein using a flexible linker was designed to promote hydrolase localisation for surface expression. Given that dimer formation is believed to be critical for enzyme activity and the YiaT transport system has not been shown to co-transport bound proteins across the membrane, a linker of increased length was used to join two hydrolase monomers together, forming a concatemer with dimerisation capabilities.
Riboswitch-ribozyme-sRNA construct
PbuE Riboswitch
While adenosine binds to no known transcriptional regulator in bacteria, it can be detected using its hydrolytic product, adenine, which binds to the PbuE riboswitch as an indirect measure of concentration. PbuE is a transcriptional activating riboswitch, thought to function by the unfolding of a terminator loop in response to ligand binding to the aptamer domain.
An upstream non-coding region was inserted before the aptamer which has been shown to improve folding efficiency. In order to investigate the importance of the upstream region, we designed two different riboswitch variants:
PbuE riboswitch with 89 bp upstream region
PbuE riboswitch with 117 bp upstream region
sRNA
In the system, sRNA is a critical feature, converting the adenosine input into repression of IL-10 translation. The sRNA contains a sequence, complementary to the IL-10 mRNA, of variable length, allowing tuning of binding affinity to alter sensitivity to the adenosine levels.
A MicC scaffold in the sRNA recruits an mRNA degradation complex.
Ribozyme
sRNA has been shown to only exhibit knockdown when not connected to auxiliary RNA such as mRNA. Cleavage from the riboswitch, to activate the sRNA, is performed using a ribozyme. The hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV) was chosen over the better characterised human hammerhead ribozyme given that the latter included a PstI site which is incompatible with the BioBrick standards.
Inducible kill switch
Another important consideration was to develop a system to enhance the safety of our probiotic. Therefore, we decided to design a kill switch which would be activated by an external supplement in order to account for the possibility of adverse reactions in patients. We linked the antimicrobial artilysin Art-175 with a DsbA periplasmic secretion tag, under the control of an inducible pTet promoter. Therefore, upon"

Overview
We devote to dividing the polyketide synthases (PKSs) and catalyze according to specific mechanism. Therefore, as if we standardize the genes which encode independent domains of PKSs, we can synthesize new kinds of polyketides by means of permutation and combination of domains.
In the process of analyzing the DEBS1 which catalyze and synthesize 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB)，the precursor of erythromycin, we know that each domain has independent and specific chemical reaction and function.
Name of domain
Function
Acyltransfer-ase, AT
Activating the extended unit------- propionyl group
Acyl carrier protein, ACP
Anchor the polyketide chain needed to extend
Ketocaylsynthase, KS
Combining the propionyl group with acetyl group at the end of the polyketide chain by forming the C—C bond
Keto-reductase, KR
Deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the β-hydroxyl ester bond
Dehydratase, DH
Dehydrating the extended unit and enabling it to form the α, β- enol ester bond
Enoylreductase, ER
Deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the saturated methylene
Thioesterase, TE
Removing the polyketide chain from PKS
By preliminary analysis of chemical reaction and function of each domain, we can conclude that it is available to analyze their own kinetic mechanism, and it's significant. If we simulate the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in each domain, we can finally establish kinetic model of PKSs related to all kinds of polyketides.
Aimed at the final goal of our project, we simulated the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in each domain, including AT, ACP, KS, KR, ER, DH, and TE"

- Today I also started a new PCR to amplify the CRISPR with the Spacer region as well. This will also put in a BamHI site that we can clone other spacers into for future use. There are 5 PCR reactions and 1 control.
Michael Linzey 10/11/2014
-This week I spent a lot of time working on creating the t7 spacer. We have run several pcr reactions but when we run them out on low melt gels our results have been inconclusive. We have run this experiment several times and it has not been working so we are going to work more closely with Dr. Grose.
Week of October 12
Garrett Jensen 10/12/14
- This week we did a soeing PCR for the new T7 spacers, one for going on a separate plasmid fromt he CRISPR and the other that we will insert into the existing CRISPR spacer region. None of these reactions has worked so far. We are continuing to set these up and hopefully it works soon. Michael set up a reaction yesterday for the T7 spacer that will go into the CRISPR system yesterday that we have not yet run out on a gel.
- We ran a PCR of the S. thermophilus gDNA to amplify a set of the CRISPR that has part of the spacer region attached. Dr. Grose engineered in a restriction site into the middle of an existing spacer that we can use to clone additional spacers into the CRISPR. We were planning on cutting off the end of the CRISPR system at the SnaBI site present in the CRISPR and then ligating that last little bit inluding the spacer region into our existing CRISPR. Unfortunately, after several attempts at cutting our existing CRISPR system using the SnaBI site that it supposedly there we have been unsuccessful. Our sequencing fo the CRISPR did not have good coverage of that area of the DNA, and after running our product out on a gel the band is the size we expect the uncut CRISPR plasmid to be. My hypothesis for this has been that our restriction site has a mutation and cannot be cut by SnaBI.
- After talking to Dr. Grose we are just going to use the new CRISPR system that we have done PCR with instead of the old one. Hopefully we can get this to work soon!!!

General Considerations
In order to produce restriction enzymes in vivo, it is necessary to protect the host DNA from auto-restriction and cell death. This is possible by expressing an excess of the MTase in relation to the REase that is being produced within the cell. Since REases form dimers (whereas MTases are monomeric) in their active form there is a natural lag phase before enzymatic activity is observed. This also implies a 2:1 excess of active MTase within the cell if both enzymes are expressed at the same rate. We intend to create a construct that expresses both enzymes on the same promoter in order to test if MTase can effectively protect the cell's DNA through this mechanism alone. It is possible that this will not provide the MTase with the advantage needed to sufficiently protect the host DNA from auto-restriction. In this is the case, it may be possible for the MTase to out compete the REase by simply expressing the MTase on a strong constitutive promoter and the REase on a weak constitutive promoter. Alternatively, it should be possible to express the MTase on a constitutive promoter and use an inducible promoter system to delay the expression of the REase until the host genome is protected.
Methods of Production
We ordered 500bp segments of DNA that, when connected through a Gibson Assembly, contained the full sequence of our genes of interest (EcoRI and EcoRI methylase). After Gibson Assembly into plasmids failed to produce any transformants, we attempted to PCR amplify our constructs from linear intermediates in the Gibson Reaction.  These PCR reactions resulted in smearing and unexpected bands (below left).  Finally, we used a PCR purification kit to clean up the Gibson Reactions before PCR amplification. Smearing disappeared and our expected bands became more prominent (below right) although multiple unexpected bands remained, most likely due to the DNA blocks in the Gibson Assembly annealing incorrectly, especially in the EcoRI Methylase where three 500bp DNA blocks were required.
To remedy this problem, we gel extracted the band of the correct size to isolate it from the other products. The resulting DNA was at such a low concentration that a second round of PCR was required and a subsequent purification.
In order to synthesize a plasmid containing the desired genes, we digested EcoRI, its methylase, and a previously made Freiburge pSB1C3 backbone with XbaI and AgeI. All three DNA sequences were extracted and purified with an extraction kit.
We then ligated EcoRI into the pSB1C3"

Team Greece worked on their big Human Practices campaign with a survey. They wanted to know the opinions of the PIs and Instructors of other teams around the world about their project and its social, public and health impact. They included a summary of their project to fill us in, and after that, we sent the survey to our team PIs and Instructors. They were happy to help because they are not often this involved in collaborations.

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln team and Tec-Chihuahua team collaboration goes back to the beginning of the summer. We first presented our projects to each other to get to know us a little better. Later on, the UNL team asked us to share their General Public Survey to get to know Mexican opinion. We ended up video calling to officially meet each other and got a great feedback on our projects.
Leuven's Central Hub
Did you know there are more than six thousand languages around the world? Some of them are widely spoken, like Mandarin, Chinese or English, while some others are less spoken, like Tarahumara and Náhuatl in Mexico. In iGEM’s Tec-Chihuahua, we are in favor of diversity because we are sure every language is singular: in composition and expression.   With this in mind, and with iGEM KU Leuven team initiative, we participated in the multiple collaboration of the Central Hub: a platform in where more than a dozen iGEM teams share project descriptions to be translated into ten different languages.  We translated several teams project descriptions to our native language: Spanish; at the time, our description was translated into ten different languages.

Miniprep repeat with new protocol
Another miniprep was repeated on 3 ml of CB bottom plasmid culture using the protocol from yesterday, with a yield of 1 ug/ul.  This seemed very high considering our previous results, and we are suspicious that there may be some genomic DNA contamination.  Contamination may occur either from leaving cultures on the shaker for too long (with cells lysing and releasing their genomic DNA) or from shaking too hard during the lysis process (shearing chromosomal DNA and allowing it to escape the cell).  The lysis process was performed by mixing through tube inversion, so this is likely not the cause.  The tubes that were miniprepped yesterday were left on the shaker for approximately 22 hours, while the tubes from today were on the shaker for 17 hours.  Strangely, although the tubes were on the shaker for a shorter amount of time, there was still higher yield.
The concentration and absorbance curve data can be seen below:
Hopefully this is actually real, it seems almost too good to be true.
As a note, the tubes were unusually dark blue this round after addition of the lysis buffer (buffer P2).
The uncut plasmid was also run out on a gel alongside the cut oligos (loaded 0.5 ul).  This should theoretically have been around 500 ng of DNA, but for some reason it only shows up very faintly.  This is not good news.
Results for new restriction enzyme protocol
The resulting reaction from the oligo cut with Bsa-HF yesterday was run out on a gel with the following results:

There appears to be a band of the correct size.  However, there is still incomplete cutting as indicated by the second band at around 100 bp, but there is no longer a band at the uncut position, indicating that all of the oligos underwent a single or double cut.

We have engineered bacteria to turn non-recyclable waste into bioplastic
We have taken an expensive byproduct of recycling facilities, a type of mixed waste and turned it into something quite amazing; a material that can be used for a diverse range of applications from making your lunchbox to a 3D printed tissue scaffold. This material is the bioplastic poly-3-hydroxybutyric acid P(3HB). Our system is designed to maximise the recovery of resources from the waste and so we have also investigated how we can use the oil based plastics within it to produce the commodity chemical ethylene glycol. We are passionate about using synthetic biology to help us move towards a more sustainable economy. We have considered what happens to the material we produce after it is used. This led us to develop the first synthetic biology recycling system for P(3HB) and one of the first in the world. The other well known bioplastic, poly lactic acid (PLA) is also expanding in use and so we developed a system to turn it back into its constituent monomers so that it can also be resynthesised, chemically or in vivo.
Click here to find out how we made P3HB and broke down oil derived plastics and here to see how we recycled P3HB and PLA.

Intravenously injected targeted exosomes delivered Dox specifically to tumor tissues, leading to inhibition of tumor growth without overt toxicity. The results suggested that exosomes modified by targeting ligands could be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications in our project.

1.1 KRAS siRNA interference efficiency verification in vitro
To ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA, we transfected the plasmid loaded with this siRNA into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and extracted protein to perform western blot. Significant down-regulation of K-ras can be observed in A549 cells treating with anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid, compared with the control group, demonstrating that anti-KRAS siRNA has a gene silencing effect on lung cancer cells.
Figure 3. Anti-KRAS siRNA transfected into A549 cells successfully reduced KRAS expression. Left panel: western blot analysis of KRAS protein levels in cells without any treatment (Nude) or treated with negative control siRNA (NC, siRNA targeting at a random sequence) and transfected with anti-KRAS siRNA using Lipo2000. Right panel: protein quantitative analysis made for intuitive support that anti-KRAS siRNA can suppress KRAS expression.
1.2 TEM imaging of exosomes carrying KRAS siRNA and expressing iRGD peptide on their membrane
After co-transfection of the two plasmids mentioned above, we performed a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA. The TEM image showed that the exosomes presented normal morphological characteristics after outside modification and siRNA loading, with a diameter of approximately 200 nanometer and a double-layer membrane.

We then asked NUDT_CHINA to help us perform nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for a further evaluation of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes. The use of Nanosight enabled quantification and size determination of the extracellular vesicles, as nanoparticles can be automatically tracked and sized based on Brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient."

UCL,2016,Team:UCLA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"-CT), by the expression of a CdiI immunity protein that interacts directly with the toxin to neutralize its pore-forming capabilities. The CdiBAI cluster is common throughout most CDI+ strains, significantly varying only in CdiA-CT and CdiI sequences.
Our project focuses on the translocation of three different CDI systems from EC93 and Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 (containing two CDI loci) into one lab strain of E. coli to create a super-soldier organism that is able to selectively inhibit the growth of these strains. A lab strain containing CDI EC93, for instance, would be able to target all bacteria containing the corresponding receptor for CDI EC93, which would in this case be BamA Ecoli. In order to target EC93 itself, however, we aim to switch CdiA-CT EC93 with a toxin from ATCC 13048 so that the immunity protein of EC93 does not prevent growth inhibition. It has previously been shown that CdiA-CT regions are modular, and systematically modularizing the toxin region using appropriate restriction sites is another goal of our project. While the CDI system in EC93 targets the BamAEcoli, the relevant receptors in other species of pathogens and even in other strains of E. coli is unknown. An additional facet to our project would be to find the receptors that each CDI system of ATCC 13048 targets by creating a transposon insertion library. Mutants that display a whole or partial CDI immunity phenotype will be sequenced to determine which genes have undergone transposon insertion, providing insight into which receptors may be targeted by ATCC 13048 CDI systems.

LPS is a crucial part of Gram-negative bacteria’s structural integrity and also plays a protective role against certain chemicals and immune effectors. However, it is extremely endotoxic, evoking a strong immune response in human that can result in septic shock.  It was found that hexa-acylated LPS is the trigger in humans, recognized by the human toll-like receptor 4 (hTLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor-2 (MD-2) complex. This complex activates the NF-kappaB transcription factor, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and eventually septic shock.
Thankfully, strains of E. coli have already been made to deal with this toxicity without significantly compromising the structural integrity of the bacteria. One such strain includes a mutation in the lpxM gene, which codes for a late-stage myristoyl transferase essential for the addition of secondary acyl chains on the Lipid A portion of LPS. This prevents the toxic hexa-acylation of LPS and exhibited a 10-fold reduction of toxicity in a murine model. We were able to obtain the lpxM mutant strain from the Yale E. coli stock center for use in our experiments. Recently, it was brought to our attention that a new strain, dubbed “Clear Coli”, utilizes six additional genetic mutations to further lower the risks of immunogenicity. While the strain is relatively new, the results are very promising with >95% reductions in endotoxin response in a Limulus amebocyte lysate test. In the future, we hope to use “Clear Coli” as our standard for minicell production.

A pair of widely-used split firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase fragments (Nluc 416/Cluc 398) was then selected to construct Nluc-FRB and FKBP-Cluc fusion proteins; they are, therefore, subjected to rapamycin induced complementation [9]. Our results of PFAC assay on our split luciferase fragments confirmed that the luciferase activity is able to be successfully reconstituted in a rapamycin-dependent manner (Figure 3b).

The location of His-tag
Despite the fact that His-tag is widely used for protein purification, it is well-known that His-tag might have some considerable impact on protein structure. Hence, we first tested the activity of C-terminally and N-terminally His-tagged split luciferase-dCas9 fusion proteins to see whether the location of His-tag matters. We found that when the His-tag is attached to Nluc or Cluc, the activity of fusion protein would dramatically decrease (See working mechanism of PC reporter in Figure 2); this is probably due to the interruption of luciferase reconstitution by His-tag (Figure 4). When the His-tag is attached to dCas9, the enzymatic activity was reconstituted significantly. Therefore, we chose split luciferase-dCas9 fusion proteins with His-tagged dCas9 for the following study.

○ Introduction
Normally, bacteria cannot survive in extremely acidic and alkaline environment. So before producing acid or alkali, the bacteria should be able to tolerate acidic or alkaline environment. Two devices are applied to achieve it.
The first is alkali-resistance device, consisting of Nha protein family.
Nha is a family containing a number of bacterial sodium-proton anti-porters. These are integral membrane proteins that catalyze the exchange of proton for sodium in a manner highly dependent on the pH. To resist different pH, we select two genes, NhaA and NhaB, from this family.
NhaA is the archetypal Na+/H+ antiporter and the only member of the family that is required by E.coli for survival under alkaline stress[1,2]. It is a membrane protein consisting of 388 residues[3]. NhaA excretes Na+ from the cytoplasm using the energy from the cotransport of protons down their electrochemical gradient into the cell, with a characteristic electrogenic stoichiometry of two protons to one Na+ (Fig.1)[4,5]. Like many other Na+/H+ antiporters, NhaA  is regulated by pH. It is essentially inactive below pH 7.0, and the Na+ efflux rate increases by three orders of magnitude between pH 6.5 and 8.5[6].
Fig.1 The mechanism of NhaA
Fig.2 The mechanism of NhaB
The NhaB gene encodes Na+/H+ antiporter catalyzing the exchange of 3 H+ per 2 Na+(Fig.2)[7]. NhaB has a high affinity for sodium. In the absence of NhaA, NhaB confers a certain tolerance to Na+ which decreases with increasing pH. Essential for regulation of intracellular pH under alkaline conditions, NhaB is crucial when the level of NhaA activity is limiting, when NhaA is not sufficiently induced, and/or when"

Thus, the overexpression of plasmid-based NADH-dependent propanediol                  oxidoreductase (FucO) gene reduces furfural to ultimately improve furfural resistance without detrimentally affecting the biosynthesis                  of NADPH (Wang et al. 2011).

GSH (BBa_K2571001)
GSH is a protein-coding region that codes for Bifunctional gamma glutamate cysteine ligase/Glutathione synthetase.
Glutathione (GSH) is known to be an important antioxidant that is a sulfur compound; a tripeptide composed of three amino acids                  (cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid) and a non-protein thiol (Pizzorno, 2014; Lu, 2013). GHS is, furthermore, found in thiol-reduced                  form which accounts for its strength as an antioxidant.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are harmful substances that distort protein based matters by taking electrons and also causes oxidative                  stress (Lu, 2013) which occur during the fermentation process and is another major setback. The chemical structure of the protein-based                  substances such as the DNA are altered and become therefore become  dysfunctional because of ROS (Lu, 2013; Burton & Jauniaux, 2011).
GSH is generally found in the thiol-reduced form which is crucial for detoxification of ROS and free radicals. which cause oxidative                  stress. (Lu, 2013; Burton & Jauniaux, 2011).

Since genetically altered E. coli are only able to survive in the environment as a symbiosis with cyanobacteria and the survival of those in African climatic conditions is highly unlikely, Dr. Himmel agreed this would be a feasible approach to ensure our traps biosafety.
We strongly suggest to implement this feature to anyone deciding to further develop our project before applying it for registration. However, the limited time available in an iGEM period did not allow us to implement the complete iGEM Darmstadt 2016 project.
With Dr. Mirko Himmel, we raised two additional questions we could not find sufficient answers to: Could diseases be spread between mosquitoes landing on the S.H.I.E.L.D., and could mosquitoes develop resistances against the toxin we employ?
To gain more knowledge about malaria-transmitting vectors like Anopheles gambiae, and to answer some of our questions regarding new and existing mosquito traps, we interviewed Dr. Thomas Jacobs from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, who currently works on the topic “Protective and pathogenetic role of T-cells in murine malaria.”
Dr. Thomas Jacobs.
From the mosquito expert we learned that female mosquitoes are fed with blood in the lab using a bowl with pre-warmed blood which is covered with parafilm for mosquitoes to land on and sting through. During this process, the parafilm gets destroyed irreversibly. With our focus on sustainability, this approach would not be feasible for use in the S.H.I.E.L.D. To accomodate mosquitoes landing and taking up the insecticide, we implemented a self-healing hydrogel. However, we worried bacteria could grow on the hydrogel surface, possibly infecting the landing mosquitoes or being distributed by them. When told about the S.H.I.E.L.D.’s approach, Dr. Jacobs assessed transfer of pathogens between landing mosquitoes to be very unlikely because even under laboratory circumstances the infection of mosquitoes is quite hard to achieve, and pathogens would not be able to survive for on the hydrogel for longer times. Since we are aware of insecticide resistances being an abundant problem in fighting malaria, we discussed how likely a novel resistance to our toxin could occur. In his opinion, this should not be a major problem as long as the dose of our toxin is high enough to kill the mosquitoes swiftly enough to prevent them from developing a resistance. Even if a resistance to the toxin should occur, the modular BioBrick system would allow a relatively easy substitution with another"

Synthetic biology opens exciting perspectives to control cells, for applications ranging from                             industrial processes to cell-based therapy. However, the large majority of designed cellular                             circuits are based on transcriptional regulation, which may be too slow for many                             therapeutic or diagnostic applications, for example delivery of insulin or detection of a                             metabolite. Several medical doctors and researchers that we consulted stressed that a fast                             but controllable response is high on their wish list of expectations from synthetic biology.                             Additionally, noninvasive stimulation of selected tissues in the organism would also be highly desirable. While light is extremely useful as a rapid, spatially-restricted input                             signal, it cannot penetrate deep into the tissue. On the other hand, ultrasound combines                             several advantages of light with the added ability to penetrate tissue.
In our project we enhanced the sensitivity of mammalian cells to ultrasound or other                             mechanical stimuli by introduction of bacterial or engineered mammalian mechanosensors.                             Additionally, the response to ultrasound and touch was strongly increased by expression of                             the two components of bacterial gas vesicles, GvpA and GvpC. Mechanosensing was detected by                             the calcium-induced calmodulin-M13 complex reconstituting split cyclic luciferase, highly                             applicable for the emerging field of mechanogenetics. This enabled us to draw on cells using                             touch, where we engaged in collaboration with the artist Laura Olalde.
For the rapid response of cells to multiple stimuli we designed proteolysis-based signaling                             pathways. Four orthogonal split proteases were generated, each recognizing                             its own motif of seven amino acid residues. Based on cleavage of coiled-coil dimerizing                             domains we demonstrated the ability to implement proteolysis-based signal pathways and logic                             functions in mammalian cells. Based on the cleavage of an ER retention peptide by a                             protease, input signals led to protein secretion without the slow step of induced protein                             synthesis.
We believe that this project introduced several foundational advances that could be very                             useful to synthetic biology far beyond iGEM and for the benefit of humanity for therapy,                             diagnostics and potentially many other advanced applications.
 Abstract in plain English
Synthetic biology aims to control cells so they can obey our commands and do what we want,                             for example produce drugs when needed. In our project we made cells which respond to ultrasound                             or touch. When we touch the cells they light up, which can be recorded on a camera. Ideally                             we want cells to respond to our commands as fast as possible, because sometimes we can’t                             wait an hour before the cells produce the medicine and release it"

Additionally, Mark mentioned several companies where they are developing techniques for the detection of antibiotic resistance. He also suggested to look what the farmers are doing now as a protocol when discovering that one of their cows got an infection. With this we could really state where the added values of our project lies. So, the detection device that we are making should be accurate of which antibiotics the farmer then needs to use.

Summary
Relevance
Korienke Smit and Cécile van der Vlugt gave insights on the political agenda concerning antibiotic resistance. This way, we were able to make an overview of the most important European and Dutch institutes and agencies. Besides new vaccines and new prevention strategies to tackle the infectious diseases, and besides the need for new antibiotics and new therapeutics, the increased use (including overuse and misuse) of the available antibiotics (ref. The Netherlands Center for One Health (NCOH)) should be stopped. The detection method could be used as frontline diagnostics and could be the key for new treatment strategies.
Safety and public acceptance
Besides designing in a relevant for the field, the acceptance of our detection method was considered. We aimed to design a detection method that could be broadly implemented to detect resistance on the spot. The public should be comfortable to use our method. Our idea was based on detection with GMOs with a kill-switch on a paper-chip. However, considering safety and public acceptance, we have chosen not to use GMOs in the environment, but only the products of the GMO. Taking into account the public opinion on GMOs and bacterial resistance, we aimed to design a product that looks as safe"
UIUC-Illinois-Software,2010,Team:UIUC-Illinois-Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," - The third and final part of BioMORTAR is cell modeling using the BIGG database in conjunction with COBRA tools in MATLAB to simulate cell growth and chemical flux from the added pathway within the cell.
IMPtools (AKA IMPtools 2.0)
The first release of IMPtools is the result of the efforts of the 2009 University of Illinois iGEM software team. The web-based program works by finding the quickest pathway between two organic compounds over a reaction network constructed from the KEGG database. It also would allow the user to customize the algorithm by using a weighting system to specify the importance of certain features of reactions, such as ATP consumption, metabolite connectivity, and amount of extra product at the end. The software won best software as well as a gold medal in the 2009 iGEM competition at MIT, however it still had a few problems to work out before it could be feasibly used.
IMPtools has had some big improvements made to it since last year's iGEM competition. First, some major bugs in the program were fixed, and the inputs were simplified to recognize the name of the compound rather than merely the KEGG ID. There are two major improvements to IMPtools. The first and most fundamental, is the reduction of the rather bloated network by the application of the RPAIR database available from the KEGG project. The RPAIR database pairs compounds that chemically interact for each reaction, making the network a much smarter network to work with. The new IMPtools relies on the direct nature of the links for greater accuracy in generating a realistic metabolic pathway. Another large improvement is the addition of a branching system. One major drawback of IMPtools was that the algorithm would simply ignore large intermediate inputs and outputs in the pathway. The branching system solves this by keeping track of these large side products and attempting to convert them into readily available reactants or common metabolic products that could be provided or absorbed by the cell's existing metabolism.
User inputs the desired starting and ending compounds
Weighting system allows for a more customized metabolic pathway
IMPtools selects the best metabolic pathway from the generated reaction network
An option allows IMPtools to optimize output while minimizing intermediate inputs or products through pathway branching
Plasmid Designer
Building on top of IMPTools, BioMORTAR plasmid designer determines the requisite enzymes and retrieves the appropriate gene sequences from the KEGG database. BioMORTAR will then assemble a plasmid or an array of plasmids in silico for the necessary metabolism according to the expression characteristics designated by the user.

Characterizations for MFC
Being widely reported its natural ability to generate electricity, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 was fed with lactate in the MFC to quantify the performance of our MFC device and to be used as the experimental control for our engineered Shewanella system. While Shewanella can utilize different carbon sources such as lactate, pyruvate and acetate, lactate is selected in our experiment because it has shown that lactate is an energy-favorable carbon substrate for this strain[1]. As described from literature[2], it is desirable to inoculate Shewanella culture until it reaches an early stationary phase. Therefore, we decided to characterize the stationary OD600 of Shewanella in LB by its growth curve since we used LB to proliferate the cell. To get a full understanding of the cell population of Shewanella in the designed condition of MFC, we also stimulated the anaerobic bacterial growth in M9 minimal medium. ""Anaerobic condition is chosen because Shewanella will have a better performance in generating electricity.""
Growth curve of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
Figure 1. Growth curve of Shewanella MR-1 in LB under 30oC aerobic condition
From the graph, the stationary OD600 value was observed at around 1.8-1.9. In addition, the doubling time was 0.981h. Since a stable cell population is desired for a stable electricity generation in the MFC, we attempted to stimulate the anaerobic bacterial growth.
Figure 2 Growth curve of Shewanella MR-1 in 25oC M9 anaerobic medium
Stationary Shewanella MR-1 in LB was washed and transferred to M9 anaerobic medium at time zero. Although no significant cell growth was observed, the OD600 remained at 1.45-1.5 for 24 hours. After the decreasing trend was observed, we decided to repeat the measurement, but allowing aeration to the cell culture after shifting from LB to M9 for better cell adaptation to the new medium.

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#Wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," more general promoter design strategy. To obtain regulated promoters we decided to combine these parts with short regulatory sequences that operate as a binding site for the transcription factor. To this aim, we synthesized four libraries of operator sequences, respectively for LacI , TetR , cI and LexA repressor proteins ( see details ). In each library, there are three sequences (see Table below) each with a different repressor binding affinity to the repressor protein. Since the libraries were synthetized on pGA18 and pMA Geneart vectors, we isolated each operator with the intention to clone them into BioBrick standard assembly plasmids. The choice of the operator should give a relative fine-tuning of promoter sensitivity to the repressor. We decided to take the Berkley's costitutive promoter library as a good ""collection"" from which we could select the unregulated promoter, according with the chosen transcriptional strength.

Single operators or a combination of them, can be also assembled upstream or downstream with respect to a constitutive promoter. In fact, it is known (Cox et al, 2007) that the position of an operator site plays a crucial role in determining repression effects (i.e. lambda operators ). In particular, the same operator located upstream of the promoter -35 sequence functions as a weaker repressor than one located downstream of the -10 consensus sequence.

None of the cultures for today's flow grew. Only the controls grew. Looking back at the URA knock out patch plates that we inoculated from, they didn't grow very well. I think they moreso had a hard time growing than it not being correctly transformed because they came back positive in the colony PCRs (14/7/15). I transferred them onto a YPD patch plate to see if they would grow.

COLLABORATIONS
Collaboration was a very important part of our project.  Having a large team with diverse students working on four subprojects (lab, modelling, Second Life and Human Practices), it was very important that team members communicated and collaborated well with each other.  We had a variety of ways to do this.  First, through our blog, ' Synthetic Blogology ', we were able to keep everyone up to date on what each of the different subprojects had accomplished on a weekly basis, as well as what their goals were for the upcoming week.  We also had weekly team meetings where we would discuss accomplishments and future directions.  Lastly, our Wiki Notebook, where team members recorded what they did on a day-to-day basis also helped us keep everyone on the same page.
Collaboration between teams is a very important part of the iGEM competition as well.  Not only is helping another team a gold medal requirement for the competition, but it's a great way to meet students from around the world and learn a bit about what they're up to. We are all working towards the purpose of promoting a synthetic biology community, and this clearly requires cooperation between teams.  Beyond collaborating within our own team, this year we had a variety of opportunities to collaborate with other teams.

The 2015 UCLA iGEM Interlab/Measurements Study Notebook
Introduction
The 2015 UCLA iGEM Team is proud to participate in the Second International InterLab Measurement Study in synthetic biology.  As members of the synthetic biology community, we are committed to providing robust data for development of novel characterization methods in the rapidly growing biological design fields of synthetic biology.
The purpose of the 2015 InterLab study is to ""measure and characterize fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices"" expressing GFPmut3b (SwissProt: P42212) from active iGEM teams participating around the world.  By collecting fluorescence data from multiple teams in absolute units, variability in measurement and consistency of data collected from instrumentation following a uniform procedure can be determined within a high degree of accuracy.
This notebook will record all protocols, daily experiments, basic parameters and images, as well as the raw data used to prepare the Interlab Worksheet, Protocol, and Wiki page for submission at the 2015 Giant Jamboree.
Experimental Design
Three separate genetic ""devices"" were constructed using IDT gBlocks Gene Fragments synthesis, in addition to positive control BBa_I20270 (Constitutive Family Promoter J23151 inserted upstream of the promoter MeasKit) and negative control BBa_R0040 (pTetR - empty control plasmid). All gBlocks were designed on Benching to simulate the sequence of the BioBricks standard assembly product, for uniformity in measurement with teams that opted for RFC10 standard assembly.  All devices were subcloned in the standard pSB1C3 (chloramphenicol resistance marker) backbone and transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli . As such, E. coli BL21(DE3) laboratory strains were used as the chassis for fluorescent measurement.  Details as to"

How Did We Start?
After we decide to do with the CRISPR-Cas system, we start to think about how can we combine our lab work with the world.         Firstly, as we all know China is a developing country, a large number of pollutions are inevitable, especially some heavy metals in water from metal factories. Secondly,          cancer is always a big problem around the world, comparing         to paying lots of money on the low chance of curing it, the prediction seems to be more significant. So         with our theory of gene editing and detection, two embryonic thoughts of our projects related to the society came         out, which are “heavy metal detection in the water” and “high throughput screening of cfDNA of cancer.
Communications
During the time we are working on the projects, Junjing Chen went to the 2018 Eurasian meetup to communicate with other         teams. Chenbo Sun went to Nankai University for a communication which was attended by nine teams. We took an active         part in the first iGEM Eurasian meetup co-organized by TU Delft and BGI college in Shenzhen, which several other         teams participated including EPFL, Tongji, HKU and so on. The meetup schedule is similar to that of Giant Jamboree,         which offered us an opportunity to practice presenting our project. Through the Eurasian meetuo and communication         in Nankai University, we received useful suggestions on how to improve our projects, and we firmly believe that we         will do better in the future. Furthermore, we also established strong relationships and built collaboration with         buddy teams. We received other teams’ advice and figured it out that we can turn our work into products or make the         results useful to every person, not only to the entire society.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

As the thread is ejected from the nozzle, any remaining liquid is evaporated, resulting in a solid fiber that is collected on a wall surrounding the reservoir.
Hydrogels
A hydrogel is a 3-dimensional polymer matrix that suspends water within itself, and has applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and tissue implantation, to name a few. Hydrogels created from other polymers for these purposes have already been studied for decades, but silk is remarkable in that it evokes no immune response. This makes it particularly suited for use within the human body.
Silk hydrogels can be created in a wide variety of ways. Some methods include using sonication, electricity, or even ultraviolet radiation to coagulate the liquid silk into a gel. Our team primarily utilizes acids and vortexing to create the gels."

Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#calendar_-_-_TEXT.html," HBsu BioBrick is now to clone the gene construct into the pMutin4 plasmid and use a single cross-over via the amyE gene to integrate it into the bacteria genome. Also the antibiotic marker and promoter is no longer being used because after SCO the whole plasmid will be integrated and as such will contain the promoter Pspac and Kanamycin cassette.

B.subtilis Transformation
Aim:
To transform the bacteria with Groningen plasmid.
Methods:
A single colony of B.subtilis strain 168 was picked and transferred into MM media and left to grow at 37 ̊C overnight. We continued the protocol on June 26th .
Microfluidics Introduction
Our iGEM team attended a talk about microfluidics given by Sunny Park. Microfluidics is vital to some of our sub-projects ( Genome Shuffling and Shape Shifting ), therefore we looked into the mechanism of operation, possible uses and creation of design for master moulds on the silicon wafer.
HBsu BioBrick Cloning Strategy
The HBsu-GFP and HBsu-RFP BioBricks were sent off for synthesis. We then created an overnight liquid culture of LR2 rod B.subtilis cells in NB/MSM media, ready to be used to make L-form plates to obtain microscopic pictures.

Promoter Activity
Experimental Planning
After brainstorming ideas we concluded that we wanted to work with the characterisation of promoter activities. We heard about the Spinach technology and were intrigued about the potential to develop an assay for promoters activity in Polymerases Per Second (PoPS). PoPS is a measure of the amount of polymerases that passes a certain point on the DNA string. The Spinach technology involves an RNA-aptamer (“Spinach”) that binds to a ligand called DFHBI-1T, creating a fluorophore. The fluorescence from this fluorophore can be measured and will correlate with the concentration of Spinach RNA in the cell. After these considerations we decided to work with the Spinach technology and synthesised the sequence for Spinach2 (an improved version of Spinach), flanked by stabilising tRNA sequences as well as the BioBrick prefix and suffix. We modified the Spinach2 sequence to remove an internal SpeI site, resulting in a sequence we called Spinach2.1 . Unless otherwise specified, the term “Spinach” will in the following refer to Spinach2.1.
We derived a model describing the relationship between promoter activity and Spinach concentration. According to the model we needed to
Measure the degradation rate of Spinach in the cells
Measure the fluorescence from cells expressing Spinach
Create a standard series to correlate fluorescence with Spinach concentration.
We therefore designed experiments to achieve these goals. We wanted to obtain the standard curve by measuring RNA synthesised in vitro. This would allow us to add the ligand DFHBI-1T in known concentrations with excess RNA and measure the fluorescence signal. To determine the degradation rate of Spinach"

Inspiration and intention
Build the Adaptors!
Based on the transcriptional factors bioinformatically mined from the database, we have built a large collection of well-characterized biosensors with low basal level and high induction ratio, including XylR for BTEX (short for benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylene), XylS for benzoates, NahR for salicylates, DmpR for phenols, HbpR for biphenyls and HcaR for phenylpropionate. However, we noticed that the detection profiles of these biosensors can be further expanded. For example, aromatics containing functional groups like hydroxyl and aldehyde groups often can not be readily detected by our biosensors, probably due to their poor performance in the host E.coli [1] or the unknown activation mechanism [2] .
To broaden the detection profile of our toolkit, we set out to seek for possible solutions.
Previous studies that aimed to expand the detection profiles of biosensors were mainly protein engineering based on the sequence homology. For example, XylS protein with a R45T mutation could be activated by benzoate with substitutions at 2, 3 and 4 position of the aromatic ring, such as 4-methoxybenzoate (Fig. 1a) [3] . Victor de Lorenzo et al. generated a library of engineered transcription factors by shuffling homologous domains between DmpR and XylR. The product can sense not only xylene but also phenols (Fig. 1b) [4] .
Therefore, new methods need to be developed for our goal. Because aromatic compounds can be inter-converted by the enzymes in the natural metabolic network, we reasoned that such enzymes may help to expand the detection profiles of existing biosensors. We analyzed the data of metabolic pathways provided by ( KEGG"
