Friday 10/7
After finishing our final exam, we talked a lot about our project. We determined our goals and direction of getting there. In the discussion, work assignment had been done. Our team tidied the lab together. Moreover, with the help of our senior fellow-student brothers and sisters, we received lab safety training.
Saturday 11/7
With the help of our senior fellow-student brothers and sisters, we studied the method of culturing cell. And we tried to culture some. Then we waited for the result.
Monday 13/7
We were informed that we failed in culturing cells. We tried to recall the experimental process to find out the reason of failure. We found that maybe the overdue cell-culture medium we used caused the failure. We still wanted to try again, although not without pain.
Wednesday 15/7
We put forward experimental procedure and gave in detail.
Sunday 19/7
Part of our team members took part in a meetup which was set up by Sun Yat-sen University Guangzhou, China. The meetup contained three parts: ice breaker, project presentation, world café. Many teams had been involved such as SKLBC-China, SKLBC-GDSYZX, SYSU-China, SYSU-Software, SCUT-China. In the meetup, they shared their ideas to us and we also introduced our project and showed our presentation to them. Their teacher and members pointed out our shortcoming and gave us some advices. And we also exchanged our views with modeling team to seek a better way to cooperation and development. We reaped a lot benefit from this meetup!
Thursday 23/7
We learned basics, as running a PCR, and we got every reagent we needed in our project. And we set those reagents on appropriate place. We can find everything we needed in the lab.
We set about designing three primers and came across some trouble. PDE5A mRNA has three variants, we felt confused about choosing which variant.
Our team’s logo and the style of our wiki had been settled.

Although all of the organisms are in line with biosafety level 1 (BSL), we have treated it as a potential affection source and created following rules to minimize the danger:
Wearing appropriate protective equipment like gloves and lab coats.
Don’t eat any food or store it in the lab.
Avoid wearing shorts or shoes that make your legs or toes exposed.
Washing hands before leaving the laboratory.

Safety training
There is no Biosafety Committee at our university, only a bio-safety officer. Nevertheless, we have iGEM instructors, Dr. Chun Li and Dr. Shuyuan Guo, who trained us about the project progress regularly and is responsible for the bio-safety of our project. The general rule at our university is that every student has to take part in specific safety training before their first experiment. Further, once a year, every member of the lab is required to take a refreshment course in lab safety, bio safety, fire safety, waste management, handling gas cylinders and working with hazardous materials. All of these treatments ensure our lab safety.

Public & Environment safety
The model organisms used in our project are non-virulent strains which are commonly used in microbiology laboratories. The organism has been provided various resistance of antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, ampicillin and kanamycin. Without the circumstance which contained specific antibiotic, our organism has no advantage in the competition with the wild one. Besides, although we have improve its resistance of higher temperature(42~45℃), it can still be denatured via heat. In a word, it can work well in laboratory environment and will be eliminated through competition when exposing in the wild.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," lots of feedback on the 3D animation of our device from the team and Cesar.  Areas for improvement were identified and it was suggested to change the part with DNA processes to show the interaction between the repressor gene and the promoter/operator/reporter genes. In particular, it might be better to show that the repressor gene codes for the repressor proteins and transcription cannot happen while repressor proteins are bound. So this week we have been working on improving our Maya animation. We also talked to Cesar about creating a schematic to describe our system. He suggested a couple of software options we can use for the schematic. We also started working on writing up content for the wiki and made plans for future weeks.
Week 18: September 1st - September 5th
This week we have been working on improving our Maya animation. In particular, we simplified and improved the transformation animation. We also made the DNA pieces appear more clear and organized. The scene of the animation with DNA was also changed to show the interaction between the repressor gene/repressor proteins and the reporter circuit. This week we also continued writing up content for the wiki and editing the journal so we can start uploading content to the website. We also downloaded Microsoft Visio software so we can start working on the schematic for our biological system.
Week 19: September 8th - September 12th
This week we started uploading our content to the wiki so we can design and prepare for how we want to display our information. We collaborated with the various biology sub-teams to create a rough outline of our schematic. This week we were also preparing engineering content for the aGEM presentation, and determining which information was important to be communicated in our project at aGEM.  Additionally we also practiced answering potential questions we might receive.  We received valuable feedback regarding the alignment of the detection chambers in our prototype.  If we place these chambers radially and symmetrically to the PCR chamber we automatically reduce the amount of Teflon tubing required to transport the sample from the PCR chamber to the detection chambers.  This allows us to make a device that is both more economically feasible and more portable through the smaller design.  Additionally we received feedback regarding the heavy base of our prototype.  We wanted to ensure that during the development phase that we would have a device to showcase aesthetics and the fact that it was operational for several months through many tests.  When creating a new design we plan on altering this and planning for a lighter, less expensive base, as tests will have to undergo on test, instead of multiple over several months.

Within M.R the unbound particle binds to the E. coli with some rate constant α, and detaches with some rate β (equilibrium process).
This process operates until the particle concentration is as low as desired.
Bioreactor Assumptions
Our cell surface engineering technique has specificity to only one substance in the waste-water (i.e. the substance desired for removal).
We will only observe exponential bacterial growth within the reactor, i.e. the biomass has been cultured to sufficiently large optical density before being introduced into the bioreactor.
Suspended particles attach to the surface of our E. coli at a rate proportional to the particle concentration and the ratio of unused area available on the surface.
Bound particles detach from the surface of our E. coli back into the waste-water at a rate proportional to the particle concentration bound to the E. coli.
Once the E. coli that are pumped out of the main chamber end up in the flotation tank, they are immediately removed – no more growth nor unbinding of particle occurs.
We ignore all the spatial properties of pipes between the main reactor and flotation tank, as soon as part of the solution leaves the main take, it immediately arrives in the flotation tank, and vice versa.
The pipe leading into the flotation tank sprinkles the solution over the flotation tank so lightly that the E. coli cells do not sink into the tank – they float on the surface, allowing for immediate removal.
The solution within the main reactor is continuously mixed; it can be considered a homogeneous solution).
All the E. coli in the flotation tank float.
A higher dilution rate (D) does not affect the detachment rate.
2.3 Equations
The dynamics within the bioreactor are given by:
$$\begin{aligned}\dot{N} &= N_i \mu (S) - N \cdot \left( D + \kappa \right) \label{N}\end{aligned}$$
Equation 1.
$$\begin{aligned}         \dot{S} &= -\mu (S) N \gamma^{-1} \label{S}             \end{aligned}$$
Equation 2.
$$\begin{aligned}         \dot{X}_u &= \beta X_w - \alpha X_u \cdot \left(\frac{\delta N - X_w}{\delta N} \"

We have developed a pipeline for selection and characterization of new transcription factors, specifically:
in vivo selection of functional mutants from a large library of variants using a “survival of the weakest” strategy,
in vitro characterization of affinity and specificity of mutants with MITOMI,
in vivo characterization of selected mutants using reporter plasmids.
Our project can be decomposed into four main parts:
In vivo TF selection system
As the first step in our pipeline we propose a new in vivo method for the automated selection of mutant transcription factors or transcription factor binding sites from large and diverse libraries containing millions of variants. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we use negative selection, or “survival of the weakest” as the selection strategy. In our method, a functional variant activates lysis of the host, leading to release of the plasmid DNA coding for the functional variant. The plasmid DNA can then be amplified, transformed, or directly sequenced to determine which variants were functional. We believe that our negative selection scheme is a potentially powerful approach when coupled to next-generation sequencing. Using a proof-of-concept version of the system, consisting of a T7 driven lysis cassette we were able to show that:
Cells can be specifically lysed upon induction of the lysis cassette.
DNA can be recovered from the lysed cells.
We get an enrichment of plasmids originating from lysed cells in a mock selection experiment.
In vitro TF characterization
We used a microfluidic based approach for characterizing TF mutants in vitro. The MITOMI method allows us to measure absolute binding affinities and specificities of transcription factors (Cite the science paper). We determined the precise binding energy landscape of the wild type TetR transcription factor. We also generated several TetR transcription factor mutants and determined the specificities of a number of the new variants.

Future work should be done in order to characterize this new biobricks and other generated by the online tool created in this work and increase the tools for control of gene expression.
Ethics
The undervalued but key ethical issues in synthetic biology mainly include reductionism and the bottom-up approach. Issues concerning safety, security and handling of intellectual property rights should mostly be related to politics not ethics. Instead there should be more focus on questions concerning life, specifically the reductionist (top-down) approach towards understanding life, and the bottom-up approach towards creating life. The issues are evaluated by a literature study and a survey based on that study, amongst 60 supervisors (and advisors) and 168 students involved iGEM 2009. The headlines:
Participants believe that the value of life cannot be changed by synthetic biology
Craig Venter's research is presumed not to involve creating new life forms, but rather applying genetic engineering
Safety and security issues are acknowledged and additional regulation should minimize their risks
Synthetic biologists are generally careful, but the public wants more
There is no relation between the existence of a God and sacred or holy properties of life
Communication with the general public is difficult but perceived necessary
Life can possibly never be explained by mankind
The reductionist approach towards understanding life is limiting

 A Glimpse of Our Journey
With the recent advance on CRISPR technology and a growing topic in the national conversation in Singapore, our iGEM project is at the heart of such a discussion. How far should we as a society accept technologies that change our genetic makeup? What are the important concerns that people may have? And even more fundamentally, how can our society become informed about such a niche topic, when it is now so close to our life?
With all the questions at our heart, we started to engage with our community to inform them about gene editing and understand their concerns. Through our public education and engagement, we had an intuitive understanding about people’s attitudes and we realized some mismatches between our focus and the concerns that other people have. Therefore, to fully convince ourselves, we decided to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the general attitude towards gene editing in this region. Below is what we have learned. 
Preliminary Research
 Motivation
To ensure our experience is not subjective and unique, we first started off by collecting and analyzing the different views of Singaporeans about gene editing technologies on different media platforms. We believe the different stands and the different arguments being raised would inform us about the main issues in the discussion.
 Summary of Arguments
In Singapore, proponents of gene editing argue that it is a great tool for us to cure genetic diseases. With the CRISPR/Cas system, target efficiency and specificity have been greatly improved. It promises an affordable solution for curing rare genetically linked diseases, the cost of which is unimaginable for many families. Lastly, many believe that it is important for many parents with genetic diseases to have an equal opportunity to have their children.  
However, opponents against gene editing argue that no one is born to be perfect, so we should not deliberately change our genetic makeup to eliminate disease causing-genes. Many also think that germline gene editing objectifies humans and violates bodily integrity. More importantly, many question the safety of such treatment, fearing for the variation in the results and the consequences that come after.
In general, the discussions in Singapore are capable of reaching the consensus that"

Newcastle_University,2008,Team:Newcastle University#Constraints Repository_-_-_TEXT.html," the necessary modifications to add the “BugBuster” parts to the MIT parts registry as novel BioBricks parts and devices.
Some examples of the questions asked to ascertain the compatibility of the biological compartments include;
How should two components interact to produce the desired effect within the system?
What are the possible biological components, within the parts database, that will generate the correct interaction type?
Are the kinetic parameters, associated with the interaction, likely to generate efficient transcription, gene expression or stable binding of the biological component?
Each valid interaction is stored as a mathematical model using the CellML format. This model is included in the database and is used by the circuit designer system, within the BugBuster Project, to produce a genetic circuit.
To populate the database, a thorough search of literature, public databases and existing tools was carried out. One biological component may interact with many different types of components and therefore possess many different interaction types. So initially, the type of interaction suitable within the context of the system must be identified. A list of potential parts which would induce a particular interaction type must be generated. This information is then coupled with a model to demonstrate the kinetic parameters.
In cases when literature did not contain information about an interaction, public databases and software tools were utilized. The Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) stores experimentally determined interaction information about protein coding components. One can search for proteins in numerous ways including sequence similarity and homologous motifs. However DIP does not supply information regarding non-protein coding biological components.
Programmes, such as GeneDesigner and BioSpice are tools designed specifically for synthetic biology. They provide a means of computationally constructing genetic circuits. A repository of general constraints and models are included in the tools. These provided a useful source of information.
The matrix
To populate the compatibility matrix I used three methods.
literature searching (google the parts and look through journals for conformation that they can interact/control gene expression of the connecting part)
Look at homologous structures of parts that have been confirmed to interact. If the structure is the same, they may also be compatible.
use blast of the DNA sequence two parts together to see the sequence exists at all. This would confirm compatibility.

What is iGEM?
iGEM is an international competition hosted by the MIT in Boston, USA, for undergraduate students of disciplines related to molecular biology. iGEM stands for International Genetically Engineered Machine competition. One the one hand, it targets to combine aspects of education and social collaboration among undergraduate students, on the other hand, it provides a library for standardized and interchangeable parts which can be used in living systems, particularly in model organisms like E. coli. Student groups from all over the world will receive a requested kit of biological parts, also called ""BioBricks"", and work over the summer on an individual research project. Every year, the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"" is upgraded with further BioBricks by the participating iGEM teams. These BioBricks will be accessible to the iGEM community in the following years in order to use these parts for their own projects.
The iGEM-logo. Click on the logo to get the iGEM-Homepage.
The iGEM competition started in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already 165 universities from all over the world competed against each other. This year, it is the first participation of the University of Göttingen, Germany. The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for students to gain and improve a multitude of skills that are necessary during a carrier as a molecular biologist. Such skills would be planning and organizing a project, including fund raising and team recruitment, coordination of lab work, designing experiments and working together as a team. Next to intensive lab work during the summer, also literature search and well-structured documentation of the experiments is crucial. Moreover, safety for humans and"

Göttingen
iGEM Göttingen visited Aachen and spend some time with us, when the DECHEMA Jahrestagung took place.  While giving them a tour around Aachen, we were talking about the progress of our projects.
HHU Düsseldorf
We participated in the postcard projec which they initiated. Moreover, we visited the NRW Day in Düsseldorf and presented our work to the public and to other iGEM Teams from North Rhine-Westphalia.
Contribution to METU HS Ankara Lab Protocols Collection
We were contacted by the iGEM Team METU HS Ankara . They had translated iGEM experiment protocols to Turkish and now had the idea to create a database consisting of protocols translated to different languages. We liked the idea of making those protocols accessible in every country, so we also contributed to this collection.
Thank you, for contacting us, iGEM METU HS Ankara and giving us the chance to add to the success of your project.
Click here to see the protocols we translated to German.
Survey
A useful tool to get different opinions on topics related to the iGEM team’s projects is conducting surveys. Therefore, you need as many participants as possible to get a broad spectrum of opinions. So our team decided to take part in the surveys of the different teams which can be seen below.
Thank you
Politics
We got in contact with many different politicians and asked them questions related to genetic engineering and the political situation in Germany.
The answers from the different political parties can be seen in the PDF files below.

Ethics
Until now we did not look at the ethical perspective of our project. After our conversations with the public and some other professors it is not surprising, that synthetic biology, which adapts and designs living organisms with many different applications, has a broad ethical dimension. An ethical dimension, an ethical discussion … ethical questions … ethics?
Many of us maybe heard about ethics, because of their philosophy courses or because of their religious education at school. Some of us maybe saw an ethic expert in television or in some TV discussion rounds. But what is ethic exactly?
Ethic is a branch of philosophy and refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong. Normally it defines what humans ought to do and what is wrong about their actions. Ethics is about trying to give answers to questions about how we have to react to or act in specific situations, what"

Most schools decided that students from the last year of high school, already specializing in vocational areas of  Physics-Math or Biology-Chemistry, should listen to this conference though our objective was to reach al three years of high school. A total of 470 students from the 5 schools participated in the activity, and a main body of 446 students that participated in all three sections was considered for the analysis. These students answered Survey 1, listened to the talk, and answered survey 2 afterwards.
Any survey section left blank by the survey taker was assigned NA except for obvious omission within the context of contiguous surveys, like school; hence,the actual number of answers may vary among columns.
Categorization of answers was based upon key word criteria, order of ideas mentioned, and broad concept underlying the answers. Any answer too difficult to categorize was assigned “other” as a category. See the examples mentioned in the Description section.
As a result, the data obtained from the survey takers can be analyzed according to many variables and many internal controls are present while surveying twice, thus our study workflow can be generalized and data from different studies with the same structure can put together into studies of a larger public.
Dynamics and Explanation of Lecture
Work tools:
PowerPoint presentation.
Blackboard for specific explaining.
Outline of lecture:
The lecture begins asking the audience about life and giving different concepts about life. the purpose of this is to give the first hit to students changing or getting an abstraction about what is life, eventually arriving at life as a combination of parts, namely genes.
Explaining how a gene looks like, the molecular ""working"" concept of genes and how these make functions. this is given  in a non-technical way.
At this moment we the elevate imagination of the student, creating expectations in them about many genes are many functions, like combining functions to create doctor-like bacteria, superman-like bacteria and bathroom-cleaning bacteria.
After moment 3, we explain the egnineering approach to biology with parallelisms  between computers and cells, and how bioparts can create a biomachine.
Then, ideas about what to do to understand and create a biomachine are explained with simple concepts of Restriction Enzymes,  and the importance of Statistics and Mathematical Model are introduced as when predicting the trajectory of a rocket.
then everything is taken to reality: What is iGEM competition, some shocking examples and own project.
Drawbacks, potential issues, purpose and the need to create an opinion about synthetic biology were reminded.

Have Fun in Hot Spring Valley
We are the first iGEM team that integrates  culture element into synthetic biology and opens a new leaf for in iGEM  society. In this part, we utilize the resources inside our home town by make a  relationship with our project and different institutes such as a hot spring  valley and Taipei astronomical museum factories.
In order to understand the sulfur  metabolism in our environment, we go to a hot spring valley which is an area  filled with sulfur resources. It’s a trade off for us to balance the  environment and synthetic biology. The best ways is combine the culture  elements and scientific factors to protect our environment, just as what we do.  By doing so, we guys can enjoy the atmosphere, enjoy research and enjoy iGEM.
Further more, not only do we collect several bacteria  from the hot spring, we also analyze it by molecular biology technology techniques  to find out whether bacteria can stay well and make use of sulfur element from  hot spring area or not. Furthermore, we young scientists make a discussion  about the impact from our project and understand what we can do to make our  hometown a better one. The most important thing is that we have lots of fun by  such a practical activity.

Safety & Security
In this chapter we have analysed the role of iGEM in the development and debate about the safety and security of synthetic biology. One of the problems about safety analysis of synthetic biology projects, is the fact that, in contrast to for example the chemical industry, there is too limited statistical data available. We think that iGEM should take the lead in the data collection about synthetic biology. There are multiple ways to do so. First of all, in our opinion it would be wise to consider the introduction of a specific track about biosafety. In that case, teams participating in this track work to create more general knowledge about the safety of synthetic biology. For example, they could do research into biosafety issues of specific constructs or into the real impact of horizontal gene transfer. Another, in our opinion, interesting possibility, could be to start a project, like interlab, about biosafety.  In this way, iGEM could start a large-scale and multi-annual project to collect the required data about biosafety and could play a key role in the development of synthetic biology.
We have also researched how safety is respected in other areas and fields. It appears that in many areas the analysis of possible safety issues is done in a more systematic way. Therefore,  we think it is important introduce more systematics in the analysis of risks of synthetic biology as well. Risk matrices can help with this. They are probably one of the most widespread tools for risk evaluation. A risk matrix has two dimensions, respectively probability of occurrence/likelihood and impact.  It looks at how large the impact is of a specific event and how likely it is that it will happen. These two dimensions create a matrix. The combination of probability and impact will give any event a place on a risk matrix.
The risk matrix is used as basic of our own risk analysis tool. We have developed a hands-on safety application that can be used by iGEM teams to analyze the safety issues of their project. In this application aspects such as the used chemicals, types of used micro-organism, etc. will be taken into account. The teams can use the tool to get in a more systematic and a visible insight into the risk issues of their project.

Modeling Methods
There are a lot of different mathematical representations, techniques, theories and algorithms to solve all kinds of different real world problems, e.g. physics, engineering or biology problems. In this section we discuss the different methods we made use of in order to be able to model our three different modules: the landmine detection module , the Extracellular Electron Transport module and the conductive curli module .
We made use of deterministic modeling methods, where you translate reactions that occur in nature to a set of ordinary differential equations and solve this resulting system analytically or numerically. We used Flux Balance Analysis, a method that"
NTU-Singapore,2016,Team:NTU-Singapore#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA cleavage. We started with deleting the REC2 domain to see if we could have similar results with our GFP reporter assay.
Then, we started on the nuclease domains, RuvCI, RuvCII, RuvCIII and HNH. Motivated by our results, we continued on the REC1 domain. Lastly, we went on to explore if truncations can be made on the PAM interacting domains of SP-dCas9.
Check out our Proof of Concept page on the truncation adventure!
Project Evaluation
Currently, there have been several Cas9/Cpf1 enzymes discovered and each has their own PAM specificity and sizes. For the Cas9 protein, the PAM sequence is on the 3' end of the target sequence. On the other hand, Cpf1 has a unique PAM sequence which is on the 5' end of target sequence. Another difference is that Cpf1 produces a sticky end after double strand break while Cas9 makes a blunt end break.
For our iGEM project, we made a comparison of efficiency among 5 Cas9/Cpf1 endonucleases: Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), Neiserria meningitides Cas9 (NmCas9), Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6 (AsCpf1) and Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 (LbCpf1). We targeted these Cas9/Cpf1 to 5 genes, ALK, EGFR, NF1, KDM6A and STAG2 with increasing expression levels and epigenetic modifcation of H3K27Ac.
a. ChIP-seq for H3K27Ac for five genes. b. RT-qPCR to measure the expression of 5 genes. Data taken from Dr. Tan Meng How's lab
From our CRISPR survey, we have found that most of the public are concerned about the specificity of Cas9 on genome editing. Studies have shown that when shorter gRNA lengths were used, specificity of Cas9 can be increased . Hence, for each gene, we compared what is the optimal length of gRNA required for editing, starting from 17bp to 24bp. . We then computed and compared the editing efficiency via T7E assay which detects the amounts of indels on the target. In order to have fair comparisons, all 5 Cas9/Cpf1 are targeted to the same target sequence. We further tested the HDR efficiency of the"

Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

As the two figures show, even with decreasing the concentration of Imidazole, no purification of dxCas9-Tn5 happened. The fusion protein broke apart. This can already be seen in the samples before purification (figure col 1 lane 2-5, figure col 2 lane 2-5). The conclusion is that the fusion protein probably breaks at the linke, due to two bands at approximatly the same height as dxCas9 and Tn5. Another purification will be done, now with a gradient elution.

Microcins
Microcin C51 (MccC51)
Microcins are a peculiar class of gene-encoded low-molecular-mass antibacterial peptides secreted by enterobacteria. They contribute to the regulation of microbial competition within the intestinal microbiota. The genetic systems involved in microcin biosynthesis share a conserved organization. Similar to bacteriocins, microcins exert potent antibacterial activity directed against phylogenetically-related bacterial strains, with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the nanomolar range.
Usually, microcins exhibit ""Trojan horse"" mechanisms of antibacterial activity: some microcin structures are a mime of essential elements, permitting recognition by outer membrane receptors used for vital functions in bacteria and further translocation into the periplasmic space, other microcins are secreted as harmless molecules and further processed in susceptible bacteria to form the toxic entity. When inside target bacteria, microcins bind essential enzymes or interact with the inner membrane to form a bacterial killing structure.
Microcin C51 is a nucleopeptide of 1.18 kDa molecular mass and the first described nucleopeptide antibiotic. It contains a heptapeptide with the N-terminal formylmethionine and C-terminal asparagine bound to AMP via an aliphatic chain. Microcine C51 is characterized by a broad spectrum of action. Expression in Escherichia coli is activated upon decelerated growth of cells during their transition to the stationary growth phase. This synthesis is controlled by four genes organized in an operon.
Our microcin strain has come from Severinov Laboratory at Rutgers State University (Severinov et al. Mol Microbiol. 2007)

We demonstrated that DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease proteins synthesing succesfully within clonning to pET45-b plasmid.

We have seen with the same origin in two plasmids can not be found in a bacterium simultaneously due to origin incompatibility process. For this reason, we decided to clonning one of these two gene sequences into pet45-b plasmid which have ColE origin and one of the gene sequence clonning into pColA plasmid which have ColA origin which also we designed it.

BOKU-Vienna,2017,Team:BOKU-Vienna#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"sticky” to hydrophobic surfaces by having them display an adhesive catecholamine moiety on their cell surface. These proteins are inspired by mussel adhesive proteins (with mussels being able to stick to almost any surface in an aquatic environment) and have been developed by J. P. Park et al. in 20142
. One disadvantage in the application of these proteins is that they require the addition of tyrosinase to the media, in order to be adhesive.
Accordingly, three genes have to be inserted into the E. coli chassis additionally to the helper construct : PETase, MHETase (both in D.I.V.E.R.T. cassettes) and the adhesive protein. Such a recombinant E. coli strain should be capable of growing on and degrading PET films.
Step 2 - Cell separation.
In order to screen for the most efficient mutant, mutant cells need to be separated first. Separation can theoretically be done using a flow cytometric cell sorter. In Flow Cytometry, cells in suspension are passed single file across a laser interrogation point. In the case of our application, light scattering signals from the laser could be measured, which correlates with cell morphology, to identify single cells and divert them from the fluid stream.3 This way, single cells can be sorted and assembled into microwell-plates with up to 100.000 wells.4 These wells can then theoretically be directly used for the screening process. One big downside of simply singling out cells into microwell plates is that they cannot incorporate a whole library created with D.I.V.E.R.T. In other applications it may be possible to classify the cells during the cell sorting process, but this is hardly possible with catalytic enzymes.
Step 3 - Cell screening.
In 2016 M. T. Zumstein5 reported their high-throughput screening method for enzymatic hydrolysis of biodegradable polyesters utilizing the co-hydrolysis of a fluorogenic ester for real time activity measurement. This approach also seems suitable for screening of PETase variants in concert with D.I.V.E.R.T. The authors embedded a fluorogenic ester in thin polyester films. As the hydrolytic enzymes degrade the polyester matrix, they likewise hydrolyse the embedded fluorogenic compound releasing the fluorophore into the reaction solution. This means that, as the enzymes degrade the polyester-film, a proportional increase in fluorescence can be measured. What makes this method ideal, is that it can be conducted in microtiter plates, by coating the well with the modified polyester film.

Sub Level 1:
The mutual interactions and kinetic laws are absolutely clear that only kinetic parameters are unknown or partly known. Based on the restrictions the user inputs, our software give a series of possible solutions to choose. In this sublevel, only parameter identification algorithm is recalled. Construction of E-parts of out wet team is on this sublevel.
Sub Level 2:
The mutual interactions are already known but kinetic laws are not that clear. Usually, the structure is clear to the users but kinetic laws are changeable for design. On the other hand, kinetic laws largely determine the dynamics. The Oscillator and Bistable Toggle Switch example is on this sub level.
Sub Level 3:
The reaction types are already known but mutual interactions are not that clear. Sometimes kinetic laws are easy to identify based on some basic ones like MassAction, Michaelis-Menten, or Hill Kinetics, etc. The Adaptation example is on this sublevel.
Sub Level 4:
Nothing is known about the design. Urr….. Just wait, we will give some solutions anyway. What you need to do is just to wait.

Gel to verify proper amplification (1% agarose gel, 10 µL 1 kb ladder, 120 V):
The OZ052 lanes (1-3) had bands at the proper length (328 bp) at all three concentrations, although there were several fainter bands likely from side products. Only the undiluted OZ123 lane showed any bands, and from the faint band at 328 and the stronger band around 250 it appears that the PCR did not work well, and the majority"

NYMU-Taipei,2010,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Project#Speedy protein degrader_-_-_TEXT.html," purposes within single living cells. FPs, together with modern microscopes, has become essential tools for studying spatial and temporal dynamics of cellular processes at high resolution.
The biophysical characteristics of fluorescent probes provide opportunities and, set limitations for fusion-protein studies. The fluorophore of GFP and its variants is contained within a barrel of beta-sheet protein (Ormo et al., 1996). This compact structure renders FPs with high photostability under a variety of conditions, even under treatment with protease (Chalfie et al., 1994). Once stable FPs formed, they are cleared from the cells in tens of hours (Andersen et al., 1998). This property allows prolonged imaging of cells, and easier detection when FPs accumulated. However, the stability of FPs limits its application in some studies which needs fast reporter turnover, for example, studies of transient gene expression. This also impedes the measurements of temporal expression pattern and behavior of proteins, because proteins at different stages of their lifetime are being detected. To overcome this limitation, we tried to develop destablized FPs.
There are several ways to generate FP variants with different spectral and expression properties. One approach is mutagenesis studies. Though this approach is fruitful (Delagrave et al., 1995; Heim et al., 1995; Zacharias et al., 2002), it seems impractical to screen possible mutations of each FP in ever-increasing FP libraries. Alternatively, we planed to control proteolysis by adding degradation tags to FPs (Andersen et al., 1998). This approach can be easily generalized to several FPs; thus, it provides extensibility to future applications.
Design: Controlled protein degradation in bacteria
We added the degradation tag to each fluorescent protein. This approach effectively accelerates reporter turnover.
The flow of genetic information can—and sometimes need to — depend not only on its controlled synthesis but also equally on its controlled degradation. Indeed, protein degradation in natural systems is essential for cellular functions. Previous study showed that 2.7% of proteins are degraded per generation in Escherichia coli (E. coli.) growing in logarithmic phase (Fox and Brown, 1961). Control of protein turnover is required for cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and rapid responses to environmental challenges (Grunenfelder et al., 2001; Hengge-Aronis, 2002; Neher et al., 2003). Therefore, regulated degradation is expected to be critical for the development of synthetic circuits.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#Experts_-_-_TEXT.html," and member of the department of infectious diseases, who mentioned emerging viruses. Emerging viruses are viruses that occur suddenly. Most of them are unknown or difficult to find. They can spread in no time. A good example for that are the Zika virus, the MERS-Corona virus, the Ebola virus or newly influenza viruses. As a basic researcher he thinks that our method can perfectly complement modern –omics methods by providing an antibody.
Further topics that are mentioned by other experts can be seen in the following figure:
Figure 1: Overview of expert answers.
To be able to use the mutagenesis system as a detection system we wanted to provide our reporter gen with a fluorescent dye. Thus we are able to detect a cell that produce a suitable Evobody. Also we can measure the strength of the fluorescence und thus conclude to the affinity of our target and Evobody.
Because some experts told us that we must consider the restricted protein folding in E. coli, thereby to look out for disulfide bridges we decided to use monobodies and nanobodies in our library. Proteins with disulfide bonds mostly can not be fold correctly in E. coli and therefore does not work with our bacterial two-hybrid system. Additionally, to begin with we plan to use our mutagenesis system as an antibody refinery like Prof. Dr. Bartenschlager advocates. Thus, we are producing antibody mimetics and provide their sequence to other researchers."

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#microtubule_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulin dimers anchored on the yeast surface and those in the solution determine how efficient the system is. The simulation result is presented below.
Figure 4 Microtubule polymerization with different ratios between the concentration of tubulin dimers on the yeast surface and those in the solution. “Strength” is the total number of tubulin dimers that assembled on the yeast surface. $k_{ptp}=8.9{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{pdp}=7.5{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{ptm}=4.7{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{pdm}=4.0{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{stp}=44s^{-1}$, $k_{sdp}=500s^{-1}$, $k_{stm}=23s^{-1}$, $k_{sdm}=700s^{-1}$, $k_n=5{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1} $, $C_{m1}=20{\mu}M$.
Here, “strength” is the total number of tubulin dimers assembled on the yeast surface, which reflects how efficient the tubulin dimers are being used. This quantity can be measured by fluorescence intensity, which means that our results can be tested by experiments. We can see that as the relative concentration of tubulin dimers displayed on yeasts increases, the number of dimers assembled on yeasts first increases and then stabilizes at around the ratio of 0.4. This suggests that attempting to increase the ratio to a point beyond 0.4 is unnecessary.
Next, we set the ratio to be 0.5 (to ensure the robustness of the model) and examine the polymerization on the yeast surface with different GTP hydrolysis constant $k_h$. Below is the simulation result.
Figure 5 Microtubule polymerization with different GTP hydrolysis rate constant. “Strength” is the total number of tubulin dimers that assembled on the yeast surface. Note that the vertical coordinate is logarithmic. $k_{ptp}=8.9{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{pdp}=7.5{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{ptm}=4.7{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{pdm}=4.0{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{stp}=44"

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics background_-_-_TEXT.html," brain efficiently. One of the things that humans have used their brain for, is to give definitions to the things that they saw and heard. So what about LIFE? Society has come to a point where it wants to make a distinction between living systems (with the potential to expire) and non-living systems. But the problem is to make a clear cut between these two. The scientific community has come up with some properties that are specific for living systems, such as the ability to reproduce, evolve and metabolize. Although these properties are quite clear, it is also suggested that this list is insufficient. We still don't know for certain what constitutes life. Moreover, scientists tend to look at living systems with a biochemical approach. But what if biological systems are fundamentally special in some way? Is there more to life than we can imagine? Is there a higher power? Is life holy or sacred? We just don't know. However, it is definitely important to distinguish how life is perceived by the general public and what is believed and proven in science.
René Magritte, Ceci n'est pas une pipe. As Magritte himself commented: ""The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? No, it's just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture 'This is a pipe,' I'd have been lying!"" (cited in Harry Torczyner, Magritte: Ideas and Images, p. 71.)
How people perceive information of any kind differs between individuals. External influences play a great role and cultural differences have a big hand in the process of believing and perceiving. Additionally, what we perceive to be true might not be the reality. This concept is beautifully depicted in Margritte's painting, which makes people realize they are not looking at a pipe, but at a painting, which is flat and contains paint applied on canvas.
Synthetic biology is a key player in the search for answers regarding life. The reductionism approach that has proven itself to be very useful in physics and chemistry is now applied in biology to get to know the foundation of life. Fundamental research on the molecular level has given us indication that DNA is the basis of all life forms and genetic engineering has given researchers the ability to change this genetic code. But is that all? Or is there more to it? Should we go on with chasing answers for these typical questions? What happens if we find out?
One of the results of the top-down approach towards understanding living systems is that we can now understand how certain substructures of complex living systems work, and sometimes even"

Experiments & Protocols
In the course of our project we performed various experiments, ranging from construction and transformations of plasmids into E. coli over the testing of their functionality and response measurements after induction of our circuit, up to experiments with mammalian cells, which are the subjects of our analysis. In addition, we designed and tested a microfluidic setup for our final system
Below you can find the protocols for all our experiments, grouped into experiments with bacteria , mammalian cells , the combination of both , and some general useful basics .
E. coli experiments
Overview
The first important feature of our engineered E. coli is their binding capability to apoptotic cells via our INP-Annexin V construct which makes them display Annexin V on their outer membrane. We performed experiments to show expression , externalization , and functionality of this construct.
In our system, the actual detection of E. coli binding to apoptotic cancer cells happens via quorum sensing upon colocalisation of bound bacteria. We therefore designed experiments to test the quorum sensing properties of our final and working constructs.
The second signal which will be integrated by our bacteria is the elevated lactate production by cancer cells when compared to non-cancer cells. The main part of the"

The figure shows an example of this where the mammalian cell line U-2 OS is transfected with a Plug ‘n’ Play assembled plasmid expressing GFP with a targeting sequence localizing the produced GFP to the peroxisomes of the cell. As a proof of concept of the Plug ‘n’ Play assembly system, the Copenhagen team proved the easy assembly as well as successful function in bacteria.

Figure 2: The concept of our in vivo copper sensor ( BBa_K1758324 ), which consists of the activator under the control of a constitutive promoter ( BBa_K1758320 ) and the operator and promoter sequence of the copper inducible promoter. An untranslated region in front of the sfGFP, which is used for detection, enhances its expression ( BBa_K1758323 ).
Figure 3: Time course of the induction of a copper biosensor with sfGFP for different copper concentrations in vivo. The data are measured with BioLector and normalized on OD600. Error bars represent the standard deviation of two biological replicates.
Figure 4: Fluorescence levels at three different stages of cultivation. Shown are levels after 60 minutes, 150 minutes and 650 minutes.
We tested our in vivo copper sensor with sfGFP as reporter gene, to test the functionality of the system. Moreover, we tested different copper concentrations. The kinetic of our sensors response to different copper concentrations is shown in figure 3. The first ten hours show a strong increase in fluorescence. After that the increase in fluorescence is slower. For better visualization the kinetics of figure 3 are represented as bars in figure 4. A fluorescence level difference for 60 min, 150 min and 650 min is represented.
In vivo we could show that the adding different concentrations of copper has effects on the transcription levels of sfGFP.
The shown data suggest that sensing copper with our device is possible even if the detectable concentrations are higher than the desireble sensitivity limits. Therfore we tested the copper sensor in our in vitro transcription translation approach.
in vitro
For the characterization of the copper sensor with CFPS we used parts differing from that we used in vivo characterization. For the in vitro characterization we used a cell extract out of cells which contain the plasmid  ( BBa_K1758320 ) (figure 5), so that the resulting extract is enriched with the activator CueR. To this extract we added plasmid-DNA of the copper specific promoter copAP with 5’-UTR-sfGFP under the control of T7-promoter ( BBa_K1758325 ) to the cell extract. The T7-promoter is needed to get a better fluorescence expression.

Uppsala,2016,Team:Uppsala#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," are affected by hazardous substances or processes are essential. Information from outer science units can contribute with knowledge of great importance to the risk decision process, which is why it is important to incorporate these in the scientific framework.
Scientific analyses are not always neutral and objective in all manners either. An analysis in science is often neutral in the sense of not taking part in a dispute and it is often objective in the manner of observations notices so that others shall be able to obtain the same results. But in the sense of framing problems science are not necessarily objective and neutral. For example the risks of indoor pollutants draws attention from the potential comparative risk of the problems from ambient pollutants and analyses of risks of drunk driving that points out driver’s behaviour as a cause of traffic accidents, takes the highlights away from the importance of automobile and highways design (National Research Council, 1996).
In addition, science is not necessarily neutral in its assumptions. Standard statistical assumptions can raise questions according to bias. The null hypothesis is commonly used in risk analysis and its assumptions has biased traits since it puts a higher weight of proof on those who would like to restrict rather than those who would pursue a potential harmful activity (Rosner and Markowitz, 1985; Lilienfeld, 1991). Scientists may also possess a more powerful position to affect risk decisions since certain risks only can be discovered with quantified and highly technical methods. Without transfer of information, non-specialists are more fragile and less able to challenge or confirm the proposals of scientific units.
With these points in mind, science alone cannot provide a completely comprehensive base of decision-making. Science can tell which decision alternative that would give rise to fewest deaths, fewest new cancers and fewest workdays lost to illness etc. But it cannot tell whether it is better with 30 percent of cancer risk to one individual than 15 percent of cancer risk to two individuals. Thus, science cannot obtain information about how effects of scientific results shall be treated in the context of a decision (Stein et al. 1996).
Conclusion
In purpose to encourage and foster information transfer between the scientific platform and the public, Uppsala iGEM team has decided to cooperate with the organization Makerspace. The organization was created by enthusiasts of science in 2012 with the purpose of making knowledge of biosynthetic procedures more accessible for all public units.  The project of Uppsala iGEM team 2016 provides an economical profitable pathway of microfluidic-linked procedures, e.g. transformation, which make scientific techniques more accessible at more basic dorms.

UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#GRAS_-_-_TEXT.html,"AG-GAG-GAA-AAA-AAA exhibited the highest specific activity (expressed in miller units). Also documented is that in both in vivo and in vitro situations B. subtilis ribosomes required more extensive Shine-Dalgarno complementarity for efficient translation initiation and the effects of spacing were profound on expression (35). With such considerations in mind, our RBS sequences were designed with the incorporation of this ideal spacing and Shine-Dalgarno for maximum expression activity.
The expression cascade for B. subtilis was designed as follows:
pVEG = A very strong constitutive promoter for B. subtilis. Chosen for its transcriptional strength and compatibility for B. subtilis. Total DNA insert size = 237 bp (36).
RBS A = Designed with two primer sequences annealed together, each containing segments for Golden Gate assembly with pVEG and HO. The annealed assembly is 21 bp long.
HO = The Heme Oxygenase genetic construct catalyzes the conversion of heme to Biliverdin IX alpha. This genetic construct is 726 bp.
RBS B = Designed with two primer sequences annealed together, each containing segments for Golden Gate assembly with HO and PcyA. The annealed assembly is 21 bp long.
PcyA = Phycocyanobilin / ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA) reduces Biliverdin IX alpha to PCB. This genetic construct is 750 bp (37).
B0015 Terminator (used 2x) = iGEM part - double terminator consisting of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B012. This is the most commonly used iGEM terminator (38). Biology: rrnBt1-T7TE, Chasis: E. coli and B. subtilis, Direction: Forward. Length: 129 bp.
IPTG Inducible Promoter = Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside , abbreviated IPTG , binds to the lac repressor and releases the tetrameric repressor from the lack operator in an allosteric manner, thus permitting lac operon gene transcriptase. Compatible in E. coli and in B. subtilis. We ordered this promoter through IDT as a g-block and cloned this gene out as well from pHT43 as two methods of derivation. Length: 107 bp

PcrD has an HA-tag inserted at the C terminal.  PcrB forms a periplasmic heterodimer with PcrA and comprises the active complex of perchlorate reductase. PcrC is a C-type cytochrome that connects the AB complex to the periplasmic membrane, allowing for electron shuffling. PcrD is predicted to be a molybdenum chaperone protein specific to assembling the pcrABC system. (Youngblut et. al.,2016)

Teams may use the parts in this collection to allow their chassis to reduce chlorite to chloride and oxygen, which might be useful for soil detoxification or O2 production where chlorite or perchlorate is present. For perchlorate reduction, the enzymes below must be used along with Perchlorate Reductase (see above) as that enzyme reduces ClO4- to ClO2-, which is the substrate that chlorite dismutase uses.

In addition, Bob Mulder, the communication specialist of Wageningen UR and team adviser, pointed out the following principle: ""Don’t change the consumer, change the technology"". After several conversations with beekeepers from the NBV and through Bob Mulders advise, it became clear that an improved product must meet the following criteria:
It should be effective and specific, not killing the bees or have any negative influence on the beekeepers.
It should be adapted to the hobbyist character of beekeeping, ensuring the viability of E. coli in the sugar water so no changes have to be made in beekeeping practices.
It should not interfere with honey, like the curent usage of thymol does.

We contacted the Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) to help us in designing an applicable format for BeeT. After mutual visits, a design student from the DAE – Thieu Custers -  proposed a product that incorporated the daily practices of beekeepers and BeeT: A juicebox-like product that beekeepers apply to the sugar water just before the start of the winter.
BeeT design and product description by Thieu Custers, Design Academy Eindhoven.
""I am interested in combining disciplines to discuss ideas and come to new solutions. By using science and art together, I aim to tell stories about what could be our future. I want to take existing conflicts or themes and envision what could be their consequences or solutions, to broaden our understanding of the present.
BeeT is an innovative approach to solving a man-made problem. Implementing a genetically engineered bacterium into the agricultural sector is something that should be done carefully. It opens up a dialogue about the use of altered organisms in daily life. Communicating both the risks and the merits of such a precise tool is the most important to me. Genetic engineering is a new technology that is met with a lot of fear, but by completely and openly showing the inner workings, it can be assessed honestly.
With BeeT specifically, the challenge is going to be to gain acceptance in the world of beekeeping. The design of the BeeT container is meant to be clear in use, and will show which hive is currently being treated with the bacteria. The marking label is still connected to the container of the bacteria, ensuring no mix up of labelling.""
BeeT will, via the sugar water, end up in the brood food and be transported to cells where bee larvae grow and where the mites are present. Inside the cell"

Experimental Results
Testing of Or as a Promoter
The backbone of the radiation sensor in our project relies on part BBa_K648029. This part includes the operating region Or and two promoters, one on each end of Or. In order to test the functional ability of the of the pr promoter we attached a part called mcherry, which has rfp controlled by the promoter. We used the TECAN in our lab to measure the fluorescence of our samples over time. The data collected while the samples were in exponential growth was used to determine a rate of expression of the rfp. Compared to the control, the rate of fluorescence was much higher in our test subject, about 4227 compared to 418 (fu/OD600nm). This suggests that the promoter on Or is functional.
Future Testing
As part of our reporter project focused on improving the part developed by Imperial College London iGEM 2010 (BBa_K316007) we began by characterizing their test part K316009 . The data for this test, using the standard catechol assay described by their team here is show below.
This data shows that, while their part is capable of extremely fast conversion of catachol to 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde, it is also subject to extreme input sensitivity that leads to significant results of color production seen from both induced and un-induced cells.
Much of the additional work for our project that expands on this data is still underway and due to time constraints cannot be posted before wiki freeze deadline. More characterization and testing of all the parts we are actively building is on the way and should be accomplished by the Jamboree.See our project pages for more information.

Northeastern,2016,Team:Northeastern#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," H+. Functional Proteorhodopsin is expected only from the group induced with beta-carotene and exposed to light. However the ATP/ADP ratios of both the induced light and induced dark groups were higher than the uninduced groups and they were within error of each other. This suggests a potential leakage of light into the induced dark group. Nevertheless the activated construct is producing a measurable effect on the ATP/ADP ratio compared to inactivated forms without beta-carotene.
Proteorhodopsin Culture pH Characterization
To demonstrate the effect of our proteorhodopsin construct on the pH of the extracellular environment BL21 E. coli were transformed with BBa_K1282002 and cultured in experimental groups for 29 hours. pH of the cultures was measured using pH probes every 6 hours and at the end of the experiment. Active proteorhodopsin should result in an increase in extracellular H+ and thus a decrease in pH of the culture over time. pH across all samples increased over the duration of the experiment however the pH of the induced light group, which was expected to have functional proteorhodopsin maintained the lowest pH at every timepoint throughout the experiment.
NOX Dissolved Oxygen Consumption
This dissolved oxygen assay was conducted to determine whether or not BBa_K1282003 was producing NOX sufficiently to impact dissolved oxygen levels. Over the course of the first 10 minutes the PBS containing BBa_K1282003 transformed Bl21 E. coli lost 35% of the initial  dissolved oxygen whereas the PBS containing the control BL21 group saw only a 5% decrease.  This is important in the context of microbial electrolysis cells as cells only function at high efficiency in anaerobic environments, by using a biological means of helping to maintain an anaerobic state this construct can likely increase the efficiency of microbial electrolysis cells.
A CFU count was conducted in order to determine whether the observed difference in dissolved oxygen consumption was due only to a difference in number of cell counts between the control BL21 and the BBa_K1282003 transformed cells. Average CFU/ml were calculated using counts from the 4 replicate plates of the 1:1000 dilution from the OD normalized liquid cultures. The mean CFU/ml of the liquid cultures are displayed in the table at the right, and show that the BL21 culture had a higher CFU/ml than NOX did both as a raw mean and over the 95% confidence intervals of the two means. This demonstrates that BBa_K1282003 was causing a significant increase"

今回もDNAの転写、リボソームによるmRNAからの翻訳を動画を見ることによって理解をイメージを湧きやすくしていきました。 実際、それぞれがまだはっきりとわかっていない点が多いかもしれないので、そこは教えあうような環境作りなどが必要かもしれません。 どこを疑問に思っているかを表現できれば、先に進むチャンスだと思います。
また、知っている人にとっては教科書的記述の多い部分なので少し退屈かもしれないので、さらに発展的な内容を盛り込んでいけば全体の活気もさらに上がっていくでしょう。 この点についても考えていきたいです。

Overview
This year we participated in the Fifth International InterLab Measurement Studyas an IGEM team.
As part of the Bronze Award,The goal of the iGEM InterLab study is to identify and correct sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements so that ultimately measurements made in different laboratories are not more variable than measurements made in the same laboratory.In the course of the experiment, we strictly follow the experimental procedures to obtain the most accurate data.We successfully completed the experiment and submitted the data within the expected time.
Calibration Protocols
We firstly completed the Calibration protocols including The OD600 reference point,Particle Standard Curve,   Fluorescence standard curve.
Here are our OD600 reference point:
Particle standard curve：
Fluorescein standard curve:
Cell measurement Protocol
In the experiment, we performed bacterial transformation according to the officially recommended method. But Test Device   1 and Test Device 5 are not transformed. We contacted NPU-China and got these two strains from them. Then we completed the follow-up work as scheduled.
1.Make a 1:10 dilution of each overnight culture in LB+Chloramphenicol (0.5mL of culture into 4.5mL of LB+Chlor).
2.Measure Abs600 of these 1:10 diluted cultures.
3.Record the data.
4.Dilute the cultures further to a target Abs600 of 0.02 in a final volume of 12 ml LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube covered with foil to block light.
5.Take 500 µL samples of the diluted cultures at 0 hours into 1.5 ml epp"

Today we began researching for a procedure to begin purifying phage. We have found that T7 can self assemble with scaffolding proteins without forming procapsids, and that T4 has only been know to form procapsids. We may not have to worry about T4 if the other group isn't using it.
Important findings -  Phage have been purified before Phage capsids can self assemble Phage (amber strain) can have their genes knocked out to make a hollow phage

BioMORTAR: 3-Part Genetic Design Suite
The 2010 Illinois iGEM Tools Team is constructing a program to design a plasmid in-silico for the user-specified host bacteria as well as model the growth of the designed cell.
The web-based program will begin by implementing the desired metabolic pathway computed by a greatly improved version of last year's project, IMPtools, then by determining the recommended enzymes for each reaction, and accessing the DNA sequence for it. In the meantime, the program will model the growth of the user specified bacteria with the new metabolic pathway to optimize the plasmid design. Finally, it will construct and display, with annotation, the advised plasmid(s) for the user as well as display important information on projected growth.
An additional function will be a program-based plasmid registry that not only allows for users to display, to others, what plasmids they hold in the lab, but it will also reference these stored plasmids to the other users looking to implement the generated plasmid design. In addition, it will have the option to adhere to the iGEM biobrick standards and will reference the biobrick database.
As a whole, the program will not only give the user the optimal plasmid design for the metabolic process, but it will project growth for the modified bacteria and connect the user with the other users storing the necessary plasmids.

UV Hardware
Leave as is but UV exposure is not killing bacteria even at 1 hour of exposure, going to try moving closer to lights, right now we are at 8”
Problem with kill curve experiment: Some plates with high UV exposure have more growth than plate exposed to lower amounts of UV. In addition, GFP expression across plates are inconsistent.
potential hypotheses:
UV light is not close enough to kill majority of bacteria.
Bacteria is under stress due to UV irradiation and does not use pGLO plasmid as it doesn’t seem to provide benefit. Note that we are irradiating bacteria with a wide UV spectrum while GFP only absorbs a fraction of it.
The TSB media partially absorbs UV light, sheltering bacteria.

Introducing the Missouri Miners
Our History
The Missouri S&T iGEM team was founded under the guidance of Dr. Katie Shannon in 2006.  Dr. Shannon learned about the iGEM program at MIT through research associates from Missouri Western State University. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology had pioneered a collaborative research effort to use engineering principles to solve biological problems.  Their approach, coined Synthetic Biology, is based on creating a library of interchangeable genetic parts for bacteria and yeast. MIT expanded this project under the International Genetically Engineered Machines banner (iGEM for short). The first competition took place in the summer of 2004 with 5 teams. MIT is expecting 180+ teams in 2010.
The Missouri S&T team began with two simple projects of building a biological clock in Escherichia coli and an ethanol sensor in yeast. The projects acted as a test bed while students learned and perfected lab techniques. The team initially split into two research groups, one pursuing the clock while the other began work on an ethanol sensor and the two projects were presented together at the 2007 iGEM Jamboree. The clock project was retired after the 2007 Jamboree, and the ethanol sensor was continued for  2008 iGEM competitions. After the 2008 competition the sensor was retired and the team began its most ambitious project yet.
As the 2008 iGEM competition was wrapping up, some students on the team proposed a new project. Using genes from Geobacter sulfurreducens that shuttled electrons outside of the cell, the team wanted to construct an aerobic microbial fuel cell by moving the genes from G. sulfurreducens to E. coli.

Technion_Israel,2015,Team:Technion Israel#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,". The fact that this assumption may not be correct is one of the main reasons we chose to overproduce NADPH as a part of our project.
In fact, this model does not acknowledge the fact that the enzyme requires a cofactor in order to work, so we cannot use it as a good simulator of our system.
Nevertheless, in situations where these conditions exist, this model offers a simple tool for prediction that is easy to understand and analyse.
Approach 2 – cofactor saturation assumption
In this part we will look thoroughly at the mechanics of the enzyme and develop new rate equations for the system that will take cofactor levels into account. Later we will analyse those equations and explain how they correlate with our previous model and with our wetlab results.
The rate equation for an enzyme
Let \({K_{cat}}\) be the the number of substrate molecule each enzyme site converts to product per unit time and P the number of product molecules. If we have N enzymes in our solution, the rate equation for the product of the enzyme will be:
\(\frac{{dP}}{{dt}} = {K_{cat}} \cdot \sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {{1_{enzym{e_i}}}} \)
where:
\({1_{enzym{e_i}}} = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{1,}&{if\,the\,enzme\,currently\,converts\,a\,substrate}\\{0,}&{else}\end{array}} \right.\)
is the indicator fuction for each enzyme.
If an enzyme operates in both directions, with different velocities for each direction, the rate equation will be:
\[\frac{{dP}}{{dt}} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {{K_{enzym{e_i}}}} \] where:
\[{K_{enzym{e_i}}} = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{{K_{ca{t_{forward}}}}}&{if\,enzyme\,converts\,substrate\,to\,product}\\{{K_{ca{t_{backwards}}}}}&{if\,enzyme\,converts\,product\,to\,substrate}\\0&{else}\end{array}} \right.\]
We'll assume that \({P_{reactio{n_{forward}}}}\) and \({P_{reactio{n_{backwards}}}}\) - the probabilities for each reaction to occur"

Farnesol production device( BBa_K1653025 )
To realize ""Flovorator"" we need to make E. coli produce Farnesol. Surprisingly, We have succeeded in farnesol production by Farnesol production device. Our new biobrick device ""Farnesol production device"" worked as expected. Because we validate this fact  by GC-MS analysis experimentally. We have documented and submitted this new Biobrick device( BBa_K1653025 ) to iGEM Registry .
Farnesol is probably generated through FPP hydrolysis by endogenous phosphatases, which are induced by an increased intracellular FPP level. Analogously, we hypothesized that E. coli could produce farnesol under cellular conditions of an increased intracellular FPP level through metabolic engineering. A MEP pathway has been shown to synthesize IPP and DMAPP efficiently in E. coli. Because of its high hydrophobicity and low volatility, decane was chosen to extract and solubilize farnesol from culture broth. The decane overlay in the two-phase culture did not affect growth, and farnesol could be solubilized in the decane phase with negligible volatile loss. We adopt 1 mL of decane overlaid to 5 mL of culture broth. Two-phase culture of E. coli JM109 (BBa_K1653025) was carried out in 2YT medium containing  1% glycerol at 29°C for 48 h. The decane phase of the two-phase culture was collected to analyze the farnesol content by GC-MS. In the GC-MS analysis (Fig. 3 A-G), there was a main peak at 8.5 min in the collected decane phase sample, which corresponded to the reference solution of the standard farnesol compound dissolved in decane. Mass spectrometry confirmed that the peak at 8.5 min was f"

""A winner is a dreamer who never gives up."" - Nelson Mandela
In my opinion, humans know only the tip of the iceberg of science. I wish one day I can know what is under the water. Passion and curiosity push me to learn more and more about it.
Why iGEM ? iGEM was for me the occasion to carry out a project starting from an initial idea and until its term. Find an idea, confront myself to constraints, develop the solutions and always improve it. iGEM is the opportunity to discover the vastness of science.

""Nothing is worth more than this day."" - Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe
As you never know what tomorrow has to offer, I believe that every single day should be lived as if it was the last. The thing is that it is easy to forget this philosophy when caught in the vicissitudes of life. Keeping on smiling while living by this moto has become my inspiration for the future. Determined and motivated, I tend to be a little too perfectionist which can be annoying and prejudicial to my work.
Why iGEM ? This ambitious contest has been the opportunity for me to develop an innovative scientific idea. Starting from scratches, this project was challenging in both scientific and human relations aspects.  It is such a rewarding experience which lessons will help me in future challenges.

Passionate and committed, I can spend days on a single question or idea, as long as I did not get a trustable answer. I enjoy achieving team projects, equipped with my smile and willingness.
Why iGEM ? I firstly looked for informations by curiosity, and I was so amazed by the concept of iGEM that I rushed head down in the contest ! More than improving my scientific knowledge, I also wanted to learn more about every other skills required to lead a project from A to Z: imagination, social skills, scientific background, confidence in others, financial literacy, open-mindedness, self confidence…

In order to verify the preservation effect of SAHS protein, we resuscited the lyophilized sample and performed PCR experiments to verify the activity of Taq enzyme. The activity of Taq enzyme can be reflected by the product of PCR.
Figure 4. PCR results of Taq enzymes preserved at different SAHS protein concentrations.
We selected different PCR systems for verification. We found that some short fragments were easy to succeed, but there was no obvious gradient. However, when we replaced them with some other fragments that are difficult to succeed or very long, there would show a very obvious gradient. We think it must be that a shorter fragments were too easy to succeed, and made the base too large. The two fragments above are pET-28a, which had a relatively obvious gradient and also had a good repeatability.
Figure 5. The result of the comparison of PBS and ultra-pure water. Blank is the group that the Taq enzyme has not been lyophilized and without SAHS protein.
In addition, we also made a comparison between  PBS and ultra-pure water. We found that regardless of the presence of TDP, the lyophilized system added with PBS could not make the correct band. On the contrary, there was only one large band which was much larger than 8000bp. We think it may be a PCR mismatch. Considering that PBS contained a large amount of salt, it was likely that these salt ions affected the binding of Taq enzyme to Mg2+.
Figure 6. The ruselt of the success rate of PCR with Taq enzymes preserved at different SAHS protein concentrations.
Then, we tried some shorter fragments for PCR, and interfered with the PCR system by reducing time extension and reducing the concentration of the template in order to explore the success rate of PCR. As the figure showed, when the concentration of SAHS protein was 0.5 g/L, the success rate of PCR was the highest. We suspected that excessive concentration of SAHS protein might affect the normal function of the Taq enzyme and might affect the binding of the enzyme to the substrate. This reminded us of the results of TUDelft in 2017. They also got the result of that 0.5 g/L was better than 1 g/L in some cases. Eventually, they took a concentration of 1 g/L to preserve Cas13a. They discovered that while CAHS 94205 preserved Cas13a's RNase-like activity"

Our Project
What component has the largest amount in human body? Cell or Gene? Neither of the options are right. In fact, it’s microbe! The number of microbes is 10 times larger than that of human cells. Only in our gut, there are more than 100 trillion bacteria, which help the body digest food, produce vitamins to prevent diseases caused by bacteria in the food and stimulate the immune system.
With the in-depth researches, scientists have founded that intestinal microbiota also plays a key role in many chronic diseases and symptoms, such as inflammation and obesity. Some other researchers also suggests one possibility that regulating intestinal microflora might treat diabetes. In addition, newest research has revealed that microbes in the gut can ""command” our brains to work. There is an increasing number of evidences indicating that gut flora can really influence our thinking, mood, behavior, and feelings.
We searched for some of the most common and important intestinal microorganisms(click here to find more information) to study their functions, as well as their effects on their host. Amazed at the little creatures colonized in our intestines. For the reasons above, our team want to focus on certain kinds of intestinal micro flora, studying the interaction, location and relationship among them."
