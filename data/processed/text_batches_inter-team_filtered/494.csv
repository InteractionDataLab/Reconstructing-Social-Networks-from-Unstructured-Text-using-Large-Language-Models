Part 2: THU-E Tryptophan-sensor Part
Aplasmid  used for performance test of our novel tryptophan sensor.
The sensor  was derived from one regulation sequence upstream of tryptophanase(tnaA) operon  in wild type E. Coli [3] . This sequence codesone 24-residue nascent peptide. Following  this nascent peptide sequence stands one transcription termination factor (Rho)  recognition sites. When certain amount of tryptophan exists, it is recognized  by the nascent peptide. This leads to the hindering of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro  from being cleaved from ribosome. This peptide-mRNA-ribosome complex blocks Rho  factor’s access to its binding site which is just adjacent to termination codon  of nascent peptide so that initiate the transcription of downstream sequence. As  far as we know, this novel mechanism has not been utilized before as tryptophan  sensor.
As a proof of  principle, we cloned beta-lactamase gene lacZ downstream of wild type nascent peptide and Rho interaction sequence. The  assembly was cloned between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pTrc99A vector with  IPTG induction.By measuring the activity of beta-lactamase activity (the  protocol has been described in detail in our note, please refer to it) after  induction and 21-hours culture, we obtained our expected tryptophan dependent  beta-lactamase activity increase with dynamic range up to 3mM tryptophan.

iGEM Students
Following our gratifying adventure at BioCurious, the team felt confident in the role DIY biotech would play in synthetic biology innovation. We were also inspired to know that by participating in the iGEM competition, we were at the forefront of this revolutionary movement. The projects being designed, teams being forged, and ideas being meticulously crafted by teams across the globe represented how powerful and widespread this movement has become. iGEM itself, consisting of only 32 teams a mere ten years ago, represents the vigor of how rapidly this movement has grown to its now current state. Given our views on the movement, we wanted to reach out to other iGEM teams to understand how they viewed the DIY biotech movement.
For this we decided to reach out to our friends at the UCLA iGEM team, whom we met at the 17th Annual University of California Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium hosted by the Bioengineering Institute of California. The iGEM team at the University of California, San Diego, were kind enough to invite the UCLA iGEM team, the UC Davis iGEM team, and ourselves to meet at the Symposium in San Francisco. Each morning of the Symposium, June 13th-15th, we all met in a reserved room at the Symposium to present and discuss our projects to one another. It was a valuable and much-appreciated opportunity to connect with other iGEM students and form relationships with passionate, creative, and intelligent individuals. For this year’s competition, the gifted UCLA iGEM presented their impressive focus on protein cages with potential use in drug delivery.
Interestingly, the team had heard of Do-It-Yourself biology but did not fully understand the extent of its meaning. To provide a description of Do-It-Yourself biology, we linked the idea to what the iGEM teams were currently doing; in that we were utilizing technologies previously prohibited by high costs. When asked if they had considered DIY biology prior to iGEM, the UCLA students admitted that they had interests in joining research labs but had never considered taking projects into their own hands. When asked about the barriers that stand in the way of engaging in synthetic biology projects, they mentioned how equipment such as thermocyclers were a necessity as well as the education needed to apply them. We brought up the plummet"

Human Practice
Part A. Game: Bacteria war
One day, a group of unknown viruses invaded the tribe of bacteria, bacteria have fought off waves of enemies, but it seems that the war will still last...
There are four kinds of viruses, and each kind of viruses will cause different damage. The aim of the game is to help bacteria resisting the viruses and winning the victory of the battle. And you can update your bacteria after one level cleared.
‘Bacteria War’ is developed based on android platform. The develop progress is a little difficult but enjoyable. We created the setting, roles and game rules on our own and we are keeping improving the game. For example, players can control the bacteria only by accelerometer at first.  But now, players can also control it by joystick.
We have learned from some similar games during the develop process. We’d like to give our great gratitude to predecessors.
When a player open the game, he’ll see a brief introduction of iGEM in the home page.That’s why we developed the game. We’d like to let more people know about iGEM and synthetic biology.
Part B.Introductory videos
CRISPR may be an unfamiliar field for most ordinary people. In order to make it easier to understand and get more people to know about synthetic biology and iGEM, we made some short introductory videos.
In the first video, we’d like to give a brief description of our project. And the next two videos are about the desktop version and android version of CRISPR-X. Please check out and you will have a preliminary understanding of our software.
Wish you will also be attracted by synthetic biology!
If you can’t see the video, maybe you can try to click on the links below to view them on Youku.
Brief introduction of the whole project: Video 1 .
Desktop version of CRISPR-X: Video 2 .
Android version of CRISPR-X: Video 3 .
Part C.High school visit and lecture
On April 29, we visited Chengdu No.7 senior high school, which is the best high school in Chengdu. We made a lecture about the iGEM and synthetic biology. Before the visit, we prepared eye-catching posters and organized slide for the sake of making it easier to understand.
First of all, as the representative of our team, Wu Yaoming"

RIVM Workshop on Synthetic Biology
Figure 1.  The stand of iGEM Team TU Eindhoven 2014
during the information market
We and the other Dutch iGEM teams were contacted by the Dutch Institute for Public Health and Environment ( RIVM ) and asked to play a central role in their workshop on synthetic biology. This workshop covered a whole afternoon and was held on the 17th of September. The day started with an open information market during lunch hour at the RIVM, this meant all employees were able to come by and take a look at our projects. Here general introductions were given about the projects as well as projects from previous years.

The samples were then ligated, using fast ligation, such that 1002-1002 and 1002-1006 were hopefully produced. This was done by combining the 1002 cut with Spe with the 1002 cut with Xba and the 1006 cut with Xba. These were then run on an agarose gel and cut out, then frozen overnight.
25th July
Double Terminator
The DNA was extracted from lanes 3&4 of the gel and extracted using the Zyppy Gel Extraction kit. The extracted DNA was then PCRed using 34 cycles, and then 10μL was frozen at -20°C. 8μL of the PCR product was cut with both EcoR1 and Pst1, as was 5μL of the death plasmid, PSB4C5, using the fast digest protocol. The gene was then ligated into the plasmid backbone, using the fast ligation kit, from Finnzymes.
500μL of normal TOP10 cells were made competent, and then transformed with the 4μL of the new plasmid, and grown on chloramphenicol overnight. 1μL of Puc19 was used as a control.
K+ assay for E.coli
Solutions of potassium chlotide were made up from 0mM to 500mM. 100μL of cells, 100μL of 10x KCl solution and 800μL of SDW were mixed and the OD600 measured every 30 mins, after agitation to ensure homogenaity. After 4 hours 800μL of the cell solution were spun down and resuspended in 1mL SDW, lysed using the freeze-thaw method, and the K+ concentration measured using the Flame Photometer.
28th July
The flame photometer was also calibrated using μM concentrations of potassium.
The mutants were streaked out from the innoculation discs onto both kanamycin and non antibiotic plates for the resistant strains, and just onto the normal plates for non-resistant strains. They were then incubated overnight at 37°C.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Introduction1_-_-_TEXT.html," Vector System
Synthetic biology is based on the principle that all genes, when standardized, can be assembled to form a biological algorithm.
Designed on this principle, the Double Vector System (DVS) is composed of a bacterium, a phage and eukaryotic virus proteins. A complex mix offering, to vectorization technology, a key to its major issues.
DVS components:
and
The DVS is composed by a first vector , tissue vector, from bacterial type, able to reach a tissue without being eliminated by the immune system. And by a a second vector , created by the first one, from phage type, able to reach a targeted cell and to integer itself, thanks to viral proteins exposed to its capsid. Once the target is reached, it releases a therapeutic plasmid which has a action against the disease.
DVS mechanism of action:
DVS is not only replying to underlying vectorization problematic, it enhances some intrinsic characteristics of the technology.
Discover in more details each DVS components through pages of the website.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Alternative sodium sources
Figure 3: Dilution and alternative sodium sources
The needed medium composition was adjusted a head of time to faster distribute medium into the platereader.
Sodium citrate is an ideal candidate to replace
NaCl
in industrial media. A study from 1978 showed that V. natriegens could grow with sodium citrate as the sole carbon source (Austin et al., 1978). Therefore we hoped that it would help to maintain the growth rate of V. natriegens. Furthermore, we hoped that it would lead to favored uptake of sodium in correlation with the higher bioavailability of the citrate salt overall.
Sodium sulfate is another alternative sodium source to
NaCl
. It too is non-toxic in high concentrations, has already been tested for applications in bioreactors and it is readily available.
The sodium content of the media was derived from the available sodium in v2 salts. Due to the polyvalence of the citrate and the sulfate, the overall molarity had to be adjusted. The lower solubility of sodium sulfate was taken into account and resulted in a lower stock solution  (10x
NaCl
= 2.4 M; 10x Na3Citrate = 0.8 M; 5x Na2SO4 = 1.2 M).
Contents of the medium:
5x M63 (1.25x the standard concentration)
12.5 g (NH4)2SO4
85 g KH2PO4
3.125 mg FeSO4 (7H2O)
→ Adjust to pH 7 with KOH
add 34.2g MgSO4  (7H2O) afterwards
→ Adjust to a final concentration of 240 mM sodium ions in the ready-to-use medium.
→ Readjust pH as needed.
Workflow
NaCl
was replaced in 2.5% incremental steps (2.5% → 100%) with the respective sodium alternative, sodium citrate or sodium sulfate. The scheme of the workflow is depicted in Figure XX.
The culture inside the wells was inoculated with an overnight culture (1µL) with 100%
NaCl
content without alternative sodium source.  The preliminary result of the dilution experiments is depicted below. So far sodium citrate seems to be an outstanding choice in taking up the role of
NaCl
as sodium source. The growth continuously stays on par with the pure
NaCl
culture while the growth significantly declines with increasing sodium sulfate replacement. Those results show that the

The conference included official presentations along with Q&A and a poster session, which not only serves as a drill for the coming jamboree, but also inspires us with new ideas and valuable advice we can make good use of.Taking an active part in the conference, we shared our ideas and studies in synthetic biology and made a great deal new friends with different backgrounds. We sincerely acknowledge NCHU Taichung for their warm services and we gained a lot through the conference."

Drawing Contest
If I Were the Creator is a drawing contest we held this year. Considering the most unrestricted minds would be children’s, this contest is mainly for the primary school and kindergarten students. For a very long time, the Chinese students are said to be lack of imagination and creation. We attempt to break down this stereotype by giving them the freedom to design creatures that they like and providing them a platform to show their masterpieces.
We contacted primary schools and kindergartens in Shenzhen. The teachers and students showed great enthusiasm for this contest. We received 225 pieces of drawing within one month. Almost every teacher we contacted showed great interest in having this kind of cooperation next time.

Survey
We designed an online survey to evaluate stigma and discrimination to HIV/AIDS. We also put questions about gene treatment in it. We collected 2211 answers in about one month. And here are some important conclusions we draw from the statistics collected.
We should enhance the education of detailed basic knowledge besides the transmitting pathways for the primary school and middle school;
The knowledge about HIV transmitting should be most emphasized among the old
Most of the respondents express that they can accept the foreign gene introduced to their body and would like to try the gene therapy.

AIDS Ice Bucket Challenge
When we were doing our project in summer vacation, we also noticed viral spreading of Ice Bucket Challenge. This activity intends to promote awareness of the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We also want to arose people’s awareness of HIV/AIDS and promote them to learn more about this disease. And we also desired to show the world what our project is in an easy way. So we created Aides Ice Bucket Challenge.

NRW day
To the 70th birthday of the state North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and also the 70th year of Düsseldorf as the capital of NRW, the state celebrated the NRW day in Düsseldorf. Till 2012 the foundation day of NRW is celebrated every year in a different city within the country. For three days (26.8 - 28.8) 600,000 people celebrated together and participated in several events. The governor of NRW Hannelore Kraft and the mayor of Düsseldorf welcomed everyone. The iGEM team Düsseldorf invited us along with the teams from Bonn and Aachen to participate in the NRW day and to present synthetic biology. Therefore, we traveled to Düsseldorf and had a great time that weekend, both as actors and as visitors. During our visit we presented and promoted synthetic biology, iGEM and our project at a public stage as well as in personal conversations. Moreover, we presented a poster and distributed post cards to reach a lot of people and informed them why synthetic biology is not as bad as many people in Germany think. Many visitors of our stand were impressed by our project and iGEM in general."

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," that will rid of pollution, enhance food production, produce energy, do the housework and, in our iGEM project, destroy biofilms, kill pathogenic bacteria and provide a novel approach to treating microbial infections.
It's about selecting a feature of an organism, identifying its DNA, cataloging it and engineering it into a biological chassis. The approach is beautifully simple: the designs of biology applied to the logic of engineering and then put back into nature.
It's about a lot more than bacteria. Synthetic biology is the engineer's rationalisation of life: where we once aimed just to explain the world, synthetic biology now gives us the capacity to improve it.
HELLO WORLD!
Welcome! We are the 2015 Oxford iGEM team.
What's iGEM all about?
iGEM is a socially-driven research competition in the field of synthetic biology. Participating teams of undergraduates from all over the world work throughout the summer with the aim of using synthetic biology to create solutions to major social or environmental problems. As such, the competition is just as much about ""beyond the lab"" work in the form of outreach and human practices as it's about the actual technology derived from our lab research. A summer of hard work culminated in the presentation we'll give at the iGEM Jamboree, which will be happening in Boston at the end of September.
What problem are we interested in?
Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health and is an issue in all partts of the world, and one of the ways through which bacteria confer themselves protection against antimicrobial drugs is the growing of biofilms. Biofilms, or ""bacterial slime"", are responsible for a whole host of medical, industrial and environmental problems that are very costly and technically challenging to remedy. The scale of the problem is huge, with up to 80% of all infections involving the formation of a biofilm. Some examples where biofilms pose especially big an issue are urinary tract infections (UTIs), catheter and implant infections, dental plaque formation as well as infections in cystic fibrosis patients. In industry and infrastructure, biofilms are also the main culprit behind the fouling of various plants and pipelines for aquaculture, water treatment, and food production.
Both antimicrobial resistance and the other problems associated with biofilm formation are big issues in their own right but are especially problematic when they're combined. The bacteria, already constantly evolving to afford themselves more innate resistance against antibiotics, produce biofilms as protective layers that shield them from the drugs even more comprehensively.
How are we proposing to solve the"

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html,".  Il sistema consiste di due moduli: uno per il riconoscimento del ceppo preda (che rappresenta l´organismo patogenico) da parte del ceppo predatore (il killer), che quindi si dirige verso di esso; uno per l´eliminazione della preda non appena il predatore si trovi nelle sue vicinanze. La squadra fa uso del sistema con cui i batteri E. coli in natura riconoscono la presenza di nutrienti e si muovono verso zone in cui sono maggiormente concentrati, cambiando pero´i recettori del ceppo killer affinche´essi rispondano alla presenza di un cocktail molecolare secreto dalla preda.
Quando il predatore giunge in prossimita´della preda, un ulteriore modulo viene attivato che porta all´eliminazione dell´organismo patogenico o della cellula cancerogena. La squadra di Heidelberg sta seguendo due strategie per l´eliminazione della preda. La prima si basa sull´utilizzo di tossine batteriche, l´altra fa uso di virus che infettano specificatamente i batteri. Alcuni ceppi batterici producono normalmente delle tossine per eliminare altri batteri. E´stato dimostrato, tuttavia, che le tossine batteriche sono in grado di uccidere anche cellule cancerogene. Cio´apre la strada alla possibilita´di eliminare tali cellule usando proprio le tossine batteriche. Nella fase di prova iniziale, la squadra utilizza l´informazione genetica propria della produzione delle tossine, che viene introdotta nel ceppo predatore e modificata in modo da azionarla solo nelle vicinanze della preda. L´attivazione si traduce nella produzione e conseguente rilascio delle tossine, che culmina con l´eliminazione delle cellule preda.
Il secondo approccio utilizza i virus batterici, che in natura infettano cellule di E. coli. Durante l´infezione, il virus inietta il proprio materiale genetico nel batterio, forzandolo a produrre nuovi virus, che vengono rilasciati successivamente nel terreno circostante. Tali virus cosi"

He has also encouraged independent thinking amongst ourselves to maintain the student-driven aspect of the project. Lately, he has helped us a lot in preparing for the Giant Jamboree. His support has been invaluable in our iGEM journey.
Heli Viskari was our instructor and also there for us from the beginning. She answered all questions related to the lab and also arranged the lab space for us - important for carrying out for our experiments! She helped with the flow cytometer instrument and setup. She also regularly gave her input on our results and the progress of our project.
Merja Penttilä (VTT) encouraged us to think outside the box in our brainstorming sessions. As the secondary PI of our project, she gave us advice and direction when designing our project idea.
We had the opportunity to talk to Kaarina Sivonen and her cyanobacteria research group at the University of Helsinki. They really helped us by answering our questions, providing us with the cyanobacteria we used in our experiments and by analysing our enzyme activity samples. We were in contact especially with David Fewer , who is a researcher at the group. He helped us in planning the project and provided useful research articles. With his input we were able to design and carry out various laboratory experiments. Also, the group’s laboratory technician, Matti Wahlsten , helped us tremendously and we are very grateful to him for analysing all of our enzyme activity samples (there was a lot of them). He also gave us the safety training concerning working with the toxins and the cyanobacteria and how to handle and dispose of them. Without Matti’s help, we would have had to come up with some different way of analysing the enzyme activity in our samples, which most likely would have given us less time to spend on doing other things in the lab. As a gesture of thanks we decided to name the main character in our introduction video as Matti.
In addition to our official advisors and the cyanobacteria research group, we would like to acknowledge the following people for their contribution to our project:
Jussi Jäntti (VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland) attended many of our brainstorming sessions and advised us, especially on the use yeast as a chassis. He also gave advice on designing transporters and the choice of fluorescent protein for the detection.
Alexander Frey (Aalto University) helped solve many of our problems related to yeast. He advised on signal sequences for our construct design. He also helped us with the choice of"
USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance Analysis#m_-_-_TEXT.html,"min) as described above which means the time for signal induction does not account for a large portion in the total time for nicotine degradation.
The recycle rate of nicotine
The final goal of our system is to transform nicotine from tobacco waste to 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine which is a valuable intermediate for chemical synthesis of medicine. Because some portion of nicotine is catalyzed to 6-Hydroxynicotine to operate the sensing system, not all nicotine is transformed to 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine. We need to evaluate the extent of end product production with certain input of nicotine to validate the efficiency of degradation system. To describe the transformation rate, we define a concept called ‘Recycle rate’ calculated as below:
Equation 4 Definition of recycle rate
In simulation, we define the nicotine input in the interval of [1e-5, 1] M and promoter1 strength s1 in the interval of [0, 1]. To make sure that 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine reaches the maximal concentration, the simulation time is set to 300000s.
Figure 13 Product max with s1, nicotine
Figure 14 Recycle rate vs s1, nicotine
From figure 13, it is transparent that the relation between 1og10 nicotine input and product concentration follows the exponential function. But the amount of final product is not so strong related to promoter1 strength. Only when nicotine input is in high concentration, product amount tends to decline with the increase of s1. It is expectable because stronger promoter1 expresses more Vppa which transformed more nicotine to 6-Hydroxynicotine rather than 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine. About the recycle rate, we notice that when nicotine input is more than 0.01 M, stronger promoter1 leads to the attenuation of recycle rate. The maximal recycle rate is nearly 100% with small s1 which means that our system is efficient in transforming nicotine.
Conclusions
According to the results of simulation, with defined promoter3 strength, promoter3 strength, plasmid 1 copy number, plasmid 2 copy number, the systematic properties mentioned above is significantly affected by the concentration of nicotine input. Only with high amount of nicotine input, the influence of promoter 1 strength is amplified to an observable extent. We can acquire many valuable information about the rough value or interval of these properties, then these data can be used as reference for exact experiment design such as the choice of sampling time or nicotine input amount.

Results:
In the picture U = Uncut, P = Pst1 and S = Spe1. The Native FlhDC has an internal Pst1 site, while this site has been altered in the FlhDCmut gene. As expected all the cut samples show two bands, while the uncut samples only show one band. The picture shows a difference between the cut band and the greatest cut band in the native FlhDC, the cut band is slightly leighter than the uncut (ca. 100bp). The FlhDCmut samples show no specefic difference between the uncut band and the greatest cut band.
This indicates that a grater part of the native FlhDC is cut of than is cut of the FlhDCmut.

DTU_Denmark,2009,Team:DTU Denmark#results_-_-_TEXT.html," the two primers to anneal correctly. Then the double stranded oligo was digested with XbaI and SpeI o/n (over night). In the morning the oligo was warmed up to 95 °C again and cooled down as former described. This method was chosen to denature the restriction enzyme before ligation as the oligoes would have been lost in a standard DNA purification.  The oligo was inserted into two different plasmids:
1. pRS416 : in-house yeast plasmid with URA marker that we wished to use to demonstrate that Biobrick BBa_K194002 worked in yeast.
2. pSB1A2 : a iGEM plasmid what would be used to send the biobrick to MIT as we cannot send pRS416 with the biobrick due to intellectual property issues.
The two plasmids were digested seperately using two enzymes, XbaI (20U) and SpeI (10U). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for eight hours after which more enzyme was added to ensure maximum digestion. After an additional two hours of incubation the digested plasmids were dephosphorilised to prevent reanealing during ligation. This was achieved by an Antartic Phosphatase treatment (25 U). The DNA was gel-purified and the resulting concentration was determined using fluorometrics ( The Qubit Quantitation PlatformTM from invitrogen). The ligation was performed using T4-DNA ligase using a 3:1 ratio of fragment to vector and 9 ng DNA in total at a volume of 20 µl according to the manufactors recommendations. The actual ligation was carried out on a PCR machine for 1½ hours shifting the temperature from 10 °C to 30 °C at 30 second intervals as desribed by [1]. The final product was finally chemically transformed into competent E coli cells.
Selection of transformants
Ten random colonies were picked for overnight growth in liquid media. The next day the plasmids were purified and digestion were performed with PacI and XbaI to verify the presence of the biobrick. This was done as the presence of the biobrick is introduced a PacI site in the vector. The XbaI digestion was done to ensure that the biobrick had been inserted with the right directionality.

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," water correctly.
Waste product detection in water is based on the activities of the company. For pharmaceutical companies, the raw materials to produce the drugs are tested, not the drug itself as this is carefully filtered out of the water. Pharmaceutical water pollution is mostly caused by hospital waste water, which commonly contain: solvents, Iodide, Bromide, volatile aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals.
Currently, most assays are based on mass spectrometry, specified on the contaminant. These techniques show results within 24 hours.
It would be a great advantage that some biosensors are able to detect various compounds in wastewater. This way, the efficiency of the water purification and the concentration of contaminants can be measured at the source.
Applied
Shift the focus of measuring the presence of drugs to the presence of drugs residues.
Integrate the matter of difficulties of water sampling into the end product.
It will be an advantage if our end product can measure multiple compounds or groups of compounds at the same time.

Insights
On existing biosensors:
A biosensor used currently at Wetsus is the lux system. This system utilizes an E.coli-based luciferase assay, which will emit light when a carcinogen is present.
Other biosensors are fish and daphnia, which rely on the behaviour of these organisms, resulting in a lot of false positives.
On our project:
Difficulties: docking molecules in an active site is rather difficult, multiple techniques can be used to tackle the problems
Random mutagenesis
These techniques require a lot of time or luck.
Dictyostelium bacteria have a stronger chemotaxis-mediated swarming effect than E. coli.
On the safety of our product:
When using this kind of biosensor, materials can be easily disinfected. Cleaning-up the water after the measurements might be harder, because you have to be certain all bacteria are eliminated.
Applied
Acquiring info about Dictyostelium bacteria to make sure the organism with the highest potential is used in our system.
Focussing on effective ways of sterilization and cleaning of the water used by the biosensor.

Colonies were not counted above 300 and so this is the maximum value given. All samples were induced to a final concentration of 0.2 nM IPTG. All samples were  diluted 1000 times in a final volume of 4.5 ml liquid broth (LB). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.
Fig. 14. Comparison of CFUs formed by KillerRed exposed to light and kept in the dark for each sample taken from the ministat. The efficiency of the kill switch decreases over time as shown by the increasing number of CFUs.
Fig. 15. Comparison of CFUs formed by KillerOrange exposed to light and kept in the dark. The efficiency of the kill switch decreases over time as shown by the increasing number of CFUs. The effect is not as obvious in KillerOrange compared to KillerRed as the starting efficiency of KillerOrange is lower.
Enzymatic kill switch
Lysozymes are a group of enzymes that are an important part of the immune response against bacteria  (Myrnes et al, 2013). They are defined as 1,4-fl-N-acetylmuramidases that cleave the glycosidic bonds between carbon 1 of N-acetylmuramic acid  and carbon 4 of N-acetylglucosamine in the peptidoglycan that makes up a bacterial  cell wall (Jollès and Jollès, 1984). Lysozymes are commonly used in mass spectrometry for protein mass calibration and are also effective lysing agents  against Gram-positive and to lesser extent, Gram-negative bacteria (Sigma aaldrich, 2016). UNICAMP-Brazil 2009 iGEM team used the Lysozyme Gallus gallus part BBa_K284001 previously and other lysis mechanisms have been used as kill switches by TU-Delft 2013, Newcastle 2010, Imperial College London 2011 and METU-Ankara 2011. As others team have used lysis mechanisms in their kill switches we thought Lysozyme (Gallus gallus)   would be a suitable candidate to test the effectiveness of lysis as a kill switch mechanism and investigate the  potential for HGT if lysis is successful. We added an OmpA signal peptide to Lysozyme C which   targets it to the per"

Design and Document BioBrick Parts and DNA submission
We characterized and uploaded 31 new parts to the Registry of Parts. These were:
11 Plasmids
15 ORFs
4 Linkers
All submitted parts have been verified as the correct size using test digests and gel electrophoresis.  Sequencing files are posted on the Parts Registry as advanced sequence analysis.
Beyond our additions to the Registry of Parts, we also have parts that will work with GENOMIKON that could not be uploaded to the registry because they are created from oligonucleotides.
BioBytes 2.0 Assembly Method
The BioBytes 2.0 assembly method was engineered to allow for the fast and efficient assembly of BioBytes into larger constructs. This method was demonstrated successfully in multiple on-bead assemblies, which included the construction of a 12kBp long octamer and construction of multiple plasmids that were effectively transformed into E. coli.  The successful construction and transformation of E. coli with the plasmids created using the BioBytes 2.0 method was a major accomplishment of this year's project.  All of our parts have been tested in PCRs and shown to produce a product of the correct size.
Demonstration of New Parts
All of the 31 parts uploaded to the Registry of Parts are new and conform to the BioBrick standard. All of our RFP plasmids work as we designed them to and can be used to rapidly create BioByte 2.0 parts. These BioBytes can subsequently be used to assemble DNA constructs.
Characterization of New Parts
All of the 31 new parts that were uploaded to the Parts Registry were tested extensively, as this was required for their operation in the BioBytes 2.0 system as documented"

These quencher oligos were hybridized in situ by incubating the membrane in hybridization buffer, we used the same buffer as for Southern blots. After washing the quencher excess, increasing amount of ATP gradient was applied on each lane of the nitrocellulose membrane.                                 The figure below shows the fluorescence on the membrane observed with the ChemiDoc after extensive washing.
Fig 4. Blot of the ATP-aptamers on nitrocellulose. The ATP aptamer successfully detects ATP up to 10 µmol.L-1.                                     This sensibility is good enough to detect circulating ATP in blood.                                     However, the signal is not detectable with naked eyes or with a cell phone equipped with a blue and green filters (data not shown).
Conclusion: This revelation system works, but the signal is too weak to satisfy our selt-test specifications.
The latex-beads revelation system
Principle
The latex bead is taken in sandwich between two aptamers:                                 the first one is fixed on a big, dark and visible latex beads.The second one is fixed on the support.
Fig 5.  The biomarker, or target, is taken in sandwich between two aptamers.
Fig 6.  The biomarker, or target, is taken in sandwich between two aptamers.
Fixation of the aptamer on the beads: Proof
This detection system was implemented on streptavidin coated plates.                                 The beads fixation to the streptavidin-coated well bottom results in darkening the well.                                 This phenomenon can be quantified by OD600 measurement.
Fig 7 : Thrombin specifically forms complex with the latex beads coated with aptamers. In absence of DNA, the beads do not stick (bar 1 in black). Beads with complementary strands aptamers allow a good fixation,                                     and constitute our positive control (bar 2 in red).                                     The full detection system in absence of thrombin, our negative control, does not allow fixation of the beads (bar 3 in grey).                                     Decreasing amount of thrombin allows to determine the sensibility of the test, i.e. 100 nmol/L in these conditions (yellow bars).
Conclusion: We have proved that beads coated with aptamers are able to recognize their target in a sandwich assay.                                 A fixation of the beads on the support occurs. This detection system works.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

Tuesday: Poster printing day! I spent the morning putting the finishing touches on the poster. As a team, we decided what the font should be because our original choice of Helvetica Neue was not quite up to par. As a somewhat last minute decision, I asked Evan to help me write a blurb about the visual language that we had devised. They wrote up a really awesome description which fit perfectly into the poster, and then we were off to the presses for our 12:30 poster printing slot. Thankfully, it was a beautiful day, so we didn't have to worry about our poster getting rained on in transport. I'm really proud of how the poster turned out!
Wednesday: More user-testing! Catherine and I gathered up video cameras, a tripod, two iPads, one tablet, and a huge bundle of chargers and headed off to Boston University to do user-testing for our current iteration for Eugenie from the BU iGem team! We had some issues finding the building, resulting in getting there a bit late, but it turned out fine. The BU students who were there liked the program and gave us some great feedback. There are two members of the team that weren't there, but I will schedule some other user studies with them when it is convenient for all parties involved.
The Eugenie team, minus the lovely Consuelo!
Thursday: Presentation day! The Eugenie, zMol/zTree, and Bac to the Future teams finally had the opportunity to show off their projects to the rest of the Wellesley Summer Research Program. It was a great day and people were really interested in the work that we were doing.
It was the official end to the Wellesley Summer Science Research Program, but there is still much to do before iGem competition! I'm looking forward to the rest of the summer.

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html," système est constitué de deux modules : un module de détection de la cellule cible, qui imite le pathogène, par la cellule prédatrice et un module qui permet le déplacement de la cellules prédatrice vers la proie. L’équipe utilise le système naturel des bactéries E. coli qui leur permet de diriger leur mouvement en fonction de leur environnement et des gradients de concentrations de molécules nutritives : le récepteur de la cellule prédatrice responsable de cette fonction a été modifié pour qu’il reconnaisse un mélange de molécules secrétées par les cellules proies.
Une fois arrivée près de sa proie, la cellule prédatrice active un autre module de gènes qui induit la mort de la proie, du pathogène ou de la cellule cancéreuse. L’équipe d’Heidelberg suit deux stratégies différentes pour cette fonction : une stratégie utilise des toxines de bactéries, l’autre des virus spécifiques de bactéries. Les toxines sont normalement produites par certaines bactéries pour tuer d’autres bactéries. Mais elles sont également capables de tuer des cellules cancéreuses, rendant cette stratégie très attractive pour l’élimination de ces cellules. Pour le système test l’équipe utilise l’information génétique liée a la production bactérienne de toxine. Cette information est introduite dans les cellules prédatrices et modifiée de telle sorte qu’elle ne devient active que lorsque la cellule prédatrice est au contact de la cellule proie. Cette activation induit la production de toxine et sa sécrétion provoquant la mort de la cellule proie.
L’autre approche pour tuer les cellules proies utilise des virus bactériens, autrement appelés phages, qui infectent les bactéries E. coli naturellement. Lors d’une infection, le phage injecte son information génétique dans la bactérie afin de la forcer à produire de nouveaux phages qui sont ensuite relâchés hors de la bactérie. Ces nouveaux phages sont alors capables d’infecter de nouvelles bactéries.  L’équipe met essentiellement à profit l’effet domino du processus, qui permet de tuer de"
BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Human Practices#Marketing Campaign#Public Perception_-_-_TEXT.html,". Reasons not to were given as:
unknown consequences for human health such as cancer or allergies
threat to “natural” biotopes and plant species
loss of flavour and lack of need for such genetic modifications, because all essential food is already present on earth [12]
These relate to the general fears about safety and security: ensuring no damage will be caused to health or the environment. We also need to provide reasons for why our product is necessary or better than the alternative.
Edinburg 2009 found a significant number of the non-scientific people they surveyed to be unsure about whether they approved of synthetic biology – 76%. Their conclusion was that these people are likely unfamiliar with genetic engineering advances [13] reinforcing the idea that more informed people believe that it is potentially more beneficial. This again motivates increased public engagement and awareness.
Our response
The motivation for our product needs to be clear and persuasive: listing clearly the environmental benefits and aim of reducing the use of excess fertiliser. Surveys suggest that there is a negative attitude to ‘genetically modified’, whereas there is not sufficient information for as many people to have an opinion on ‘synthetic biology’.
Some lessons to be learned from genetic modification
If the public are to accept our hypothetical product or any other similar technology, we need to be careful in the way the information is presented. As already suggested, there appears to be at least some general public distrust of genetically modified organisms, and a lack of knowledge about synthetic biology and its potential applications. Being wary of some of the ways in which GMOs have been criticised will hopefully lead our campaign to be viewed less controversially. Some examples from GM publicity that are considered to have adversely affected public opinion are highlighted here, and ways to avoid a similar situation suggested.
Avoid over-stating potential and underplaying controversy
Previous advertising campaigns by GM seed producing companies attracted scorn in the late 1990s by suggesting their technology would improve the world hunger situation. Attacked not only for the features of their crops that disrupt traditional farming by forcing fresh seed to be bought each year, their claims concerning feeding the world have been unpicked as a naive message. [14] [15]
An article in the Observer from 2009 quotes a slogan from a Monsanto ad from 1998, attributing some of the blame for the dividing opinions on GM through overplaying it as being the solution to the world’s hunger problems.  “Worrying about future generations won't feed them, [...] Food biotechnology will. [...] While we'd never claim to have solved world hunger at a stroke [...] biotechnology provides one means to"

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.

Figure 1: Number of colony forming units (cfu) during incubation with silicic acid.
This figure suggests that either the polysilicate layer inhibits nutrient diffusion into the cell, unlike reported by Müller et al. (2008), or the sodium silicate has a detrimental effect on growth.

Discussion and Conclusions
In this part of our project we have transformed E. coli with a gene encoding the enzyme silicatein in three different ways. We solely expressed the silicatein protein, but have also fused the protein to two different membrane proteins, INP and OmpA. The goal was to let the cells produce a polysilicate layer around their membrane, so the cell was completely covered in this biological glass. We have characterized the polysilicate-covered cells by electron microscopy, AFM, spectroscopy, fluorescent staining and with a growth study.
After staining the silicatein-expressing cells with  the fluorescent stain Rhodamine 123, which binds specifically to the polysilicate layer, we found that the cells transformed with the OmpA-silicatein fusion successfully synthesized a polysilicate layer around the cell, therefore we continued all experiments with this strain. This result was confirmed with TEM and EDX spectroscopy, where a higher concentration of silicon was found on the polysilicate-synthesizing cells. SEM showed that this layer is a neat, homogeneous layer and does not form any aggregates of polysilicate on the cell. Aggregates could seriously disturb the optical properties of our cell, so it’s a good results that our cells are covered homogeneously. AFM showed that the cells covered in polysilicate have a higher stiffness compared to cells without the polysilicate layer. This proves the presence of this layer. The finding that the cells are more rigid is also useful for our idea to develop biolenses, since these should not easily deform. Lastly, our growth study shows that the cells covered in polysilicate live shorter that cells without this layer. This means that when we want to produce microlenses at a high scale, we should first grow the cells prior to incubating them with silicic acid. The fact that the cells die when they are encapsulated could also make it easier to use our microlenses in user-products. Bringing GMO’s out of the lab is often not permitted, so if we can show that our biolenses are inviable, this would not be a problem for our product. So, from"

Abstract
iGEM@home is a distributed computing platform build upon the BOINC framework. Volunteers download a client software that receives and runs work packages distributed from a central server. Combining the computational capacity of at least hundreds of personal computers, this approach allows (1) future iGEM teams to run heavy computations without the need of access to a big server cluster and (2) offers the opportunity to spread information about Synthetic Biology and iGEM events and projects. By actively promoting the platform and constantly motivating a growing community of iGEM@home supporters, we managed to accumulated more than 1.5 TeraFLOPS of computational power and displayed about 40,000 screensaver slides to more than 400 community members. We conducted a survey for evaluation and found our project content well received by the community: 80% of first time BOINC users was also interested in the information on synthetic biology and over 60% of the users had never heard of iGEM before and got involved into synthetic biology via iGEM@home. The succes of the project was reflected and stimulated by the national and international press.

Human practice
To implement the core value of iGEM and  spread a brief recognition of synthetic biology among general students, we  conducted our human practice mission with pleasure. The public we targeted to  were mainly consisted of three groups listed below: students from other iGEM  teams, freshmen from the School of Life Science in Tsinghua this year and some  high school students who showed great interest in our project and daily  experiment.
iGEM Mini-Jamboree (Public Engagement)
Freshmen major in Biology always look  forward to their research life in the future with enormous passion every year.  In the light of this statement, we held an iGEM Mini-Jamboree on September 13th,  2015.     
In addition to our telling the story of  iGEM and some previous interesting projects, we encouraged them to form several  temporary teams, which enabled them to exchange their preliminary ideas  relevant to feasible iGEM projects.
The most impressive part came when the  representative of every group shared the amazing thoughts of their discussion,  and those brave students were awarded with small souvenirs. 
 
At last, we received many reflections  and encouragements written on the leaflet from them, which made us feel even  more hopeful when thinking about future iGEM teams representing the School of  Life Science in Tsinghua. 
Lab Visiting & Experiment Guidance  (Education)
We decided to create a chance for high  school students to experience experiments in the lab after we got to know their  desire for practical attempt based on theoretical knowledge learned in class.  Contacted successfully on May 18th, these senior three students from  RDFZ visited the lab on May 24th for the first time.
Several days in May and June spent in the  lab with them, we introduced significant lab safety rules and basic molecular  experiments. By the time we ended this activity, they were capable of getting"

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

Our olfactory receptor odr-10 has been transformed into S.cerevisiae. we transformed SⅠ BBa_K1072016 into S.cerevisiae and cultured the cells until they reached the exponential phase(OD600, in the range of 1-2), then we diluted broth to OD600 0.5 and cultured in the selection media containing 2% galactose at 30℃ for 18h.
Finally, we found that GFP, Flag tag signal and BFP were bright by confocal microscope，which means that Odr-10 gene have be translated, located and induced MAPK pathway successfully, as showing in figure 5.Flag tag was detected around plasma membrane, as we can see in figure 6.
Figure 5: Transforming Odr-10 with flag tag and reporter gene into yeast,GFP, flag tag signal and BFP was detected successfully, meaning that the whole pathway was stimulated by diacetyl.
Figure 6: FLAG immunolocalization of yeast cells expressing Odr-10 with flag tag, which means that Odr-10 protein locate at plasma membrane successfully.
Additionally, we transformed SⅡ system into S.cerevisiae and cultured the cells as above method. We found that SⅡsystem, BBa_K1072017 , expresses bright blue fluorescence under UV field under 400ms exposure time Figure 7. Both BBa_K1072016 and BBa_K1072017 work meaning that Brho isn’t the necessary or don’t work in yeast. Odr-10 successful localization may result from the interior signal peptide of cDNA of Odr-10.

In order to optimize the pathway and achieve our expectation, we constructed Gpa1-odr3 chimera (chi) device to enhance the intension of signal transduction.
The chimera, carboxy-terminal five amino acids of Gpa1 are replaced with corresponding residues from odr-3 subunit, will not only enhance the affinity between Gpa1 with odr-10 from caenorhabditis elegans, but also not influence the affinity between Gpa1 with Gβγ. We utilize the sequence (1000"

[1] [2] . A 20 bp random sequence was derived from random sequence generator and put upstream the terminator loop. A complementary sequence, reaching within the terminator´s stem loop (the transmitter) was stepwise shortened to find the length, where the formation of the terminator is thermodynamically favored compared to the strand displacement by this sequence. The final transmitter sequence was then defined by selecting this shortest strand which is still able to ""destroy"" the stem loop. Subsequently, the complementary random sequence (identity site) was removed an the remaining trigger site was tested in regard of not being able to resolve the stem loop on its on. As illustrated for the His-based switch below, the terminator is thermodynamically favored toward the trigger unit, but in combination with the identity site, destroying the terminator´s stem loop becomes possible.

Design of Feces Analysis
E. coli (DH5alpha) expressing amilGFP, were cultivated using both agar plates as well as liquid cultures [1, 2]. The first test was done by weighing 5 g of horse manure in glass petri dishes which were then gently mixed with 5 mL tap water. Various mixtures of either solid or liquid fluorescent chromoprotein expressing colonies were gently mixed with the feces in varying concentrations and quantities. These samples were analyzed using an ultraviolet gel reader in combination with an overhead UV lamp, so that both sides of the petri dish were illuminated.
Figure 1. Solid cultures of amilGFP (left) and RFP (right) gently mixed into horse manure. The purpose of this test was to determine if there was any background fluorescence and if colonies would be seen on horse manure at all.
Quantification
To focus on quantification, a similar experiment was undertaken using a plate reader, (Tecan - Infinite M200). The expansion of the experiment via different sample preparation methods was to see if there was a cheap method (filtering), that would show the presence of the reporter system more easily and quantitatively. From the initial experiment that was previously described, it was decided that amilGFP would be the best candidate for this follow up experiment. With this in mind, a liquid culture of OD600 = 2.13 expressing amilGFP was used in all sample preparations below.
The first sample preparation consisted of horse feces (a mixed batch was prepared with 10 g of feces from 5 different horses) mixed with a liquid culture of amilGFP at different concentrations (1, 3, 8, 15, 25, 50 and 75 %), with the total weight of mixed samples totalling at 1 g. In the second and the third sample preparation, 1 g of horse feces was mixed with LB-media and liquid culture of amilGFP at different concentrations (5, "
Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Project#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," we did not recognise any band in the non-splicing C-half which should theoretically be stained by anti-GFP. However, the band in the splicing construct can certainly be identified as C-terminal half next to the sfGFP positive control. We therefore conclude that no intein splicing has taken place for the Ssp DnaX split inteins and split sfGFP.
This conclusion is supported by the data we obtained from flow cytometry.
Figure 6) FACS analysis of fluorescence of sfGFP samples
No reconstitution was visible for sfGFP
The FACS data was gated on the FSC - SSC scatterplot to separate debris from cells (Figure 6). During acquisition the maximum event count was set to 50000 or 100000 and usually reached within 10 to 30 seconds even at higher dilutions.
The fluorescence at ~488-512nm is plotted on vertical histograms for comparison. Data strongly implies that there is no change in fluorescence in the splicing constructs. This suggests, especially with regard to our previous experience with [2014.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Project/Reconstitution Fluorescent Proteins Assembly], that no protein splicing has taken place.
For mRFP, results look much better. Apart from confirming the expression of most constructs, a weak yet clear band is visible in the splicing coexpressed sample at the estimated position of mRFP (25.4 kDa). All proteins in this particular blot seem to have run at higher positions as suggested by the protein ladder. We have previously observed this in our lab and is has proven to be best to carefully compare the protein-bands in one's samples with each other in addition to the ladder. Although the band of reconstituted mRFP is weak it is to be seen alongside the non-splicing control to the left. The blot strongly implies that protein splicing has taken place and mRFP has successfully been reassembled from split halves.
Figure 7) Western blot of mRFP induction
There is mild restoration visible in the splicing expression construct.
The LOV constructs to the right are somewhat harder to interpret. On the top at around 36 kDa we see the DnaXn-mRFPn fusion protein as we saw it in the coexpression samples. To the bottom, as expected, the LOV-DnaXc-mRFPc construct is found. Inbetween, a weak band is visible at the same size as the reassembled mRFP band in the coexpression sample. We therefore deduce that protein sp"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," additional panic by not portraying novel alarming scenarios.
Science provides an example with a publication on the transmissibility of A/H5N1 viruses between ferrets which might be used to increase transmissibility of harmful viruses (Herfst et al., 2012). The research group examined which part of the genomic information of a mutated A/H5N1 virus was responsible for its previously non-present air transmissibility. Theoretically, this could be transferred to any harmful virus - so it is a case of Dual Use Research of Concern. However, it is important to note that the modification of a virus is not a trivial task and would require substantial additional research.
An example from another field of science is a publication on pulmonary drug delivery by customizing large porous particles (Edwards et al., 1997). The publication enables the optimal uptake and medical efficacy, but this works the same for toxins or drugs. This is why this research can also be considered Dual Use Research of Concern as it could be misused to effectively harm somebody.
New challenges in the internet age
In contrast to researchers from previous generations, we have to deal with an additional challenge: the global availability of information throughout the internet. Open access provides lots of chances for science as huge amounts of data can be shared within seconds but at the same moment cause a sensible problem as also sensitive information and panic could be spread rapidly.
But no need to panic!
Despite all these concerns we did not have lots of misuse cases in the last decades. They are actually extremely rare considering the number of scientific projects that are running each year. It should be mentioned here that despite only a few cases, they are nevertheless still present! We as scientists know that in most cases the feasibility of misuse is very low. For example, it is extremely challenging to recreate a virus and there are many easier ways to harm someone - but does the public know, too?
The Public’s Conception of Risks: The Problem of Science Communication
During our research on Dual Use and Research of Concern it became clear to us that it is not the misuse of research itself that poses the only danger:
A great danger comes also from how the public perceives the danger.
Different understanding due to different educational or scientific backgrounds led to huge debates in the past ultimately resulting in restriction of publications. That is why we reached out to scientists gaining public trust by effective science communication of their research.
An Example of failed Communication: ‘Airborne transmission of influenza A/H5N1 virus between ferrets’ by Herfst et al., 2012
A critical publication from 2012 caused a disturbing sensation at this time"

Overview
Why modelling?
Computational and mathematical models are useful and effective tools for understanding biology. Molecular biology experiments in vitro are very expensive and time consuming, building models of biological processes as a preliminary step helps to circumvent some of the drawbacks of performing hypothesis-testing in the wet lab. Using models could provide a faster and cheaper shortcut for biologists to gain a better understanding of the newly engineered system.Particularly with the extent of synthetic biology, many of the biological systems that are being researched could not be found in nature because they are genetically engineered, so their behaviors are unknown and need to be characterized.
Gene Regulatory Network
A gene regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of DNA segments in a cell which interact with each other indirectly (through their RNA and protein expression products) and with other substances in the cell, thereby governing the expression levels of mRNA and proteins. Some proteins serve only to activate or repress other genes, and these are the transcription factors that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades. By binding to the promoter region at the start of other genes they turn them on or turn them off, initiating the production of another protein, and so on.
GRN of I’M HeRE
For one green world, an Intelligent Microbial Heat Regulating Engine (I’M HeRE), as shown in figure 1, was designed to satisfy our needs described in the project. The engine consists of 2 systems namely the heat-resistant system and the quorum-control system.
Fig.1 The gene regulatory network of the intelligent microbial heat regulating . (a) shows the regulatory relationship of these genes. (b) is the detailed diagram of the GRN of the quorum control system.

For this reason we designed a Mycobacterium tuberculosis detector and began to verify that it functions as well as the other detectors. In this way, our Human practices investigations highlighted a real world problem that we sought to address.

Figure 2: CPRG assay results after 24 hours of incubation
As shown in Figure 2, After >24h incubation, expression levels for BBa_K1127008 and BBa_K2048001 reached to its maximal steady state levels and expression levels for metal and gold ions were similar. BBa_K2048002 showed concentration dependent expression in the presence of gold(III) ions up to 1uM with minimum to no expression in the presence of copper(II) ions.
Conclusion:
We proved that BBa_K1127008 Biobrick expression was not specific for Gold(III) ions. Comparable expression levels were also observed in the presence of Copper(II) ions and abscence of metal ions.
Cell Free Paper Based Genee Circuit Concept
The process begins with the application of molecular biology techniques to create the plasmids holding the gene(s) of interest. Then, the paper array supplies are prepared. A hydrophobic barrier around each “well” can be made by using software to design a matrix and a printer to print wax in a given pattern onto the paper. Then transcription and translation enzymes are combined with the gene circuits, embedded into the paper, and freeze dried to form a paper disk. Upon rehydration, i.e. the addition of water, the abiotic and sterile paper will produce a functional and stable cell-free synthetic gene network. In our case, the incorporated GolB promoter is activated with the transcriptional regulator GolS, in the presence of gold ions. The LacZ reporter is then transcribed, producing the - galactosidase, which allows a dramatic color change, from yellowish-white to purple, to be observed in individual paper wells. Thus, the engineered paper can be used to test soil samples for gold. By simply isolating a soil sample, hydrating the paper based technology, placing it into the sample, and allowing it to incubate at 37  for 24 hours, the presence or absence of gold can be confirmed, by the change of colour in the paper compared to the control wells.
We have successfully proved the functionality of our circuit by performing an in vitro assay and determined the time required as 24 hours. Among the circuits available in the registry (BBa_K1127008), and devices assembled by our team ( BBa"

Part II: Collaboration with UBC : IP issues encountered by iGEM teams
Introduction
The University of British Colombia team was also interested in intellectual property issues. They sent to each team a survey to understand what kind of IP issues are encountered by iGEM teams? Do IP issues hinder iGEM project? What level of IP knowledge have iGEMers?  We were glad to see we were not alone on IP planet, so we contacted them to share our works. UBC has accepted to give us their survey results and in exchange we commented their poll and their FAQ, we also answered their survey.281 iGEMers had answered the survey when we treated it .
This collaboration allowed us to broaden our reflexion to iGEM teams' issues.
Teams and IP experience
Firstly we studied past iGEMers experience with IP . In a graphic we summarize the answer  to two questions:
Do you have a past experience regarding the IP ?
Was your past experience in the context of a past iGEM project or outside of it ?
Only a few iGEM participants experienced dealing with IP issues. However, it would have been interesting to know their age in order to know if both data were bounded.
Besides, a patent experience seems to be often linked to a different project than the iGEM one, the reason probably being the special functioning of the iGEM contest in which most of the tools needed (such as the plasmid vectors) are provided without any intellectual property rights. Outside of iGEM, of course, such tools are obviously not freely supplied, which may results in a patent experience if the materials used are under a proprietary license.
Nonetheless, these answers do not reveal what these past experiences are. To test our hypothesis (iGEMers acquire IP experience outside of iGEM because patented materials are not used) we got interested in the nature of iGEMers IP experiences.
Nature of the IP experience
In this study, those who had an IP experience had to explain what was its nature. The results are that most of them (46 %) had already used patented materials before. However, 15% renounced to actually use them, which shows how patent can impede research and innovation:"

Science journey with stamps
Time:2017.7.9
Place: The hall in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum
Remember that we cooperated with Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum (ZJSTM) to build a Community Lab in 2015( 2015ZJUwiki )? Today, it has become a part of the AST(art, science, and technology) space! This year, we cooperated with Hangzhou Foreign Languages School and Hangzhou No.2 High School iGEM team as well as AST space, and held the activity in a greater arena and lager scale. As we hoped, a lot of children signed up and participated in this mysterious journey, and as they said,learned a lot in this activity.
Stamp by step
We hold the activity as a “garden party”, that meant the children could join us at any time during the activity. All you need to do was to sign up and get a card for collecting stamps, and choose the items you like. When you finished one mission under our instruction, we would stamp on the card, which could be used to win awards later.
During the activity, curious children surrounded every table and of course, every team member. They did the missions carefully, watched us stamping on their cards happily, and went to next station curiously.
Stamp by stamp, step by step, our science journey started!
Learning while doing
We along with the high school iGEM team prepared seven items for the garden party, including drawing with fluorescent protein,”flying on whiteboard” , crystal glue and so on. Through the items, participants could learn rudimentary knowledge of synthetic biology, and improve their abilities in STEM.
The most popular item was drawing with fluorescent protein.
Firstly,we transferred the plasmids (BBa_J06702,BBa_E0240,BBa_K592012,BBa_K1491005,BBa_E1010,BBa_592011) gotten from the kit plate in to E.coli DH5α. Then we prepared these plasmids and used 3A assembly to construct 6 plasmids containing T7 promoter, fluorescent protein coding sequence and double terminator which could express 7"

Figure 2:Sex ratio in SB conferences.  The proportion of speakers and poster presenters at SBX.0 conferences who are women.  Data was gathered on-line from available programs.
Under represented and badly represented
   In order to try to better understand the dynamics of gender behind the posters numbers, the rank of authors were reported for each poster. Sex ratio were calculated for each rank, keeping in mind that in biology, the first author is often a Phd student or a post doc and the last author, the P.I.
As explained above, women are generally under-represented in synthetic biology labs, even less represented at conferences. When looking at the rank of author in posters, another bias appears. Indeed, women  are more likely to be present as middle authors than first or last. This bias can be found in papers of different disciplines as shown on the graph realized on the eigenfactor.
The main finding considering gender in synthetic biology is that even though synthetic biology is new and interdisciplinary, it remains quite representative of existing gender bias in science.  Therefore it can be concluded, that the issues that have kept women out of science and especially out of top research position are still present and will not be resolved with time. A strong and active policy appears necessary to bring more mixity and therefore diversity in this field.
Figure: Sex ratio according to rank of authors in SB posters. Authorship on Posters in SB conferences was collected and Women and Male authors are organized by their rank of authorship.  Women tend to be middle authors more often then first or last authors.
Figure 4: Analysis of rank of authors according to gender in scientific publications.Women's rank of authorship in various journals and databases.  There is over-all far more men cited as authors than women, and this is consistent across publications and scientific fields.  Additionally, Authorship rank is shown on the bottom with the % of women over all shown as the solid line with the dot indicating the % of women within that authorship rank.  Dots above the line indicate that women are over represented compared to the mean and dots below the line indicate that women are underrepresented, with the further they are from the line the greater the imbalance.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#project description_-_-_TEXT.html," treat the horse in the purpose of avoiding mass rupture and severe consequences.
Methods of Detection
Currently the only method for detection and counting of how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires timely shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing and treat their horses regardless of need, contributing to the problem of resistance [10].
Resistance development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,5]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance[2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [15,16].
Due to all of these facts, we aim to develop a diagnostic tool to give horse owners a better estimation of the amount of worms in the horse. This would allow them to adapt the deworming treatment based on the level of infection.
Large Strongyles
Strongylus Vulgaris
Large Strongyles
The small strongyles larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat[1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested[4]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle[4,11]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals[8]. The large strongyle therefore needs to be detected in pasture in order to prevent infection.
Symptoms
When the worms migrate in the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms, it may form an embolism, which can detach and travel in the"

Figure 6: The 3D-model of the centrifuge
Testing of the centrifuge
We unfortunately had no opportunity to test the centrifuge. Considering it working, it would enable a technician to centrifuge 100x more blood at once than the amount that the paperfuge already developed was able to. Another benefit is the fact that our design provides more sufficient handling of blood thanks to the Eppendorf tubes.
The one worrying factor that might limit the centrifuge’s capabilities is the danger of hemolysis. The vigorous shaking of the eppendorf tube could cause hemolysis of the blood, thus making the centrifugation and the separation of plasma from the blood unsuccessful [1]. The gentle handling of the blood, during the centrifugation is really crucial, and the fact that the centrifuge would rotate around the horizontal axis might cause some problems.
One solution to the abovementioned problem would be to modify our current design so it would spin around the vertical axis and the tubes would be put in at an angle - thus making the process more robust for the technician. This might reduce the RPMs of the centrifuge however even after 5 mins at 4000 RPM a 1 ml sample of blood in an Eppendorf tube is fairly split.

Science 4U 14th April
The annual University of Westminster iGEM science4U took place this year     with 230 students (year 5 and 6) from 14 primary schools invited to partake     in a day of presentations! We had puzzles and games prepared while we     engaged with students about the realities and possibilities of synthetic     biology. We found that the students were actually very open minded about     the topic whereas the teachers bought more into stereotypes such as     genetically modified virus bombs!
New Scientist convention Thursday 28 September 2017
Having heard of the New Scientist expo coming to ExCel centre this fall,     the team decided that it would be a fantastic opportunity to join and share     our project as well as talk about antibiotic resistance to the engaged     public! The team were very excited to visit the exhibition and talk about     our projects, we also ran into Warwick iGEM and exchanged project ideas     (and stress!)
Biology week
On the week of the 16th October, our team decided to join a     group of academics to talk about biology as well as our project to     university students. We also decided to use this as an opportunity to talk     about iGEM in order to entice more students to join!
Antibiotics unearthed talk on 25th October 2017
Antibiotics unearthed is a public engagement project as well as a tool set     out by the Microbiology society in order to develop new antibiotics. We     were invited by Dr Linda Percy in order to give a brief talk about our     project to a cohort of students. We also talked about what iGEM was and     promoted the competition as a fantastic opportunity for students to engage     in.
Engagement
During our project, we also decided also grow our media presence and thus     invested time to try increase our social media presence. The official     Bio-busters twitter and Instagram pages in particular were constantly     updated.
Our social media activity also caught the attention of academics early on     and thus allowed us to build up our team’s reservoir of contacts! We also    "

Mammalian cells and bacteria combined
Co-culture of mammalian cells with bacteria
Overview
One issue that was concerning us was the possibility that the mammalian cells would behave in unusual ways in presence of bacteria. To exclude this possibility we decided to co-culture mammalian cells with bacteria for 3 h which is the time we expect that our test will last.
We used E. coli expresssing GFP and for the mammalian cell lines we used 3T3, HL-60 and Jurkat lines.
Results
We could observe that after the set time point (3 h) the 3T3 cells incubated with GFP-expressing bacteria had the same morphology as in the control. However, in Jurkat cells, it was possible to see some unspecific binding of bacteria to the cells.
Figure 17. Co-culture of 3T3 and Jurkat cells without and with bacteria expressing GFP after 3h of incubation.
Detection of apoptotic cells by our engineered bacteria expressing Annexin V
Overview
The ultimate goal of the introduction of our INP-Annexin V construct into E. coli is to make our MicroBeacons bind to apoptotic cancer cells. In order to prove this, we induced apoptosis in Jurkat and HL60 cells by incubating them with 100 ng/mL for 2 hours before combining them with our engineered bacteria. The final analysis was performed using microscopy. We verified apoptosis using Annexin V-Alexa488 staining.
Results
Unfortunately we were unable to show binding of our E. coli cells to apoptotic cells. On the contrary, it seemed that our bacteria bound preferrentially to non-apoptotic cells. We peformed an extensive series of experiments to achieve better results, adapting incubation time with the bacteria (1 h, 2 h, 3 h), calcium concentration of the Annexin binding buffer (0.25 mM, 2.5 mM, 25 mM) and incubation temperature with the bacteria (4ºC, 25ºC, 37ºC). Still, it seems that our bacteria (both with and without the INP-Annexin construct ( BBa_K1847015 ) are only bining to healthy cells and only under low concentrations of calcium. Our previous coculture experiments , however, showed that in complete absence of calcium the bacteria are not sticking to mammalian cells.
We are currently looking into alternative ways to get Annexin V exposed on the surfcae of our E. coli.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Yuze WU
I will go to bed before 12 today!
Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN
If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.
Fengzhi LI
The one who thinks differently.
Fengzhi is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Technology in UCAS.
He participated in both China National Biology Olympiad and National Olympiad"

- PolyA tailing: for several genes polyA tailing was performed using Taq polymerase and the following protocol: 20 minutes denaturation at 95°C, followed by addition of Taq polymerase, followed by 15 minutes extension at 72°C.
- Gel electrophoresis: gel analysis was used following OpenWetWare CFrench: AGE protocol except 0,5 TAE buffer was used rather that 1x TAE. Gel staining was done using the SYBR-Safe staining solution.
- Gel purification and DNA purification: for ccm and several ligation attempts for other genes the PCR samples were run on the gel then the appropriate bands were cut out and purified using standardised QIAquick Gel Extraction Kits. For pure PCR products OpenWetWare protocol CFrench: DNAPurification1 was used.
- Vectors used: For most reaction the standard BioBrick vector pSB1C3 (provided by the Registry) was used, except for samples that were subjected to polyA tailing which were then ligated into the pGEM vector (Promega)
- Restriction digestions: Restriction digests were performed for PCR products along with vector digestion following the OpenWetWare CFrench:restriction1 protocol . For enhanced efficiency, varying ratios of insert to vector were used with the optimum ratio reached at about 3:1 to 5:1 ratio of insert digest to vector digest. Analytical restriction digests were also performed for miniprep samples using the original protocol.
- Ligations: Digested samples were mixed with 1 ul T4 ligase buffer and 1 ul T4 ligase and mixed with water to reach the final volume of 20 ul if necessary. Alternatively, polyA tailed PCR sampels were mixed with pGEM vector and used directly for ligation.
- Fusion PCR: following the ligation the samples were used as template for fusion PCR, following KodPCR protocol using forward primer for the gene and reverse primer for the vector. Extension time was adjusted to suit the length of the vector with insert.
- Transformation: Ligation and fusion PCR products were used to transform E coli JM109 competent cells using the OpenWetWare protocol Cfrench:compcellprep1 for preparation of competent cells and cell transformation).
- Transformed cell selection: Transformed cells were spread on LB agar with chloramphenicol (when using pSB1C"
