For every long day spent in the lab, we made a post to remember it. While the Instagram wasn’t as informative as our blog, the connections we made through it were even stronger!
Pacific Northwest Meetup
This year, the Washington iGEM team hosted an event for teams around the world. It included industry panels, practice presentations, workshops, poster sessions, a Q+A, and a public fair at Gasworks Park. Human Practices has always been important to us, so we knew we’d have to do something extra special for the fair! We came up with an activity, that was later revised and used for more events. First we collected solutions with different acidity levels. They were labeled to correspond with a Puget Sound map of arsenic contamination. Then we handed out pH strips to represent our arsenic sensor. Visitors could dip the strips into the solution, and the color of the strip would tell them how much arsenic is in water at that location. The audience varied widely in age, so the event gave us good practice in tweaking our presentations on the spot. We had a great time at the meetup, and got great responses at the fair! Thank you Washington iGEM for hosting such a fun event!
Clover Park Rotary Club Presentation
This July, members of our team were able to present at a nearby branch of Rotary International. Rotary is a global organization dedicated to promoting peace, growing local economies, fighting disease, providing clean water, saving mothers and children, and supporting education. As local residents, the members had experienced the difficulties in testing their soil firsthand. We spoke about the potentials of synthetic biology, and the potential of our sensor. They seemed excited about just using a test strip for arsenic, and even more excited about what synthetic biology could do."

School project
Teaching the basics of microbiology
To meet the challenges of the future, biologic applications are going to be more and more relevant. Thus, it is essential to make this work field interesting for young people. With a school project, we tried to make the field of synthetic biology more appealing for them.
Since we were very surprised about the major role of melatonin in the human body and the little familiarity in the public, we took this opportunity to inform our audience.
At the beginning of September, we went to 10th-grade students at the Herzogenrath Highschool to show them the fundamentals of lab work. We carried out the lessons on three different days.
First day:
At the beginning of the first day, we presented the schedule for the upcoming one and a half weeks. After a small introduction about us, we talk about safety in a laboratory, working sterile and different media types for the cultivation of microorganisms. We split the class into groups of four students. First, the students weighed out the different components to prepare a YPD medium in Petri dishes. We autoclaved the media and explained the physical principles of autoclavation. In the end, the pupil poured the YPD medium into the Petri dishes.
Second day:
On the second day, the students inoculated the Petri dishes. Every group had four Petri dishes: one plate which was exposed to the air, another which was used to test the effect of ampicillin on the growth of microorganisms, and another two where they could test the contamination of different surfaces. Furthermore, we explained the functionality of antibiotics. The plates were incubated at 30°C.
Third day:
Seven days later we evaluated the plates and talked about the different organisms that grew on the Petri dishes. To get a closer look, we used a light microscope to analyze how their morphology was multifaceted. After the students finished their drawings, we presented our project. The students were very interested in the topic and we continued discussing about synthetic biology and the different fields of research.

Overview
Our team focused on both global outreach and on connecting with our local community. Our goal was to not only make a difference in the world, but also help improve our local community. To accomplish this, we decided to reach out to local middle schools and high schools, present our project and iGEM to faculty members and students, and gave a TEDx talk.
San Lorenzo Valley High School (SLVHS)
We want to inform and inspire upcoming generations, so we reached out to local schools and asked if they would let us present to their students. We contacted a total of 15 schools (four middle schools, nine high schools, and two vocational/private/alternative schools) in a 75-mile radius. So far, six of these 15 schools have shown interest in us presenting to one or more of their classes.
While we have several school presentations planned for after the Jamboree, SLVHS was the only school who planned for our presentation to be before the Giant Jamboree. We spoke with two SLVHS biology teachers, Aria Bauman and Stephanie Beck, who were interested in us presenting to their freshman biology classes. We created a presentation similar to our Bioethics class presentation, but with less technical information since the level of knowledge with high school freshmen isn't as in depth. Three presentation groups, each with three presenters (one who discussed iGEM, one who discussed our scientific research, and one who discussed our human practices), shared seven total presentations at SLVHS. We worked closely with the two biology teachers to assure our presentation wouldn't intimidate or confuse any of the students. Students from each class asked us questions about our work, our experiences as college students, and even about creating an SLVHS iGEM team.

Ruiling CAI
I will definitely arrive at the lab before 9 tomorcolumn! (Never)
Ruiling is a junior majoring in biology at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Devoted to iGEM for two years, she has got lots of training from lab work to project design. Besides, she really treasures the precious and memorable experience of working with all her teammates and instructors. About them, the future is still very long. To be short, she is the leader of the team this year.
“Deadline gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall have no breakfast, play no games, watch no films. I shall wear no ccolumnns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the alarm of the clock. I am the watcher for the schedule. I am the fire that burns against the laziness, the light that brings the energy, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the team of UCAS. I pledge my life and honor to the Deadline’s Watch, for this ddl and all the ddls to come.”
Apart from iGEM she is also a singer and a geek design aficionado. To her, the beat and melody have the magic power to sweep"
Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," The students asked insightful questions on both tours, such as “How do you avoid contaminating mammalian cells?” and “Why would you want to make proteins outside of cells rather than inside?” In addition to answering these questions, we explained the concept of CRISPR Capsules.

Perspectives Charter School
At the summer’s end, we were given the opportunity to teach a high school biotechnology class for a day at the Perspectives Charter School campus in Auburn Gresham, a high-risk neighborhood in the south side of Chicago. Teach for America member Emma Nechamkin helped us prepare our presentation material, which took almost a full month to plan. Emma emphasized that her students were a “challenging group.” Aiming to provide an engaging lecture, we filled the slides of our presentation with images and GIFs.
We brought with us two bags of GMO-free fruit juice pouches and conventional honeycrisp apples from Whole Foods. The class had 25 students ranging between the ages of thirteen and nineteen. None of them had any prior exposure to research science. We handed out juice pouches. Initially, we discussed GMO foods, using the “non-GMO” juice pouches as a segway for our discussion on “What is genetic engineering?”
We explained the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, CRISPR-Cas9, our iGEM project, and grant proposals. Students asked questions such as “If I cut off a lion’s tail, can I use CRISPR to give myself a tail?” and “If I were to modify the DNA of an animal, would that animal change completely?” At the conclusion of our presentation, we asked the students to write grant proposal outlines explaining how they would use CRISPR to solve a problem. We encouraged crazy ideas and walked around the classroom to interact with the students. One group of students said they’d use CRISPR to “give a person a twin if they wanted one.” Another group said they would “change other people’s mindset” and “end racism.” After the students completed their grants, we gave everyone apples, explaining that any of them could become scientists one day and that scientists normally have months to generate ideas and write their grant proposals.
After we returned to Evanston, we emailed Emma a new survey that would provide useful information for future iGEM teams planning presentations for high school students. The survey instructions made clear its voluntary and anonymous nature. Emma administered the survey and sent us the results promptly. Here’s what we learned:

High Fidelity PCR
The dxCas9 coding sequence contains forbidden restriction sites to be RFC compatible. Therefore, Gblocks were ordered at IDT. The dxCas9 is to large to order as one Gblock. Therefore I ordered two Gblocks, also incorporating Linker-Tn5 coding sequences (Gblock 1 and 2). To be able to construct also a different variant of the fusion protein, two Gblocks were ordered in the order Tn5-Linker-dxCas9 (Gblock 3 and 4).
To amplify the Gblocks 1 and 2 as well as the pACYCDuet-1 backbone, high fidelity PCR was done. The template DNA are the Gblocks 1 (primerset 045 & 046) and 2 (primerset 047 & 048) and pACYCDuet-1 (primerset 049 & 050). Six 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol .

From 2014.igem.org
Besides spending a whole summer in the lab and developing an own project, iGEM is about meeting new people, people with the same interests, the same motivation, the same dedication. Collaborations between team ensure the exchange of ideas, therefore helping the field of Synthetic Biology to be interdisciplinary and creative - the best conditions to give rise to revolutionary projects. We are very happy to met some of the team members from Freiburg, Aachen, Tuebingen, Marburg and London.

iGEM Team Aachen
Michael from the iGEM team Aachen visited us in Heidelberg. Their team worked on the development of a real-time pathogen detection technique for what they have build their own fluorescence measurement camera. We provided our expression vectors to the iGEM team Aachen, which they used to express their part E1010-K1319003 , the human galectin-3 protein fused to mRFP. Nicely seen in Figure 1 and 2 the the intensity of the red color is significantly higher for the induced sample with pSBX1A30 compared to the uninduced ones. To ensure the right molecular mass of the fusion protein, a SDS gel was run as well (Figure 3).

More information about their project can be found on Aachens Galectin-3 site .
In exchange they offered to characterise these expression vectors with their own designed analyser by measuring the amount of produced fluorescent proteins. Unfortunately, transporting E.colis to another city wasn't as easy as expected, not all Bacteria were able to grow afterwards and we could only obtain sufficient data from pSBX4C5.
iGEM Team Tuebingen
The project of iGEM Team Tuebingen is about blood types and the difficulties that arises during blood donation of the wrong blood type.

Introduction
We design and develop a software tool, iGame, which supports database written in MoDeL format, to perform task of automatic modeling. Actually, automatic modeling is a database-dependent network-searching-and-developing process from the initial conditions. Besides the database, users are required to provide initial environment condition, such as initial plasmids with biobrick parts. iGame will generate the network of the biological system in SBML standard. Please refer to User_Interface user interface to know more about input and output of iGame.
Algorithms for automatic modeling will be shown in the following sections. An overview is as follow:
Section Algorithm flow chart gives an overall description of the general framework of our algorithms;
Section Special reactions and volume strategy tells details about the methods and strategies our program utilizes to handle with some special reactions;
Section Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme provides details of sorting as well as weighting scheme and their functions;
Section Structural pattern match of template species provides details of the core algorithm of iGame: how to find matchings between template species defined in database and species existed in the bio-system;
Section Generation of products based on reaction templates describes the mix-trim-split method to generate products.
Algorithm flow chart
Before stating our own algorithm, we will first make an analysis about the difference and difficulty brought by introducing a new language system. The general algorithm idea is common: find out all species and reactions between them. Ignoring the efficiency of program, the most obvious method is doing the following recursively until no more species is generated:
find reactions between species have been found and generate products as new species
Similar idea applies to our program. Some modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of"

This is BioBrick-A-Bot from a side and a front view.
Module ALPHA
ALPHA was created in August 21, 2009. It consists of three robot arms. Each arm consist of two arm segments as shown in the picture. One arm segment is referred as the control arm and is connected to the motor which controls entirely the joint. The other arm segment, referred as a linkage is loosely attached and moves in a sphere. The end of this attaches to the platform which holds the four pipette tips.

Technically, this is not a LegoRoboBrick. We call this a LegoEnviroBrick. In layman terms, this is just the chassis of the robot.
BETA provides the environment where the robot can move and  conduct its task. It consists of a telescoping frame and a big lego plate under the stand. The telescoping frame is used for holding ALPHAs and PHIs, and the lego plate is where the 96-well plates and petri dishes are placed.
V1.0 uses two separate petri dishes. The first dish contains ethanol and is used for cleaning the pipette tip. The second dish contains water to clean the pipette tip before transferring DNA, enzymes, etc. between wells in the 96-well plate"

Experiment & Results
Experiment
Protocols:
Experiments:
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place. We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ . The final result is the channel capacity.
Results
Do our circuits work?
Yes, they do sense the input level of Dox concentration. Figure. illustrates the changing distribution of EBFP2 florescent intensity in response to Dox gradient. With higher concentration, the distribution shifts to the right till reaching saturation. (TRE-EBFP2N:IntN and TRE-EBFP2C"

Part: BBa_F2620
BBa_F2620
Part:BBa_F2620 had been fully characterized with data in partsregistry BBa_F2620 page. It is a composite biobrick with three individual biobricks: pTetR (R0040), LuxR（C0062) and lux pR. Without AHL, transcriptional level of lux pR is extremal low because of lack of activator, LuxR-AHL dimer. If we add AHL into the system within a very short time, expression of mature GFP is expected to increase significantly. To measure behaviors of the system consisting of BBa_F2620 using our software tool, we construct a system using plasmid pSB3C5 and Part:BBa_F2620 as well as a reporter gene:
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate transfer function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :
where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to 1E-5 M (increasing by order of magnitude) to the reactor within one minute. Details of modeling are described here .
We also plot time and dose response measurements of GFP stable concentration following addition of AHL. We choose the same AHL concentrations as done in testing the transfer function and plot their dynamic curves of GFP:
A similar work to measure system response of luxr-plux to inducer AHL was done by USTC 2009 iGEM team . Besides measurement of dose response of GFP stable concentrations following addition of AHL, they construct four constitutive promoters, BBa_K176026 , BBa_K176126 , BBa_K176128 , BBa_K176130 , and quantitatively measured their effects to the response curves. The construction is modified by replacing pTet with the four promoters and pSB3C5 with high copy plasmid pSB1A3 (copy number: 200). Since there are no tetR protein existed in the system, we keep lux pR unchanged ("
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," consultant radiologist, said that the results of a blood test using our sensor could help to relieve a patient’s anxiety far sooner than is currently possible. Our test, which can be carried out at a GP surgery, would comprise sending off the sample and processing the results with our sensor. This could be achieved in a few days rather than the 3 weeks required for a CT scan. In a hospital, this process could be even faster.
Portability
Through using the flourometer, and miRNA extraction kits, our sensor could be highly portable - unlike a CT scanner. This would be highly important for use in developing countries - bringing the test to individuals, when transport infrastructure for them to get to an urban hospital may not be in place.
In developed countries, blood tests could be carried out locally and the samples would be sent to a national lab for processing and testing. For example, nurses could be sent to higher-risk population groups e.g. nursing homes, allowing more people to be screened as there would be fewer barriers to screening (e.g. mobility issues).
Dr Desai, a respiratory consultant, stressed that another benefit of our test would be in reducing the number of CT scans required to rule out NSCLC. Given the shortage of radiologists, this could prove extremely beneficial to the NHS. This shortage would also make screening with CT impractical.
It is important to note that our project would not replace current diagnostic methods; CT and PET scans, along with biopsy would still be crucial for staging tumors and informing a therapeutic decision. Our sensor would be used to:
Screen high risk population groups for cancer and other diseases, and refer people with positive test results to further testing.
Rule out cancer or other diseases in certain high risk individuals - by setting cut-offs appropriately, and using several miRNA signatures in tandem - preventing unnecessary further testing could be prevented (this is further explained in gold human practices )
Be used in tandem with a CT scan to reduce false positives
Mass-population screening. For example, testing for a variety of diseases every year for those over a certain age
Provide point of care information to doctors. With a multiplexing assay of toehold switches, a myriad of diseases could be screened for, and ruled out, simultaneously assisting doctors in making a diagnosis.
We believe our tool could save millions of lives through early detection of various diseases. Non-small cell lung cancer was chosen as a proof of concept as NSCLC is often treatable when detected early (as cited by doctors), and had 2 well characterized miRNA biomarkers. However, due to the programmable nature of toehold switches,"

Results of One-Tube Electroporation
At the core of the Broad Host Range Kit is the One Test Tube Method of testing plasmids in a host bacteria. This is how the majority of people who receive our kit will begin their experiments. Using our kit, a researcher will be able to transform multiple assembled plasmids at once, and then through selective plating determine which plasmids work in their non-model organisms. Specifically, this will allow the researcher to identify what origin of replication works, which is the first step in building a plasmid to genetically engineering an organism. Results will be confirmed by one of two ways: assessing the phenotype produced by the reporter gene or sequencing at the barcode region. The reporter is either fluorescent protein-specific or chromoprotein-specific, and each color designates an origin. At the DNA level, a unique, non-coding Barcode sequence of DNA does the same thing, specifying which origin is on the plasmid. Our one tube mixture of initial assemblies contains an equimolar concentration of plasmids.
Electroporation into E. coli
Figure 1: Transformation of the One-Tube Reactions into E. coli Via Electroporation. Above are plates containing the transformants from a one-tube reaction. Within this reaction, many different assembly plasmids are added to a competent cell mixture. The various reporter genes will help to distinguish which assemblies were successfully transformed. This can be visualized in the far-right plate where both crimson and green colonies can be seen.
The plates in Figure 1 represent our first trials to see if the one tube method would work. The first mixture had 8 different assemblies (pAMB1+AMP, pMB1+AMP, p15A+CAM, pAMB1+CAM, pAMB1+KAN, pMB1+KAN, P15a+KAN, p15A+TET) and bacteria transformed with it was plated on 4 different plates, each with different antibiotic to select for E. coli expressing a plasmid with the corresponding antibiotic resistance.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the"

Objective
We designed four gates, two XOR and two AND. (here)
Our objective was to characterize these gates with the recombinases as input and RFP as output, Tp901.1, Bxb1 for BBa_K1132031 and BBa_K1132032 and FimE and PhiC31 for BBa_K1132037 and BBa_K1132038 . With the RFP as output, it will be easy to see the switch of the logic gates.
Conception
The gates have been inserted into pSB1C3, and the RFP gene inserted after the gate or inside it (depending of the gate type). For XOR2 and AND2, the T7 promoter was used and the polymerase T7 was also inserted in the construct, with a promoter, a rbs and a terminator.
We succeeded in assembling Bxb1 with a ribosome binding site and a promoter and FimE with a ribosome binding site, a promoter and a terminator.
The gates and the recombinases parts have been submitted, here is the detailed description of the parts .

Parameter B(c) under different concentrations.
As is shown in figure 11, B(c) is low but not zeros when the concentration of tetracycline is zeros, this phenomenon indicates that leakage of promoter happens. The protein expression remains depressed when concentration is below 0.8 mg/L, which is another demonstration of switch effect discussed in part 1. Later, B(c) increase rapidly and reach its peak at around 2.5 mg/L, at which concentration the promoter is activated to the most. After that, excessive tetracycline molecules bind with mRNA and reduce the RiPS, thus B(c) decreases in an exponential pattern.

These constructions were repeated. J13002-dszB and B0034-dszC constructions were attempted, however they were not successful as indicated by cPCR. Constructions of J13002/hpaC were carried out and also came back negative in sequencing, however B0034/katG-LAA was sequence confirmed.
Week 18 (August 27 - August 31)
Decarboxylation
This week, the primary objectives from last week were continued. Another restriction digest of OleT and then a ligation was performed, in order to see if we could obtain more colonies following transformation. After preparing overnight cultures and minipreps of eight of these colonies, we attempted to cut the OleT/PET vector with EcorI to verify that the gene had successfully inserted into the vector. Unfortunately, we did not have any luck, even after several attempts. Our attempts to verify this will continue. We also performed ligations with NPT (cut with XbaI and PstI) with JI3002 (cut with SpeI and PstI), so that we could produce a biobrick with JI3002 before NPT to act as a promoter and ribosome binding site. We decided on how we will build our two primary constructions, and where each part will be. Also, we attempted to amplify the CAR gene in the PET vector (with 3 mut sites replaced) with biobrick primers, so that we could get it inserted into a biobrick plasmid. After several tries, this amplification was successful.

dszB sequencing results came back as successful. dszA(PstI1,3 mutated)-PstI2-mutagenesis was performed and sent for sequencing. Also dszA(PstI1,2,3 mutated)-PstI4-m"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," science is not only about courses and classes, it also seen as an innovative project, even if everything is done in a rush and hardly finished. The imperative use of the public wiki makes the competition very unusual and indirectly announces an open approach to science making. Summer and temporary labs aren't thought to be close to the world. Sharing, meeting, looking at other projects is encouraged. Some elements are new for students, such as the use of BioBrick™. In the same way, the “get some, give some” principle has to be integrated as a new way of making science, and, in addition to the standard using habits, free exchange between scientists is performed.
But this portrait has also to reflect the conflicts, so normal in projects of this kind. As an example, let's consider the attempt of participation of a DIY team in the IGEM 09 competition. On February 2009 DIYbio Groups had initiated the idea of a DIYIGEM team  with a “home made project” and started to think about what they can propose, regarding their material conditions of work. Regarding posts written on DIYbio googlegroups, website and blogs, on April 10, the initiative was rejected by the IGEM's direction. Mackenzie Cowell from DIYbio, former student and researcher at the MIT and instructor for IGEM, related the official reasons for rejection in one of his post, quoted from Randy Rettberg, IGEM Director :
1. “IGEM depends on the academic institution of each team to provide a safety framework for that team. Because there is no formal safety framework or guidelines or precedent for amateur teams working outside of traditional labs, IGEM is afraid of the potential safety liability and doesn’t want amateur teams to participate until there is some kind of framework (2010!).
2. Most of IGEM’s funding comes from grants to support undergraduate education. A host of amateurs who are not undergraduates would be supported by grants for undergraduate education, which could be a situation the grantors wouldn’t like. Randy didn’t want to take that risk.”
We can see that concern over biosafety is called up by the IGEM Direction to reject the DIYIGEM proposal. The second point is a very different argument, putting into light how both youth and academic composition of teams are important to grantors.
Two important things follow the rejection: how the DIY community proposes to take strategic advantage of it and how IGEM 09 Competition answers.
If we keep going on the post, Mackenzie Cowell is proposing different things to react to the rejection. At first, the rejection seems to lead DIYists"

Conclusion
In our experience with this part, we found out that Pyear will yield strong transcription rate under the presence of high concentration of Nitrate. However, we found out, under high concentration of nitrite(40mM), the promoter will be repressed, unlike nitrite in low concentration. Furthermore, if nitrate(40mM) is present along with nitrite(40mM),"

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is a device that take a a biological material and puts it in contact with a recognition element to capture an analyte and a transduction element to allow for a measurable signa l. She cautioned us to focus on choosing a suitable medium of analysis , including circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and exosomes.
From this, we learned that circulating tumor DNA was probably a good idea for our project. This is partially because circulating tumor DNA provides effective tumor genome profiles and can be sampled non-invasively and subsequently analyzed for specific metrics.
Takeaway:
After our conversation with Amogha, we realized that we were most likely going to work with circulating tumor DNA. Our next step would be to determine a specific epigenetic indicator of interest.
Dr. Kang Zhang, Shiley Eye Institute and UCSD School of Medicine
Dr. Zhang expressed great interest in our project and agreed that looking into epigenetic determinants as an earlier and more consistent indicator of cancer was a good idea. He suggested that the two primary ones that we could look at were promoter methylation and histone modification. By looking at structural modifications, we could use these as potential diagnostic metrics. He also went into depth in his work on epigenetics, and expressed the hope that our team could come up with a methodology that could address the issue of bisulfite treatment . He explained that when he and other clinicians performed methylation analysis, the default method was to treat the input DNA sample with a chemical called sodium bisulfite that converts unmethylated cytosines into a different base that can be sequenced and given a ratio, known as the beta methylation value. He also told us that our methodology should give a quantitative output rather than a qualitative one .
Takeaway:
Our talk with Dr. Zhang allowed us to make some crucial decisions: namely, we decided that our indicator of interest was going to be promoter methylation because it has been associated with events prior to tumorigenesis. In addition, promoter methylation is correlated with tumor burden which can be valuable information in a clinical setting, whereas histone modification cannot be localized or traced to a tangible part of the cancer diagnostics journey. We also decided to focus on developing a methodology that did not require chemical treatment: our team believed that we could take the novel step of implementing synthetic biology in cancer diagnostics to identify a specific epigenetic determinant of interest, and then build a subsequent biosensor that can transduce the signal into a measurable output.

We also held small competitions: grope scipping with ropes made of reaction tubes and filling up pipette tip boxes as fast as possible. The kids could win golden Bluecaps filled with sweets and we made sure they won all the time. For the adult visitors we presented posters for them to understand our project and our approach  We alsoplanned an experiment for DNA extraction for everyone. For our DNA extraction we took an experiment from CommunityBricks and modified it.  We wanted our common day to be multimedial, so we showed a video about Synthetic Biology (taken from TechNyou .

Conclusion
Our poster to illustrate the development of biology to Synthetic Biology.
The SynBioDay - StreetScience was a great success. Everything from organization to realization worked just fine. We were able to talk to a lot of people about Synthetic Biology and our project and they gave us a positive feedback. People were interested and fascinated by our project. They not only unterstood our goals, but also found it helpful, innovative and informative. We answered a lot of their questions and also got several applications for internships. The visitors acknowledged our collaboration with the iGEM team from SDU-Denmark . Everyone was impressed at how easy it was to extract DNA and that it was possible to “see” the DNA. Especially the kids were amazed and happy to take home their self-extracted fruit DNA. Looking at microorganisms through the microscope was fascinationg for kids and adults and everyone had a lot of fun. The possibility of Synthetic Biology to add new characteristics to microorganisms did not frighten the people, but led to an unterstanding of this new field of science and its potential applications.
We did a survey to have an evaluation about our booth and about possible errors. Here you can find the results.

The 1/8” diameter holes are arranged in a grid, spaced 0.3” from one another and 0.15” from the edge of the board, enabling two boards to be connected forming a space of 0.3” between all holes. This is compatible with an emerging standard in microfluidic hardware, the MEC board, developed by the GroverLab at University of California, Riverside. Neptune’s board can use a multitude of materials and even a combination of materials, currently tested with HDPE plastic, ABS plastic, and wood.
To ensure Neptune meets the requirements of any microfluidic experiment with different requirements for flow-rate and max volume to be dispensed, Neptune has completely parametric 3D parts. These parts hold and align the servo and syringe combination and enable the fluid motion of both. From 100mL to 10uL, Neptune’s 3D printed hardware will adjust in shape to accommodate different size syringes and servos to meet synthetic biologist’s experimental needs. While Neptune has tested servos and syringes on file to choose from by default, should a biologist need more volume to dispense or more precision in flow-rates they can input their own servo or syringe to obtain the exact response they desire. The final result is completely parametric 3D parts that adapt to a specific servo or syringes’ dimensions, enabling a massive amount of freedom for synthetic biologists in using Neptune.
To bridge the gap between clicking a computer screen and moving fluid through a chip, users must select servos and syringes to move this fluid in the first place. In order to perfectly match the requirements of synthetic biologists to an appropriate servo/syringe combination, Neptune has an algorithm to convert the desired max volume and minimum tolerance of each dispenser to published values for servos and syringes. On the Build page this is seen clearly, when entering in fundamental requirements results in all servo/syringe combinations that can fulfill those specifications—even including price ranges.
Reliability and repeatability of experiments are essential for Neptune to deliver results. The firmware developed for the Arduino Mega ensures these standards are met and maintained. Currently implemented, this firmware has the capability to work with both digital and analog servos, up to 13 servo shields stacked on top of the Arduino Mega (enabling the control of over 200 servos at once), control valves with instant motion, and control dispensers with variable flow-rates. In addition to working seamlessly with Neptune’s control page, there is another option to use the Arduino IDE should"

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary"

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," of the best opportunities to make collaborations with other teams and bring back useful information that we gained during 2 days in Oxford on 12th-13th July 2018.
The first day was very interesting! We got an opportunity to present our project, answer questions and get feedback from other iGEM teams. This was very useful as it helped our team to understand what type of question the jury might ask at the Giant Jamboree. As well as this, we took part in a collaboration workshop. It was a great chance to meet other teams, discuss our projects and also make collaborations, which is a very important part of iGEM.
The next morning, we started with a short introduction of activities. We were split into 3 groups and started our lecture sessions. The first one was called “The iGEM Alumni Trouble-shooting Workshop”, where we focused on our problems and shared our iGEM experiences so far. This helped us to understand how other teams are doing and gain advice from last year’s winners and alumni. Then we had a lecture on human practices, safety and security. This lecture was extremely important because it helped our team to understands the concept of human practices and gave us some tips about how to avoid mistakes in the safety and security part of iGEM. The final lecture was about entrepreneurship. This helped us to look at our project from another perspective and learn about the After iGEM potential for our team.
Hassan, Sofya and Nemira were brainstorming a lot during these two days, so we came back to Nottingham full of different ideas about what we can do or change. We presented these thoughts to the rest of our team, who had even more ideas!
To conclude, we found the meetup incredibly useful and informative. We learned, plus collaborated with so many different teams and loved getting to know more about each other’s different projects. We look forward to implementing the skills and knowledge that we learned in Oxford very soon!

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#DanFalk_-_-_TEXT.html,", who do you imagine your audience to be? I like to think of them as an educated, interested reader who happens to be interested in the subjects that I am writing about. I have written three books and they are not technical. You have to know something to enjoy my books, but you don’t have to be/ have been a science major. Science can be quite technical, thus when presenting it to a general public, you have to simplify the subject matter, but you can’t simplify it too much or else it is no longer accurate. How do you do this? I think this is a problem that every science communicator wrestles with, but in my case as a freelancer, my audience is not necessarily consistently the same people. When I am publishing with news agency such as NBC, I have to appreciate that there is a very wide audience for anything I write. This is different when I am publishing in science journals which may have a very sophisticated audience interested in the details. It all depends on the audience. How do you pick the topic of your books? At a minimum it has to be a personal interest. Could you talk about your experience as a Knight Fellow in 2011/12? The Knight Fellowship is a terrific program. During that year, I did a lot of work that evolved into my book “Science of Shakespeare”. I sat in on two different Shakespeare classes, I did a lot of library work, and I went to a lot of lectures and public events on a lot of different topics. On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons we had to attend the guest speaker lectures who were usually local (e.g. someone from MIT, Harvard, etc.). We analyzed the survey we conducted at the start of the summer, and found some pretty interesting results. Do you have any hypotheses as to why would most people with a university education trust scientific reports in the popular press with dramatic and opinionated language? That’s pretty weird… or maybe it’s not that weird. I don’t know what to make of that. You would think that someone with an education who may have been exposed to different publications may be turned off by over-the-top language. Do you have any tips for up incoming science communicator? Science communication is a really important type of work to do… it is fun, and it comes with a lot of responsibility. Try to stay well-informed, read a variety of science-related news sources, and stay on top of the latest social media innovations. Do you have any tips on how to determine if a popular science article is exaggerating the conclusions from a scientific article? What are the red flags? If you are"

GFP Expression in Cells
To verify that our DNA schema was appropriate for expression with the T7 promoter we decided to validate it with an easy phenotypic readout: GFP in T7 express competent E. coli.
Successful expression of GFP in our DNA system in T7 express E. coli under the long promoter ( BBa_I712074 ) with the 5’UTR ( BBa_K1758100 ) superfolder GFP ( BBa_I746916 ) and Terminator ( BBa_B0012 ) in pSB1C3 vector. The same DNA sequence but as a linear PCR amplicon was expressed using NEBs PURExpress kit

Mutagenesis forward primer: CGCTATTATCGTCTTTATCACTAGCCGATCAGAGTTTGCGACTCTAAC
Mutagenesis reverse primer: GTTAGAGTCGCAAACTCTGATCGGCTAGTGATAAAGACGATAATAGCG
However, site-directed mutagenesis attempts were unsuccessful, so the gene was extracted in two parts using (i) comE forward primer & mutagenesis   reverse primer; (ii) comE reverse primer & mutagenesis forward primer. The two fragments were then ligated with the pSB1C3 backbone through Gibson Assembly.
PcomCDE
The promoter region of the comCDE operon only contains 67bp. By estimating the position of the transcription start site of PcomCDE, the total size of the   promoter region should be 89bp. We obtain the promoter region by oligo annealing. In designing the forward and reverse oligos, we added the XbaI cut site to the prefix and   SpeI cut site to the suffix at the two ends of the oligos respectively. The backbone pSB1C3 was used. PcomCDE was ligated with GFP generator (BBa_E0240), which   contains a RBS (BBa_B0032), GFP (BBa_E0040) and double terminator (BBa_B0015). The purpose of this construct is to measure the functionality of PcomCDE in the presence   and absence of phosphorylated ComE by green fluorescence. BBa_E0240 was obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit. The bacterial strain of E.coli used was DH10B. We have tried to   ligate PcomCDE with BBa_E0240, but unfortunately due to time limitation, we were not able to verify the sequence of our ligated products.

The Future
This is Only the Beginning
Before the L.A.S.S.O. can move onto becoming a usable device there are further issues we need to take care of. First of all we would need to find a replacement for the Arduino. Although it works well for our proof of concept, it does not have the resolution to make an optimal device. We need to look into the availability of a commercially available replacement, or whether it might be possible to custom build our own microcontroller. Another issue that we would tackle in future work is allowing the L.A.S.S.O. to communicate wirelessly. This would allow it to be controlled by a smartphone application as opposed to a laptop. Once these issues have been rectified the device can move towards clinical testing. This would be a long process, but it would show if the project as a whole (including the biological systems) was fit for purpose and deployable in the real world.
The Light Amplifying Signal Sensing Object is the beginnings of a device that has huge potential to meet the evolving health service. There is a movement of monitoring patients away from a hospital or clinic setting to their own homes1. The device can fit well into this environment. In future iterations it could be used by patients to keep a more detailed record of their bacterial levels. This would be possible as the tests will be easily accessible and the results will be recorded digitally and automatically. The L.A.S.S.O. could be used as part of a telemedicine system where"

[The molecular structure of green fluorescent protein.             Yang, F., Moss, L.G., Phillips Jr., G.N.           (1996) Nat.Biotechnol. 14: 1246-1251].
To get the best effect of reassembling, we need to know the structure of GFP first and find out the best splitting point. The picture above shows the structure of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein. According to that, GFP has a beta barrel structure consisting of eleven β-strands, with an alpha helix containing the covalently bonded chromophore 4-(p-hydroxybenzylidene)imidazolidin-5-one (HBI) running through the center. Five shorter alpha helices form caps on the ends of the structure[1].
So it will be beneficial to the reassembling when the splitting point, also the junction point corresponds to loops or turns between β-strands. Previous experiments done by Cabantous S, Terwilliger T C and Waldo G S showed that one feasible pair of GFP fragments are amino acids 1-214 and 214-238. To further reduce the size of the small GFP fragment, they tested 1–214 (GFP 1–10) for complementation with 214–230 (GFP 11), eliminating the residues 231-238 from the small fragment[2]. Their experiments results show that these two fragments can bind with each other spontaneously, which is really delight news for our project.
GFP --> sfGFP
At this point, we start our experiment to acquire two GFP fragments from complete GFP, simultaneously, we continue reading papers and learning experience from others. Fortunately, we find a variant of GFP, superfolder GFP (sfGFP), which gives us great help in the following experiments. sfGFP carries the following amino acid changes with respect to mut3 GFP (E0040), the currently most commonly used GFP in iGEM registry: S30R, Y39N, F64L, G65T, F99S, N105T, Y145F, M153T, V163A, I171V, A206V[5].

7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol
I) Purpose
To test the sixth protocol for applying 5-bromodeoxyuridine and inducing mutation. We also hope to see if using LB or M9 is better for the mutagen process.
II) Expected Outcome
A decrease in phage viability with increasing mutagen concentration.
A few random mutations that produce smaller and larger phage that can be isolated.
M9 media should allow E. Coli BL21 to take in more of the mutagen so there should be more mutations in T7 phage, resulting in a smaller titer when compared with LB media.
III) Reagents Used
5-bromodeoxyuridine stock in freezer labeled T7 (10mg/mL)
50mL of M9+ prepared by the large phage group
Uracil solution (2.5mg/mL)
Adenine solution (5mg/mL)
7.19 phage stock
x2 top agar
LB
IV) Procedure
1) Overnight (The day before) (7.28)
Add 5mL of LB into a test tube and add 1 colony of E. Coli BL21 into the tube using a wooden stick.
2) Applying the mutagen (7.29)
Label 10 test tubes LB:C, LB:0, LB:100, LB:200, LB: 500, M9:C, M9:0, M9:100, M9: 200, and M9: 500. Add 9.8mL of LB, 40ul of"

Collaborations
Throughout the development of our genetically engineered machine we have also collaborated with other mexican and international teams in different ways to enrich each other's project.
1.- Meetup
The three mexican teams met in July to present our projects, get feedback from each other and plan a collaboration. This was the start of a Science Experiment Manual collaboration; a handbook that aims to introduce elementary school kids to science. This meetup helped us realize our areas of improvement to get better prepared for the Giant Jamboree. This event helped us establish closer relationships with the other iGEM teams, which consequently led to more collaborations.
2.- Science Experiment Manual Collaboration
Focusing on the importance of spreading science to the general public, and most importantly to those in their early stages in life, we collaborated with the two other mexican iGEM teams; team TEC CEM, and team TEC Chihuahua. We created a fun science experiment manual for elementary school students in which we aim to get children involved with science by creating science. This manual is intended to be presented to the Mexican Ministry of Education. Each team collaborated with the proposal of 10 different experiments according to the national education plan, making a total of 30 experiments. We validated them in public and private schools in the cities of Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Mexico City where we got feedback from teachers and students. We aim to awaken the children’s curiosity and to bring them closer to scientific activities through the manual and in the long term, to increase the scientific development in Mexico and to make progress in our country.Focusing on the importance of spreading science to the general public, and most importantly to those in their early stages in life, we collaborated with the two other mexican iGEM teams; team TEC CEM, and team TEC Chihuahua.

This week we also repeat the Imperial College experiment, exactly the same as the first time but adding one new washing solution, catechol 0.03M since the it is the substrates for the enzymes which we are going to test with the FBD.
We will improve thi Biobrick because is also important for us, since we will use it as control in our binding experiments.
Week 26th September to 2nd October
We ascertain that all the plasmid we send to sequencing were good, without mutations, except for one of the FBD7, luckily we isolate 2 plasmids of each type, therefore if one fails as in this case we could chose the other to follow the experiments.
Once we now that the plasmids are ok, we transform them in BL21-DE3 and carry out the ove expression.
But first we will carry out the assays with the native enzymes we slected as potential candidates to egrade anthocyanins.
To do this we cloned the plasmids into BL21-DE3 in 5ml of LB during an whole night, then in the morning we inoculate this 5ml in 500ml of fresh LB, and let grow them till OD=0.4-0.6, then induce the expression by adding IPTG 0.5mM final concentration. And wait 5 hours.
The cell extract was obtained by following the protocol of B-PER from Thermo Fisher, then we carry out the SDS-PAGE and enzymatic assays to see if there were protein and if they are active.
We used a kit from BioRad, all ready even the gels, which are 10% polyacrlamide.
As we can see we didn't achieve to express the protein product of BGI, maybe because is a eucariotic protein which could from inclusion boides, therefore we desist to express it anymore as well as for PPO2, for the same reason.
Once this is done, lets do the enzymatic assays.
First, for XylE, it was done in potassium phosphate 100mM, with different concentrations of catechol but the best was 0.03M. In 200ul of reaction mix was added 5um of cell extract.
For CatA gene product the reaction was carrried out in Sodium phosphate buffer 50mM, with the same concentration of catechol,"

Tsinghua,2014,Team:Tsinghua#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,". First of them comes from the drastic reaction to glucose of β cells in all islets, and the second comes from the difference of secretion paces of different islets.
The main events are shown in the following chart:
[Glc] rising → [ATP]/[ADP] change → KATP Ch closure
→ Ca2+ Ch opening → [Ca2+]c rising → insulin secretion
As the insulin secretion-[Ca2+] is quite expectable, we focus mainly on the [Ca2+]-time curve.
Modeling
We make the following assumptions:
The reactions in metabolic process obey the M-M equations;
There is a time interval between [ATP[/[ADP] ratio reaches the threshold and closure of K+ ch;
The infux of Ca2+ is only subject to the chemical and electrical gradient, and cellular retrieval of Ca2+ is constant.
Stage I
Michaelis-Menten equation:
Normally [ATP]/[ADP]= x0 (during fast)
X1(t) =
Where δx(t) =
∈(0,1), p is the concentration of ATP, and [G] is that of the glucose.
We assume that under discrete time intervals reactions conduct in packet
.
Stage II
K+ Channel opening state:
K(t) =
K(t) limiting conditions:
K(0) = 0;
K(t) = 1, when X1(t) ≥ Ra;
K(t) = 0, when X1(t) ≤ Ra;
Amount of imported Ca2+:
Suppose the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is:
    (*)
Note 1 for the successful application of iteration, we introduce F(t) and C(t) with relationship as:
F(i) = exp(-c1)*(F(i-1)-1) + 1;
C(i) = c*(F(i) - F(i-1)) - c2 + C(i-1);
These two functions in fact realize the behavior of the above C(t).
Note 2 we assume that there should be a time period after [ATP]/[ADP] reaches the threshold before the K+ channel closes, resulting in a time delay:
if i > 150
    for j = 1:150
        if K(i-j) == 1
            q = 1;
        end
    end
end
Stage III: Ca2+-induced insulin secretion
With the increase in cellular [Ca2+] concentration, insulin secretion comes into a steady state concerned with [Ca2"

NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," from papers so that we can select the DNA fragments that directly correspond to gland-stimulating function. By ligating the constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101), ribosome binding site (BBa_B0034) and PBAN DNA sequence with a terminator (BBa_J61048) at last (we delimit this sequence as basic part), we were able to make E.colidirectly produce these PBANs continuously instead of the original complex process of PBAN biosynthesis in insects.
Multifunctionality
Fig.4-2-1 Best Potential of Our PBAN Biobrick - Multifunctional.
We can assemble these basic parts together easily because the number of base pairs of these basic parts are small. We can assemble different basic parts that contain different PBAN DNA sequences to resolve different insect problems. Therefore, our biobrick design can be customized according to the users' needs. For instance, if there is a farm harmed by 3 kinds of moths: Lymantria dispar, Spodoptera litura and Mamestra brassicae, what we have to do is to ligate the PBAN DNA sequence of 3 basic parts into one plasmid and let the E.coli express these PBANs. After these three kinds of moth ingest these three kinds of PBANs, subsequently, these 3 species of moths will produce their own pheromones to attract their same-species counterparts. To put it simply, our PBAN basic parts can be assembled together with any combination in infinite possibility.
For even more creative ideas, each of the PBAN basic parts can use different promoters, RBS and terminators to make many different regulation. Thus, not only can we produce many different PBANs with just one strain of E. coli, but these parts can be regulated to our desire. Thus, our PBAN biobricks really have infinite potential!
Device
In order to actually attract and capture the insect, we take the different weather conditions such as light and temperature into consideration. The different conditions will change the efficiency of insect attraction. Therefore, we design a device that can be used in different conditions, which would allow farmers to choose the best way for their local condition.

Introduction
Since insects behave widely different to the gravity force, we design a device which could catch specific kinds of insect species that we want. For example, Agrotis ypsilon (Rottemberg) and Spodoptera litura fall into the kind of moth that have negative"

As part of the optimisation, we aimed to combine these parts into one part containing the entire cso operon, as shown on Figure 1. Furthermore, a promoter was required to drive the gene expression. For this purpose, Ptac was chosen, as for the genes encoding the Calvin cycle enzymes.
Figure 1. The envisaged design of the carboxysomal genes, encoded in the composite part, BBa_K2449030 , under control of the Tac-promoter.
We succeeded in assembling both carboxysome parts in the composite part, BBa_K2449030 , but for some inexplicable reason, this composite part likewise emerged difficult to clone with the Tac-promoter. Therefore, it was decided to focus at other aspects of the project and, as for the Calvin cycle part, keep this part theoretical henceforth.
A fitting approach to verify the expression of the genes involved in carbon fixation, could consist of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). For this, one could build upon the experience obtained by the 2014 Bielefeld iGEM team .
In order to test the functionality of the parts we had hoped to assemble, we had reached out to Nordcee , which is a major research group within the Department of Biology at SDU. Our hope was to compare the carbon fixation rates for cultures expressing the Calvin cycle enzymes alone and in combination with the carboxysome, whereby the effectivity of the microcompartment also would have been assessed. In cooperation with Nordcee, measurements of CO2 decrease in an airtight culture would have been carried out with an infrared CO2analyser. Another test approach would have been using 14CO2, and then measure the amount our organism had taken in.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#HP Product Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the Hong Kong community, which is a biosensor for fungal diseases in trees. By using the tri-stable switch, the chemical which has the highest concentration out of three different target substances can be detected. When used as the tree biosensor, the switch will be used to detect tree wounds as well as two different kinds of fungi which live on the roots of trees. After detecting the presence of a fungus or a wound, the device will release chemicals that can either kill the parasite or heal the tree wounds. We plan to use Liana plants as a potential host for easier delivery of the device to the trees. We hope that this biosensor design would be able to help the Hong Kong Government in reducing accidents caused by falling trees. In the future, the circuit can  also be used to detect pests in plants grown in commercial farms.
1) Principle Behind Application: Tree diseases detector
The system senses tree wounds and two fungi that devour the trees’ rigid structural components. The following are the functions of the promoters used:
Promoter
Function
1st Promoter
Detect phenolic compounds secreted by tree wounds (i.e. phenols, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins) (Vek, Oven, Humar 2012)
Induce the switch to produce certain colour of chromoprotein in the sap flow through the surface of the bark.
2nd Promoter
Detect acetic acid secreted by Brown Rot fungi (Wang et al., 2014)
3rd Promoter
Detect compound  like Fe3+ and H2O2 produced by White Rot fungi (Teunissen, Pauline, 2001)
Dealing with infection by two fungal diseases (More than one stimulus stimulating our switch)
Detect the dominating inducer, and produce chromoproteins of color in response to that particular stimuli - chemicals will then be used to treat the tree wounds or kill the fungi depending on which color shows up.
After the first dominating inducer is dealt with, the next dominating inducer will be detected.
Host Organism of the sensor
Liana (climbing plants)
Shares the same habitat as the fungus in temperate forest (Schnitzer et al, 2014)
Implant the sensor in leaves
Go up along the tree trunks and branches
Carry the sensor and check every corner of the tree
2) Product Description
The product is in the form of genetically engineered Liana plant. It will be planted near the target tree, enabling it to grow and climb up the tree without much care needed.
Normal Liana leaves are green-colored. However"

Model
Modelling is an important part of any project within iGEM. As part of our project, we decided to model two separate systems: We created a kinetic model for the Tolerance Assay Model, and collaborated with team Edinburgh UG in order to model a potential “Kill Switch.”
Each of these models provided us with important information that directly impacted our general design and our wet-lab experiments.

Wageningen_UR,2013,Team:Wageningen UR#Science cafe_-_-_TEXT.html," skills a workshop of Paulien Poelarends was followed in advance. She wrote her Msc thesis about last year’s iGEM team and their way of communication and we tried to implement some point of her thesis in our human outreach. And of course the science café Wageningen was the perfect opportunity to observe the way of communication taking place and consider the facts we have learned during the workshop. Furthermore a science café is held in a café which is interesting for our observations for it is an informal and unusual surrounding.
As always during the science café the speakers had the word first. Both, Prof Dr. Arnold Driessen and Dr. Dirk Stemerding had 15 minutes time to introduce their topic to the public, afterwards some music was played and the audience had time for some talking and getting new drinks and after the break it was time for Pieter van Boheemen to explain his work and the general idea of DIY biohacking. He was also the one starting the discussion and question-round everyone was looking forward too.
Heated discussion and team members
The first one who had the word was Prof. Dr. Arnold Driessen from the department of molecular microbiology at the University of Groningen. He gave a short introduction to synthetic biology in general and what kinds of research is going on right now. He also explained the way of standardizing it by using biobricks which are, like lego, parts that can be used to build a system on cell level. This is also the principle used in the iGEM competition. Furthermore he stressed out the great importance of being able to synthesize genes.  Then Dr. Dirk Stemerding from the Rathenau institute told us about his work and their effort about communicating synthetic biology to the public. He also pointed out the effort they want to take to include iGEM teams in the future to successfully inform the public about ongoing research and the threats or safety regulations that have to be taken into account.  Last but not least Pieter van Boheemen was given the chance to look at synthetic biology from a different point of view. Pieter studied biotechnology and now work at The Waag in Amsterdam as a DIY biohacker. His goal is to show that interference with nature can take place everywhere and that also safety is possible everywhere. Also he stressed that ever since human existence we interfered with nature and that it is nothing that currently arose. Furthermore he wanted the public to know that nothing forbidden is done at those open labs as the one in Amsterdam where he works.
After everyone had the chance to give his presentation the public was invited to"

Promoter Characterization
To construct our reporter systems, we needed promoters of different strength. The well-known Anderson promoter collection consists of nineteen constitutive promoters of different strength. Because of their specific strength, we chose four different promoters (Table 1).

Table 1. For our project, we were interested in four different promoters from the Anderson Collection. For each part, we used an intern number, which will be used in the text, as well.
The activity of these promoters was mainly characterized by measurement of the activity of a reporter protein expressed from these promoters. Protein activity is not only determined by the efficiency of transcription. In addition to this, translation efficiency contributes to the protein amounts in a cell. In particular, regarding fluorescent proteins like RFP or GFP, the growth phase might affect their fluorescence (see discussion below). A more direct way to determine the promoter activity is to assess the transcript levels. We were interested in how the mRNA levels of RFP placed downstream of the promoters from the Anderson collection change dependent on the promoter and how the protein activity compares to them.
For this, we transformed E. coli DH5α with the promoter parts present in the plasmid backbone BBa_J61002. As an empty vector control lacking a promoter and RFP, we used E. coli cells transformed with BBa_B0034(an RBS) in plasmid Backbone pSB1A"

In our project it was very important to talk to multiple groups to gain a complete understanding of the issue of insulin accessibility: Type I diabetics dependent on insulin for health and survival, physicians prescribing the insulin, concerned citizens and members of organizations interested in helping those in need.
 
Our integrated human practices can be broken into three categories: project design, applied design and entrepreneurship.
 
Project Design:
Anthony Di Franco from the USA, founder of the OpenInsulin project alerted us to the issue and jumpstarted the project as did Meow-Ludo Meow-Meow was another connection linking us to the OpenInsulin project, via his group at BioFoundry
Neil Donelan from Insulin For Life suggested that we did not need to focus all of our efforts on a thermostable insulin, as human proinsulin is generally stable without refrigeration – so we considered the option of generating proinsulin in a cheap manner
Jeni, a pharmacist, warned us of the dangers of modifying our insulin excessively, as endocrinologists prefer not to diagnose biosimilars that may induce an allergic reaction in patients
Len Mancini from Maxwell’s Patent and Trademark Attorneys helped us in the design of our Winsulin sequence, to ensure we weren’t infringing on any existing pateitns and ensure we can safely submit our sequence to be Open Source
Edwina Wang – a Type I diabetic alerted us of the importance of modelling our insulin in order to predict whether it will be short or long-acting. We found that our modelling predicted it would be short acting.
 
Applied design:
Dr David Beran is an expert on the insulin market working at the Geneva University Hospitals who alerted us to the fact that it will be difficult to enter the insulin market, due to expensive qualifications and licenses required
So we went to George XX from OpenInsulin who alerted us to the possibilities of crowd-funding, to aid a jump-start of this Open Source project
 
Entrepreneurship:
Mike Nichols from INCUBATE hub at the University of Sydney educated us on the possibilities of creating a start-up company that could fund the initial production of Winsulin and/or a more cheaply produced human proinsulin
He also pointed out the value in us targeting a country with an especially high need for insulin, in order to break into the market
Dr Narcyz Ghinea from The University of Sydney , an expert in access to high cost medicines, assisted us with data on where the money for clinical trials is sourced from, giving us the idea of a potential use of government grants for this open-sourced project

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for"

Public Engagement
Education and outreach has always been a core value within  iGEM. This year, we ran a diverse selection of workshops and open houses to  showcase  both our project and synthetic biology as a rapidly developing field. We ran panel discussions to consider gender equity; workshops to teach essential synthetic biology techniques to students; and, events to  increase the interest and awareness of synthetic biology amongst the public.
Waterloo iGEM SHAD Valley Synthetic Biology Workshop
As an emerging field, synthetic biology is not always well-understood by today’s high school student. We believe that as the future of synthetic biology continues to grow brighter, it is important to introduce students, especially those reaching the postsecondary level, to this field and its potential. To address this, we partnered with SHAD Waterloo (a summer program that gives exceptional high school students chance to experience 4 weeks at several Canadian Universities) to host a three-day workshop to educate students about the foundations of synthetic biology, lab techniques/protocols, and the social and ethical aspects of science in the modern day. Specifically, our goals in hosting the SHAD workshop were three-fold: (1) to teach eager secondary school students about the field of synthetic biology and how it may be used in the world of today; (2) laboratory techniques that are used by the Waterloo iGEM team to manipulate the genomes of bacteria to exhibit particular properties; and (3) ethics surrounding synthetic biology, its impact on society, possible benefits, and possible misuses of the technology. Overall, the SHAD workshop organized by Waterloo iGEM was directed towards an interactive and interdisciplinary approach to synthetic biology education.
Day 1: Introduction to Synthetic Biology and the Fundamentals of Genetics
To begin, students received introductory surveys to describe their previous experience with different laboratory techniques and their current thoughts on synthetic biology. Following this, the students were given an introduction on what synthetic biology is and how it is perceived differently by scientists, engineers, and the public. We also explained some molecular biology techniques that are important to synthetic biology. These techniques include the importance of the aseptic technique in the laboratory, plating cells onto an agar plate,  and preparing and running an agarose gel for gel electrophoresis."

We would like to thank Dr. Sergi Aranda, who kindly gave us some BL21 Competent E. coli so that we could transform the genes’ enzymes into a recombinant bacteria. Once we could lyze the cells, the idea was to perform some analysis via HPLC or Mas Spectroscopy. Unfortunately, we did not have time to perform this last assay but we will some day continue with this idea, since we truly believe that a it can provide the world an accurate and easy tumor risk marker.

In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields. [18]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [19, 20].  A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed  to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we are working on market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions will be possible to implement.
Our Outreach Mission:
For the future of iGEM
We plan on making our project useful for future iGEM projects by producing informative media for iGEM teams.  We plan to provide a Youtube channel explaining scientific concepts, have lectures at local schools and have a public forum discussion in order to better educate the public on what exactly GMOs are! We also plan to publish a booklet outlining how to avoid burnout, and the effects it has on the biotechnology industry.
Collaborations
We are stronger together so when possible we are striving for collaboration with other iGEM teams. So far we are in contact with the teams of Aalto Helsinki, National University of Singapore (NUS), Lund Technical University (LTU), the team of Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH) and with all other nordic teams at social events and channels. Besides collaboration with teams we also keep a close collaboration with Vidilab, a veterinary diagnostic company.
Vidilab
Besides collaborating with other teams, iGEM Uppsala 2018 has a very close collaboration with Vidilab, a company that works with the current veterinary diagnostic tools. They are offering us usage of parts of their lab and equipment during the summer and potentially during the fall. With Vidilab’s help we have also had the opportunity to collect tissue samples and feces samples for our research.

After several times of discussion with us, BNU-China understood the background of our modeling part and the problems they were about to settle. Meanwhile, they helped us to find some bugs in modeling, such as the inconsistency of some variable values in each group of equations, and the problem that parameters of some equations don’t accord with the fact.
First of all, BNU-China adjusted a series of independent variables and corrected the parameters. Then they found the solution of the equations by applying the Runge-Kutta Method. The method could be used in differential equation system in different dimensions with high efficiency. According to concentration of hydroxyl ion in equation ABCDE groups, pH of each equation was obtained and was used to judge the termination condition. In equation C and equation F, concentration of specific substances were used to stop the conditions. The initial value of each equation group was the terminal value of the last equation group. By this way they achieved the whole cyclic process and finally got dynamic image of pH(Fig.5).
Fig. 5 The dynamic change of pH during the regulation process
The initial concentration of OH- is 0.2×10-6, and the initial pH is higher than 7.0, so the whole reaction starts from Group A, and the reactions are in the order of Group A, B, C, D, E, F, A, B, C, D, E, F.
○ The detection of protein NhaA and NhaB by BNU_China.
BIT-China’s project this year is to regulate the pH in fermentation environment and to strengthen the competence of microorganism to survive in both acid and alkali. Therefore we want to express two kinds of membrane proteins, NhaA and NhaB. Considering the fact that membrane proteins are particularly hard to express and detect, BNU_China helped us to establish this part. To this end, they reviewed amounts of relevant articles and consulted several professors in this field, on which basis they tried various protocols to express, purify and detect NhaA as well as NhaB.

We had a nice talk with members from Tec Chihuahua.                                                 First, we introduced our                                                 project to each other.
During our talk, we received many useful                                                 recommendations                                                 and advice especially for                                                 our                                                 constructions and cost of our main device. The considering these                                                 aspects                                                 which also led us to                                                 more focus on the value of our project to be applied on the industries                                                 sides. Eventually, as we were                                                 communicating for our main ideas and project, we found that Tec                                                 Chihuahua                                                 seems to have a great                                                 idea on solving the problem of larvae-killing bacteria. According to                                                 researchers, the extinction                                                 of bee will also lead the human society to face the acute problem which                                                 is                                                 the shortage of food                                                 sources. By considering this knotty dilemma, team Tec Chihuahua has                                                 outcome this with the                                                 technologies of synthetic biology. In addition, we also give our                                                 suggestion                                                 such as constructing a                                                 control system on their project so that there will be an awareness on                                                 the                                                 shortage of material or                                                 overusing of their materials.

We hoped we can                                             know more about each other's project deeply and give some suggestion to                                             benefit each other's                                             project.
In the beginning, we greeted and introduced ourselves                                             to                                             each other. Next, we                                             entered our project presentation time. In this meetup, we had more                                             familiar                                             with each other's                                             project. We gave our                                             questions and suggestions to CCU, and we also received great feedback                                             from                                             them. We discussed our                                             construction in wet, design modeling"

Results
(including responses between 10th -22nd of Oct 2010)
General Profile of Participants
The following teams are dedicated as collaborators with more      than 60% team participation are
INSA-Lyon
Lethbridge
WashU
Out of 244 participants between 10 to 22.10.2010, 57% of the      participant had scientific degrees from B.Sc to Professor and 18%      had graduate degrees. 18% of participants are enrolled in their      teams as either Instructors or Advisors.
95 teams have responded to the survey while we are still waiting      to hear from 33 teams. 74% teams participated with one or more members      to the survey.
75% of participants were interested with synthetic biology field      for academic purposes.
Browsing the Registry of Standard Parts
56% of participants think that it is not easy to search      for the parts in Registry of Standard Parts. Many comments      indicate a need for a better search engine and more flexible keyword      search options, especially excepting aliases. Also many are longing      for recognizable parts names, which will ease searching with keyword.
Partnership with Google and enforcing standardized parts names     are suggested
As a global organization iGEM can offer the Parts Registry in     different languages and more illustrations describing how the system     works.
Content of Registry of Standard Parts
57% of participants agree that the number of parts registered     "
UC_Davis,2012,Team:UC Davis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," if the K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase versus the K206000 + B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015 versus the strain by itself. We want to be able to see if there is growth with one piece or only if there is both. We also did it with J23101 instead of the K206000. These tests were done in the MG1655, Strain E-15 EG3, and DH5α. We looked at the Tecan results that had just finished its run. We concluded that it was not done for a long enough time because of its growth curves. It had not made significant changes. We put it back in to grow longer in the Tecan.
We made liquid cultures for multiple parts including PSB1C3, PelB+Cutinase+PSB1A3, Cutinase+Histag+PSB1A3, Cutinase +PSB1A3.
Tuesday  September 25th
We did a lot of basic chores (carb plates and chloro plates made and glassware autoclaved). We also set up multiple liquid cultures of the remaining EMS colonies. These amounted to about 180 liquid cultures done in 96 well plates. We also liquid cultured the same constructs as yesterday, except this time, we added in 2 µM and 10 µM of arabinose in the K206000 constructs to see if there is a difference between low and high induction. We will use these in the Tecan experiments as well, later on.
We then minipreped the liquid cultures PSB1C3, PelB+Cutinase+PSB1A3, Cutinase+Histag+PSB1A3, Cutinase +PSB1A3, measured the concentrations to do a digest, and digested them (PSB1C3, (and the inserts) PelB+Cutinase, Cutinase+Histag, and Cutinase, and Bba_K936020). After the digestion, we ran an extraction gel to extract our parts we want to put together. Afterwards we purified, and nanodropped them to get the concentrations. With these concentrations we did a ligation and transformation of each of the inserts with the backbone PSB1C3.
Wednesday  September 26th
We are going to set up more liquid cultures and design experiments for the Tecan for more data! We are also miniprepping the transformations of the pSB1C3"

Cooperation & Celebration
During the course of our project, we had the pleasure to meet and collaborate with a great number of passionate and creative partners inside and outside of the iGEM community. On the one hand, we will elaborate all active collaborations with iGEM teams and companies. On the other hand, we will name all iGEM teams we simply visited for some scientific exchange and having fun together. In short, this is the page of Cooperation & Celebration!

Future iGEM Team of the ""Westfälische Hochschule""
Quite at the start of our project, we were contacted by a group of students and their professor from the college from Recklinghausen. They are considering to participate in iGEM 2016 and had a lot of questions on how to build up an iGEM Team and manage an iGEM project. We were glad to welcome them in Aachen and answer all of their questions regarding BioBricks, judging and project organization. We hope that they will become part of iGEM next year and wish them all the best!
The students from Recklinghausen were accompanied by a supporting and potential future instructor Dr. Frank Eiden. Later that year Dr. Eiden was attending the same SynBio Symposium as our team. We took the chance to get some feedback on our project and won him over for an interview on Community Labs . We also met him at the Maker Faire and had an interessting discussion about synthetic biology and our prototype.
