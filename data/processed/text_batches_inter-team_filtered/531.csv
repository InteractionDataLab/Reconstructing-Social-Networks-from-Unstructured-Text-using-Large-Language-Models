Participants: Yang-Ming University, Tongji University, Chiao Tung University,
Chang Gung University, Taipei American School, National Chung Cheng University,
Tsing Hua University.
We attended the communication conference. In the conference, each team presented their project and gave some suggestion or shared some novel ideas with each other. We specially enjoyed the World Café event since everyone shared the opinions on different topics such as the attitude toward the life science or what attitude or abilities we thought we should have in such a competitive world.
We thought we had a great interaction with other teams and gained some ideas related to our project after it!

Introduction
Mutant library activity
Regulatory part activity
Conclusions
Introducton
To demonstrate the CAT-Seq is working as intended, we chose an Esterase enzyme (CAT-Seq Esterase) capable of hydrolyzing N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate to 2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate. We have then designed a library of the esterase mutants with the help of in-silico modelling and also acquired libraries of different ribosome binding sites and toehold switches. We have successfully shown that we can assess the derived esterase mutant and regulatory sequence activities and sequences by recording those activities into their DNA sequences in a high-throughput manner using N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate as a Substrate Nucleotide and 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidines as reference nucleotides. The activity recording is based on the ratio of catalytically converted and reference nucleotide incorporated into the  DNA during the amplification reaction and can be extracted during the analysis of Nanopore sequencing data.
Mutant library activity and sequence assessment
First of all, the constructed in silico designed mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. By applying the data preparation and analysis pipeline, the mean methylation scores arising from different ratios of catalytically converted and reference nucleotides for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted from the DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio). The collected data was normalized over Wild Type Esterase and  K227R mutant (lowest activity).

Next Mission: Placing them into only two plasmids
Final Mission: Create an Even Lawn of E. Coli
We are using this top agar plating technique
Next is to test the what the optimal OD, arabinose concentration, and amount of light it takes to a) create an even lawn of E. Coli and b) see contrast between the ""on"" and ""off"" cells
Basic Assembly Protocols
For more insight about the process behind the ligations, here is a sample ligation procedure.  Because the initiator is one of the smaller constructs, we have decided to use it as an example to illustrate the protocols used in lab.
Starting Up
Hydrated parts: BBa_B0034, BBa_C0051, BBa_B0015, BBa_R0082.
Transformed these parts into DH5α competent cells.
RBS to BBa_C0051
Cultured cells that have parts: BBa_B0034 and BBa_C0051
Miniprepped BBa_B0034 and BBa_C0051
Digest with SpeI & Pst
Run on gel
Gel extract
Digest with Xba & Pst
Separate fragments through gel electrophoresis
Gel extract
Ligate the RBS and BBa_C0051 fragments together and transform on carb plates.
Depending on the outcome of visible colonies on the experimental and control plates, a PCR screening may be needed.
Assembly notes
It is most practical to cut RBS as a vector because RBS is less than 100 bp long as an insert, making it hard to see and extract on the gel.
The sticky ends from the XbaI and SpeI, when ligated together, will form an 8 bp scar.  Thus, XbaI and SpeI will no longer be able to cut here.

Customers and Sales - Both having a customer base (market segment control) and sales to these customers were taken into consideration based on the number of customers and the size of the contracts that we would hold with these members based on previous evaluations made in our financial reporting
Investment - Finally, contribution through investments or loans are considered to count towards the value of the company. This was determined by estimated contributions from 2014-2016.
See the figure below for a summary of our evaluation:
Funding Our Venture
In order to gain the funds required, a financial commitment is required.  To achieve this we have demonstrated a need for multiple rounds of funding from government granting programs, industry collaboration and partnerships, angels, and venture capitalists.
At our present stage, we plan to facilitate the need for our approximately $450,000 start-up costs through government granting programs, personal funding, and industry collaboration.  Our team aims to use numerous provincial and federal opportunities to subside salaries, reagent and equipment costs, as well as the legal and administrative concerns.
In the subsequent years we plan on strategically targeting angel investment as a method to ensure our technologies development.  Manufacturing opportunities will allow for decreased cost of prototyping development and producing our product.
After release of our product into the market in 2016, we aim to seek venture capital funding to take our company to the next level, expanding into new domestic and international markets across the world.

This equation can be solved either analytically or numerically to yield solutions as follows.
Analytical steady state solution
The steady state solution can easily be calculated by setting \(\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}\) to zero. This solution of the resulting equation is of the form
\[ C(h)=C_{1} e^{kh}+C' \]
Substituting this in the steady state equation yields \(k=\frac{-V_s}{D}\). The value of \(C_1\) and \(C'\) can be found by normalizing this answer with the total number of gas vesicles in the column and applying the necessary boundary conditions.
Illustration 1: Steady state solution for a column
We assume the boundary conditions to be such that \(C'=0\), \(C_1\) can be calculated by normalizing the function over the number of gas vesicles in the column.
\[ \int_{0}^{L} C_1 e^{\frac{-V_s h}{D}} A dh = N \]
where A is the area of the column and N the total number of gas vesicles in the vessel. The normalized equation is
\[ C(h)=\frac{V_s N}{AD(1-e^{\frac{-V_sL}{D}})} e^{\frac{-V_s h}{D}} \]
a
We take the following parameters to simulate a 1 cm2 cuvette with solution filled up to a height of 2 cm:
\[V_s \sim \frac{4gR_H^2}{18\eta} (\rho-\rho_{gv})\]
\[A \sim 1 cm^2\]
\[D = 6\pi \eta R_H \]
\[L \sim 2cm\]
To take into account the dependence of terminal velocity on hydrodynamic size, we have considered the gas vesicle to be a sphere of a radius equal to the hydrodynamic radius measured in DLS. The steady state profiles for some effective \(R_H\) are given below,
Figure 1: Gas vesicle concentration profile at steady state (C0 is the mean concentration in the column)

Concerns about accidental leakage of GMO
Advancement in science and engineering has led us to the era of synthetic biology. By reprogramming living things at DNA level, synthetic biologists could introduce new characteristics or modify existing properties to create synthetic organisms for the sake of human well-beings. For example, bacteria and yeast have been engineered for drug production that can hardly be obtained in nature1 and for cleaning-up large scale environmental pollution2. Given the rapid development of synthetic biology, more sophisticated organisms with de novo applications may be created in the future. Meanwhile the expanding applications of synthetic biology have also raised public concerns over the risk of accidental leakage of synthetic organisms which may jeopardize the ecosystem and public health3,4.
Control of leakage
Although no one has fully understood the actual impacts of escaped synthetic organisms on the environment yet, various containment policies have been adopted to minimize accidental leakage of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Physical containment, such as proper handling of genetically modified microorganisms (GMM) with suitable containment equipment and implementation of laboratory practice is one of the simplest way to prevent escape of synthetic organisms3. However this strategy may not be applicable to open-setting applications, for example biomining5 and biosensing6 which often involve deliberate dispersal of GMO covering large area.
To address this problem, intrinsic containment or ‘built-in safeguard’ have been developed to control unintentional release of GMM. One of them is to design auxotrophic organisms by removing metabolic pathways responsible for synthesizing essential nutrients, such that modified organisms can only survive in the environment with addition of essential nutrients7. Alternatively, lethality can be induced by built-in killswitch which will be activated when GMM escape from specific environment. For instance, iGEM13_BGU_Israel has designed an IPTG-and-arabinose-regulated repressible killswitch using holin and lysozyme, in which escape from medium containing IPTG or arabinose would lead to lysis of bacterial cell wall, and hence cell death.
Toxin-based killswitches seem to be effective in eliminating escaped GMM but undestroyed plasmid and chromosomal DNA could remain intact in the environment for months8. Moreover, a recent astrobiological research has demonstrated that up to 35% of plasmid DNA remain functional even after expose to high temperature and pressure9. Chances are"

We also expect to see lower expression of cytokines in the -LPS wells (columns 10-18) when compared to the same treatments with LPS (columns 1-9).
The no cDNA column should show no result, as there is no cDNA present to amplify. This column represents a negative control in order to identify a contamination, if one occurs. Beta-actin acts as an housekeeping gene, therefore we expect to see similar expression levels in all samples 1-10.
Results:
Figure 4: Quantitative qPCR of TNFα  mRNA expression in knocked-down IKK (shIKK) microglia BV2 cells.   LPS activated BV2 microglia with and without IKK knockdown (shIKK) showed reduction in TNFα expression in microglia cells treated with shIKK compared to wild-type control cells (WT).  
The +shIKK +LPS samples expressed less TNFa than the -shIKK +LPS samples. Each sample with LPS expressed more TNFa than the same sample without LPS.
Discussion:
We were unable to include the -shIKK samples in our conclusions, as the values from these samples were erratic due to technical errors. Therefore, the results of this experiment are inconclusive. Time allowing, this experiment must be repeated.

SYSU-CHINA,2018,Team:SYSU-CHINA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," bispecific anti-       CD19 anti-CD3 antibody(Brudno and Kochenderfer, 2016) . However, the underlying mechanism        remains unknown(June et al., 2018) .
On-target off-tumor toxicity
On-target off-tumor toxicity is induced when the target antigen is also expressed on non-tumor tissues, despite its lower expression        level, and CAR T cells can inflict normal tissue damage by target antigen recognition. Such toxicity has been documented in the        literature and has even lead to fatality. In one study 3 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving CAR T cells        targeting carboxyanhydrase-IX (CAIX) developed liver damage, due to unexpected expression of CAIX on the bile ducts (Lamers et al., 2013) . The risk is further exemplified by another study in which a patient        with metastatic colorectal cancer experienced acute respiratory distress and pulmonary edema and subsequently died after infusion of        CAR Ts targeting ERBB2 (Her-2/neu), possibly due to expression of ERBB2 on lung tissue(Morgan et al.,        2010) .
Cross-reactivity
Cross-reactivity occurs when CAR T cells recognize antigens on normal tissues similar to target antigen, possibly leading to organ        damage. By far no cross reactivity of CAR T cells has been reported, instead such toxicity has been observed in clinical trials using        modified TCR T cells(Cameron et al., 2013) .
Current Methods
Immunosuppressive drugs
To date the most common method for CRS management is giving immunosuppressive drugs. Tocilizumab (Actemra), an anti-interleukin-6-       receptor antagonist originally developed for rheumatoid arthritis, is often effective in the management of CAR T cells related        cytokine release syndrome and has been approved by the FDA for such treatments(Brudno and        Kochenderfer, 2016) .
Corticosteroids are given when patients are not responsive to Tocilizumab, but they are not considered as the first option since they        can interfere with T cell functions and induce T cell apoptosis(Brudno and Kochenderfer, 2016) , with some research demonstrating that prolonged administration of corticosteroids can impair CAR T therapy efficacy (Davila et al., 2014) .
A potential risk for immunosuppressive treatment is its global effect on the immune system, rendering the patients more vulnerable to        opportunistic infections by bacteria, fungi and viruses. It has been demonstrated that rhe"

siRCon - A siRNA Constructor
Short Summary
In our project, we introduced RNA interference (RNAi) and translation repression with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) as an alternative to CRISPR/Cas. To use siRNA as silencing agents for the gene-of -interest, we proposed a two-step design process. At first, potential siRNAs for prokaryotic organisms must be designed. In the second step, the silencing effect of these siRNAs can be validated by our siRNA vector system TACE . To facilitate the initial siRNA design step, we developed a siRNA construction tool which identifies possible siRNAs for a given gene sequence, calculates their probability to silence the target gene, and returns candidates ranked based on the calculated score. It consists of three modules: ""siRNAs for RNAi"", ""siRNA"", and ""check siRNA"". The siRNAs predicted by our software are perfectly compatible with our siRNA vector system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tool dedicated to predicting customized siRNA for application in prokaryotes. This Python tool comes in two versions: a command line application and an easy-to-use graphical interface.
siRNAs short introduction
siRNAs are small, non-coding single-stranded RNAs with an average length of 21-25 nucleotides which bind a specific complementary coding mRNA and silence its function. In eukaryotic RNAi, siRNAs are loaded to Argonaute proteins which carry out the repression, either by blocking mRNA translation or by"

Introduction
Fig 1. The overview of the system. Gene regulatory network is composed of three modules: invasion operon, endosome detection operon and cytoplasmic operon. Invasion and cytoplasmic operon are bistable switches regulated by endosome detection operon.
This project attempts to create E. coli strain capable of entering the eukaryotic cells by means of controlled expression of invasin gene from Yersinia sp. together with internalinA gene from Listeria monocytogenes st. EDG-e. This leads to internalization of the bacteria into the phagosome of the host cell. To escape the endosome we will apply bacterial hemolysin ( listeriolysin ) from Listeria monocytogenes. The coordination of protein expression is based on switching the E. coli cells between four physiological states: growth in the medium, ability to enter mammalian cells, presence in the phagosome , and escape from the phagosome into the cytoplasm.

Description
Abstract
The idea that a basic biological system could be used in the production of a related group of molecules suggests that this kind of manufacturing could be designed to optimally synthesize specific products from a wide range at a given time. The proper strategies for the modular design and execution of such projects are hereby addressed, making it possible to manipulate such modules in a project’s genetic construct with ease and resource frugality. A software tool is implemented for the appropriate design of a master DNA sequence with modular restriction sites placed in such a way that further cloning is facilitated. As proof of concept, a biological platform in the yeast Pichia pastoris is proposed for the production of terpenoids, useful hydrocarbons linked by the mevalonate pathway as their common source, focusing on the synthesis of lycopene. The restoration of an RNAi mechanism in the yeast by insertion of Saccharomyces castellii genes is also proposed for its use in silencing the ERG9 gene, responsible for the synthesis of the terpenoid squalene, further optimizing the platform. Additionally, the insertion of an N-terminus truncated enzyme from the mevalonate pathway to limit reported metabolic regulation is set forth, together with the use of the peroxisome targeting signal type 1 in the enzymes used. The need for reliable promoters for P. pastoris is addressed by characterizing three inducible promoters with GFP as a reporter.

Questioning Central Dogma
The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is the foundation of modern-day synthetic, molecular, and microbiology. While countless innovations in medicine and technology are based on the truth of the doctrine, it does not always accurately predict results in the lab. The Penn State iGEM team questions the central dogma with genetic constructs explore deviations from the norm.

Welcome!
Welcome to the Penn State iGEM page! Here you can find information on all of our projects , progress , achievements , and much more.
We are currently working on three projects that question the dogma of the Central Dogma of Biology. The Central Dogma is the commonly held belief that within biology, information flows from the order of nucleotides in DNA to the order of nucleotides in RNA and finally to the order of amino acids in a protein. These proteins then go on to complete a variety of functions that make life work.
Molecular biology can be challenging to understand. Check out our Synthetic Biology For Dummies animation below!

Picked up the Machine Learning again, after experimenting a lot the main idea now is to compare proteins that are defined as cry and non-cry which do have a certain amount of sequence similarity. This was done by comparing all cry proteins in my database against the current Uniprot database, and then removing all cry proteins and proteins that could be cry proteins.

Improving pipeline and making sure that the blast works with a nice cutoff, gonna have to make sure that all the cutoffs are exposed to the initial tool run.
The end result is gonna be 3 files with lots of info per tool and 3 files of just genemark codes, which I can put into an online Venn-Diagram tool from the university of Gent.

Diffusion model
The model about the diffusion of the repressor
The models described on the ‘model-intagrase model’ page simulate the entire recombination procedure in our in vivo system. These models laid the solid theoretic basis for the feasibility of our project. However, our wet lab results are far less satisfying than the expected data from the prediction of these models. The serious leakage of the promoters is the main cause here.
In order to get a better understanding of the problem, we came up with a new model that focuses especially on the concentration of the repressor for the promoter at different site in the cell. The model wants to prove that the diffusion of the repressor results in the lower concentration around the promoter than the one in center of the gene site where the repressor protein  is produced. Therefore, the lower concentration of repressor causes the high probability of separation between the repressor and promoterwhich then explains the extremely high leakage of the promoter.
Figure 3.1 | The green’s function can perfectly describe the diffusion with a delta function source which shows an instantaneous pulse in time and infinite concentration in space. If the time approaches the infinity, the concentration will be uniform distribution ultimately. However, our diffusion model with a sustained pulse can be regarded as an accumulation of a series of the green’s model.
In order to describe the change of the concentration with the distance from the original transcription and translation site in cell, we set up a diffusion model.
Firstly, we use Fick’s first law to define the dynamic process:
The gradient of the concentration is not always constant, so we use Fick’s second law to describe the non-equilibrium state.
Expanding to three dimension, the formula becomes:
We made following assumptions to simplify the formula:
a. The diffusivity D does not change with the position.
b. The diffusion is spherically symmetric.
Then we can get the simplified formula:
In an E.coli cell, we assume that the repressor is produced from a point without volume, which we call it point source. And as we state in chapter III, the protein producing rate will reach a balance with the dilution and degradation rate. In addition, there is a Neumann boundary we should consider"
Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," today if you are oversupplied! [21]
Brazil
A nationwide, multicentre study of diabetes in Brazil by Cobas et al (2013) found that; “The average annual direct medical cost per capita was US$1319.15. Treatment-related expenditure (US$1216.33 per patient, per year) represented 92.20% of total direct medical costs. Insulin administration supplies and Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (US$696.78 per patient, per year) accounted for 52.82% of these total costs.” [30] Furthermore, the one Brazilian respondent to our survey stated; [10]
“No estado onde moro no Brasil o acesso público ao medicamento é relativamente fácil. No entanto, ocorre falta do medicamento repetidas vezes ao longo do ano”
Translation: “In the state where I live in Brazil the public access to medicine is relatively easy. However, there is lack of the drug again and again throughout the year.”
Figure 14.Insulin and self-monitoring of blood glucose (test strips) account for the majority of a Diabetic’s medical expenses. The paper states that “Approximately 68% of the participants in our study were of low or very low economic status. To save money, these individuals may use their supplies inappropriately (e.g. they may reuse disposable supplies, use lower doses of medication or perform SMBG less often than recommended by clinical diabetes monitoring and treatment guidelines).”  [30] In addition, the authors suggest another very real danger implicit in patient’s spending so much on supplies; “more money is being spent on SMBG supplies than on physician and dietitian consultations and nurse counselling. These findings point to the need to pay greater, more logistical and financial attention to the integral health assistance model, which involves investing in a multidisciplinary team and focusing on health education and on the rational and effective use of the procedures and technologies available.”  [30] High insulin costs don’t just undermine the ability of diabetics to treat their condition, they also undermine the very medical industry that attempts to protect those with Diabetes.
Australia - Developed Nation, High Public Healthcare Expenditure
Australia has one of the world’s most well funded ‘Pharmaceutical Benefit Schemes’ - which ensures cheap medication at the cost of an exacerbated tax burden due to the non-competitive market. As such, the overall insulin expense is steadily increasing for the Australian government. Even with this rapid growth, it is likely that cost inflation is mitigated by contractual agreements between major pharmaceutical companies and the PBS.

Week 1 - May 4 to 8
On week one, we focused on finding literature about the specific chemistry of silver staining. In general, we did not find any literature about the specific, molecular interactions of the silver stain dye with proteins. Many of the articles even stated that the exact mechanism of silver staining remains unknown.
Week 2 - May 11 to 15
This week, we researched on the scientific basis of color. More specifically, we looked into how the interaction between silver, protein and the polyacrylamide gel produces a certain color. We found that the size of silver nano-particles and the refraction of light is how we perceive different colors.
We also tried to look into the electron cloud and how electron excitation produces certain wavelengths of light
Week 3 - May 18 to 24
Our research continued for the source of color in silver staining.
We attended the geekStarter workshop hosted by Alberta Innovates at the University of Calgary on Sunday, May 24. We presented questions about iGEM to a panel of experts. We also got one on one ""speed-"
UMaryland,2015,Team:UMaryland#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," potential to take advantage of the Hok-Sok cassette as a method of post-transcriptional control over a variety of genes. As hok is indirectly regulated by the upstream binding of sok to mok, there is potential to control protein expression through using the interplay of sok and mok to prevent the translation of various mRNA transcripts. Although we did not focus on this, there is great potential for experimentation.
As mentioned earlier, many synthetic biology projects, including those within iGEM, intend to release their final product into nature. As our testing supports the conclusion that Hok-Sok can successfully be implemented to maintain plasmids without antibiotics, it would be intriguing to test this further ourselves or see other iGEM teams test this by implementing the Hok-Sok cassette as the maintenance system on a project where the final product is intended for release into  nature. Successful implementation of this would further prove the efficacy of Hok-Sok as an alternative plasmid maintenance system and as a method for combating the widespread use of antibiotics and growing population of antibiotic resistant bacteria."

Main processes considered in this model are similar to basic circuit model, this model is special for its cyclic processes. To simulate the inversion function of recombinase, we need to switch different groups of equations by detecting some key values of pH.
○ Cre/Flp regulation circuit
Cre-LoxP and Flp-FRT circuits are shown in Figure.8. To describe the function of recombinases, we set cyclic processes in our model.
Fig.8 Gene circuits of Cre/Flp regulation system
Our results show that with the application of Cre/Flp circuit, pH Controller can achieve automatic switch in acid and alkali production and stabilize environmental pH level (Fig.9).
Fig.9 Extracellular pH regulated by Cre/Flp regulation circuit. The final pH level fluctuates between the range where both promoters are repressed. To prove the function of circuit, initial environmental pH was set up to 8.0, indicating that our circuit had already been induced.
○ Bxb1 Regulation Circuit
The second fine-regulation circuit is led by recombinase Bxb1 (Fig.10). Bxb1 can invert the constitutive promoter to both sides, thus, the eventual pH level is determined by strength of both acid and alkali.
Fig.10 Gene circuit of Bxb1
Here we assumed that Bxb1 had reached stable condition, where the inversion efficiency of Bxb1 to both sides were the same. Results show that with the Bxb1 regulation circuit, pH could be regulated to a suitable level (Fig.11).
Fig.11 pH level change led by Bxb1 regulation circuit. Bxb1 can invert the constitutive promoter to both sides, thus, the eventual pH level is determined by strength of both acid and alkali. To prove the function of circuit, initial environmental pH was set up to 8.0, indicating that our circuit had already been induced. Eventual pH is determined by functional genes, and can reach other value if functional genes are replaced.
○ FimE Regulation Circuit
The last fine-regulation circuit is led by recombinase FimE (Fig.12). This recombinase can only invert the promoter for one time.
Fig.12 Gene circuits of FimE.
Results prove that with the application of FimE regulation circuit, pH Controller can regulate environmental pH to the level determined by the strength of acid (Fig.13). ldh"

For phage and anhydrotetracycline dependent geneIII (gIII) expression a fusion promoter (Carlson et. al) consisting of a phage shock promoter (psp) and anhydrotetracycline induced domain was used (Ppsp-tet).
Gene III is followed by mNeonGreen, a reporter fluorophore to measure gIII expression level. The backbone consists of a E. coli origin of replication (ColE1 ori) and an ampicilline resistance. A non-coding sequence has been added between backbone and Ppsp-tet because all fragments are assembled by Gibson assembly following the cloning standard.

The psp-tet promoter sequence is taken from Carlson et. al (Negative Selection) and was ordered as a gblock. psp-tet promoter is flanked by gibson overlap 1 on the 5´end and gibson overlap 2 on the 3´end.
GeneIII is extracted from a Dickinson plasmid (Jin_177:_p15A_origin_pG). On the 5´end geneIII is concatenated to gibson overlap 2 and on the 3´end to gibson overlap 3.
mNeonGreen or any other reporter system is taken from the PAM-PACE accessory plasmid. mNeonGreen gblock includes gibson overlaps 3 and 4 at 5´and 3´end.
The backbone includes a ColE1 ori and AmpR and is extracted from pSB1A3. By using primers with extensions gibson overlap 4 is added to the 5´end and gibson overlap 5 to the 5´end.
The non-coding fragment between Gibson overlap 5 and 1 is extracted from the iGEM Distribution Kit and contains 256 bp from BBa_K808003, a small subunit B1 of the tripartite tricarboxylate transporter family.
With primers PP_005_fwd and PP006_rev a fragment from coding sequence is extracted (bp 78-334). The extracted fragment consists of 265 bp and with the named primers gibson overlap 5 is added to the 5´end and gibson overlap 1 is added to the 3´end.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic"

Latin America
In our search to expand and build bridges within Latin America’s synthetic biology community we collaborated directly with team USP-EEL-Brazil and Team TecCEM, who hosted a Latin America meetup which we attended through video conference. We also attended to the brazillian team Jamboree, at the beginning of the year.
USP-EEL-Brazil
USP-EEL-Brazil team worked with estrogen contamination in water and needed their hormones in a purified form to test their degradation. We got in touch with Professor Wothan Tavares de Lima, who gladly provided us with the samples used by the team.
TecCEM
In the meetup hosted by TecCEM team we discussed the teams projects and received feedback on our project, especially in regards to how we designed ou plasmids and on their workings.   As a result of the meetup we were kindly invited to take part in the “Moves like iGEM” video in september.
Brazillian Meetup
One of our members attended to the brazillian team ""Jamboré"", at the start of the year, where we could share experiences from veterans, project ideas, and ultimately bond and strengthen our brazillian iGEMers community. The meetup was organized by the USP-ESALQ prospective team, that is planning on entering the competition in the near future. Teams USP-EEL, UNESP-AQA were present, along with other prospective teams, ranging from the whole country, from Rio de Janeiro to Manaus. The experience was great and we hope to see more iGEM teams in Brazil rise from this collaboration!
Düsseldorf
In an effort to evaluate how our system would respond to the chemically characterized HSL molecule, we got in touch with Duesseldorf team 2018. They kindly provided us 3OC6 HSL for our Lux system, which allowed us to conclude that our project has a great potential to test not only biological but also chemical crosstalk between different quorum sensing devices. This can be performed by using two compatible plasmids at the same time."

NYMU Bioenergy Team developed Enhanced CO2 Capturing Microalgae
A bioenergy research team led by Dr.  Chuan-Hsiung Chang, an associate professor at the Center for Systems and  Synthetic Biology in National Yang-Ming University (NYMU), has designed and  engineered a synthetic microalgal genome for enhancing carbon dioxide capture.  This research result has been published in the August issue of the world-class  top journal""Energy & Environmental Science""and is subjected to a  patent application.
Dr. Chang is leading a research team  working on genome analysis, design and engineering and currently engaging in  National Science Technology Program (NSTP) - Energy Project for Carbon Capture  and Storage (CCS) in Taiwan. The NYMU research team has developed a platform  for both Computer Aided Whole Genome Analysis (GenomeCAA) and Computer Aided  Whole Genome Design (GenomeCAD) based on the integration of Systems Biology and  Synthetic Biology. Through this integrated platform, Dr. Chang's genome team  was able to design a gene regulation system in microalgae cell for producing  and secreting carbonic anhydrase (CA), which was proved to increase CO2  absorption and to enhance the efficiency of microalgal CO2 bio-mitigation. This  excellent achievement has been invited to be presented in the International  Conference on Next Generation Technologies for Bioenergy and Biomass  Utilisation hold in Singapore in August this year (2012). Dr. Charles Harper of  MIT Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship in United States has  also expressed his interests in this report and has consulted about the detail  of this research result.
Dr. Chang's team has been using the  innovative platform of GenomeCAA and GenomeCAD to design and model the dynamic  interaction networks in engineered microbial cells. Through this computational  simulation of microbial biorobots, the target genes for engineering become easily  predictable and designable, and the achievements in biotechnology and  biomedicine could be greatly improved. Through this excellent achievement in  National Energy Program, the NYMU team not only builds up the relationship in  international cooperation in scientific research but also enhances Taiwan's  international competitiveness in genome-based green energy biotechnology.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," has been an epistemological indicator of which the classifying, delimiting, and other functions had an effect on scientific discussions, and not on what they were talking about.’ (Foucault, 1971)  Of course that was 1971, when even recombinant DNA technology was a new idea.  Perhaps the concept of life wasn’t the reason for early biological epistemology, but could the work of synthetic biology, in the area of the minimal genome and artificial life actually play a role in changing the use of the word life from an epistemological indicator to a scientific concept in its own right? After all much of this field is actually driven by a desire to understand the functions, limitations and threshold of life.  A leader in this area is of course Dr Venter; ‘What is life? I don't think there are that many biologists trying to answer that one.... We're...working on a reductionist view of trying to take the smallest genome that we have...and see if we can't understand how those...[genes] work together to create life...’ (Cho et al, 1999).  Such a reductionist approach is questioned by Cho et al, who mention how reductionist logic has led to erroneous conclusions such as thinking that viruses were the phylogenetic precursors to cellular life.
Where does the ethics of synthetic biology apply to all this? Is this not simply academic wrangling over a conceptual definition?  This cannot seriously be conceived as the case.  There is concern that making such debate an ethical matter may lead to a fracturing of opinion based on different ethical foundations between different religions, groups and societies.  However it is pointed out ‘There are virtually no major ethical differences between the basic texts of Judaism, Christianity, Islam Buddhism, Confucianism and Greek and Roman applied philosophy.  The four Confucian qualities are goodness, conscience, reverence and knowledge.  You may debate these, but they reflect the same concepts, and, when carefully translated, the same words as the various European traditions.’ (Saul, 2001) In fact those four traits can be seen to be mirrored in many secular societies as well, arguing for goodness, conscience, knowledge and for example in environmental groups, a reverence towards our ecosystems.  Saul argues that there are very few issues on which there can be no consensus, ‘What about the daily questions we must deal with?  How many are ethically unresolvable within the Western tradition?  Very few.  Of course, there is endless room for disagreement and debate, but not to"

Education & Public Engagement
A.  Education
    Based on our idea “Science for all”, we vigorously engaged ourselves into education and science advocating activities. All events have served for our final goal in long run: creating a science culture for all generations in our community in the future.
On June 22th The first station: Tian-E-Hu kindergarten
I. Science speech
    In this section, we introduced probiotics to children, and talked to them about the relationship between probiotics and our daily food, including yogurt, pickle and others. We also explained how probiotics work in our intestines. They showed great curiosity and asked us lots of questions about probiotics. We answered them patiently in an understanding way.
 
II. Drawing bacteria
     In this section, we asked the children to image how bacteria look like and draw them down. What they have drawn showed their rich imagination and understanding about our introduction.
     In summary, what we have done in Tian-E-Hu kindergarten enabled these children to understand the probiotics, and inspired their interest in science.
 
On July 8th The second station: the youth palace
     This section was meant for adults and teenagers. We made some display boards, which articulate and connect fundamental ideas in genetics, synthetic biology and iGEM without technical vocabulary and dense detail. Parents whose children was engaged with our other activities can come and listen. We got great feedback from them. They asked many questions and learned a lot in this section. This is also a mutual understanding between our project and its potential consumers.
 
B.  Communication with related Companies
    Eager to know market demands and trading policies, as well as solving problems encountered during the experiments, we went to visit several biopharmaceutical companies. In the process of communication with the company's R&D personnel, we first introduced our project and raised our questions, and then they provided us with some suggestions. In short, by communicating with corporates, we have gained a lot and what we learned played an important guiding role in the follow-up experiments.

Maybe we can make two kinds of questionnaire to hand out before and after the lecture to compare to get a better conclusion.
Theme Fresco
Besides those activities related to synthetic biology we’ve mentioned above, we assisted XMU_Software in finishing a theme fresco in Furong Tunnel.
Furong Tunnel can be said to be the most attractive scenery of Xiamen University, visited by more than 30,000 people per day statistically. We made this work in consideration of its attractiveness, which can greatly help us to popularize not only synthetic biology and iGEM but also our team. In fact, many students witnessed the fresco, maybe called doodles more appropriately, made by iGEMers from Xiamen University. Some of them took photos and asked us about iGEM. It improved a good interaction between our team and these students and tourists to popularize iGEM competition and synthetic biology.
Collaborations
First
We collaborated with Purdue iGEM team to create a definitive characterization standard for the parts registry. All the teams participated required to fill out a survey which was about the important items in the registry page. Purdue iGEM team worked out a standard protocol which contains all of the details. The other teams need to complete it better or put forward some questions and problems. To make this work easy, we had a video meeting with the Purdue iGEM team and USP Brazil team through the GOOGLE HANGOUTS. It really helped us to exchange the opinions just like face to face.
As we know, the members of this collaboration are currently over 50 teams so that it is the biggest collaboration in the iGEM history. We feel awesome about what we did!
Second
On April 5th, 2013, Haoqian Zhang, advisors of Peking University iGEM team, a famous iGEMer who is keeping on developing synthetic biology and iGEM in China, came to Xiamen University in purpose of strengthening collaborations our two universities. During his visiting, Mr. Zhang took part in discussions between our two teams, XMU- Software and XMU-China 2013 and gave some good advice focusing on the feasibility，security，advantages and disadvantages of ideas raised by our team members. His words about teamwork were very impressive and educational. Finally, Mr. Zhang simply showed some interesting projects in the past as well as encouraged us all to try our best to perform this year's iGEM projects"

TEC-CHIHUAHUA team
Model a sequence using our software tools & GMOS ‘S regulation in France
Our collaboration with the team Chihuahua started on the 10th of July. We first did a skype to present teams and projects.                     They were interested in our model part, so we offered them our help using our model softwares to get a clearer view about the possible interactions of their enzymes together.                     In order to do so, we used the website Phyre2 to model the only sequence not present in the PBD register: yhiH.
We tested the sequence during all July. Using Phyre2, the molecule was modeled with high reliability and corresponding to other existing close models.                     Using Pymol, we studied the molecule’s identity matching.
We provided a document about the French regulation to help them with their Human project to develop a new law for GMOs regulation in Mexico.
They helped us to build our interactive map, providing us information about synthetic biology in their country and spreading two of our surveys: the first one to their society to understand the society’s GMO perception, and the second one was for their winemakers in Chihuahua.                     They organised a skype with a winemaker, in which we had the chance to interact directly with her and talk about climate disorder, how it affects their vineyards and know their opinion on using SofterShock as a potential solution.
The results from the collaboration were very satisfactory: their sequence was very likely to be the one obtained by experimentation, we obtained several feedbacks from the society and winemakers, and they had extra elements to write a new law for Mexico.
""Besides good friends, the collaboration with IONIS team brought us some improvements in our project, mainly in our modeling. The IONIS modeling team helped us to visualize one of our enzymes: “yhjH”. Based on bibliography and the enzyme optimal conditions, they managed to simulate it in silico, helping us to establish and assume model parameters and enzyme behaviors, among other things. We hoped we helped you as much as you did, thank you so much!”

Potential applications of communication through nanotubes
There are many potential applications of the nanotube communication. Our project is the very beginning of the investigation, but such a mechanism opens non-foreseen opportunities in biotechnology and drug conception.We propose very new and innovative applications in the field of metabolism engineering, amorphous computing and drug design.
Metabolic engineering
Implementing a new metabolic pathway into a cell often leads to rejection of the pathway due to the toxicity of the compounds and the over-expression of the metabolic enzymes. This takes a heavy tool on the host cell.
In order to address this issue, several labs are working on creating ""bacteria consortia"". In these consortia, each species or strain present is taking care of one step of the reaction. This approach presents the problem that all compounds have to pass through the membrane efficiently. Other scientists, linking artificial giant vesicles with artificial metal tubes to build compartimented micro-factories. The problem is that this is no living organism, and the enzymes have to be encapsulated. Also, it is hard to build and unstable.
Using nanotubes between cells would be a great progress in the micro-factory metabolic engineering. Connecting the cells together through nanotubes and having each cell carrying one step of the reaction would combine the advantages of the two previously mentioned techniques without their drawbacks.
A lot of work has to be done before such control is reached but our iGEM project can be a significant step in this direction.
Amorphous computing
Amorphous computing refers to computational systems that use very large numbers of identical, parallel processors with each having limited computational ability and local interactions. The term amorphous computing was coined at MIT in 199"

It is indicated that the liquid crystals are still mostly                             arranged                             vertically. The critical concentration for changing the liquid crystal from the vertical                             alignment to the parallel alignment was not found, but it was found that the antibody                             concentration of 10 ng/mL or less did not cause a change in the color of the liquid                             crystal.

Explore the appropriate antibody concentration
Time:
23 Aug: Antibody concentration 125ng/ml. Antibody concentration 2000ng/ml.
Since the preliminary experiment for exploring the appropriate antibody concentration did not                             find a critical value of the antibody concentration that can change the alignment of the                             liquid                             crystal, it is known from the search that the concentration of the antibody below 10 ng/mL                             does                             not affect the liquid crystal alignment, so we refer to the literature and related research.                             It                             is recommended by field personnel to select a concentration of 500 ng/mL as the initial                             antibody concentration for detecting the antigen. Since the amount of antigen (β2-MG) in                             the urine of our                             current patients with chronic kidney disease is 125 ng/mL in unit conversion, we hope to                             determine the optimal antibody critical concentration by antigen concentration so that the                             concentration is lower than 125 ng/mL. The antigen does not allow the liquid crystals to be                             aligned in parallel, while antigens at concentrations above 125 ng/mL just align the liquid                             crystals in parallel.
Therefore, our team selected 125 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL antigen concentrations for                             experiments. The number of bright spots in 0.125 ng/mL-2 ng/mL parallel light images                             increased                             accordingly, but the overall color was black, and the difference was not large enough                             (Figure                             3).

Since the previous experiments used high antibody concentration or high antigen                             concentration,                             the liquid crystals could not be arranged in parallel to discolor the observation. We                             reflect on                             whether the concentration of DMOAP in the"

The resulted plates for the GFP generators were glowing green even though the presence of PLacI. This indicated a lack of LacI or an excessive production of the plasmid (since a high copy number plasmid was used). A literature review showed that TOP10 cells do not have LacI. Thus, we continue the lab work using k12 E. coli which it is known to produce LacI. Contrary to our expectations, plates with the GFP generators were glowing again, this could be explain in at least two ways: 1) there is a big leakage in the control of PLacI and/or 2) the high copy derived from a high copy number plasmid therefore the LacI present in the cells is not enough to block the action of PLacI.
In order to identify the problem, two strategies were designed. In order to elucidate a shortage of LacI a simple kinetic and a kinetic in a 96-well reader (see below) were done. The simple kinetic consisted in inoculation of 250 μL of cells transformed with one of the plasmids constructed to test the new biobricks in a 4mL minimal medium tube which was incubated overnight at 37°C and 175 rpm. 2mL of the resulted cultures were used to inoculate 2mL minimal medium tubes from which fluorescence was followed for 9 h using a normal black lamp and an orange filter.

The expected results were an increasing in the intensity or glowing in the tubes induced with 2mM IPTG compared with the control. This should probe that even with the leakage and the permanent green glow, the induction accelerates the process of GFP production. Unfortunately, this could not be appreciated in the simple kinetics (see figures G and H). These results showed that the leakage is not the cause of the expression of GFP.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

I am a Bachelor of Health Sciences student, majoring in biomedical sciences, going into my third year of undergraduate studies. I am a “molecular biologist”. Before iGEM, my research interests are in obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. I am super excited to be part of the iGEM project this year. I am working towards finding genetic elements that acts as a specific and sensitive sensor for the environmental toxin, naphthenic acids.  In my spare time, I like to play basketball, the clarinet, or watch movies.

Hi, I'm Robert, and I'm in my third year of Biomedical Sciences at the U of C. I've never done any kind of research work before iGEM so I was really excited to have the opportunity to help out with the development of the biosensor this year. The best part of this job is that there's a Timmies (Tim Horton's - a coffee and donut store) on the walk here, so I'm full of energy by the time I get to the lab. The summer will be lots of fun, working with great people and learning a lot about science along the way!

I am a third year student at the University of Calgary studying Biomedical Sciences. In Junior High, I memorized the entire Qur'an, and became class Valedictorian in high school. I have an avid interest in both medicine, specifically clinical genetics, and in Islamic Law and hope to pursue both these career paths. This is my first year in iGEM and I will contribute primarily to the wet lab portion of the research, by identifying a suitable reporter for the naphthenic acids biosensor and in helping to create a promoter library using pseudomonas. I hope to gain valuable research experience from working iGEM this summer and to work towards creating a solution to naphthenic toxicity in Alberta's oil sands.

Motivation
Our project focuses on genetic circuits. In the last ten years, iGEM competition has produced and collected thousands of biobricks. And extensive efforts have been made to create the technique standard for biobricks. A genetic circuit usually composes of several biobricks and can perform some predefined function. Our project aim to go one step further, that we develop the technique standard for genetic circuits and build up a central database for collecting and sharing genetic circuits.
Actions
So, here are our actions
Technical standard
We proposed two technical standards this year (RFC 101 and RFC 97) to define logical gene module and genetic circuits.
Circuit+
a central database for genetic circuits
Inspired by the Registry of Standard Biological Part database, we came up with an ambitious plan that we should make the Registry of Standard Genetic Circuit. Our goal is to collect all previous iGEM projects and all published synthetic biology projects.
The ultimate goal of our project is to promote sharing in synthetic biology community! We have a future plan of establishing a community based on Mind Road and LGD, for we clearly know the importance of sharing design. To make the sharing efficient and effective, we proposed a technique standard for documentation of a genetic circuit
LGD
LGD is short for Logical Genetic Digram. It is a computer aided graphical generator integrated into our database. User can see the circuits and the relations between parts.
SBOL
Our software support SBOL. SBOL is used in the data-exchanging interface of the software and users can upload and comment circuits.
Clotho application: Circuit List and TTEC
We developed a Clotho version of circuitplus, with the name “Circuit List”. We also developed TTEC in clotho, which is originally created by SUSTC-Shenzhen-B in 2012.

Working in the  lab has had its great moments as well as its difficult times that through  creativity and perseverance, we were capable of overcoming them. At the  beginning of the summer we started experiencing difficulties with the plasmid  DNA extractions. Since we were working with low-copy plasmids, we had to  increase the pellet size we were using by more than what we could’ve predicted.  Once we finally obtained the plasmid DNA, we began trying to carry out the  enzyme restriction digests. We faced a great amount of difficulty carrying them  out because of the required amounts of DNA and enzymes weren’t matching. 
Later on, we had  the bacterial sequences synthesized and we began thinking about how to build  our device. At first we tried setting it up and after several failed attempts  we decided to regroup and analyze all of our steps in order to identify our  error. We had brainstorming meetings, we looked up outside information, and we  worked as a team to fully understand the biological processes at hand.
Once we were  sure we understood what our mistakes were and why our device wasn’t being built  correctly, we could start anew. For this, we decided to designing artificial  restriction sites with the use of oligonucleotides that we, as a group, designed.   
Throughout the  summer we were constantly in contact with our mentor, Dr. Cuero, who was  guiding us through this experience. We frequently engaged in brainstorming  sessions in which we discussed the different steps of our project and proposed  new ideas. Additionally, he would always let us express our ideas and thoughts,  listening attentively and encouraging us to follow through with our ideas,  which in the end resulted in the overcoming of our obstacles.
We have also had the support of former IGEM competitor Silvana Saieh throughout   this experience. Having attended the IGEM in 2007, she has been able to guide us   through this experience making sure we are taking the right steps. She has also   played an important role in helping us prepare for the Jamboree.
Being this the  first time we’ve all worked in a lab and encountered these biological processes  and laboratory techniques, it was an incredible experience. Throughout the  summer we managed to get some"

Collaborations
Here at the UCLA iGEM Team, we firmly believe that the basis of all progress is teamwork and collaboration. This year, we have formed a number of collaborations with not only local California teams, but teams across the world. We hope through our collaborations that our impact and influence on the iGEM and synthetic biology community worldwide will lead to great advancements and success in the field of science.
Second Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup
The UCLA iGEM Team was proud to host the Second Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup at UCLA on July 20, 2016. Team members and advisors from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), University of La Verne, Alverno High School, and the University of Marburg attended the meet-up at the Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA. Each team was able to discuss their ongoing projects and receive feedback and advice on aspects such as experimental design, while learning about what other teams in the iGEM community was working on with the potential to form new collaborations. We also discussed pertinent issues for all iGEM teams in terms of logistics, team organization, fundraising, and project design. Additionally, we discussed the current state of iGEM and synthetic biology as a rapidly emerging biotechnology field in the United States, especially in the context of developing scientific communications to combat rising negative publicity and misinformation toward the use and safety of genetically modified organisms. Through our meet up, we hope to spur not only a collaborative experience in local teams to work together in solving synthetic biology problems, but also a space where teams can discuss the maintenance and sustained success of an iGEM team. Through our meet-up, we hope to facilitate greater collaborations among Southern California teams as well as foster the general iGEM and synthetic biology community.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some"

Philipp Boeing
I have been involved in iGEM at UCL since 2011. This year, apart from advising our undergraduate team, I wanted to try something new with iGEM E. I'm very interested in DIYbio, citizen science in synthetic biology and the lot - so being involved in Darwin's Toolbox excited me a lot.
Bethan Wolfenden
I am a biochemist by background, and I enjoy combining interdisciplinary science with different audiences. I believe experiential learning is the best way to get to grips with new subjects, particularly important emerging technologies like synthetic biology.
Tom Catling
I'm a PhD student in UCL's Optical Science Lab working on thin mirrors for x-ray telescopes. I enjoy making all sorts of stuff and met the other IGEM E team members through UCL's Institute of Making. Biotech is a really interesting field and I firmly believe in a technically and scientifically literate society, so I thought this project sounded very interesting.
Oliver Coles
I'm a PhD student in astronomical instrumentation, specifically focusing on optics, data analysis and target selection for future spectrographic instruments designed to probe dark energy. As a fan of the open source hardware and maker movement I'm excited to be able to work on a project to enable a wider group of people to have fun with biotech.
Desmond Schofield
I am a EngD student in the Department of Biochemical Engineering at UCL working on the production of a biotherapeutic protein for a novel cancer therapy. I enjoy interdisciplinary work and the application and commercialisation of scientific concepts. I am excited to be involved with Darwin's toolbox as it is a chance to expand the use of synthetic biology into new areas and gives me an opportunity to take a hands-on approach to bringing a technology to market.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," that the animation we tries to build are already complicated for us to handle (protein folding and interactions), we doubt that the computer can solve on its own. For now we will do our ways until the meeting with Merry, the expert on Maya, has taken place.
Week 16: August 12 - August 16
The computer Justin was using for his animation work complained the depletion of RAM. As a result he couldn't work effectively in the lab, so we agreed to let him work at home for he has a much powerful desktop. This means that except Monday he was not here with the rest of the lab, but he will show up on the group meeting next Monday to report upon his progress.
Our meeting with Cesar on Monday resulted in division of labour between Justin and me. From that time I will be working on the quantitative modelling (on what problem is yet determined) while Justin will be responsible for the animation (that is, the entire story telling). This supports the decision of letting him work at home, for now there is no need of cooperation between the two of us. For now I studied nDynamics per request of Cesar in case the quantitative modelling will be focused on spatial problems, and then moved on for the modelling of beta-lactamase, a request from Rai with newly found papers on its kinetics.
I also took some time doing readings on Fogler's book Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering. This is because my prior study of enzyme kinetics was still confusing, mostly because Cornish-Brown's book was not presented in the way consistent with my chemical engineering background. Fogler's book, especially Chapter 7, bridged the gap.
Week 17: August 19 - August 23
Meeting with Cesar resulted in the topic of the quantitative modelling being set to the interaction & interaction of TALE and DNA. During the meeting Justin reported his progress on his last movie, which he completed using key-frame. To this Cesar pushed us try harder with nDynamics and Justin responded by that he needs at least a week to study the techniques properly. On the same team our team leader Iain asked us to start writing our progress report and filling the wiki.
While Justin practised at home, I was working on the quantitative model. I adopted the approach of Markov chain by modelling 2D TALE-DNA binding on the strip, with discrete time and space. Since TALE is immobilized to the strip, with each time increment the DNA moves according to the movement rule specified by me, and when certain conditions are met it can either be bind to TALE permanently or can"

Handbook for non-model iGEM organisms
Despite Chlamydomonas reinhardtii being a model organism in the world of microalgae research, its presence at iGEM has been virtually non-existent. With a few exceptions like Concordia 2014 and Valencia 2012 , microalgae has made little of an appearance. While we hope our protein expression plasmid makes it easier for future teams to use Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we went further by contributing to a dedicated non-model organisms guide.
The partnership, facilitated by Yale 2015 , includes the following five teams: Concordia 2015 , Cornell 2015 , University of British Columbia 2015 , University of La Verne , and Utah State University 2015 .
The guide itself appropriately stresses the need for both time and resources for non-E. coli species and emphasizes the utility of in-lab experience to help guide the project. We hope it is of use for future iGEM teams."

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-3_-_-_TEXT.html," made the DNA unusable as a PCR template. We tried using the Zymogen clean and concentrator kit to further purify the DNA, but there wasn’t enough DNA to use for PCR reactions after the clean-up. We performed two more gel extractions using the reagents from the kit but still didn’t get clean enough DNA for further PCR amplification. We finally decided to order the full genes and use the primers from the OE PCRs to amplify the full length genes.
After a successful test reaction at 10uL, we repeated our linearization PCR with a volume of 50uL. Our confirmation gel indicated a successful linearization, although some of the sample streaked above the 10 kb ladder.
We then attempted a transformation of our new chemicompetent Y. lipolytica using our control D17 plasmid. Our transformant cells were then incubated in liquid selective media for outgrowth. We also attempted a transformation of our linearized PCR product from the 50 uL reaction, but later realized that the linearized plasmid was unfit for expression of any genes at this point and so the transformation plate was discarded.
Created YNB+CSM-Leu medium (leucine-deficient) and YNBcasa (uracil-deficient) medium. Attempted to transform Y. lipolytica with pXRL2, ultimately to test if we can miniprep yeast with our protocol. Unfortunately there was no obvious yeast growth on the transformation plates.

Thesis week is upon us! This time around, we struggled a lot less to work as a group and write as a group. The early organization probably helped. We turned in a much more cohesive paper.
We received an invitation to speak at TEDx! This is exciting. We get to tell people about our project, but we also get to bring more attention to the unmet need for modern contraceptives! Our team is really happy about the opportunity to present on such a large platform.
In lab, we had some successful yeast and bacteria transformations, some successful Gibsons, and confirmed Y. lipolytica’s antibiotic resistance.
We also finally received IRB exemption for our questionnaires! This means we can now officially use our questionnaires to gather information about the women who may not have adequate access to modern contraceptives.

The overall design of our team's project is interwoven across several different sections in our wiki. The Experiment page clearly outlines the steps and design processes that our team went through before and during our research. Most notably, we structured our research around a space mission with the end goal of producing a Martian habitat out of mycelium. The actual Mission Architecture addresses several design problems; how will the mycelium grow on Mars? How will the mycelium grow into a specific shape? What shape will this habitat actually be? How will humans on Mars be able to produce more materials when needed? All these vital questions are explored and evaluated in our Mission Architecture page. These considerations and research have been reflected in our approach in the lab and research.
Please read more about our Mission Architecture, and hence the overall design of our project, linked here.

A Proposal of the German iGEM Teams Concerning Intellectual Property
During the meet-up of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[No] one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Science
Protocols for the characterization of transcription initiation were based on the methods of Kelly et al., 2009 (1), but added rtPCR analysis to determine transcript copy number of the reporter mRNA.  We propose this methodology as a minimal measurement standard for promoters and other transcriptional parts.

Cell Growth
LB broth with an appropriate selective antibiotic was used in all cell growth experiments.
From streaked plates, three colonies were picked for each condition tested, and cells were cultured overnight (~12hrs) in liquid media.
All samples were diluted 100x in fresh LB (time = 0).
At time = 3hr, samples were collected for analysis of optical density, RNA purification, and RFP fluorescence.
mRNA
The QIAGEN RNAProtect and RNeasy protocols were followed for total RNA extraction, using 6 x 10^8 cells from each sample.  Purified RNA was eluted with 50uL DEPC-treated water, and absorbance at 260 and 280nm was used to determine RNA concentration and purity.
rtPCR analysis was performed by the Nucleic Acids Research Facility at VCU. NARF also designed and ordered primers and probes for their analysis.
The Anderson promoter BBa_J23100 was used as the reference for rtPCR analysis, and results were normalized to total RNA recovered for each sample.
Protein
To prepare cells for flow cytometer analysis for RFP fluorescence concentration, 0.5 mL of sample was pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 1.0 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS), for a 2x dilution.
Cells were analyzed on a BD FACScalibur flow cytometer kindly provided by Dr. John Ryan, stopping at 100,000 events or 45 seconds. Voltage settings were as follows:
FSC: E00
SSC: 350
FL-1: 474
FL-2: 550
FL-3: 750
The geometric mean of each sample was recorded and compared to that of the reference Anderson promoter BBa_J23100 .
E. coli NEB10beta cells growing on LB were used as a negative control.

WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
We should probably use this section as an opportunity to really expand on the significance of our work. Be specifc, talk about the costs of equipment involved in experimentation. We need to really establish the issues surrounding the lack of funding (how it prevents the expansion of science...things). Make people understand the severity of this problem and get them excited about our potential solution! Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Biosynthetic Make-up
Introduction
Bacillus subtilis is a rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium that lives on soil and in our gastrointestinal tract. As already mentioned in the co-culture setup , B. subtilis  is a part of our co-culture system that is set to be our producing organism of organic compounds. This could be the production of biological compounds such as vitamins, antibiotics or detergents. As a proof of concept, we decided to produce biodegradable plastic called Poly(Lactic Acid-co-3-HydroxyButyrate [P(LA-co-3HB)] that can be used as a raw material for 3D printing. This section would highlight the synthetic make-up and genetic engineering aspects of our project in B. subtilis.
Why Bioplastic in Space?
conventional plastic is one of the world’s most versatile material that is used to make tools, plastic bags, bottles and lab equipments. On planet Earth, conventional plastic is known to be one of the factors promoting environmental pollution because it is non-degradable and can survive for several centuries. When colonizing Mars, it would be wise to choose a more sustainable and environment friendly lifestyle and decisions. In our project, we have chosen Poly(Lactic acid-co-3-HydroxyButyrate [P(LA-co-3HB)] production using approaches within synthetic biology.
We have chosen P(LA-co-3HB) because,
It is a biodegradable, meaning that it is degraded by microorganisms and decompose to water, carbon dioxide and a soil based black material (Drumright RE et. al.,2000).
It has a lifespan of 6 months to 2 years on Earth, but it might be a bit longer in space due to less availability of microorganisms
It is a renewable resource which means that the bioplastic can be reused for another purpose and overcome plastic waste problem on Mars.
It is thermoplastic which means that it can can be warmed up and reused.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Results#Light system_-_-_TEXT.html," for illumination. Our results       indicate that five hours of illumination lead to the highest level of SEAP expression (Fig. 2).
Another important finding was the specificity of the blue light system.        In the dark controls, we found almost no activation of the SEAP reporter,       leading to a very low background level in our system.
SEAP as a Reporter
In order to test the capability of the blue light system for pattern generation, we transfected HEK-293T cells with the appropriate plasmids (PKM292 and PKM297) using seap as a reporter gene (PKM084). Cells were transfected in suspension and seeded on 96 well plates afterwards. Single wells of these plates were covered with a photo mask that prevents exposure to light. All other wells on the plate were illuminated to induce SEAP expression. SEAP that was secreted into the culture medium leads to a colour change from red to yellow after addition of pNPP (chromogenic substrate) by its phosphorylation.
First we generated a coarse pattern realizing that scattered light also reached wells that were close to the illuminated ones, leading to an unclear pattern. However, the rough shape of the desired pattern is discernible (Fig. 3A, B).
Since it was essential to completely prevent light exposure on covered plates, we tested 96 well plates with optically separated wells. We could generate patterns with sharp contours (Fig. 3C, D).
The colour change of pNPP in cell culture medium could be measured at 405 nm in a plate reader. Setting a distinct threshold made pattern recognition easier.
Figure 3: Generation of patterns on 96-well plates.
HEK-293T cells were transfected with the blue light system (PKM292, PKM297) and       light induced SEAP as reporter (PKM084). Single wells were covered with a photo       mask to prevent cell from light exposure. 24 hours after illumination with blue       light, a SEAP assay was performed, leading to a colour change of wells containing SEAP.       (A) Photo mask in heart form, (B) pseudocoloring done at a computer,       (C) the same experiment was performed with optically separated wells,       (D) the contrast was increased and the colours of the wells were changed       at a computer.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," into cells, then biological safety is one thing we must consider about. To prevent harmful genes being expressed in uncontrolled cases, we must do something to prevent possible genetic pollution.  And this year our project can do a lot on this problem. Our o-ribosome device allows translation only when the combination of the o-16s ribosome and o-RBS, so if we put the device at the upstream of the target genes, we can control the expression of target genes precisely. At the same time,  RBS sequences are necessary in almost every cell,therefore an extensive application can be performed by  our o-ribosomal.
Our teammate is performing gel-cutting.
Not only can our project  regulate gene expression  and prevent genetic pollution, but also it will not consume any extra nutrients, and  have no influence on the normal life activities of bacteria.
On the other hand, different RBS sequences can influence the efficiency of the translation, so we can use a series of RBS sequences to regulate  gene expression with a gradient rate. The possibility of genetic pollution can also be reduced in this accurate process.
Finally,  the o-ribosomal devices can be used to establish a orthogonal system, in which cells  have specific o-ribosomal devices instead of the original ones. Being different from other ordinary cells, they cannot be expressed in normal cells even if the target genes from orthogonal system spread out,which leads to  a strong protection against genetic pollution. It is obvious that genetic pollution  can be completely prevented in this orthogonal system. There were also several projects which were related to gene expression regulation in iGEM last year. For example, the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team designed a set of Codon-Switches that regulate target protein biosynthesis (translation).In their rare-codon switch, the translation of the protein can be finely turned up/down with the control of rare tRNA amount, aaRS that charges the rare tRNA and rare codons. Besides they also made other two switches that could be turned on/off without background noise. One called the stop-codon switch was to use stop codon as the controlling element. The other one called the initial-codon switch was to use any codon but the original start codon to initiate translation. What's more, the projects of the BYU Provo team, USTC-China team, Peking-R team and some other teams were all related to gene expression regulation too. We believe that maybe the principles of these projects can also be used in the prevention to genetic pollution. So if you are interested in this, you can know"

ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#Biofilm_-_-_TEXT.html,"-(Histag) biofilms. At the meanwhile, nanorods are firmly attach to biofilm as well for there are histags on biofilm subunits. Electrons from nanorods excited by light thus transfer directly to purified HydA due to short spacial distance and achieve hydrogen production in vitro.
Our ultimate goal is to harness this bio-abiotic hybrid system to efficiently convert solar energy into alternative energy or other high value-added industrial products.
Key Achievements
We tested and proved that all the device we constructed work well:
1. Strains with engineered CsgA subunits :
1) CsgA-Histag   2) His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag   3) His-CsgA-SpyCatcher
can successfully expressed, secreted and realized self-assembly extracellularly.
2. Small peptide histag on CsgA subunits can function well and attach to the ligands on nanorods and quantum dots.
3. Large protein SpyCatcher on CsgA subunits are also able to be secreted by transporter machinery and successfully from nanofibers. We also prove the biological function of SpyCatcher after appending on CsgA subunits, thus provide potential for our second plan mentioned above.
Mechanism
We focused on the bacterial amyloid curli structure. The curli consists of two kinds of amyloid proteins bound together and extending on the cell membrane. CsgA, the main subunit, can self-assemble in the extracellular space creating an amyloid nanowire while CsgB is the part which anchors to the membrane, nucleating CsgA and facilitates extension of nanowire.  CsgA is about 13-kDa, whose transcription needs to be regulated by CsgD and expression are processed by CsgE, F and secreted with the assistance of CsgC, G (these all belong to curli genes cluster. After secretion, CsgA assembles automatically to form amyloid nanofibers, whose diameter is around 4-7 nm and length varies [1]. CsgA subunits secreted by different bacteria individuals will not have trouble in assembling and bridging each other, therefore finally achieving the goal as extensive as an organized community network.
We constructed a library of CsgA biobricks (see Parts ) which are respectively modified with different small peptide domain, endowing the biofilm with designed functions. The expression of CsgA is strictly controlled by inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) and its biomass can be"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more"

Since we are all software team track, unlike experimental team, what we need is more and more feedbacks and technical support to further improve our software. USTC-Software and us decided to test the projects of each other. After testing, we gave them the results of test of Biohub for USTC-Software and shared our experiences and some technical methods on the construction of our database with them so that they might improve their project. Also, they presented their discreet suggestions and feedback which helped us optimize our database BioMaster and it became one of our basis on the improvement of our project.
USTC to UESTC: Your information is comprehensive and the UI surface is user-friendly. However, the ranking of search results is to be optimized when searching with iGEM_ID, such as searching for BBa_K104000, the first display of BBa_K1040001, and BBa_K104000 in the back position. You’d better give out a guidance to each information, for example, new user may not know what EPD& RegulonDB contains of.
UESTC to USTC: The response of your Biohub is more than goodness. The design is good to see and is clear enough for users. However, there’s no specific introduction on the main page and it may mislead the users. If an example is provided on the editor page will be more user-friendly and clear.

I ran 5 ul of the undigested tyrosinase from tube 4/8-2010 with 1 ul 6X loading dye in an agarose 1 % gel 80 V.

This undigested sample looks compared to the NgoMIV digested tyrosinase vector control from yesterday to have travelled further down, meaning that the digested tyrosinase has indeed become cut. A circular vector travels further in an agarose gel compared to a cut linjerized vector.
