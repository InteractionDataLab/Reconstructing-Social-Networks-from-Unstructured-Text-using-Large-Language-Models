As a scaffold for chemical biotinylation, we produced and purified PAS-lysine and GFP. We extensively characterized all proteins as well as the biotinylated forms of the latter group plus BSA by ESI-TOF, SDS-PAGE, and IEF; moreover, we determined the affinity of streptavidin variants via fluorescence titration and their thermal stability using CD spectra. We produced all target proteins in good purity and successfully biotinylated PAS-lysine, GFP, and BSA.
A fully functional cross-kingdom membrane localization toolbox
Based on our modular membrane protein design, we evaluated the functionality of different signal peptide in shuttling the protein into the membrane. Apart from taking the BioBrick EGFR signal peptide, we designed two further signal peptides with increased translational efficiency, incorporating items such as the Kozak sequence. These three signal peptides were analyzed in silico as well as experimentally using a luciferase secretion assay. The BM40 signal, one of our self-designed constructs, was most efficient and thus incorporated into our other devices. Additionally, we incorporated three reporter modules (mRuby3, A3C5 epitope tag and strep-tag II) into the receptors. The finished constructs were used to generate semi-stablly transfected and stable cell lines. Protein localization was confirmed via fluorescence and high-resolution fluorescence microscopy, including characterization of a trafficking signal for increased membrane localization, and the recombinant protein was quantified by FACS and Western blot. mRNA expression levels were detected by RT-q-PCR. For visualization, aggregation of functionalized cells with Strep beads was subjected to SEM. The bacterial autotransporter was characterized and found to successfully shuttle small protein domains to the extracellular surface.
Chemical synthesis of amino-reactive biotinylation compounds
Apart from the standard biotin-NHS, several other derivatives spacing biotin and NHS apart by an amino acid residue were synthesized. These derivatives were used in the chemical biotinylation of BSA in order to assess their relative stability toward cleavage by the plasma protein biotinidase. The assay principle is based on a colorimetric reaction and was developed by ourselves. Compared to biotinylation via regular biotin-NHS, the derivative incorporating a spacer aminocaproic acid is cleaved somewhat faster, allowing to dissolve a cell mesh more quickly"

7.  Our approaches to the questions we encountered
Through the activities mentioned above, we  found two questions about our project. The first is whether the tool would be  really useful for understanding the economic system. The second is how we can solve  the safety problem (related  to commercialization.)
Our approaches to these problems were questionnaire  to students and interview to a biosafety specialist.
First, we sent out questionnaires to the students of Tokyo  Institute of Technology to confirm whether  our project would help the understanding of economic system. The results are (WHERE?)
Second, we consulted the biosafety expert, Mr.  Tomoya Saito, who is working for National Institute of Public Health. He gave us a lecture on dual-use technology. After that, we asked him  some questions about biosafety.
 
Fig. 6-1-22. Our team member approaches to the problems
 
Q1. When we use bacteria that produces harmless  substances, does a biosafety or biosecurity problem arise? (Naoto)
A1. In that circumstance, it is necessary to  find out whether the problem comes from the bacteria or the substances. In  other words, the measurement against the problem differs depending on whether  the problem is biohazard or chemical hazard.
Q2. No matter how hard we try to keep  biosafety, there remains a probability that researchers themselves might abuse  the technology. How can we prevent that? (Riku)
A2. The most important thing is to not provide  funding or facility to those people. For example, the researcher who has  dubious funding sources or who ordered dangerous series of reagents might be surveyed.  Also, the achievements and status as a researcher will be checked if they ordered  synthesis of genes. In the U.S, when they have debts or criminal records, their  applications will be rejected.
By integrating both feedbacks from students  and the expert, we were able to conceive the idea. We were able to receive many feedbacks from our  two approaches.
First of all, by looking at the answers in the  questionnaire, we were able to have confidence that our project can help people  understand economic system better than before. Although we used several  scientific details related to synthetic biology, the project was understandable  for students without any knowledge of this field. Therefore, we can say that our  project, which is making an educational tool for iGEMers is effective and  practical for all students majoring science.

Seeing is believing...
Live had been on earth for 3.6 billion years. Over time living-beings evolved, merged, devoured and mutated. Cells are having ever massive networks and interactions that is far beyond foreseeable. And now we are only slowly discovering the secret of life. Through this sea of proteins, fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins are like light houses that allows scientist to hold on with faith. As the saying goes, ""Seeing is believing"". Therefore, we decided to dedicate our iGEM project to this wonderful technology.
We focus on producing a dual light sensitive circuit in order to evolve a red fluorescent protein, mKeima. At the same time we wish to establish a noble concept of ""Evolution circuit"" and associated high-throughput evolution protocols.
mKeima?
                             Take a journey here into where mKeima come from and how it works!
Dual light sensor
The architecture of dual light sensor revolves around the trick of overlapping fluorescent spectra. In this project, we improvised the overlapping of mKeima emission and Cph8 excitation wavelength. They are fused together, becoming Cph8-mKeima chimera to bring them to close proximity. Cph8 is a fusion protein which was firstly used for bacterial photography.It is able to relay signal to E.coli via phosphorylation of OmpR.
The Evolution Circuit
In order to turn the dual light sensitive chimera to full usability, optimization of the protein structure is necessary. To achieve that, there are generally two ways: Rational Design or Directed Evolution. Rational approach is both time consuming and challenging unless the target protein had been well studied. Alternatively, directed evolution is tedious but they always work and it is where most of the time significant ""surprises"" are discovered. In our case where we are optimizing a chimera, rational approach is beyond interpretation. Hence, we setup a journey to engineer an evolution circuit.
An elegant solution of it is to introduce a eGFP reporter with Omp promoter to respond to level of phosphorylated OmpR. Omp promoter capture the signal and output it as eGFP expression which correspond to the strength of response to blue or red light. In short, the better is the mutant, the greener is the cell. This eGFP brightness can then be detected by cell"

However, miRNAs present in saliva are less well documented. Saliva may also be less accurate as its composition can change depending on what was recently eaten so we didn’t look much more into this, but it could be a good area for further research.
Another cost involved in the test is the upfront equipment costs - see how we made a combined densitometer and fluorometer for less than £4 on our hardware page !
Screening cost-effectiveness model
To demonstrate that our test would be cost effective as part of a screening programme we built this cost effectiveness model. To do this it combines cancer prevelance data, the sensitivity and specificity values of our test, our cost analysis data and treament cost data.
We used Tammemägi et al.’s model to calculate the probability of someone getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. It is more sensitive than the simplistic criteria used by the National Lung Screening Trial, and thus a better way of selecting individuals for screening. Tammemägi et al. showed their model would be more cost effective method as more cancers were detected per number screened as it missed fewer cases of cancer. [16]
Although Tammemägi’s model was for lung cancer as a whole, we assume the risk factors put you at equal risk of non-small cell and small-cell lung cancer. As the miRNAs on which our test  is based do not indicate small cell lung cancer, we have built the model around NSCLC. All other figures are NSCLC specific.
A quality adjusted life year (QALY) represents one year in perfect health. The ‘quality adjusted’ part accounts for the quality of life for that year, for example 2 years with a 0.6 quality of life score would be 1.2 QALYs. QALYs can be used to measure the benefit a treatment provides (if any). Treatments costing less than £20,000 per QALY are deemed cost effective by NICE. Treaments between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY may be decided to be cost effective by NICE if there is a high degree of certainty in the cost per QALY or when there are substantial benefits not captured in the cost per QALY figure.

Fail of the week = Natasha and her butter fingers
Diary: Week 3
This week the iGEM spent their time sequencing and verifying that that our cloning of individual pdu proteins as well as the quikchange was successful. As well as this the team began to work on the targeting sequence of the protein PduD. It is known that PduD contains a 40 amino acid signal sequence which is necessary to incorporate proteins into the microcomparment. As well as using a 40 amino acid sequence we are also going to attempt to use a 20 amino acid sequence.   Towards the end of the week we began to ligate our different Pdu proteins together into a single pUNI-Prom plasmid plasmid beginning with PduAB-TU.
Fail of the Week = Rachelle’s ‘incompetent’ cells and Lucy’s transformation
Diary: Week 4
After PduAB-TU failed to ligate the first time or cloning strategy was adjusted so that we ligated AB and N together firstly. We now aim to stick the the Pdu proteins in the order ABNTU and finally JK. While all this was going on we performed more minipreps and stocked bacterial cultures to keep an updated collection of our created constructs. This was a particular highlight for many of the team as it was there first time using liquid nitrogen.
After successfully cloning PduD into pUNI-PROM Brian and Jane began working on GFP and mCherry two of the proteins which will be targeted to the microcompartment by ligating them to pUNI-PROM along with the PduD signal sequence. As these proteins fluoresce this will allow visualisation of protein targeting to the microcomaprtment.  The remaining members of the team made use of some of the iGEM biobricks as well as amplifying specific genes from E.coli genomic DNA. More details of this to follow.
Fail of the Week = Kasia’s gel extraction and Rachelle’s pyrotechnics.
Diary: Week 5
After further revision of our cloning strategy we decided to revise the cloning order once more and clone in the order ABTUNJK. The difficulty seems to be arising from the PduN. As it is such a small fragment it is proving difficult to see it on a gel. The team finalised what proteins they"

All PtNTT2 variants can be localized within the membrane, since the fluorescence signals of the GFP tag are concentrated there. Judging from the pictures, the variant with the pelB signal peptide is weakly integrated into the inner membrane, which would explain the good growth characteristics and the weak functionality of this variant. The TAT-signal peptide variant, which showed bad growth characteristics and no function, seems to be located within the cell envelope nonetheless. Given that peptides containing the TAT signal peptide are usually folded within the cytoplasm and then secreted via the twin-arginine translocation pathway, this could be a possible explanation for the non-existent function of the TAT variant. All other variants that also showed a detectable function are successfully integrated into the membrane. The variants without a signal peptide are also located within the membrane, which is not surprising, given that the integration of membrane proteins does not necessarily require a signal peptide (Facey and Kuhn, 2004) . PtNTT2(66-575) seems to be better integrated into the membrane than any other variant. The native PtNTT2, and PtNTT2(31-575) are integrated in a similar scale, but a little bit weaker compared to PtNTT2(66-575). These results are consistent with the results of the verification of the function of PtNTT2, since all variants that showed a relative beneficial effect and also the highest AMP concentrations in the supernatant do integrate the transporter into the membrane. For the TAT signal peptide variant, it is most likely that the transporter is integrated incorrectly, leading to a correct subcellular localization while lacking the correct function.

Sweat collection in mind, we first contacted the iGEM headquarters, who were unsure of whether we need to apply for a permission. Then we proceeded to writing an inquiry to the HUS Ethical Committee (the ethical committee of Helsinki and Uusimaa area public healthcare). They replied - quoting the Finnish research law - that we need to apply for permission if humans, human embryos or human tissue/blood samples are analysed. This was not the case for us, so therefore we proceeded with our plans of sweat collection. The people whose sweat was collected signed a consent form, which can be found from below.
Consent Form for Sweat Collection .
When designing our project, we wanted the production process and the end product itself to be safe, cheap, environmentally sustainable and most of all to provide something to the user. In the summer we were faced with a difficult decision: would we continue application concept development with wound care or acne treatment? Many of us felt that treatment of acne was a superficial problem, especially when compared to the fact that people die from hospital acquired infections. We were therefore compelled to stick with wound care. However, acne is a problem which affects a large portion of the population and can trigger self-hatred or dislike in individuals who already have a low self-esteem - especially young people. We thought that our peptide may suit better to an application such as this, as it may not be able to compete with strong agents used in wound care. It could be argued that it is better to provide a good solution to a minor problem than to force an average solution to a major problem.
After we saw how many people answered our acne survey and while interviewing professionals, including a dermatologist and a psychotherapist, we realized that acne in fact is a problem that affects so many people that it should not be belittled. There are many factors contributing to the problem, such as media and advertisements, and it is a difficult task to approach the issue from an angle that wouldn’t make the situation worse. Skin care products are being marketed with retouched images and products are often marketed in a way that aims to make consumers believe that it is socially unacceptable to have pimples. Commercially available cosmetics might even promise miracles which do not have to be scientifically proven since some of the ingredients and testing methods can be hidden behind patent laws.
We wanted to create a responsible product concept. Therefore, we experimented on using a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) hydrogel, which we were very happy with. Cell"

Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

    Secondly, we get to the conclusion that warrior II is actually quite ideal as it does not kill itself and that its killing effect towards Beggar I is obvious. Warrior I needs some improvement because it kills itself and the killing effect is rather weak.
    These results are consistent with our orthogonality test , as Warrior II is truly ideal but warrior I is not. Therefore, it is reasonable that we use RFP to indicate killing effect of warriors in orthogonality test.
    In order to improve Warrior I, we have to modify our gene circuit so that warrior I does not kill itself and at the same time, effectively kills Beggar II. (see improved gene circuit )

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#testing_-_-_TEXT.html," a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15].
Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of horse intestines. Moreover, we have developed new applications on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should be but also when the treatments should happen. Thus they complement each other to minimize the amount of anthelmintics used; thereby helping to prevent resistance development.
The Worm Buster
The first thing the team did was to define the desired characteristics of the worm buster and outline the project strategy.
Requirement
- Our Bacteria needs to live in the intestinal tracts of horses.
- They also need the ability to report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces.
The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment depending on the level of small strongyle infection.
Project Outline
1
1. Worm Culturing
The first step was to obtain live nematodes by the recovery of the eggs from the feces. After this process the large strongyles were divided from the small strongyles using a 3D printed microfluidic chip (figure 2) or a microscope and stored for successive use.
Figure 2: The worm separator.

2. Transcriptomics + Phage Display
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we needed an approach that would allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we developed new applications of two existing approaches.
For the first one, we have been developing a custom transcriptomic analysis protocol. This was necessary because transcriptomics is a new application for Oxford Nanopore technology. The transcriptomics procedure relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA. This will ideally reveal which genes are upregulated when the worm is next to the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!
As our result show, transcriptomics with the nanopore MinION works if a better technique to reduce the amount of RNA in the sample is discovered thus we have discovered a new application to Oxford Nanopore Technology.

We reached out to Team Oxford to establish a collaboration that would help them achieve higher expression levels of their copper chelator Csp1sfGFP, and allow us to apply our promoters to the control of a non-trivial gene. Team Oxford also had easy access to a flow cytometer, which they would use to measure the cell to cell variance of our promoter devices. Unfortunately, we both faced unforeseen delays in the experimental assembly of our devices. Although we were in constant communication throughout the project, we were not able to pursue this plan completely.

With which, we aim to demonstrate how targeting the     Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway will diminish the amount of     inflammation promoting cytokines produced by the immune representative     cells of the brain.
Design:
Each transfection mixture was pipetted evenly into 6 wells of a 24     well-plate. DNA quantities that were used are as following: 2.5, 5, 9 μg of     DNA. As a positive control, BV-2 cells were transfected with 5 μg pAc-GFP     and as a negative control cells were electroporated with no plasmid and     also seeded without electroporation. Here is a schematic diagram of the     wells mentioned:

Expectations:
We expected to observe a GFP signal in all the wells that were successfully transfected with the px601-f4/80-g2 plasmid, while we did not expect to observe any GFP signal from the wells in the “No DNA” or “No transfection” groups.
Results:
In the following 3 days, the culture was monitored using a fluorescent microscope.
Unfortunately, no GFP positive cells were observed under the microscope lens. As the positive control showed a successful transfection in the technical sense, we concluded that there is a problem in transfecting this particular cell-line with such a large construct. This is plausible because the transfection efficiency was low even with a small construct such as pAc-GFP  with only ~5% transfection efficiency (Figure 2"

The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research manages the Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+ . Together with research organizations and universities the vision is to develop the next generation of biotechnological processes as well as initiate their realization. Apart from funding of research projects, expert talks on the topics medicine, energy, environment and industry are arranged. Every year a highlight congress is organized, where representatives from academia, industry and politics meet to discuss the future of biotechnology. This year, parts of the iGEM Team Bielefeld were invited to actively participate and present posters about the 2010 and 2011 projects.
The event began with the address of welcome by State Secretary Dr. Helge Braun , followed by keynote speeches of industry representatives. Afterwards it was time for a coffee break and the poster session. Last year’s Freiburg and Weimar-Heidelberg Arts team as well as this year’s Potsdam team were also there so we could team up after the poster session. The iGEM team Bielefeld was able to present a poster of our 2010 MARSS (Modulated Acetosyringone Receptor Sensor System) project and a poster of our 2011 Cellfree S-layer Based Bisphenol A Biosensor .

Experimenters is careful not to release any parts to the public. And even the worst situation happens as it is released, it will hardly bring risks.
Environment safety
We have designed the eukaryotic circuit, which cannot be expressed by procaryotic microorganisms. And the cell we used is very fragile and it will soon die leaving the culture medium. So it will not bring contamination to the environment.

SUSTC-Shenzhen-B,2012,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-B#high.school.synbio.intro_-_-_TEXT.html,"ization, assembling in synthetic biology is as easy as playing with LEGO toys, the interface is well-designed so that the construction is so simple. Besides, abstraction, reliability, uniformity and reuse, the generic terms in engineering, are all introduced to synthetic biology. Therefore, synthetic biology turns to a field of multidiscipline. Experts with different backgrounds gather to make their efforts. Programmers write the code to calculate, mathematics find model to predict, Engineers consider about the hierarchy, biologists debug the system. Ironically, synthetic biology is more engineering than genetic engineering.
Talking about hierarchy, let me make an analogy between synthetic biology and computer hardware. Proteins and genes are compared to resistance, capacity which are the bottom of the system. Upwards, biochemical reaction is the same as gates in electronics because both of them can function basically. If biochemical reactions form a network and gates form a network, we call them pathways and modules in synthetic biology and electrical engineering respectively. Moreover, there are computers and cells.
The dream is so nice but the reality is so hard. There is still plenty of work to do to make synthetic biology to be a qualified engineering. Often, we don't even fully understand the devices we are using and the whole system is not under our fully control. Despite this, after all, a new world is in front of us, as a Polish geneticist wrote,' I am not concerned that we will run out of exciting and novel ideas, ... in the synthetic biology, in general.

We met with our mentors and got an overview of the basics of synthetic biology, namely characterization, which will be the focus of our works during the summer. We also went through the “MoClo” technique, which we intend to introduce to iGEM.
We did a survey of previous iGEM teams that got the Best Experimental Measurements award, then presented the findings to our mentors.

Week 1
We performed PCR to amplify pMJSAF(LacZ) using the       following MoClo forward and reverse primers: DVL0_AF with DVL0_BR (MF1),       DVL0_BF with DVL0_CR (MF2),  DVL0_CF with DVL0_DR (SJ1) and DVL0_DF       with DVL0_ER (SJ2). We performed Gel Electrophoresis to confirm that       pMJSAF was amplified in PCR:  The gel ran for too long thus       the bands ran off of the gel. which can be seen towards the bottom of the       picture.

Risk assessment for our Adeno-associated virus based system
In Germany the ""Central Commission for Biological Security"" (ZKBS) released three legally binding Risk Assessment satements for the Adeno-associated Virus 26, 27, 28. Risk assessment in other countries may deviate from these decisions, so please inform yourself about the legal regulations on AAV in your country before using the Virus Construction Kit.
In Germany the Biological Safety Level(BSL) classifications for AAVs are:
Adeno-associated Virus 2, 3 and 5 have to be handled under BSL 1.
Adeno-associated Viurs 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 have to be handled under BSL 2.
This classification was developed based on the fact that only serotypes 2, 3 and 5 are isolated from humans and that their harmlessness has been confirmed in clinical studies. This general classification has to be rechecked when the virus contains gene sequences with a transforming protential.
Viral vectors systems packaging a vector plasmid that only contains the viral Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) and providing the genes for Rep and Cap in trans (as it is the case for our system) are classified as BSL 1 if the following conditions are fullfilled:
The viral particles do not contain AAV derived sequences other than the ITRs
The viral particles do not contain Nucleotidesequences with a risk potential
We also investigated the legal regulations for AAV-2 Viral Vector systems in the United States. The guidelines of the National Institutes of"

September 7th 2012: Transformation of BBa_K576013 construct into DH5-alpha.
September 8th 2012: The transformed miniprep and transformed ligated pSB1C3 had colonies. The rest of the plates were clean. Therefore the transformation and ligation was successful however the construct still didn't work out. We will repeat the experiment after miniprepping more BBa_K576006 in pSB1C3. Inoculate BBa_K576005 in pSB1C3.
September 9th 2012: Miniprep BBa_K576006 in pSB1C3.

September 12th 2012: Inoculate DH5-alpha carrying BBa_K576005 in pSB1C3, DH5-alpha carrying BBa_K576005 in pSB1C3 and DH5-alpha carrying BBa_J61046 in pUC57 in Terrific broth.
September 13th 2012: Miniprep BBa_K576005 in pSB1C3, BBa_K576006 in pSB1C3 and BBa_J61046 in pUC57.
September 15th 2012: Restriction digestion of parts BBa_K576005, BBa_K576006 and BBa_J61046 to get gel extracted fragments for both the positive and negative control constructs. Diagnostic gel showed questionable bands so we need to repeat the digestion.
September 16th 2012: Repeat the digestion from September 15th. This time the bands are as expected so the fragments were gel extracted. The nanodrop values of gel extracted BBa_K576005 in pSB1C3 for the negative control construct indicated we did not have DNA so need to redo that sample. Other samples were stored.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,". The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," performed the cycle-pure spin protocol to remove contamination from our PCR product, and then proceeded to perform a restriction digest on the product with HindIII and AscI so that we could ligate it into the PET vector. After this ligation was complete, it was transformed with E.coli on a Kan plate, and left overnight to incubate. Unfortunately we do not see colonies yet, but the incubation is not complete yet, and might still be successful. Thirdly, we obtained the PetroBrick stock from the Washington team on Tuesday, and immediately proceeded to transform it. We obtained a great deal of colonies, and then performed colony PCR on 12 of these colonies to ensure that our ~2400bp PetroBrick was present in these cells. Last but not least, we have still been working on a successful purification of NPT from a transformed plate. A colony PCR indicated that NPT was potentially in a few of these colonies, so we made overnight cultures of these four colonies, and performed a miniprep the next morning, and then a restriction digest to verify that the gene was present.
Denitrogenation
The CarAa was re-streaked onto ampicillin plates and grew, probably showing that it was ligated into PSB1AC3, not PSB1C3, which explained the irregularity of our confirmation digest last week. It was sent for sequencing, but in case it was incorrect we also started a new CarAa pipeline by PCRing it from the Pseudomonas genome again and redigesting and ligating. It was transformed into PSB1C3 over the weekend. CarAc did not see a lot of progress this week as we spent much of the time attempting to construct a RBS (B0034) in front of it, but were unsuccessful. CarAd was also subjected to this construction with B0034 and we were able to send it for sequencing by the end of the week. Multiple new constructs were also started for CarAd in case the sequencing is negative. The Ant operon was successfully transformed and confirmed by colony PCR this week, after which it was grown up and sent for sequencing. We also began to attempt mutagenesis on one of the EcoRI sites in the operon, but had no amplification of the plasmid. We also re-digested some PCR purified product to start another ligation in case sequencing failed. After many attempts we were also able to finally successfully transform an AmdA/PSB1C3 plasmid into top 10 cells this week. After a miniprep they"

cyt1
FAFU-China
jacarandasmile@163.com
Cyt1 is cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis BRC-LLP29. It shows specific toxicity to Culex and Aedes by bioassay. Cyt proteins have a single α-β domain which do not bind to receptors but can directly insert into the cell membrane and then form a pore causing cell death. Although Cry and Cyt proteins are two big families of δ-endotoxins, they are far related.Cyt1 and Cyt2 are two types of Cyt proteins found in Bti.. Generally, Cry proteins are believed to exert toxicity by interacting with the proteins on the brush border membrane and then insert into the membrane which takes multiple steps. At the beginning in mosquitoes' gut, the crystalline inclusions are cleaved at the disulfide bond to release the Cry pre-toxin. Then the soluble proteins are activated by being cleaved again by intestinal protease. When toxins reach to the brush border membrane microvilli, they bind to the proteins, or known as receptors on the membrane. The binding process takes two step. Firstly, the monomeric Cry toxin binds to cadherin, resulting in the formation of pre-pore oligomer，Then the oligomer binds to a GPI-anchored APN or ALP. Secondly, the previous binding induces the oligomer insertion into the lipid rafts membrane. A formation of ion permeable pore is followed by the insertion which allows small molecules to pass through the membrane. The membrane potential inevitably changes greatly, causing the swelling of cell and finally breaking down. When the cell lysis reaches to a certain degree, the midgut necrosis and epithelial denaturation follow. Then, the alkaline hypertonic inclusions in midgut enters into hemocoel and the pH of haemolymph rises causing paralysis of larvae and finally death. To increase the express level in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii, we synthesis Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii codon optimized Cyt1. Meanwhile, we added 2A peptide sequence at the end of 5’ According to the published paper and the result of Swiss-model, there is no effect to the toxicity of Cry or Cyt. Users can use infusion technology to link the express vector to express toxins.

Another important part of iGEM is helping other teams through collaboration.  As in previous years, we had the opportunity to meet up with the other Alberta teams (Lethbridge and Alberta) at several points during the Summer.  We had the opportunity to ask questions, do practice presentations for each other, as well as give each other ideas for each specific project.  This was an awesome resource, especially given that all three teams are looking at oil sands and/or energy-related projects.  September 24-25th, all Alberta iGEM teams met for the 3rd annual aGEM competition, where we all did a mock iGEM presentation and got questions and feedback from the other teams as well as from a group of judges.  This event was organized by AITF, one of our major sponsors.
In discussions with the Lethbridge iGEM team, we discovered that we're both interested in the viability of E. coli in tailings pond samples.  The Lethbridge team wants to eventually house their system in E. coli; although we do not, we are still interested in it in case we encounter difficulties with pseudomonas.  We have done previous viability assays, however only in commercial NA mixtures.  Tailings ponds have a large amount of different toxic compounds in them other than NA's.  In addiion, different tailings pond samples can have a very different composition, depending on which pond they were taken from, and even which section or depth of the pond they were taken from.  Because of this,"

Most of SynBio information is published in English language and it can be a bottleneck for those people who is not able to speak this language. Thus, we decided to create a YouTube channel “iGEM Conecta” in order to spread SynBio topics in Spanish-speaking countries. .
We aim to become a reference channel about SynBio in Spanish language and open the gate for spreading SynBio knowledge around the world. You can watch our videos here
Even if we are not true experts, our team has tried to show how synthetic biology works and all the impressive things which can be done with this innovative field. It is an honor for us to be part of the most important community in the world: Science.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," peptides are placed downstream of the gold sensing promoter, such that mineralization is conditional to concentrations of gold in the environment. The final module is hybrid bistable switch.
The switch is an extended version of the quorum sensing from Vibrio fischeri. LuxI forms an indirect positive feedback loop through interactions with LuxR which is expressed by the constitutive promoter.  Upon gold induction, AiiA is expressed and degrade the quorum sensing signal AHL. In the other word, AiiA could disrupt the feedback loop. When gold is absent and population density is high, taR12 which is downstream of the Plux/lac is upregulated. In our project, taR12 is to transactivate the translation of mtrA upon binding to the crR12. Electricity is generated when all three mtr proteins are expressed and translocated to the right locations in cells.

Gold sensing
Some bacteria evolved to sense various toxic metals in the environment and produce certain responses. It involves transcription factors, different promoters and cascade activation reactions. One of the most characterised transcription factors belongs to MerR class. They are responsible for responding to stresses like antibiotics or heavy metals and the mechanism involves conserved N and C-terminal domains which contain DNA and metal binding motives (1, 2). E. coli has a MerR like transcriptional activator CueR, which allows the bacteria to sense copper ions and activate the transcription of specific genes. The same transcription factor can also allow the bacteria to sense the presence of gold ions in the environment (3).
There are few problems involving CueR transcription activ"

Figure 3: SEM images of (A) E. coli BL21 without the BolA gene, (B) E. coli transformed with the BolA gene.
In figure 3, we see that the cell shape of the cells transformed with BolA is indeed more spherical than the wildtype phenotype of E. coli. Also, we see that the size of the cells increased. Using ImageJ we analyzed the average size of 10 cells (table 1).
Table 2: Average sizes of a population of untransformed E.coli and E. coli transformed with BolA. We measured 10 cells for each case, the size was determined using ImageJ.
Phenotype
Average length (µm)
Average diameter (µm)
Wildtype
1.2 +/- 0.12
0.5 +/-0.04
BolA
1.0 +/- 0.15
0.87 +/- 0.13
In the table we see the average diameter of the cells increased. The average size of microlenses is in the order of tens or hundreds of micrometers, because with current techniques it's difficult and costly to produce smaller microlenses (Krupenkin, Yang, & Mach, 2003) . The average sizes of photodetectors are in the nano- to micrometer range (Yang, Shtein, & Forrest, 2005) . Our spherical microlenses approach this size, and are therefore useful since you could place one microlens over one photovoltaic cell, increasing the efficiency of the photovoltaic cell.
So, by inducing the expression of BolA, we are indeed able to control the shape of E. coli and turn the cell into a sphere. Also, transforming a cell with both OmpA-Silicatein and BolA yields round cells, so the formation of the glass layer does not distort the cell shape. We have also shown that even though cell size increases upon expression of BolA, the size of our biolenses is smaller than the size of conventional microlenses. People have not been able to produce such small lenses in a cost-effective way, so our microlenses could be a possible solution to this.
Being able to control cell shape is of major importance if we want to create biological lenses, since the lenses are desired in various sizes and shapes. Especially spherical lenses are useful since they are symmetrical and therefore do not require a specific orientation; they will focus the light in the same way"

Modeling
Us visiting him at Imperial
Dr Thomas Ouldridge
Early on in our project we met Dr Thomas Ouldridge, a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. He strengthened our modeling foundations and told us what assumptions were sensible for our system. He explained energy landscapes of nucleic strand displacements, which helped us increase the specificity of our first series of switches despite us not modeling the toehold switch binding base-by-base.
We went back to him a couple of months later with our mass action kinetics model. He located where we could remove unneeded complexity from our model. After changing the model accordingly, we were able to to narrow our model to have just 4 main parameters. This allowed us to vary them to test the effects of changing the parts of our toehold switch, for example the RBS and promoter strength to optimize the dynamic range. This made our model orders of magnitude more useful to both our design and wetlab teams. See our modeling page to learn more about why fewer parameters is better and how our model influenced our design and implementation of our project.
Applications
Dr Daniel Pregibon
We spoke to Dr Daniel Pregibon, who works for Abcam, and developed a new method of quantifying miRNAs. He advised that our method could prove especially  effective in low resource settings and in situations where results are needed urgently. He also advised us on the clinical use of miRNAs as biomarkers.

I Introduction
Even though we have orthometric gene circuit, the killing ability of two warriors may have great difference. [Fig.1]
RFP is used to indicate the LacI level inside warrior, so it can indicate the killing ability of warrior. From this figure, we can see that the LacI level inside warrior I increase at a very fast speed. In real situation, this means that warrior I will be killed at the beginning.
Therefore, in our project, it may be necessary to regulate killing ability to an appropriate level. Intuitively, many potential factors can influence the killing ability, like the catalysis rate of AHL synthase, cross-membrane rate between AHL molecules. Then what factors can we change to regulate the killing ability of warriors? Our model suggest that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins.
II Evaluation of warrior's killing ability
First, to simplify the evaluation, we will have some hypothesis at first:
1. The increasing rate of two warriors are the same.
2. The environmental capacity (it is mentioned in the famous Logistic model) of two warriors are the same if the environmental conditions and the initial amount of resources are the same. (By these hypothesis, we can ignore influence of growth rate on killing ability, which will make things more complicated.)
3. Also, we could only consider the condition that there is glucose inside the medium and there is only warrior lived in the medium.
4. RFP intensity is used to indicate the amount of LacI, so it can indicate the killing ability of"

Further Characterization and Improvement of Parts Already in the Registry
Submitted optimized parts of TALE-A ( Bba_ K1189022 ) and TALE-B ( Bba_ K1189023 ) (Slovenia 2012) for use in E. coli by removing the eukaryotic Kozak sequence and nuclear localization signal, codon optimizing it for expression in E. coli and finally adding a KasI restriction site in the composite part such that future teams can essentially plasmid switch their own custom TALEs into our system. We also fixed a mutation in the binding region of TALE-B.
Showed that the improved TALES were able to be expressed in E. coli.
Submitted multiple composite parts of TALE-A and TALE-B with his-6 tags for easy purification, as well as with linkers and our two reporters: Beta-lactamase and ferritin.
Expressed and successfully purified various TALE constructs: TALE-A ( BBa_K1189000 ); TALE-B ( BBa_K1189001 ); TALE-A with a K coil ( BBa_K1189029 );  TALE-A linked to beta-lactamase  ( BBa_K1189031 ); TALE-A fused to ferritin ( BBa_K1189021 ).
Submitted the K coil ( BBa_K1189010 ) and E coil ( BBa_K1189011 ), previously in the registry, however lacking DNA. These coiled coils are very useful for in vitro assembly of different proteins and their ability to scaffold proteins together when fusion does not work, making an attractive addition to the registry. We also added a his-6 tag to these coils K coil with His-6 tag ( Bba_K1189012 ) and E coil with a His-6 tag ( Bba_K1189013 ). We submitted these coils in the Freiburg backbone for easy fusion of proteins.
Characterized the binding of these coils, demonstrating that the coils allow in vitro assembly by doing a dot blot assay with our mobile TALE detector and Prussian blue reporter, both of which we have built, expressed, and purified with the coiled coils. These results can be found ( here ).
Demonstrated that TALE-A with a K coil ( BBa_K1189029 ) binds specifically to its target DNA. These results can be found ( here ).

Diffusion
Our model has two types of diffusion. Diffusion over the cell membrane from the inside of the cell to the outside and diffusion in the external medium. The diffusion over the cell membrane is more complicated because proteins play a role in it and the membrane is not equally permeable for every molecule. For diffusion we need to change our unit because diffusion is usually  used with concentration as unit. This is why we added a correction term for the volume of the cell and the external volume.
We assume that the volume of the cell has a shape of a cilinder. For this simplified volume Goryachev et al. found a value of $5.65 {\cdot} 10^{-16}l$ (radius=0.3µm, length=2µm) [10] . We can take this volume as a constant, since cell growth is very small compared to the diffusion. The outside compartment will be modeled as half a sphere with the cell as center and a radius equal to $\sqrt{2{\cdot}D{\cdot}t} + r_0$. We only take half a sphere because there is no upward diffusion. For the initial value of the outside compartment we take a volume (and thus $r_0$ slightly bigger than the cell volume (radius). We choose a value of $5.7 {\cdot} 10^{-16}$l which accords to a radius of $5.128{\cdot}10^{-6} dm$. Because there is also already a volume taken by the cell, the total initial outside compartment has an initial value of $5{\cdot}10^{-18} l$. The volume will increase per time step with $\frac{2{\cdot}\pi{\cdot}D}{\sqrt{2{\cdot}D{\cdot}t}}{\cdot}{(\sqrt{2{\cdot}D{\cdot}t} + r_0)^2}$
With this approximation we get more logical results. Now we can calculate the diffusivity of AHL and leucine. Goryachev et al. used this formule $$D_{AHL,in}=\frac{P{\cdot}{S_{cell}}}{V_{cell}}$$ with P equal to $(1-5){\cdot}10^{-6} cm^2/s$ and $S_{cell}=4.34{\cdot}10^{-8} cm^2$ [10] ."

We made a decision: Self destructive plasmid (a derivate of the impulse signal). Further refinement of the final idea can be seen here Team:TUDelft/Brainstorm/Plasmid .
Top 6 Ideas
Salt water purification (Sriram) (Orr)
Buoyant Bacteria (Saeed) (Orr)
Impulse Signal (Daniel) (Sriram)
Melatonin Compensation (Saeed) (Tim)
Microrganism Muscle (Daniel) (Tim)
Enzyme Modulation (Daniel) (Sriram)
The names behind the ideas indicates who is going to search background information on the subject and inspect the feasibility and application for the ideas.
Brainstorm Ideas
Impulse Signal
one suggestion (by Federico C.) from the idea exchange was to create a self-destructing plasmid, which would express once and than destroy itself with a restriction endonuclease in its code.
Saltwater Purification
+ heavy metal extraction
diatoms
Dead Sea organisms
After some research, we found that this project might not be as feasible as we imagined. Searching for the keywords 'desalination' and 'bacteria' resulted in articles about the biofilm created by bacteria to deteriorate the proper function of reverse osmosis (RO) membrane
MicroOrganism muscle
make a group of cells contract
Enzyme Modulation
express different enzymes in different period of time and measure flux
metabolic control analysis
Melatonin Compensation
compensate the reduction in melatonin levels caused by the invention of electrical lights
has been linked to lots of medical problems, see review paper The dark side of light at night: physiological, epidemiological, and ecological consequences
would need to implement melatonin detection, synthesis, and a clock
work comes back to clock/delay timer

Risks of Our Project Now
The risks in this project are the organisms used as well as the chemicals being used are potentially toxic. Both of these risks have easily manageable solutions such as wearing PPE, sterilisation, labelling items clearly with a chemical hazard data sheet, managing spills with the correct procedures and disposing of waste correctly.
Risks of Our Project in the Future
If our project is successful it will allow people to use the hypervesiculating strain, for their own uses. These OMV’s could potentially be used for harmful purposes. We currently do not have any design features to reduce the risk of someone using our project for harmful purposes. In the future if it were deemed necessary we could potentially try to limit the types of projects that could use our hypervesiculating strain."

However there are now also a number of highly sophisticated techniques available, including the use of real time PCR for the detection of cercarial DNA sequences in the water, as well as high throughput sequencing of water samples. Whilst both of these are accurate and reliable methods, they require a great expertise and cannot be used in the field, causing delays in the risk analysis.
Therefore we think we have designed a great alternative to all the methods described above that allows fast and reliable detection of cercaria, under a variety of conditions, such as flowing or cloudy water.
Prevention and Control - Approaches to Vector control
Picture of the following fresh water snails: Bulinus, Biomphalaria, Oncomelania
In order to break the parasite life cycle many attempts have been made to control the parasite vector: The fresh water snails, in particular Biomphalaria snails, which transmits S. mansoni, Oncomelania snails, which are the intermediate host of S. japonicum, and Bulinus snails, giving rise to S. haematobium. The methods attempting to reduce or even eradicate the vector in an area can be divided into three main categories:
Physical methods aim to disturb the snails’ habitat. As these snails are quite specialized to particular niches, changes in flora or displacement of the snails can result in their death. However this method is very work intensive, because each individual segment of lake or stream has to be treated individually. This type of approach has only been seriously tested in the USA to reduce avian Schistosoma in lakes, but has proven to be inefficient because the treated areas are quickly reclaimed by snails from adjacent sections of the lake or river.
Chemical methods attempt to use a wide variety of substances such as copper sulphate to kill the vectors. Whilst this can be more easily done on a large scale than the physical methods, they tend to have even more pronounced effects on the ecosystem, as they often kill many different species of molluscs as well as other creatures and diffuse to sections that have not been treated. Overall this method was used fairly successfully, although damage to the environment is considerable and the effects temporarily limited.
Biological methods are the last category of approaches. These, if done with great care, can be most environmentally friendly, although they equally have the potential to be the most devastating. The idea is to introduce a pathogen or predator, in"

SBOL Document
Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a data exchange standard for descriptions of genetic parts, devices, modules, and systems. SBOL is neutral with respect to programming languages and software encoding. By supporting SBOL for reading and writing synthetic biology designs, different software tools can directly communicate and store the same representation of these designs. This removes an impediment to sharing engineered systems and permits other researchers and commercial enterprises to start with an unambiguous representation of the design.
The plasmids we construct are stored in gb and SBOL format.

Kinetic Modeling
Enzyme kinetics is the study of the chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. The reaction rate is measured under different environmental conditions to determine the overall functionality of the protein. By studying an enzyme’s kinetics, one can determine the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and how a drug or agonist might inhibit the function of the enzyme. Our team looked at the kinetic modeling to help determine if the activity of our model protein of ACC deaminase, PDB 1TYZ, was efficient.

Figure 5: K dissociation constants for each selected step in the ACC pathway.
Following the Michaelis-Menten hypothesis and plotting the experimental values for dissociation constants shown below in Table 1, a graphical representation, Figure 6, of the ACC deaminase reaction was created.
Table 1: Summary of pH-dependence of the steady state kinetic parameters for wild-type ACCD and its mutants. MSR is the mean square residual of the non-linear fit. The equations used are listed in the original paper under the Materials and Methods section.
Figure 6: The graph above shows the relationship between substrate/enzyme concentration and time it takes for the reaction to reach completion. This information is important to determine efficiency and activity.
1TYZ Structural Modeling Using PYMOL
To probe the possibilities of mutating some of the residues surrounding the active site, specifically Tyr294, several observations of this protein structure were noted by manipulating the 3D model of ACC deaminase, 1TYZ. A gem-diamine intermediate is trapped in the enzyme complex with ACC, and Tyr294 is in close proximity to the pro-S methylene carbon of ACC in the gem-diamine complexes. This indicates a direct role of this residue in the ring-opening reaction and also suggesting that Tyr294 may also be responsible for the abstraction of the alpha-proton from D-amino acids, a precursor to the subsequent deamination reaction. These structural data provide evidence favoring a"

Now that we have done the fundamental estimation of our system,we need to put them into practical use.
There’re so many ways to use our fundamental modeling and is impossible to make them all done.So we put forward one situation for example.
The system receives blue light and begins to produce fluorescence at a time of t0=0min.Then stopped receiving blue light at t1=x min and start to receive red light.
Here comes the function(to simplify,we use single cell model)
Figure3.1 the curve of piecewise functions hve been mentioned above(with leakiness expression considered).At a time of t1=200min,the blue light was shut down and the red light is turned on. It simulates the fluorescence of practical situation.

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"
The Dies Academicus is a biannual event at the University of Hamburg. This year’s topic was “Responsibility for democracy – study reform in an unsettling time”. Within the new “General studies” we presented our new course “Synthetic Biology” which provides the framework for our participation at the iGEM contest.
We did not only present iGEM and our project „Resistant Germs and How to fight them“ in front of a public audience but we also had the chance to meet and talk to Prof. Dr. Rupp, the Vice President of the University of Hamburg. We could spark her interest and enthusiasm for our project and are very excited about her visit in our labs later.
Apart from being able to present our project to a wider audience we got a lot of valuable tips and information how to attract supporters and interested students.
„Lehramtsveranstaltung“ – Event for education majors
Taking part in the iGEM contest is an opportunity for a direct learning experience that differs greatly from classic lectures, seminars or even practical courses. In the beginning, everyone is brainstorming together to decide on a topic to work on and how to execute the idea which is later on brought to the lab.
This is precisely the goal teachers have in mind for their students: they do not only transmit their knowledge but also encourage them to share and explain their know-how with others. This is of importance to deepen one’s knowledge and to gain a new perspective through sharing with others, but most significantly to be able to make progress together.
In science, this skill is especially important as exchange is fundamental for research. Today we live in a time where no one can survive on its own anymore and the ability to work in a team and to share knowledge is essential. While it is possible to find knowledge in books and perform experiments one’s own, it is easier and often much more effective to ask experts in their field. Therefore, we talked to the represents of the education majors at our university about the possibility to discuss this topic together. In this group, we worked out a presentation about our project and the concept behind it that we held in front of interested education students. Our goal was to find out if there are ways to improve our project. There was a great general interest in our project and the concept and how we handle this teaching-learning-situation. Their response was very positive and the consensus that university and school should push these sorts of learning experience more.

SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," tissue culture technology. We made some beautiful postcards about SCAU or iGEM. We brought some books and brochures about some laws and funny things about GMO. For example, sweet potato has some DNA originating from Agrobacterium, which means they are natural transgenic in the world.
Our work turned out to be a great success. The most famous newspaper in our city--Guangzhou Daily interviewed our team leader and reported us with a brief introduction of our project and this activity. SCAU newspaper and SCAU Official WeChat also highlighted our activities.
2.3 Education
Our education included spreading scientific knowledge to the kids and farmers in the countrysides and giving courses for high school students.
2.4 Spread scientific knowledge to countrysides
Our country is a developing country and those people in countrysides can hardly get as much information and knowledge as those in cities. So we decided to do more efforts to spread our knowledge to farmers and students in countrysides. We sent our educational handbooks to farmers and rural schools in Qingyuan, Shaoguan, Maoming and Zhaoqing of Guangdong province.
The handbooks contain lots of information about modern methods of cultivating the local specialty crops, including protocol of cultivating watermelon and papaya fruit in modern way. It's possible that we can help some people in countryside who are eager to get more information on agriculture, and they might generally accept modern agriculture or even GMO crops.
Our teammates gave basic and funny biology courses in primary schools in countrysides. Our lessons may influence their lives and change their fate.
2.5 Giving courses for high school students
We also gave courses for high school students of Guangzhou NO.47 Middle School, Guangdong experimental High School and Guangdong Guangya High School. Our courses mainly focused on the advance research in biological areas in these years, especially synthetic biology. We've also introduced iGEM to them and showed them how to take part in iGEM as a high school student. After that, we also built up a good relationship with a high school group from Guangdong experimental High School and Guangdong Guangya High School.
According to the feedback, the students have a better understanding of biology after our lessons. It's quite a good experience to communicate with middle school students and teach them what we've obtained in taking iGEM competition and doing biological research.
Part Ⅳ: Entrepreneurship
The ultimate goal of projects in iGEM is to serve the public. As our project is just about the research of application-oriented biosynthesis, we are encouraged by our teacher,"

Collaborations
Cambridge JIC-team, England
The Cambridge JIC-team were generating a chloroplast transformation toolkit and were interested in expressing a CRISPR/Cas9-system in chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The purpose of the project was to achieve homoplasmy quicker, in a matter of days rather than months since no selective plating would be required.
The collaboration between LiU iGEM and Cambridge JIC-team has been an ongoing process in the form of e-mail contact, skype meetings and weekly reports about the week that was. The exchange has included discussions, questions about the model organism, Gibson assembly and other approaches, different protocols and other things that felt unclear.
USP/UNIFESP, Brazil
The Brazil team USP/UNIFESP also work with C. reinhardtii and wanted to try CRISPR/Cas9 with RNPs but encountered some difficulties when it turned out that another team worked on a similar project. The team needed a new approach which we helped them with. This was done by exchanging protocols and regular updates from both teams.
Collaborations via surveys
Surveys are an easy way to reach the public, LiU iGEM both answered and shared surveys from other teams in order to help them in their work.
Collaborations via surveys were with following teams: - Team Aachen , Germany
- Team Chalmers , Sweden
- Team XMU , China
- Team Groningen , Netherlands

Results and analysis
Assessment of “Prometheus”
In each run estimating the effectiveness of the whole system, the program simulates behaviors of 1000 bacteria over 1 hour (3600 sec). Fig. 11 encompasses 4 different orders of initial succinate concentration on root surface. Compared with the null control (0 M), the engineered E. coli can be successfully recruited around root. Under the concentration of 10-2 M, the number of bacteria within 1mm around root surface doubled that of null control.
Fig. 11 The react of E. coli to different concentration of succinate. The numbers of bacteria within 1mm of root surface (y-axis) represents the bacteria successfully
attracted and utilized overtime. We assumed the total number of bacteria being 1000. Under the model, the peak performance of “Promethei” are expected
between 10-2 and 10-3. Our simulation fits the experiments and the theoretical curve KDC / (KD + C)2 well.
The results amazingly fit the 96-well plate experiment and the theoretical curve (Fig. 12). The running of the program has the similar mechanism with the experiments done in a laboratory. That can prove our codes are correct from the other aspect.

Fig.12 The contract of the program result in computer (a), the experiment result (b) ( get to know more click here ) and the theoretical curve of KDC / (KD+C)2 (c).
Considering the overall amount of succinate secreted via root by a plant could reach 13 mg [9], we estimate the concentration on root surface be between 0.1-10 mM. We conservatively reckon that around 20-40% bacteria could eventually “transport” cargos to the root (cut a half for unconsidered conditions in soil). Thus about 60-80% would lead to indirect use in the process, raising the issue of potential Mo pollution.
Estimation of “Memory” Time
We further estimate the best time interval to set the “memory” time, the time most appropriate for E. coli to suicide. Such time is determined as"

NYMU-Taipei,2017,Team:NYMU-Taipei#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"MU-Taipei 10 Year Exhibition. We presented all the posters from the last decade so that the audience could have deeper understanding of iGEM, and how iGEM influenced previous participants' future development. We hoped that through this ten-year exhibition we could make synthetic biology advocated the general public.
Biosafety concerns
Most important of all, NYMU this year collaborated with TAS Taipei, and they helped us with suicide mechanism functional test. Their test results make us more certain that our suicide mechanism is reliable, which means that our project is responsible and without biosafety concern. Moreover, we also educated Taipei American School how to conduct site-directed mutagenesis as well as assay biofilm production, which is also a great progress to their project.
Wego
Establish a 2018 iGEM team
In September, NYMU iGEM took a step further in terms of educating kids and spreading awareness of iGEM.We went to Wego Bilingual High School encouraging them to establish an iGEM team for 2018. One of our members of NYMU iGEM came from Wego Bilingual High School and we decided to target the freshmen in high school in hopes of sparkling an interest in establishing a team next year. We presented the introduction of synthetic biology with the entire science department faculty.
Collaborate with CGU
To do so, we invited the iGEM team from Chang Gung University to present their project as well to increase the examples for potential project ideas for these freshmen. Since our project track was Energy and CGU iGEM team focused on the Environmental track, students were able to see different takes on project ideas.
Conduct a survey
We interacted with these high schoolers by not only presenting how our project and explaining the power of synthetic biology but also walking down the aisle, asking questions and talking with them on their view of synthetic biology. Before and after our presentation, we also conducted surveys to over 100 freshmen in Wego Bilingual high school to fill out. These students all took time during class to complete this survey assignment. Survey questions included their opinions on the importance of algae and synthetic biology.We then used their survey responses to target our presentation. After our presentation, we noticed evident in both the children’s faces and the surveys result that they were much more interested in synthetic biology. We sincerely hope through this reach out and education outing we could touch on these high school students' future and inspire many to join the world of synthetic biology.
Survey Results
In the survey before the presentation, the results indicate that out of the 200 Wego high school students,"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread"

Week Three
Sixpi 06:27, 15 June 2009 (UTC)
I've done some work this weekend on filling out a data model that will be compatible (more or less) with the current JCA database and parts of the JBEI. I've also been researching existing persistence frameworks for java, and whether any of them are suitable to for use on this project. I'll post more after my minipresentation during the meeting tomorrow.
Sixpi 18:23, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
At the database meeting this week, I presented a complete high level picture of how the new Clotho will bring in data from the database. We will have a set of files that define the objects the rest of Clotho want to use, and what fields these objects should have. These files will get parsed and some internal structure of a data model will get built. The user will specify some database to connect to, and then a mapping module will use metadata from the database and user input to map database table names and column names to Clotho object and field keywords. The user will also specify the connectivity of the objects at this point. The mapped data model structure will be used by a code generator to build a java class for each object, along with a hibernate mapping file. These classes will all extend the Datum base class so the rest of Clotho can use them. The classes will be compiled dynamically, and then (hopefully) everything will work.
We also came up with an API for both the core and the Datum objects.

This week I've been working on coding the java files that hibernate needs to work with the JCA database, since we want to be able to test the API. These classes will eventually be autogenerated and compiled by the piece that Evan is working on. I will be working on the mapping piece and the keyword parsing piece. I've decided to use XML for the keyword files, as there already exists XML parsing libraries, thus freeing myself from writing a parser for some syntax I come up with myself.

August 16th: ASU iGEM emailed SVCE_Chennai team in response to their posting for collaboration on the iGEM collaboration page. ASU inquired about Chennai’s promoter prediction tool and offered an option to collaborate and provide feedback and any critique of the program.
August 17th: SVCE_Chennai responded to the email and requested a skype session to discuss the collaboration further.
August 18th: ASU iGEM shared a schedule of availability since there is a 12.5 hour time difference between the two countries. ASU iGEM suggested some times for a skype call.
August 21st: SVCE_Chennai responded saying they were busy during the entire week but had availabilities to set up a Skype call on either Saturday or Sunday.
August 22nd: iGEM team member is unavailable and CC’s another team member who is available to attend a Skype chat with SVCE_Chennai on the weekend.
August 22nd: ASU iGEM team member who is available over the weekend emails SVCE_Chennai to confirm the availability for a Skype call.
August 25th: SVCE_Chennai responded to confirm a time for conversation on 9:30am Arizona time on Saturday Aug 26th.
August 25th: ASU iGEM team member responds via email to confirm the Skype appointment time for Saturday.
August 26th: Detailed Skype call between ASU iGEM and SVCE_Chennai (skype handle (igemsvce chennai) took place. The collaboration discussion included details about the promoter prediction tool that Chennai had written in Python. ASU iGEM talked about how the promoter tool could be a great asset as our team had some issues with leaky expression in our synthetic gene circuits and the promoter tool could help us predict if the issue was within our promoters. ASU iGEM also expressed that they could provide the Chennai team back with detailed information about how well the python code for the promoter prediction tool was working and if there was any other additional feedback and critiquing they had for them to improve the tool. Chennai stated that they would share the Python code for the prediction tool via email.
September 14th: Several emails later and no reply from the SVCE_Chennai team ASU iGEM reached out to our PI, Dr. Karmella Haynes, to try and get some help reaching Chennai as we were ready to complete our collaboration and were only waiting on the promoter tool code to be sent.

CHINA_CD_UESTC,2015,Team:CHINA CD UESTC#hp business_-_-_TEXT.html," If you expect potential products，raw materials and intermediate operation of each step are best to comply with biosafety. In terms of the competition, there might be short in technical conditions, however it’s a good way to think more about ideas,” Prof. Lei put forward some personal opinions in regard to our project.
“I do look forward to seeing your Magnetotatic E.coli are able to apply to the disease detection and treatment. At the same time, I am willing to offer support on instruments and reagents, and help you to connect with other related enterprises for more communication about iGEM and your project,” manager of Anno Medical Devices Co.Ltd, Mr.Xu said.
Engineer Xiang said that he hope to strengthen the communication and cooperation between the college students and the Chengdu Biology Maker. Not only the guidance of Project design, but also experimental operation, our open source laboratory can satisfy the requirement. It is a good way to develop extensive cooperation by attending iGEM competition as Biological enthusiasts.
2.Jin Douyun Space Company
Aug 13th 2015, we arrived at the Jin Douyun Space Company with Manager Zhiyong Xu, and communicated with Manager Jianjun Deng and Sichuan Strategic Alliance of Medical Devices Innovation director Dan Li.
After Kaiyue Zhang briefly introduced iGEM competition and our project, Manger Deng indicated that the prospect of iGEM as top competition of Synthetic Biology would be inestimable, and strongly supported college students to attend this competition to make a little contribution to the national biology. He expected the results of our project and encouraged us to promote the project’s development in the level of product to dig more application value about Magnetotactic Escherichia coli .
At the end of the communication, Director Li showed that he would bring the propaganda of iGEM to the Sichuan Strategic Alliance of Medical Devices Innovation and supported the development of Synthetic Biology in China.
Through the communications with biotechnology companies, we had completed the goal that to promote iGEM out of campus. But we will never stop and make people in mounting numbers to realize and recognize synthetic biology, then we can use this to improve our life.
Our Team and Maker Work Hand in Hand
Purpose:
After communicating with biotechnology companies, we contacted with Chengdu Biology Maker to have further cooperation with social organization. On one hand, we would like to spread the idea of iGEM and synthetic biology. On the other hand, we could ask for their help about the technical support.

The idea was to see how people view bio-manufacturing opposed to currently common factory methods. This way Harvard’s team could analyze the differences in the interaction between culture, political regulations, and people’s perceptions of bio-manufacturing since they would have answers from both Europe and the USA. We had a conversation via Skype to develop the collaboration further and spread the world to other European iGEM teams in order to get more responses.
The actual collaboration consisted of coming up with some questions and commenting on the questions by other teams on Harvard’s Global Perspectives Outreach (GPO). The other teams involved in the survey were Linkoping, AQA_Unesp and Hamburg.  We also distributed the survey through our social media channels and gave our thoughts on how to process it. For participating team Harvard gave us the results to use in our own human practices, but unfortunately despite being distributed in several countries only 30 people answered it and therefore one cannot draw any proper conclusions of the survey.
Skyping with team Harvard
iGEM Team Cologne Düsseldorf
We noticed Düsseldorf Cologne’s announcement on the iGEM collaborations page and decided to participate to this fun idea. Therefore we designed a synthetic biology postcard about our project according to the organisers instructions and send 200 postcards via Düsseldorf Cologne’s team all over Europe, so that we could in exchange get a mix of all the other postcards from all the other team. The postcards were then distributed in different events like Biotech Tour in Heureka, Turku presentation and Aalto University’s events.
Our postcard
Hamburg and Delft
We had lengthy and productive discussions about our projects and human practices with team Hamburg while at the European iGEM Meetup in Delft (the Netherlands). We also tried to have a bigger collaboration with team Hamburg and team TU Delft in which Team TU Delft would have provided us with folding-related tardigrade proteins which might have allowed us to send our peptide dermcidin to team Hamburg’s Biosafety Level 2 laboratory without loosing too much activity. This would have allowed us to access safety level two bacteria essential to our application like Propionibacterium acnes in order to test dermcidin’s antimicrobial properties further. Unfortunately this did not work out due to time limitations, but it would have been an interesting collaboration.

Update from Maria.  The transformations and PCR amplification of the HO1-pcyA fusion construct have nearly all failed.  This weekend the kanamycin resistant version of the construct (K089010 in pSB3K3) was transformed and cultures grew. We already have a PCR product of the fused cph8-envZ sensing part. We now need to put the newly transformed K089010 in front of the sensor in order to rebuild the original sensor, which is well and truly fucked.

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#Conferences_-_-_TEXT.html," contacted a local branch of a national environmental group (as the opinions of the members present may not be representative of the larger organisation, they wish to remain anonymous). This conversation was very interesting, and the group was very grateful for it as they said there is not enough two-way dialogue between scientists and environmentalists. We discussed a wide range of topics, from things directly linking to our project such as flaws of the RSPO and governance issues, to more general topics such as the relationship between scientists and the general public.
These meetings, in addition to conversations with other industry representatives from around the world, informed nearly all aspects of our project. In particular, the ideas discussed have been summarised in our essay, entitled ‘Public Attitudes To Science and the Knowledge Deficit Assumption: How To Avoid A Crisis Of Confidence’ )

:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together with other similar components created by users. Compartment contains cells and other microscopic organisms that can multiply. compound contains small molecules like IPTG and other compounds. PlasmidBackbone contains plasmid backbones come from PartsRegistry or defined by users. Substituent contains substitutes for template modeling.
:: Species: This container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored. It is suggested that the constructor of a database stores template species instead of real species in this container. Only in this way can he make use of the power feature of template modeling of MoDeL.
:: Reactions: This container contains definitions of various reactions. Each component has its own compartments, reactants, modifiers, products, substituent transfers, and kinetic law. This forms a detailed description of reactions. Again, constructor of a database is suggested to store template reactions instead of real reactions.
The organizational structure of components in MoDeL is shown in the following figure.
Figure 6: Structrue of MoDeL components
As mentioned above, reference relationships are stored in most components. The following figure shows the relationship between different components, the pointer pointing to a component indicates referencing to that component.
Figure 7: Reference relationship of MoDeL components
It is worth noting that MoDeL does not attempt to include all information about each component. In PartsRegistry, a long list of data in XML format is provided including part author, status, sequence, and even group access information. Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set"

Cell signaling
We wanted to incorporate quorum sensing (QS) to make Mantis more robust, increase sensitivity, and amplify responses such that Mantis can sense very low antigen concentrations. QS allows bacteria to communicate by producing the signaling molecule AHL [1]. To achieve our goal, we use a QS system that allows cells to signal the presence of antigen to the entire cell population. After detecting the antigen, a cell will start producing LuxI, the enzyme able to generate the signaling molecule AHL. AHL will diffuse out of the cell into the external medium. When it enters a neighboring cell, AHL can bind with LuxR to form an active transcription factor (TF). The TF activates production of the lysis protein LysE7, causing the cell to lyse. There are two subpopulations of cells; one containing TEV protease and the other containing a quenched form of GFP. The GFP domain in this protein is fused to a REACh domain, preventing fluorescence [2]. Upon release, TEV protease cuts the GFP free from the REACh domain, leading to a fluorescence signal. An overview is visualized in Figure 1. More details are available on the wet-lab results page.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," between questions are bit hard but he said he will try his best to do it. Tim weenink said he is getting weird results since Endonuclease generator and Reporter assembly is not working. Sriram is going to perform his experiments next weekend since his control were not correct since it doesn't have the plasmid 1 in it.
25th September, 2009
Today we had a very short meeting. We discussed regarding the yesterday's presentation at Wageningen Kluyver's Laboratory Conference. Sriram had some difficulties with sequencing since his parts are of larger than 2000bp. He resolved to ask it in today's meeting with our sponsor Baseclear. Tim Weenink is still having troubles with his assembly. He is planning to use alternative methods to know why self destruction doesn't work. Tim Vos has closed the survey and has started to work on results. The knockout kit has been ordered and knockouts will be performed for the conjugation plasmids with it from next week.
18th September, 2009
General Today we had a short meeting and Calin joined us late during the meeting. It is suggested that people who have Visa (Daniel and Sriram) might also have to fill the form for immigration to US. But it must be confirmed with Emrah. We decided on who must do the presentation for Jamboree. It was finally decided as Calin and Vos will do the presentation. We also discussed whether we have to order the knock out kit for continuing the work on Conjugation module. We felt it might be risky but still decided it will be based on all our free time.
Sriram The assemblies of LacI generator with the biobricks was completed except the LacI generator with one of the plasmids of negative cascade. It must be redone. Mostly by next thursday the experiments can be started. The samples for sequencing were sent again. We found that Weenink gave wrong primers for sequencing and with correct primers the sequencing samples were sent.
Weenink He is getting a 800bp band in his colony PCR and he is not sure why he is getting that band since none of his samples were 800 bp. He think it might be due to the expression of the restriction enzyme. But he is not sure since the cut size he expect must be more than 800 bp. Next week he is going to try the assemby of LacI generator with I-SceI + Recognition site + Reporter.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," assemblies have thus far been unsuccessful yielding only red, RFP-expressing, colonies. This indicates either: i) wrong PCR amplification of the backbone from BBa_E1010 (A1 henceforth) or ii) that the assembly has not worked and that left-over BBa_E1010 is still present in the mix. Thus, A1 were amplified again according to the PCR . This was then run on a 1% agarose gel together with the unsuccessful Gibson assemblies and BBa_E1010.
Conclusions from the gel:
The new PCR amplifications seems to have worked producing a clear bands, however some A1 seems to be present in the mix still, thus calling for more stringent cutting during gel purification.
The Gibson assembly have not been sucessfull at assembling the total fragment
A1 seems to present in the Gibson assembly - explaining the red transformants

Baking of trays: Tray from 26/7 baked for two hours at 100°C. Both trays from 25/7 and 26/7 baked at 70°C O/N.
Inoculation of boxes: As the mycelia has not been able to grow all the way to the bottom of the large boxes a hypothesis of air flow being the reason was raised. A box was supplyed with an air tube in the bottom of the box and inoculated as normally. Incubated at 28°C dark.

Small bricks: An ice cube tray was inoculated with different ratios of rice and sawdust to see how that affected the texture of the bricks. See the detailed notebook on Tueday 7/8 for further details.
8/8/2018
Baking of trays:
Tray from 25/7: In the bricks made with overcooked jasmine rice a strong and tough air pocket had been formed. It was tough to break by force with tools. This pocket was filled with air. For the porrigde rice it was filled with liquid and much more wet that the overcooked jasmine rice.
Tray from 26/7: Dry ground rice from first tray seems to have grown well and is dry after baking. Second tray show less growth with many spores.
All from 25/7 taken out of tray and baked individually because htye were not yet dry. This is attributed to them being made from cooked rice already contained a high amount of water.

In summary, we have attempted to expand the results from literature by studying the interactions between spAimR and phAimR and their cognate binding sites. Our results showed that our docking tools were insufficient to do this job and we recommend trying a different approach.
USING STRUCTURAL KNOWLEDGE TO GUIDE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
AimR as an activator in E. coli: Predicted interactions with E. coli rpoA
Using the phAimR structure, we wanted to know whether phAimR would still function as an activator in E. coli. A major mechanism for transcriptional activation at bacterial promoters is by the interaction of the transcriptional activator with the α subunit of RNA polymerase [11]. This is especially the case for transcription factors that bind outside the -35 region of their cognate promoter [11]. In order to test whether AimR stimulates gene expression in this way, we’ve performed protein-protein docking using Chimera between rpoA from B. subtilis and phAimR. The rpoA models used here were generated using I-Tasser since we couldn’t find any rpoA structures that were not in complex with a transcription factor or another protein. To do this, we obtained the rpoA protein sequences from Biocyc [14, 15]. The results of this docking are found in Figure 8.
Figure 8: Interactions between B. subtilis rpoA and phAimR (Top) Interaction with apophAimR (Bottom) Interaction with ligand bound phAimR.
These results suggest that the CTD of the α subunit of B. subtilis RNA polymerase can readily interact with both ligand bound and apo phAimR. However, an extra"
