Planned on doing the transformation of the 8 sample plasmids into NEB DH 5-alpha competent E. coli, but couldn't find the cells
Instead, pipetted the 8 sample plasmids out of iGEM 2018 Distribution Kit Plate 7 and suspended in 10 uL of npH2O, then stored in -20 C freezer as follows:
Tuesday, 7/17
Met with Dr. Velasquez to learn about using the He Lab's plate reader on the 4th floor
Transformed the 8 sample plasmids into NEB 5-alpha competent E. coli according to NEB high-efficiency transformation protocol
Plated original transformation as well as 1:10 dilution for each sample plasmid
Plated on LB + chloramphenicol plates
Incubated at 37 C overnight
Wednesday, 7/18
Observed growth on every original transformation plate, but no dilution plates
Discarded dilution plates and stored plates with growth in the cold room
Thursday, 7/19
Completed three calibration protocols and entered data into the Interlab MichiganState Excel sheet
Prepared two overnight cultures of each of the 8 devices (16 cultures total) as follows:
5 mL LB
5 uL chloramphenicol
1 colony from a plate
Incubated cultures at 37 C overnight
Saturday, 7/21
Made 16 new cultures (in LB + chloramphenicol) to use on Monday
Monday, 7/23
Performed Day 3 protocol for InterLab:

iGEM Saturday meeting 4/14/12 Project Palooza! Microbial Expression and Characterization of a Sequence-specific RNA-binding Protein for Translational Regulation - Express PUF in prokaryotic cells and turn it into a biobrick - Can we use PUF as a translational repressor? This would allow for a more rapid change in protein levels. - Using PUF is a relatively new idea. We would need to study how good the affinity of PUF proteins are. (Binding works so that 2 amino acids interact with 1 nucleotide. A 16 amino acid PUF protein recognizes 8 nucleotide sequence.) - Characterization: Artificial 8 base pair design for inhibition of gene expression. - Optomization: Make a control, and then one nucleotide sequence with 1 one bair pair off. Study the affinity of PUF to both sequences. - Biobricks: 1 biobrick for each of the PUF repeats (8 in total), multiple recognition sites, modular devise for translational regulation. - This is a significant project, but need to look into applications. That just makes it that much cooler. Compile ideas and send to Angela by Monday night. Resveratrol and Piceatannol Project (Cara’s new project) - Resveratrol is turned into piceatannol in the body, which then goes and alters genes expressions when fat cells mature. It interacts with the insulin receptors on immature fat cells, stopping them from maturing. - 1) Can build piceatannol from the ground up (that’s hard.) 2) Use E. Coli to metabolized piceatannol from wine/grapes/etc (but how much is actually there? Is it actually efficient to do this?) 3) Put resveratrol in a medium, then use E. coli that would digest it into piceatannol"

InterLab
Interlab is a peculiar work that aims to decrease lab to lab variety. Due to different conditions in labs, the results                  obtained from years of work are sometimes considered unreliable. Thus, it is important to improve the measurement tools                  available for everyone. In order to support this project, we followed the standard iGEM protocol. This protocol                  is used to calculate the difference between OD and CFU. GFP and fluorescein was used in the experiments and measurements with                  suggested tools.
Our Journey
We began Interlab Measurements in 25.06.2018                 Ph. D. student Evrim Elçin helped us with the protocols and constructing our experiments.
Reference Point
In order to convert our density readings to OD600, we constructed the first experiment of the Plate Reader and CFU Protocol.                  The given LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) were added into wells A1, B1, C1, D1 in the amount of 100 μL. Then, we                  added 100 μL of dd H2O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2 and measured the absorbance at 600 nm of all samples in Thermo Scientific                  Multiskan Go spectrophotometer.
Standard Curve
After the first experiment of the protocol, we constructed an experiment to find Particle Standard Curve with the use of                  Microspheres. Thus, we prepared a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres by following the Microsphere Protocol.                  We used 300 μL of Silica beads, dd H2O and a white 96 well plate with clear flat bottom and measured the absorbance at 600nm.                  All the settings of the spectrophotometer and materials used were same with the ones in the first experiment.

We also added pBAD/araC ( BBa_I0500 ) on the upstream of both fimB(wild-type) and fimE(wild-type). pBAD/araC_fimB(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632012 ) and pBAD/araC_fimE( BBa_K1632013 ) can induce the expression of FimB(wild-type) or FimE(wild-type) in the presence of arabinose. We co-transformed a fim switch_gfp and a pBAD/araC_fimB or _fimE in the E. coli DH5alpha strain(Fig. 3-3-2-3.). We measured the fluorescence intensity of the cells induced by different concentraions of arabinose. From the experimental results(Fig. 3-3-2-4), FimB(wild-type) inverted the fim switch[default ON](wild-type) from [ON] state to [OFF] state and the fim switch[defult OFF](wild-type) from [OFF] state to [ON] state, depending on the concentration of arabinose.  FimE(wild-type) inverted the fim switch[default ON](wild-type) from [ON] state to [OFF] state but did not invert the fim switch[default OFF](wild-type) from [OFF] state to [ON] state, depending on the concentration of arabinose.

2.1.1.1 FimB dependent fim switch(wild-type) state assay
We newly constructed plasmid, PBAD/araC_fimB(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632012 ) that produces FimB(wild-type).  We also prepared two other new plasmids, ( BBa_K1632007 and ( BBa_K1632008 (Fig. 3-5-1-2).  ( BBa_K1632012 enables arabinose-inducible expression of FimB(wild-type).  In both [ON] state and [OFF] state, fim switch(wild-type) is placed upstream of GFP coding sequence.

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," factors about our transformed library:
How much spread does our library cover?  Theoretically, the 94 colonies should be evenly spread throughout the 9,150 chip sequences, and the likelihood of a given sequence being represented twice is very low.
Additionally, are the backbones being represented after transformation in the same ratios as they are on the chip?
What are the chip error rates?  The process of synthesizing the chip is error-prone, but we do not know what percentage of the oligos on the chip contain errors.  These errors can be SNPs or frameshifts from insertions/deletions.
Currently, the sequencing files are all located under sequences/CB bottom insert seq 08292011.
29 sequences were analyzed by hand by importing the sequence files into SeqBuilder and manually identifying the position of the F1 motif based on its translation.
Out of these 29 sequences, 6 showed a frameshift mutation, causing the F1 and F2/F3 to be expressed in different reading frames.  This indicates that based on these results, roughly 20% of the oligos on the chip contain frameshift mutations.  This may be ok, due to the remaining 80% being available.  The mutated oligos will simply be dropped out of the pool during selection due to creation of a nonfunctional protein.
Furthermore, 2 of the 29 sequences contained SNPs.  One of them changed the F in ""FQCRICMRN"" to an S, while the other SNP introduced an early stop codon into the zinc finger, also making it non-functional.
Out of the 94 colonies that were sequenced, 20 of the traces were sufficiently poor quality that no F1 was identified.
For the future, we will need to create a script that will compare the sequenced results to the actual chip database.  This can be accomplished with the following steps:
Perform restriction cuts on the chip in silico, that is, manually edit out the primer tag/type II binding site, leaving only the part that encodes the F1 finger.  This will be the dictionary that we will use to check all of our sequences against.
Parse the sequencing data by identifying the part that codes for F1.  This can be accomplished with regular expressions.  One would need to identify the end of the omega/F1 linker (the last 30 or so nucleotides) and the beginning of the F1/F2 linker (the first 30 nucleotides).  Everything in between can be assumed to be F1 material.
The program will then check to see if the"

Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Yes, there is a biological safety review board at Penn State University. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) records, reviews, and approves laboratory research based on the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. They have approved the research conducted in our lab, and we are in full compliance with the biosafety regulations imposed on our work by the IBC.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Another way to ensure safety could be to create a new lab strain of E.coli that has more auxotrophic requirements. This would make it more difficult for a modified bacteria to escape and possibly spread a Resistance factor or Virulence factor.
Parts could be made safer by introducing more regulation components. By making the bacteria require cofactors to function or to live in an antibiotic containing environment would help to ensure containment of the strain being studied. You could also make it more difficult for the new BioBricks to be transmitted in an active form to an undesired bacterial strain.
Collaboration
This year, the Penn State iGEM team completed a survey for the Macquarie Australia team, commenting on the open source nature of the iGEM competition wikis. We were able to provide detailed responses to questions about collaboration practices and open source material.

Due to the foundational nature of this year's project objectives, the Penn State iGEM team used several BioBrick promoter pieces its constructs. Therefore, all the non-synthesized genetic material was obtained from the Salis and Richard labs at Penn State.
Using vectors from the Salis lab, both the multiple start codon and bidirectional promoter projects were assembled.
In addition to using plasmid vectors and equipment, the Salis lab provides a RBS Library Calculator software program to the public, which both forward- and reverse-engineers RBS sequences and translation initiation rates. This software was used heavily in the design of the multiple start codon project in synthesizing varying RBS lengths and strengths for the construct.
The codon optimization portion of the project was a side project of one of the Richard lab's graduate students, Michael Speer. His partially-assembled construct was the basis testing codon bias.

The sequencing result of P5+mRFP+P0412 was correct. Then, I digested hybrid promoter 4(BBa_K1913023) with EcoRI and SpeI as well as mRFP+P0440 with XbaI and PstI and ligated hybrid promoter 4 with mRFP+P0440 in pSB1K3. After I transformed ligation product into DH5α cell cultured overnight, I picked up colony from the plates and checked inserted parts by PCR and cultured the correct strain(Fig.8). After plasmid purification (78.9 ng/μL) I sent it to sequencing, And its sequencing results were also correct. Thirdly, I tried to use PCR amplify two signal riboswitches BS-xpt and BS-yxjA (66℃ annealing temperature and 15s extension time) that were order from IDT. I got the correct band and did gel purification(Fig.9). Then I digested BS-yxjA with EcoRI and SpeI as well as BBa_P0440 and BBa_P0412 with XbaI and PstI and ligated hybrid promoter 1,2 with mRFP+P0440 in pSB1A3. I transformed ligation products into DH5α cell cultured overnight. I picked up colony from the plates and checked inserted parts by PCR and cultured the correct strain(Fig.10). I purified the colony PCR products and sent them to sequencing, and its results were correct. In addition, I transformed BBa K215001 from 2016 iGEM kits and cultured overnight. And purified plasmid (92.6 ng/μL)  after transformation.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," that there is dilution of which was released. However, it is known that there are many sources of pollution that contains the same harmful substance that discharge their effluent into the same body of water, this fact can lead to concentration of substance and exceed limits of resolution.
In summary, Brazilian legislation only attempts to control the discharge of effluents, it does not act in maintaining the environmental quality of the receiving waterbody. Another mistake made by the legislation is that it rules on concentration and not on the load of harmful substance, this makes any dump mercury is disposed within the parameters in a greater amount than another source that turns your mercury with a margin slightly above established standards. Thus, whoever offers most eviction and degrades the bodies of water cannot be penalized, while those who dumps acceptable amounts will be.
Mercury disposal in the lab environment
Mercury is a silver metal that is liquid at normal temperature and odorless, when the temperature is increased becomes more dense toxic and corrosive. It is a product harmful when inhaled, ingested or in contact, causing irritation to skin, eyes and respiratory system. The mercury is present in various forms (metallic, organic, inorganic Hg) and can be found in three oxidation states (0, +1 , +2) generally readily interconvertible in nature.
Both humans and animals are exposed to all forms through the environment. The mercury vapor present in the atmosphere is eventually converted to water soluble form and returns to the earth's surface in rainwater. At this point, two important chemical changes may occur. The metal can be reduced again to mercury vapor and returns to the atmosphere or can be methylated by microorganisms in sediment from water, including fresh or sea water.
The handling of heavy metals cannot be made in ordinary laboratories, without any degree of certainty (See Table below about the requirements). In the absence of a suitable laboratory handling heavy materials at the university, the team had to redesign one of UFAM_Brazil laboratories ( read more ) to use mercury. This lab will remain for future research conducted at the university for now on.
Safety in the tests:
To avoid harmful we have used mercury in a water solution. In its ionic form Hg2+ in Mercury(II) Chloride form (HgCl2), though stock solution to test our biobricks. To do it, we will only have to dilute the mercury to the wanted concentration using sterilized water. The disposal have been done following the sanitary rules.
What the law says?
Why are we using the requirements applied to health labs? There’s no regulation for the use of mercury"

Week 1: May 1 - May 3
This week we attended the appropriate safety courses required by our University to work in the lab. Besides that, the undergraduate supervisors presented about the principles of Genetics and Synthetic Biology to the new team members.
Week 2: May 6 - May 10
This week we participated in a general molecular biology workshop to refresh our memory of techniques used in molecular biology.
Week 3: May 13 - May 17
We continued the molecular biology workshop. This week we also divided up into our respective groups for the project and decided research priorities.
Week 4: May 20 - May 24
This week we started to perform literature searches for our element of the project. Our goal is to find a way to link the transcription activator-like effector (TALE) and ferritin elements of the project. We have decided that using a two part system is optimal as this would allow the ferritin subunits to self-assemble without having a TALE protein attached that could potentially interfere with this process. In order to accomplish this we have decided to use coiled-coils. The synthetic IAAL E3 and IAAL K3 coils (Litowski and Hodges, 2002) have been selected to accomplish this. These coils make use of hydrophobic regions composed of leucine and isoleucine to bind to each other (Figure 1). The specificity of these coils is conveyed by the presence of glutamic acid and lysine residue that limit the binding to the formation"

Part:BBa_K2492004
In short: Part BBa_K2492004 (Podr-10)provides an neuron AWA specific promoter which drives channelrhodopsins and calcium indicator specifically expressed in AWA.
Part BBa_K2492004 contains odr-10. It is a section of genomic DNA acting as a promoter.
In C.elegans, odr-10 encodes a large family of seven transmembrane olfactory receptor genes[6], which is specifically expressed in neuron AWA and affect chemotaxis to the volatile diacetyl. Pord-10 is a section of genemoic DNA in front of odr-10 genes promoting expression of odr-10 genes[2].
AWA is a member of the olfactory neurons [7]. It responses to attractive volatile odorants. Since we expect to express the functional channelrhodopsins and indicator in specific neuron, such as AWA, we use Podr-10 to construct the plasmid.
If CoCHR is expressed in AWA, we are capable of activating it to manipulate the state of AWA. In our project, we integrated ord-10::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::mCherry transgene to C.elegans by microinjection. Thus, CoCHR (Part BBa_K2492001:CoCHR) promoted by ord-10 is expressed in AWA. We can enhance the attraction of C.elegans through the control of AWA.

Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Centrifugation)
Note: All centrifugation steps are carried out at 17.900 x g (13.000 rpm) in a conventional table-top microcentrifuge
Preparation
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg gel - 100 µL). The maximum amount of gel per spin column is 400 mg. For >2 % agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2-3 minutes to help dissolve the gel. After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow(similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, ad mix. The mixture turns yellow.
Binding of DNA
Add 1 volume isopropanol to the sample and mix.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube. To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min until all the samples have passed through the column. Discard the flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. For sample volumes >800 µL, load and spin again.

    Directed evolution strategies have always been a common method for obtaining specific optimized functional strains, but it’s easy to obtain specific functional components, nor explore the functional mechanisms of components. Therefore, based on the data and experience of this project, we have established a model for screening specific functional components, which can also provide a reference for the preliminary exploration of functional mechanisms. The goal of this project is to build a Lactococcus lactis strain with acid and freeze resistance, in which the acid-resistant components are obtained due to this model. Below I will introduce our model with our acid-resistant component msmK as an example:
    Before model, you should have a strain with corresponding capability or function. In our project, we got the anti-acid strain L.lactis by the following steps:
    We firstly mutant our parent strain L.lactis NZ9000, and 3 key mutant strains were screened from 35,000 mutant strains under high throughput screening, namely L.lactis WH101, WH102, and WH103.
    And then we did acid stress analysis on these three mutant strains.
    Figure 1 The survival rate of 4 strains, L.lactis NZ9000, L.lactis WH101, L.lactis WH102, L.lactis WH103. On the left it’s colony distribution of parent strain and acid-tolerant strains under a pH of 4.0 stress gradient of 10-3, and on the right it’s the survival rate of parent strain and acid tolerant strain (pH 4.0).
    Figure 2 The growth curve of 4 strains, L.lactis NZ9000, L.lactis WH101, L.lactis WH102, L.lactis WH103. A: pH 7.0, B: pH 5.0, C: pH 4.5.
    From figure 1 and figure 2, we screened out L.lactis WH101, which has remarkably 16000-fold higher survival rate than the parent strain at pH4.0 for 5h, which is the highest among the reported survival rates at the same condition.

Introduction
One of the ideas behind synthetic biology is to engineer artificial systems in biological cells. This can be achieved by using well-characterized and simplified parts that can be found in nature. We will be using parts found in different systems in nature to design a bistable switch, an idea stolen from the world of electronics. A simplified version of our bistable switch is illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Simplified version of our bistable swicth
This simplified version of our switch, the repressor-repressor switch is analogous SR flip-flop of digital electronics. The SR (set-reset) flip-flop is constructed from a pair of cross-linked NAND or NOR logic gates. An SR flip-flop circuit built with NOR logic gates is illustrated in Figure 2.
Figure 2: SR flip-flop
The circuit, built with the pair of cross-linked NOR logic gates, functions such that output from a gate will only be true if no input is given as demonstrated by the truth table in Table 1. The biological interpretation of this logical operation shows is that the repression by a protein can be prevented either by an inducer (or anti-repressor protein as in our case) (Input 1/2) or by repression of its synthesis by another repressor-protein (Output 2/1). The elements in the circuit do not possess memory in them, but by cross-linking the elements, the circuit is capable of “remembering” and holding its current state. This means that when neither Input 1 nor Input 2 (no inducers) is present, the circuit is bistable with either Output 2 or Output 1 being active (only one of the repressor-proteins are expressed), respectively.

Paris-Saclay
Paris-Saclay was the first iGEM team we got to talk to. It was great to hear of people doing the same kind of thing, though it was also kind of intimidating with such a big group and many advisors. It seemed like we'd need more knowledge to pull this off. Being a Finnish team, we appropriately Skyped from a sauna-themed meeting room! We did wear clothes, though.
We got a lot of good tips about where to start, what to focus on and what to expect at Jamboree. They were doing bio art, so we contacted Aalto University's Biofilia (a biological art unit under the Aalto ARTS) for them. Biofilia were very interested in talking with the Paris-Saclay team about their ""Ceci n'est pas un citron"" project.
This is how Paris Saclay's team saw us during the Skype call. Image courtesy of Paris Saclay 2014 team .
Virginia
We participated in Virginia iGEM team's survey regarding synthetic biology. It was easier said than done, however. We wandered around Helsinki city centre looking for volunteers with time to answer the survey and offered buns and coffee as an exchange for their time. After a long day we finally reached over 20 responses!
This is the well deserved badge we received for reaching over 20 entries on Virginia's survey!
Amsterdam 2012
We were contacted by Tania Quirin via Facebook. She's from Amsterdam 2012 iGEM team and she's doing her PhD at University of Helsinki. We met Tania several times and got very valuable feedback about our work and presentation but also reflected our experiences to theirs.
Tania has been encouraging and supporting our team in so many ways and even came to see us on Summer of Startups Demo Day . She was the first iGEM alumna we actually met. She also connected us with iGEM-winning Groningen 2012 team's Arjan.
Groningen 2012
We had a long Skype call with Arjan Oldebesten from iGEM-winning Groningen 2012. We were very excited for this opportunity to hear about full scale iGEM experience including world championship Jamboree.
Trying to understand the factors for successful iGEM project, we discovered that success in iGEM does not require a huge amount of experience, top-notch facilities nor a mentor constantly guiding the team"
UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," that we wanted to tackle, we set out to answer the following questions through our wet-lab work:
What sort of bioprocessing technology can we implement to achieve economic parity with fossil fuels?
How can our approach best use existing resources or completely eliminate the need for crop-based feedstocks?
How can we decrease or eliminate the risk of bacterial contamination in large-scale fermentation processes?
What organism(s) would be most ideal for our project?
How can we implement a solution that is scalable and thoroughly designed?
Focusing on a broader scale, we decided to commercialize our solution and make it industrially suitable. To do this, we had to answer another set of questions:
What factors do we have to consider to make a bio-production platform?
What are the key regulatory obstacles that our team will have to overcome?
How can we implement our technology in a way that is scalable and cost-effective?
What are the driving costs for factor of production and how can we decrease them?
Focus 2: Leveraging a Xenobiotics Approach against Bacterial Contamination
ROBUST Method
In searching for novel bioprocessing technology, our team came across a method developed by the Stephanopoulos Lab at MIT, known as ROBUST. Here, engineering microbial consortia to express complex biosynthetic pathways for efficient production of valuable compounds occurs; the team modified organisms to utilize unconventional nitrogen and phosphorus sources, thus conferring a competitive advantage to the host organisms. This is the process of using xenobiotics, or substances that are not naturally occurring in an organism.
Our team decided to implement the ROBUST method and apply it to unconventional carbon sources, deciding to modify cyanobacteria to uptake a selected carbon source so that it would gain a metabolically competitive advantage over any potential contaminants.
Carbon Source Selection
A key component of the protocol was to determine a carbon source that was rare enough that most pathogens would not be able to metabolize it. After discussion with a Virginia startup that focuses on synthesis of unconventional carbon sources, we decided that tagatose would be the ideal carbon source because it had value as a standalone product and as an intermediate for our ultimate goal, which was to produce biochemical substances of value such as medicine or biofuels.
Focus 3: Engineering microbes to produce tagatose
Constructing a metabolic map of tagatose production
Because organisms do not naturally synthesize tagatose, we had to construct the metabolic pathway for this reaction to occur. We used a number of sources, including documentation from Kegg Pathways and Brenda in order to determine how we could use naturally present sucrose and convert that into tagat"

Most of the projects were about Environment & Health and Medicine. Every project is creative and has their merits, and all the pros and cons make us go forward.
2016 iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference (August 8~August 14)
iGEM teams from all over Asia (including China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) gathered to participate in the conference held by NCKU_Tainan. Five days of the exhausting yet exciting journey then began. Every morning, selected teams are scheduled to present their project. Later in the afternoon, well-designed activities such as round table, and experience workshop were held. Experience workshop offers iGEMers from different teams to share mutual experiences and pass on good ideas. Furthermore, NCKU invited many experts in the biological industry to discuss with us, letting us understand more about the current development in biotech industry. During the poster time, we exchange ideas and seek to improve projects through discussion.
University of Auckland iGEM Team (July 11)
The University of Auckland iGEM Team’s student leader, Jessia Chiang, came to visit us in our school. We exchanged some experience with our project. We are surprised that the two teams both dedicate to tackle the long-lasting problem in the environment and improve the human health quality for future generation.
South University of Science and Technology of China
Team members from SUSTech visited us for a two-day trip. The first day, we took them to the famous scenery in Hsinchu and ate some local food. The next day, we introduced National Chiao Tung University campus, meeting room, photo wall and a small greenhouse. Simultaneously, we shared our exciting board game ""Gene Armageddon _ Pest Crisis"". In these two days, we exchange different customs and cultural from our hometown. Thanks very much for SUSTech that they gave us the opportunity to make friend with a different country.

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#TERRA Software_-_-_TEXT.html," to prompt the user to change their input or to green to confirm that the entered data is in the proper format.
Following the form information, the output destination section was improved. The UI dynamically creates a tab for each output, enabling the user to easily switch between outputs on the UI when selecting wells and make edits accordingly. In addition, selected wells change color and can be de-selected before submission. After improving the well selection table, the aesthetics of the UI were redone to make the design sleek and easy to read.
This final version of the UI was received well by users. Given more time, a LiveView feature would’ve been implemented to give users real-time information about TERRA’s status, such as current well and remaining time, during the dispensing process.
Back-end Code
The back-end software runs both the XY Plane and Control Syringes. The approach in designing the back-end was to treat information in the context of a series of different outputs coming off of the microfluidic chip. By creating an “Output” class, we created different methods that were responsible for assigning each output a set of dispensing coordinates and pair of corresponding control syringes that open and close the output. We are then able to access each output to get the necessary information to control the hardware. The control syringe and xy-plane software are detailed further below.
Controlling the Syringe Pumps
The Control Syringe Pump software is responsible for moving the servo motors in order to actuate valves on the TERRA Adapter to select for certain outputs to dispense. In addition, the Control Syringe Pump software resets the syringes before the start of any experiment. It does this by moving syringes to three known states:
Origin
Close
Open
The origin state resets the syringe to reference point, the open state opens a valve by via negative pressure by pulling the syringe, and the close state closes a valve by releasing the syringe back to origin and applying slight positive pressure by pushing the syringe. Below is a diagram showing the various states:
As mentioned earlier, the Control Syringe Pump software works with the TERRA Adapter to dispense outputs into the targeted vessel. Each output has a pair of control syringes assigned to it, called A and B, in order to toggle between selection and waste; selection occurs when the control syringe A is open and control syringe B is closed while direction to waste occurs when control syringe A is closed and control syringe B is open. When dispensing into a well, the output specified by the user is selected and all other outputs are directed"

Wild type HEK293T cells as well as our stable HIF1A knockdown HEK293T cell lines contained more HIF1A after transfection with BBa_K2295001 under a CMV promoter, while western blot showed nearly no HIF1A in untransfected knockdown cells. The synthetic HIF1A can be stabilized by simulation of hypoxia.
Collaboration
Collaborations were an important part of our project, which helped us to improve our own project but also to help other teams to reach their goals. In two meaningful bidirectional collaborations with the teams from the ETH Zurich and Heidelberg University, we were able to fulfill this criteria.
To help Team Heidelberg with their mutagenesis project, we performed mutagenesis experiments with E. coli in order to test the mutagenicity of different plasmids, while Team Heidelberg helped us with the cloning of a plasmid.
In the collaboration with Team Zurich, we performed a killing assay with azurin on HEK293T cells in order to show the toxicity of the protein used by Team Zurich for their cancer treatment. In return, Team Zurich helped us to create a model which shows the time the CAR is still expressed on T cells in the case they leave the microenvironment.
Human Practice
As our project deals with a major research topic, we wanted to involve the society into our project. In order to get an overall opinion about synthetic biology, immunology and cancer we conducted two surveys and got into dialogue with people on the Science Fair in Freiburg and at the Science Days in Europa Park. Thus, we were able to hear about the concerns about our project, which we used to improve our project. In addition to that, we talked with experts in the fields of oncology and CAR T cells, to discuss whether our project is useful and how we can improve it to be more safe for potential clinical trials.

Backend Part
Django
Django is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern.
Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code, it emphasizes reusability and ""pluggability"" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. It also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface, which is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
Python 3
Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. It is cross-platform and it interpreters are available for many operating systems.
Nginx
Nginx is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. Nginx can be deployed to serve dynamic HTTP content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and it can serve as a software load balancer.
Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests. Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide more predictable performance under high loads.
Standford CoreNLP
CoreNLP is a program of natural language processing, it provides a set of human language technology tools. It can give the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc.
It makes it very easy to apply a bunch of linguistic analysis tools to a piece of text. A tool pipeline can be run on a piece of plain text with just two lines of code. CoreNLP is designed to be highly flexible and extensible. With a single option, you can change which tools should be enabled and"

[ Red points represents the track under white light. ]
[ Blue points represents the track under blue light (470nm) ]
Analysis:
From these figures we can get some useful information.
(1) The pmyo2-ChR2-YFP worms have an obvious response. When we give the lights, we can see the amplitude of turning angles become larger. The change of the turning angle becomes drastic.
(2) Compare to the pmyo2-ChR2-YFP worms, the other worm need a long time to be activated. And the time when the worm is activated has become longer.
(3) We use the pmyo2 worms which are given no lights as the control group. We test all the strains of pmyo2 worms, and they have the same reactions. We can see the fluctuation of turning angle is more mild compare to those experimental groups.
5.2.6 The relationship between light intensity and response index
By using DC2100 we can achieve the aim that controling the current of LED accurately. For our LEDs, there is a direct proportion relationship between light intensity and the current which move across it. To test which value is the best to stimulate the C.elegents, we design this part to help us. According to the limitation of DC2100, the largest current we can use is 1000mA. So we pick some worms of all strains which have obvious reactions as our experimental material (using 1000mA to test the reactions before). Because 0mA is needn’t to be tested, we choose to start from 50mA. We pick up 10 worms in each strain to test if it has reactions or not. After 50mA has been tested, we test the 100mA and then 150mA and so on. Until we finish the test of 1000mA, we calculate the ratio of having reactions. Here is the graph we get due to the records.The results are showed below.

The second graph in Figure 4 shows the highest score, lowest score and average score in each generation. We can see that the extreme values are relatively stable. The sequence which has the highest score can be seen as the best sequence that we found.
Simulated Annealing
To compare with GA, we output the scores of each generation.
Figure 5. The score variation.
Because of the parameters we gave, the probablity of accepting the new solution when the score becomes lower is relatively low.

Compared with genetic algorithm, we can see that simulated annealing has lower convergence rate and higher probability randomicity, which can be affected by the temperature, cooling velocity and coefficient that are set.

We use the following formula to simulate the lac repressor system.
We use Michaelis-Menten equation to simulate the process.
Simulation Results
Figure 8. Simulation of the IPTG-lac repressor system.
We infer that the situation of TALE will be similar with IPTG. When TALE protein binds on the plasmid, the expression of lacI will be repressed. Consequently, the concentration of RFP will be increased. If no TALE proteins  are expressed, the concentration of RFP will be very low.
Figure 9. Situations that TALE successfully express and not express.
From the simulation, we can conclude that RFP can be a signal of whether our TALE has successfully expressed, moreover, the concentration of RFP, which shows as the fluorescence intensity, has positive correlation with the quantity of TALE protein.

It shows a bistable system. If one of the states is “on” the other is “off”.
At the following graphic, the system is able to change its states when we act on it, and each state has its own level.
If we simulate weaker stochastic effects, and no inductions on the system, we can see the following result:
The system is not stable without actions. Even, the system is able to change the state randomly. This picture shows a unstable behavior in case of lack of actions.

Nina: Even though melanin looks like it has many rare codons, we should remember that team Tokyo Tech 09 had melanin expressed in e.coli, which then leaked out melanin. Therefore it seems that we might not be too bothered about this many rare codons.

Primer design information
To create our constructs when we have the genes and their sequences
Several strategies for creating and joining two independent DNAs without the use of restriction endonucleases have been developed. One such strategy uses overlap extension employing two PCR steps (7–10). Two intermediate PCR fragments with overlapping end sequences are first amplified, then re-annealed across the overlapping sequences, extended and subsequently amplified with a flanking primer set (7). Though the idea is attractive, the success of overlap PCR depends on efficient cross- annealing of intermediate PCR products and effective removal of unused internal primers to direct the second amplification of the full-length product. - USER TM friendly DNA engineering and cloning method by uracil excision

Discovery
1. The more diligent members, the stronger the whole group
    More Farmers is much better than more beggars. Farmers can produce food for the whole country, while beggars are too lazy to do anything.
    In ecosystems, there exists a kind of character called cheaters, which is similar to our beggars here. If there are too many cheaters in a population, the population grows slower and becomes weaker.
    In human history, we can see that if the people who have power have wisdom and are diligent, the country will be prosperous. If the people who have power are lazy, the development of the country will be slow.
2. Positioning is important
    When there are no warriors on either side, the importance of a good geographical position is noticeable. In this case, if you initialize your bacteria in the middle, then you will find there is more space for your bacteria’s growth.
    In human society, plains are good for agriculture while mountainous regions or plateausare not. If a country owns more plains, it is easier to support more people.
3. Be prepared for danger in times of safety
    When there are no warriors, we came into a flourishing era, or maybe we can call this era a heyday. We can see that even in heyday, the competition still exist, so our E.coli here still have to make their best to compete.
    In human history, a ruler still needs wisdom to rule his kingdom well or manage to lead his kingdom exceeds the other in his heyday. The proverb that ‘Be prepared for danger in times of safety’ is a famous sentence in ancient China for the rulers not to lower their guards.
II The Importance of Military Force
     (1)In this case, both sides own the same number of bacteria: 5 farmers and 3 warriors. The following movie shows that when farmers are more than warriors, farmers grow so fast that they quickly surround the warriors.
Discovery
Strategies for managing the military force is important
    Intelligent players need to think up smart ideas of initialization to help their warriors living at the edge of their bacteria population and not far away from the enemies. Where the warriors are placed in the middle of the farmers or far away from the enemies, it would be hard for them to fight the enemies. Only in this way can warriors fight againstenemies efficiently.

GO BACK AND CHECK OTHER YEAST CONSTRUCTIONS
OXIDATIVE STRESS RESPONSE
This construction is made up of two parts: (1) a transcriptional factor binding site inside the promoter, (2) the coding sequence which contains a synthetic fluorescent (green) protein. The expression of the thioredoxin reductase (TRR) promoter is regulated by two transcription factors, YAP1 and SKN7, which work together in response to oxidative stress [1].
When is the protein synthesized? We obtain the green fluorescent protein by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. (H2O2).
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: YAP1 transcription factor is regulated by subcellular localization. Under normal conditions an exporting receptor (CRM1) escorts YAP1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is stored. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, another protein (HYR1) catalyzes the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond in YAP1 [2]. This conformational change allows YAP1 to accumulate in the nucleus and to bind to the TRR promoter by a bZIP DNA-binding domain. On the other side, SKN7 transcription factor is constitutively nuclear. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, SKN7 is able to associate with the TRR promoter. Some studies suggest that the formation of the SKN7+ YAP1+ DNA complex requires more than the binding of these two transcription factor to the promoter in close proximity. In conclusion, the two transcriptional factors require only one binding site within the promoter [3].  Once the two proteins are bound to the TRR promoter, the transcription of"

Note that the initial silk concentration was 140 mg/mL.
After adding Tamura, it dropped down to 127.9 mg/mL.
Dangerously low....
Tried a spin
70% v/v ethanol coagulation bath
initially tried to pump at 1 uL/min
waaaaaay too slow. Rough calculation says that it would take over 10 hours to spin the entire thing
we bumped up to 16 uL/min (Lewis paper recommendation)
this 12.8% w/v dope is not concentrated enough to spin
a fiber would come out, but it's too fragile to pull over to the godet
So now, we're left with ~2 mL of 14% w/v silk
According to the Lewis protocol, ""We find that storing the silk for a few days will allow it to reach the required concentration.""
So we'll let it sit over the weekend and see if it increased in concentration."

Procedure
Plasmid isolation as described in the sigma MiniPrep kit.
PCR in order to amplify AMO gene using USER primers and 2uL of liquid culture of Nitrosomonas europaea. Primers 17a and 17b were used and master mix for 5 samples was prepared. PCR program was the same as on 12-07-2013 for AMO.
innoculation of ON cultures of colony 12 of cycAX and colonies 3, 4 and 5 of RFP
Results
gel for the colony PCR is empty but some of the RFP containing colonies are red and fluoresce and colony 12 of the cycAX containing E. coli is visibly orange
Conclusion
Nothing was on the colony-PCR gel and we speculate that this is because the USER-primers used to this are not very good to this purpose. We therefore ordered new primers for colony PCR which contain no uracil. The new primers can be used with PHUSION polymerase or any other cheaper alternative.

Developing a Project Idea
After assembling our team, we spent the first two months in brainstorming sessions, researching potential topics for this year’s competition. A team member presented us the field of bionic prostheses, and we were all shocked by the number of people who were suffering from an amputation. His first idea was to use the capacity of bacteria to drive an electrical current to amplify the signal between the patient’s nerves and electrical sensors linked to a prosthesis. This way, redirection of nerves would not be necessary and the patient would be able to accomplish more natural actions.
When we started to look more in details the field of prosthesis and implants, we realized that along with device loosening or malfunctions and foreign-material reactions, infection remains the most serious problems encountered with surgical implants. We quickly learned that biofilm formation is common to all types of implanted foreign-body infections. Indeed, the high susceptibility of implanted devices to infection is due to a locally acquired host defense deficiency. Thus, this persistence at a specific site is mainly caused by the rapid formation of a biofilm, which is resistant to host defense and antimicrobial agents as a result of reduced access and diffusion characteristics within it. We then decided to integrate this aspect inside our project: while favoring the growth of the nerve and the conduction of a signal through a bacterial interface, we could also diminish the risk of infection. At first, we wanted to find a system to directly kill the Staphylococcus aureus, but after talking with Pr. Jean-Marc Ghigo (Genetics of Biofilm Unit, Institut Pasteur), we realized that the biofilm configuration would give us some hard time and require extra steps to manipulate. We decided to shift our goal, and rather than killing S. aureus, we would limit the virulence of the bacteria and restrict its"

It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information
Human Genome and its Domestic Ethical Guideline
We may assay whole human genome in iGEM projects. It needs to be justified ethically. At least in Japan, a chief of the research facility which conducts gene recombination is obligated to establish an ethical committee and the member of concerned research facility must follow the regulations. Principal Investor (PI) must submit a research proposal taking risks into consideration to the chief. Therefore, it is important for members to conduct risk appraisal and to draw up a plan in advance. It is also significant for us to recognize the concept and importance of informed consent.
Domestic Law Related to
Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety
Living Modified Organisms must be restricted to the laboratory and under control. We consider their potential adverse effects on biological diversity, taking also into account risks not only to human health but also to the environment.
In Japan, after the results of Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the Diet enacted “Act on the Conservation and sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms.” This domestic law aims to implement Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety properly.
In this Act, “use” means use for provision as food, feed, and other purposes, and use for other acts including cultivation, other growing, processing, storage, transportation and disposal. There are two types of “use” in the Act. “Type 2 Use” means use which is conducted with the intention of preventing the dispersal of living modified organisms into the environment. “Type 1 Use” means use which is not subject to taking measures similar to “Type"

JMU_Wuerzburg,2018,Team:JMU Wuerzburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,": During our regular skype conference Team Munich provided us with useful information about the wiki the Giant Jamboree and the design of the BioBricks.
At first, we introduced a new project abstract to replace the outdated version of our project description. For an example they sent us their abstract. Several members of Team Munich conducted some final proofreading to shorten our abstract text and advised us for the finishing touches on it.
Our questions about the documents and texts necessary for the judges to evaluate our work were also answered in a following mail. Furthermore, they gave us some advice on how to process our protocols for the wiki. Our doubts whether to use screenshots of programs we used to analyse our data were also eliminated.
But the main part of the meeting was consumed by a conversation about the Giant Jamboree and how to conduct a good presentation. To keep these things in mind, Eni emailed us a list with all the aspects to consider for creating an impressive appearance. They also told us that a hardware demonstration during the presentation is not allowed.
In the end Eni explained to us how to design and dispatch the BioBricks and gave us the hint to use the program “benchling” for an easier design of the BioBrick.
Collaboration Team JMU_Wuerzburg and Team Tuebingen
We sat together with Team Tuebingen to discuss the most urgent issues in the first months of initiating an iGEM team: “How does this wiki thing work?”, “What is Human Practice?”, “Which university staff are the right ones to bother with certain problems?”, “And how in the world do you raise enough money to pay the registration fee?”. Team Tuebingen has answered all our questions and has provided plenty of information to us giving a first impression of how iGEM works.
We followed their advice on how to get in touch with biotech companies and visited the Analytica fair in Munich. As a benefit we were able to overcome all the initial lab material shortages. Besides gaining experience in talking to companies, we met iGEM team Duesseldorf for the first time. After getting started and managing to find sponsors for our emerging project, team Tuebingen continued to support us regarding further iGEM formalities. They also supported us with helpful advice for the submission of the Safety Form.
Furthermore, team Tuebingen has offered to review our website and invited us to participate in a presentation workshop to practice for the Giant Jamboree.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator"

Figure 14: Target RNA made by RPA and in vitro transcription from tetracycline resistant bacteria diluted in milk. Both the isolation method and the RPA and in vitro transcription reaction were tested on pSB1T3 in DH5-α at 37°C. To assess the sensitivity of the method, different dilutions of DH5-α transformed with pSB1T3 were prepared in milk. The dilutions are indicated per lane.
With a teardrop assay , we estimated the number of cells in the sample we used. There were approximately ~3 x 108 cells. We were able to isolate, amplify and transcribe DNA up till a dilution of 10-8 in milk, indicating that we could detect our target in the range of 1-10 cells per sample. However, one should keep in mind that the cells contained a high copy number plasmid, which means that our sample contained more DNA per cell than an average biological sample.
To make our device more user-friendly, we tried the amplification and in vitro transcription at 22 °C (room temperature) for 3 hours, instead of at 37 °C. The results are displayed in Figure 15. These results indicate that the RPA is able to work at room temperature. The T7 RNA polymerase we used on the other hand, has an optimal temperature of 37 °C, and is not functional at room temperature. This means that for our device, we need to come up with a way to regulate the incubation temperature for 3 hours.

Combining Cas13a with our sample preparation
The sample preparation is required to obtain the target for Cas13a. Therefore, It is important to find out if, with the current sample preparation, Cas13a is able to recognise the target and will engage in collateral cleavage. To check whether or not Cas13a gets activated by our prepared sample, we used one of our purified"

Julian's Work
Today I did Cell Lysis
I thawed the  30C pellets from the freezer. I followed the nature protocol for all cell lysis with some differences as noted below. <a href="" http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v4/n3/abs/nprot.2008.250.html ""></a>
Resuspended the pellet in 1X Lysis buffer (See protocol). I added 3mL of buffer/g of cells for a total of 8mL. Mixed to homogeniety and to break up pellet.
I initially added a small amount of chicken egg lysozyme into the cells and incubated for 20 min. I then added 0.5mL Dnase and again incubated for 20 min. The mixture looked somewhat viscous and was completely homogenous. Cells appeared to have lysed. I also added PIC mixture found in the fridge near rocky's bench.
I then centrifuged at 5000g for 25 min to pellet the insoluble stuff. This formed a hard pellet and the supernatant was no longer clear.
However, this pellet looked a lot like the starting cell pellet so I was not sure if lysis had taken place.
I tried to lyse the cells further by adding another 1mL of 8X lysis buffer. I added more lysozyme as well and incubated for a further 30 min.I repeated the above steps and reserved this supernatant separately. Final pellet looked somewhat better and more lysed. This second supernatant was frozen.
For the 1st supernatant, I heated at 80C for 10 min using the heat block. This caused a white protein precipitate to form. The protocol says this step will precipitate many endogenous proteins but leave the silk proteins in solution. I then centrifuged as directed in the protocol to pellet the precipitant.
the supernatant still had some precipitant floating in it after centrifugation
this was removed by syringe filtration
final produce was clearer than before precipitation"

NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#Test_-_-_TEXT.html,"？Dr. Tzeng gave us a special view point, highlighting in the beginning, we human who do farming to survive have caused harm to the environment, so we shouldn’t inspect the ecological equilibrium problem of capturing insects.
Experience Sharing of Dengue Fever Prevention and Control：
Dr. Tzeng shared the interesting experience of his presentation about Dengue Fever Prevention and Control at many town offices and also introduced there are two kinds of dengue fever vector mosquito, one is Aedes albopictus outdoors and the other is aedes aegypti indoors. We not only learned simple knowledge of dengue fever but also realized the feeling of helping people with professional knowledge.
Visitation of their Department Building
Explanation of the Real Function of Mosquito PBAN：
In fact, the mosquito PBAN is activated during spreading wings when the mosquito emerges from its pupa. Initially, the mosquito wings are all living cells and when its PBAN regulates some hormones to make some cells apoptosis, just leaving few cells alive on its bone of wings, it finally forms transparent wings. This explanation about mosquito PBAN gave us a deeper realization about PBAN.
Take a Look at Their Mosquito Breeding Cage and Insect Light Trap ：
Dr. Tzeng let us take a look at Culex pipiens molestus (the underground house mosquito) breeding cage, and also introduced the behavior of many kinds of mosquito. This mosquito breeding cage inspired us many new ideas about our insects testing box. In fact, we mimicked the same concept of mosquito breeding cage to test our PBAN effect simply.
Further Discussion about our project：
Dr. Tzeng have enthusiasm on discussing our project. To prevent any problem from happening, Dr. Tzeng and we inspected all the probability which may cause our project failed like PBAN degeadation in insects’ intestine ( whether we have to use little thuricide to cause some holes on insects’ intestine to make it absorb our PBAN easily ) and the restriction of our project ( we have to capture the first “female” insect in our device, and actually our project work. ). In the discussing process, we inspected many problems again, and also get many suggestion from Dr. Tzeng. We hoped we can overcome all the problems, and improve our project.
Advantages Discussion of Our Device：
Referring to our project, we use PBAN to make the harmful insects produce pheromone for us to help us attract many same kinds of insects. Dr. Tzeng was very interested in our project, and thought compared to the common use (Pherom"
Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#freedthefrogs_-_-_TEXT.html,"1983; Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation and Tom Regan’s Animal Rights and Human Obligations (1976). The Case for animal rights (1983). The renewal of the attention of animal, though imposed to the practice by laws and ethical commitees, is not necessary integrated in the scientific reflection. A closer look at stories of “new” animals brought into living  reveals that our responsibility concerning those beings isn’t well established at all. Raphael Larrère  tells the story of two hybrids, Agrostis, a transgenic crop, and Lucifer, a transgenic and cloned bull. The story of Lucifer tells something that we need to be well aware of as we decide to make living being and specifically animals easier to engineer. Lucifer was the only survivor of numerous embryos cloned and genetically modified, the fruit of a long and tough labor. However, when grew old, the bull was getting really aggressive and dangerous. It was getting really complicated to take care of it. After long debates, INRA’s scientist decided to euthanize Lucifer. This case is interesting as it questions the responsibility of the creator on the creature. Don’t we have duty towards being we brought to the world? Shouldn’t we try to anticipate such situations? It also reminds that the questions raised by synthetic biology are not new. As technologies/biotechnologies shape the world we live in, shape the society we live in, they also shape ethics. [3] Technologies progressively address new ethical needs, as can be seen in the fifty last years. Animal ethics is an instance among many others, nearly insignificant comparing to all that has been thought after the second world concerning nuclear or the development of bioethics since the early nineties (Bioethics has for object what can or can’t be done to human. It is not turned towards animals.)
Some of the members of the team think that synthetic biology gives us the possibility to renew our relation nature. By putting animals and bacteria at the center of our system of production we could make people more conscious of the implications of some excessive ways of living. To some respect, synthetic  biology would be creating new symbiosis. Here comes the original formulation of this idea:
""To me, modifying frog or other organisms is not a way of controlling them, neither it is against the laws of nature (if it were, they would die anyway). To me, it is to develop a new symbiosis, which imply interdependency. In this setting, mankind will depend on these organisms, and will have to treat them well. People usually don't think of the dependence on animals synthetic biology creates, they only"

In practice, by making a plasmid containing original receptor’s promoter, channelrhodopsins, Ca2+ indicators and fluorescence proteins, the light sensitive receptors and other proteins can be expressed in C.elegans. Artificial introns are inserted in the genetic sequence of the plasmid, to enhance their expression in the nematodes. For the sake of ensuring efficient concomitant and equivalent expression of more than two polypeptides from a single promoter, viral 2A peptides are used, which trigger a “ribosomal-skip” or “STOP&GO” mechanism during translation, to express multiple proteins from a single vector in C.elegans.
Hardware Engineering
In the whole circuit in AWA neuron, blue light of 470 nm wave length activate CoChR channel. GEM-GECO, as the calcium indicator, is activated at 395 nm, and shift its emission wavelength from 542 nm to 483 nm.  In the whole circuit in AWB neuron, red light of 630 nm wave length activate Chrimson channel. Also, we will capture the wavelength range of GEM-GECO after neural activation.
Fig. 5 An overview of the microfluidic process 1) We use the Selection Chip to select appropriately sized worms; 2) we monitor changes in worms’ distribution before and after adding chemicals in the Gaussian Plate. 3) we immobilize worms to observe their live neuron activity and behavioral response in the Immobilization Chip.
Thus, to precisely control the light stimuli and receive all the output signals, a customized optical device is needed. Beside, to study the collective behavior of worms with high throughput, an accurate and user-friendly is required.
Why C.elegans?
Caenorhabditis elegans, a classic model organism, is widely used in scientific researches. In our project, we also choose it because its whole genome has been sequenced, and it has its own connectome(neuronal ‘wiring diagram’) completed by 2012 [3] [4] . Adault C.elegans is about 1mm in length, 45μm in width and it is easily to observe and manipulate under stereomicroscope [5] [6] . What's more, C.elegans has fixed ‘genetically determined number of cells’ [7] .These characteristics are"

Switches relying on tiny abortive RNAs
We also implemented switches based on a the phenomenon of tiny abortive RNAs [5] . This principle is in contradiction to NUPACK-simulations, suggesting the T7-terminator to be less stable than simulated in NUPACK. Nevertheless, we tried to implement switches integrating tiny abortive RNAs in different length as trigger site. Results are illustrated in the in vitro Screening section.

Kinetic simulations
In order to prove if the antitermination process is not only possible on a thermodynamically base, but also regarding kinetics, we performed the following modeling.
Diffusion
The question whether antitermination occurs is not only guided by the folding process of the signal-terminator pair, but also by how long the signal takes to  diffuse to the terminator sequence. The folding of the signal-terminator pair has to be kinetically on the scale of the folding of the terminator structure on its on, to be a valid competitive reaction. This means, the antitermination has to occur before the polymerase will fall of the DNA strand.

To account for the diffusion time, we estimated the hit rate τ [6] , which is the time until the signal meets the terminator sequence for the first time:
where D is the diffusion constant, a the radius of gyration of the signal molecule and r the radius of the compartment.
For E. coli r is approximately 1 μm. The radius of gyration a can be estimated using the worm-like-chain model [7b by
where n is the length of the signal which is 0,3 nm/monomer, l is the persistency length [8] which is 2nm for single-stranded RNA. Thus, for a signal of length 32 nt, a = 6,4 nm.
The diffusion constant D was obtained by
where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature.
Using the a we calculated above and T = 300 K, we get D = 3,4318 m2/s.
Thus, for a cell containing 100 signal molecules, the signal needs approximately 0,1518 sec until it first hits the terminator sequence.
Close
As the folding time (at least 1,7 sec for full signal length) is significantly larger than the estimated diffusion time (0,1518 sec), diffusion does not play an important role and thus can be neglected in modeling our signal-terminator constructs. Thus the folding process is the rate limiting factor.

NTNU Trondheim iGEM and Dr Alfred Nordmann
Search and Destroy: Bacterial Anti-Cancer Kamikaze
Trondheim, the only Norwegian iGEM team, are enabling E.coli to detect and attack cancer cells. The cells will produce a tumor inhibitor effective at killing cancer cells. It will then respond  to environmental cues indicating the presence of cancer cells and undergoe lysis, to release the anti-cancer agent. Trondheim iGEM describes this as a ""search and destroy"" missions against cancer inside the human body.
Creative Understanding
Dr Alfred Nordmann is Professor of Philosophy and History of Science and Technoscience at TU Darmstadt. We sat down with him at the CAS Conference in Munich to talk about the difference between science and technoscience - including Synthetic Biology. Whereas the former aims to generate intellectual knowledge, the latter focuses on creating capabilities and creative understanding.

Regulated Invasive Organism Targeting System
Biomolecule delivery systems are often plagued by problems such as non-specific targeting and low bioavailability. We sought to design a novel system that can sense and respond to specific stimuli present in the microenvironment of pathogenic cells. We engineered a dual-sensor bacterium that can sense increased metabolite levels in its microenvironment and then respond by delivering biomolecules into target cells. As a proof-of-concept, we engineered Escherichia coli to detect increased level of lactate in biological fluid, then respond by attaching itself to a cancer cell marker, and subsequently release biomolecules into the cell. A biosafety kill switch will be activated when there is insufficient lactate present, thus minimizing non-specific targeting.
Our proposed system has the flexibility to be engineered to detect other metabolites by changing the gene promoter and also detect different cell types by targeting other cell receptors.  In addition, the modular nature of our system also allows part of the lactate sensing mechanism to be used as diagnostic kit, especially for detecting for elevated levels of lactate in biological fluids such as blood or serum from patients with suspected case of sepsis or lactic acidosis. This method of detection can be carried out without any specialized equipment or in improvised areas.
INTRODUCING:
RIOT Sensor
RIOT Responder
RIOT Invader
The RIOTsystem is a two-component spatial sensor for drug delivery to specific cell types. Using cancer cells as a model, we have engineered E. coli to detect specific characteristics that are present in a range of cancers.
Firstly, the RIOTsystem is designed to detect and survive only in areas of elevated lactate concentrations present in the microenvironment of certain cancer cells due to the Warburg effect. This specificity is conferred by introducing a bifunctional conjugate which consists of an anti-CD"

Pigment did not mix well with pigment and caused the contents to coat the tube. The water based solution colour is shown in the petri dish.
Figure 5. Ink solutions prepared from acetone and water extractions of cranberry and lutein tablets. Guar gum was added to the solutions to a final concentration of 0.5% and allowed to set. Water based inks became thick and more opaque than the acetone based inks. Guar gum precipitated in the acetone based inks.
Finally, used a syringe to draw a line with each ink across Whatman paper (Figure 6). The acetone based inks were more prone to bleeding than the water based inks. The water extraction of the cranberry tablets yielded a more vibrant colour on paper than the acetone extraction, and the water extraction of lutein/zeaxanthin was more uniform in colour an darker than the acetone extraction.
Figure 6. Demonstration of the inks application to Whatman paper.
Using the ink in old fountain pens was attempted, but we found contamination with previously used ink in the pens were interfering with our results. The creation of our ink for use in fountain pens does not need to be as precise in terms of viscosity as it would need to be for printers. This is because there are no mechanical or moving parts or significant movement of ink within the pen, all we need is for the ink to be able to come out while keeping the amount of solvent as low as possible to prevent bleeding of the ink. This allows us to just attempt a few proportions of pigment, resin, and solvent for the pens."

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile#Cyanolux#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in various prokariotic organisms such as Vibrio fischeri and Photorabdus luminescens 12 . In V. fischeri, the operon is composed of 8 genes: LuxA and LuxB encode for the monomers of a heterodimeric luciferase; LuxC, LuxD and LuxE code for fatty acid reductases enzymes and LuxR and LuxI are responsible for the regulation of the whole operon 13 .
Lastly LuxG is believed to act as a FMNH2 dependent FADH reductase, although luminescence is barely affected in its absence 14 . The n-decanal ( n= 9 to 14) substrate oxidization to n-decanoic acid by the LuxAB heterodimer is coupled with the reduction of FMNH to FMNH2 and the release of oxygen and light.
The carboxylic group of the product is then reduced to aldehyde by CDE proteins allowing the reaction to start over 15 .
LuxAB genes have been widely used as reporters dependent on the addition of n-decanal to the culture media 16 and in 2010, the Cambridge iGEM team engineered LuxABCDEG to an E. coli-optimized biobrick format, uncoupling it from the LuxR and LuxI regulation.
As a team we decided to work with this operon for a number of reasons, first of all, the bioluminescence produced by this pathway is much stronger than other systems from the registry (i.e XFPs). Moreover, the light production does not depend on a single peptide but on a whole pathway involving several genes, which makes it much more tunable, for instance, decoupling in time the substrate recovery from the luciferase reaction itself.
Experimental Strategy
We have devised different strategies to achieve bioluminescence controlled under circadian rhythms. Here we describe the strategies used for building the constructs to reach our goals.
Splitting the Lux operon and choosing promoters
We decided that we would separate LuxAB (the luciferase part of the operon) and LuxCDEG (the substrate producing enzymes LuxCDE with LuxG the FMNH2/FMN reducing enzyme) to allow phase-dependent expression of the parts. Using specific promoters of Synechocystis PCC. 6803 we can have fine-tunning of the production of bioluminescence. Recent work on global gene expression in Synechocystis aided on finding adecuate promoters 7 , 8 . (Images at right from cited papers.)

Heavy Metal Bioprecipitation
Click the operon to be linked to the phsABC part page!
The phsABC genes from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 encode thiosulfate reductase, which catalyzes the stoichiometric production of hydrogen sulfide and sulfite from thiosulfate for heavy metal removal by precipitation. Within a separate bacterium from that containing the mer operon construct. This system allows us to extend our heavy metal bioremediation device to be applicable to a wide range of heavy metals in addition to mercury in both ionic and organic form. The phsABC operon encodes three open reading frames (ORFs), designated phsA, phsB, and phsC. Based on sequence homology to formate dehydrogenase-N, it is predicted that thiosulfate reductase behaves in a similar fashion. The PhsA subunit is predicted to be a peripheral membrane protein active site bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) molybdenum (MGD) cofactor. PhsC is an integral membrane protein that anchors the other two subunits to the membrane, and contains the site for menaquinol oxidation and two heme cofactors located at opposite sides of the membrane. PhsB is predicted to possess four iron-sulfur centers that transfer electrons between PhsC and PhsA.  was shown to have the highest catalytic activity in the IPTG- inducible plasmid pSB74.

As for FliG, this protein is responsible for the rotation speed and torque power of the bacterial flagella. For our aims in this part of the project, which are to increase the speed and power of the bacterial flagella, we decided to focus on FliG.
In a study by Gina M. Donato and Thomas H. Kawula, it was shown that HNS is not only a transcription factor but also that it can change some protein’s activities through direct interactions with them. . In studies including fluorescence anistropy and chemical cross-linking, it was shown that there is a physical interaction between HNS and FliG proteins.
Figure 2: Fluorescence anisotropy of H-NS-FliG interactions. Increasing amounts of FliG were added to fluorescein-labeled H-NS. Ten anisotropy values were measured at each FliG concentration and averaged. Graph is representative of two separate experiments.

Preventing the spread of these bacteria and increasing the immune system of bee larvae is an important goal to achieve in the health bee risk prevent. In particular, nowadays the only preventing tools are the Beekeeping Best Practices (BBP) which depends on the personal application beekeepers carry out. In this respect, FAI considers essential to test this research on the pure Italian Apis mellifera ligustica, as it is the most widespread in the world. In this regard, FAI will collaborate and provide the necessary support, remaining at iGEM team Tec-Chihuahua disposal in case of need for further information for the research project and programme. FAI is totally sure that such a research could find a spreading interest in the beekeeping world at different scales.

The forum was held in the Chihuahuan Desert Museum and had an approximate of 340 attendees from the state including beekeepers from the Cuauhtemoc’s beekeeping society, attendees from other states and from the country of Chile.
We had the opportunity to speak with diverse beekeeping companies.
Beekeepers spoke about the current contamination that exists in honey, the main problems are antibiotics, sulfonamides are still used in many parts of the country.
We were the closure presentation of the event. Juan Carlos Coronado, a Chilean beekeeper we met at the forum, invited us to visit his apiaries.
Engineer Sóstenes Rafael Rodríguez Dehaibes, CEO of COMVERMIEL and national and international speaker in beekeeping pathology topics in Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. Mr. Sóstenes shared with us some of the studies made for honey exportation. Honey needs to meet specific criteria concerning quality, labeling, residues of treatments for bees and pollutants from the environment. He stressed that for antimicrobial peptides, studies had not been done yet.

Our team sought to customize bacterial adhesion for development of targeted microbial therapies for colorectal cancer. We needed to determine the utility of such cancer treatments and what sort of questions would necessarily have to be answered so such technologies may be deployed in people affected by colorectal cancer. We wondered whether there is a need for such need microbial treatments the currently available treatment options. Finally, we questioned if the synthetic biology treatments we envisioned are fundamentally different from small molecule cancer therapeutics, and if this would necessitate engineering specific components to make them suitable for clinical trials. Hence, we consulted with experts in academia and private industry to propose our idea and learn how drug treatments are created, validated, and eventually used to treat patients.
The need for BactoGrip and living cancer therapeutics
We spoke to Dr. Lawrence Shulman, the Deputy Director for Clinical Services at the Center for Global Cancer Medicine, at the University of Pennsylvania. We learned that treatments are more desirable from the perspective of patients and doctors when they are orally administered, toxic only to targeted cells, and affordable. He also stressed that cancer is complex and not defined as a single disease. Rather, biological markers on cancers vary with factors including stage of the disease, necessitating tailor-made treatments for specific cases of cancer. Moreover, invasive surgery is common for treatment of early stage colon cancer. Based on this feedback from Dr. Shulman, we realized that design of our BactoGrip treatment must consider end-user physicians and patients. In this manner, our concept for treatment of colorectal cancer is compelling because of how it could be customized to target specific disease biomarkers by exchaning different cancer binding peptides to the Bactogrip adhesin. Moreover, the therapy meets his criteria for ease of administration to patients since it could be introduced orally and less invasive compared to surgery. Thus, the concept of BactoGrip meets end user criteria for effective cancer therapies and is thus worth pursuing as a project.
Dr. Shulman also suggested that our microbial cancer therapeutic could be especially useful for cancer treatment in developing countries because of the inherent affordability in synthesizing a self replicating, living therapeutic. The exorbitant costs of cancer therapies in the developed world has translated into disparities in cancer treatments compared places of lesser wealth"

Madrid-OLM,2018,Team:Madrid-OLM#SoftwareMeasurements_-_-_TEXT.html," Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
Activities
The event began on Friday the 14th in the afternoon with the main course. In it, after the reception of the attendees we gave way to a series of very interesting expert presentations. We were able to count on the attendance of the following personalities
Victor de Lorenzo
He is one of the Spanish most relevant researchers in the Synthetic Biology field. He work in the National Biotechnology Center (CNB) a part of the Superior Council of Scientific Investigations (CSIC). His laboratory is specialized in solving environmental issues using genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida. He gave us an interesting talk about ""Synthetic Biology in the rescue of the planet Earth"".
Saul Ares
He is a researcher of the CNB too. His work is central in the mathematical modeling of Synthetic Biology systems. He has also collaborated with previous iGEM teams. His presentation talked about ""How do cyanobacteria count to ten"".
Krzysztof Wabnik
He is a Young Investigator Researcher of the Center for Biotechnology and Plant Genomics (CBGP) at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). The group he is leading uses multilevel computer model simulations, synthetic biology experiments and microfluidics. The name of his presentation was: ""Combining computational and synthetic biology approaches to understand the dynamics of plant hormone signaling circuits"".
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
After the talks a social event was held in which the attending teams could relax having dinner in the center of Madrid with one of the most typical activities here: go out for tapas.
The second day was inaugurated with a visit to the university to show the facilities where our team works and it was explained which procedures are used in each of the sections that were visited.
Subsequently, the presentations of the projects were made. A simulation of the presentation was carried out as it should be done in Boston, to learn how to take the time and try to correct the excesses or lack of time in each section that was exposed.
In the afternoon there was a tour around Madrid, where the most iconic places of the city were shown. And although there were activities scheduled for the next day, this was the activity that closed the meet"

Safety considerations of E.coli DHα
Most E.coli strains are harmless and are a normal part of human gut flora, however, environmental strains such as serotype O157:H7, can cause serious food poisoning in humans. The genetic set up of the E.coli laboratory strain DH5α has been engineered in such a way, that this strain can be considered as safe laboratory strains, if standard safety protocols are followed. Moreover E.coli is one of the most used laboratory strains. This fact alone eliminates most safety issues with regard to laboratory applications, like on our case.
The genetic characteristics of the DH5α strains are:
F- endA1 glnV44 thi-1 recA1 relA1 gyrA96 deoR nupG Φ80dlacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169, hsdR17(rK- mK+), λ–
Amongst the most important genetic modifications is F-, which denotes the strain´s inability to develop F-pili. This prevents transfer of genetic information by horizontal gene transfer. Another important genetic modification is recA1, making the DH5α strain recombination deficient, preventing recombination of the plasmid into the E.coli genome so that the plasmid inserts are more stable. This leaves DH5α also very sensitive to UV-light as a result of the strains inability to undergo recombination, thereby impairing its DNA repair mechanism.
With regard to its prospective use as a biosensor within industrial, environmental, medical or food applications safety aspects have to be reconsidered and implemented in product development strategies. For example if our E.coli biosensor would be deployed as an oral drug it will be necessary to prevent the bacteria spreading to other parts of the human body or giving rise to an immune response. A possible solution could be to encapsulate the bacteria in some way or/and to limit the number of bacteria generations.
Local biosafety group
We have a local biosafety group at our institution, and they have advised us to follow standard safety protocols for genetic engineering and molecular biology"

Where will Printeria have a great impact?
Yturralde recommends the US to launch such innovative projects. The fact is that it is not without reason, as in Spain there have been many television media and laboratories that have ignored us. Therefore, if we continue with the project after iGEM, we will direct all our efforts abroad, it is decided!
Printeria, the near future
When we asked him about improvements of printeria, he said: "" It is not what is missing is what is going to come"". He encoraged us to continue with Printeria because we will be the start of a new and revolutionary way of expression.

Ryan Fobel is CEO of Sci-Bots located in Toronto (Canada). He has a PhD in medical biophysics.
We e-mailed Ryan to get in contact with a company that actually does Digital Microfluidics. We learned a lot from the variables involved into this technology. Our final design was heavily influenced by our conversation via Skype with him. We even got the chance of  using some of the Digital Microfluidics Chips that Sci-Bots uses for their machine.
Highlights of design changes:
Pad distance: It is really important that pads have the shortest distance between them as possible. On our early tests we used around 6 mils of separation between pads. He really advised us to use 4 mils pad separation, and this was implemented on the final PCB for the experimentation surface.
Surface coating: This is the hardest part to get right. We learned that currently is better to reapply the coating everytime we do a reaction on the surface. To solve this we got inspired on the design by OpenDrop of using disposable surfaces that are held on top of the PCB. We used that concept on the final design of our machine.

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Project#Pigments_-_-_TEXT.html," were used standard assembly protocols to build pigment producing devices. The melanin system is a single gene which we endeavoured to turn into a biobrick by PCR. Finally, we designed the violacein operon for synthesis, codon optimizing it for both E. coli and B. subtilis and designing it so it is easy to manipulate to generate different pigments.
Potential for Gene Manipulation: The melanin system is particularly elegant in that a single gene is able to generate pigment as long as the bacteria are supplemented with copper and tyrosine. On the flip side, the carotenoid and violacein systems are multi-gene operons that make more than one pigment each. Further, they generate pigments without any supplements to the media.
