Summary
With the spirit of communication and cooperation, our team members organized several team communication activities, among which are the visiting to Team ZJU-China and Team OUC-China . While we were visiting these other teams, we discussed our projects on a serious, in depth level, as well described our human practice projects in detail.
Visiting Team ZJU-China
Our team and ZJU iGEM team have traditionally been closely acquainted. Since Peking was the 1st runner-up in 2010, and ZJU was the 2nd runner-up in 2011, both of the two outstanding teams know that we can learn a lot from each other's experience, and improve the ideas and designs of both team through the free discussion. Therefore, on July 27th, 7 members of our team launched the 3-day journey to Hangzhou, the most beautiful city in China, and launched the open communication with ZJU-China 2012 iGEM team.
Figure 1. Peking University and Zhejiang University.
After our arrival, we were invited to go to the restaurant near Zhejiang University for some food and drinks and had a nice chat with the ZJU 2012 team members and the leader of ZJU 2011 team.
On the following day, we went to the laboratory of ZJU 2012 team. Both teams had the chance to introduce their team members, and give a presentation of their project. After discussing our projects, we began to introduce the theme of our human practice.

Public Relations
Article in the regional newspaper ‘Nürnberger Nachrichten’
At the end of June we sat down with the editor Dr. Lothar Hoja of the ‘Verlag Nürnberger Presse’ to talk about our project.                 We discussed our ideas, their realization as well as human practice projects. Not only did we get a lot of helpful tips and suggestions from Dr. Hoja,                 but he also sent us a beautiful package with promotion pens. The article ‘Bacteria to build artificial muscles’ was published in the supraregional part of                 the newspaper Nürnberger Nachrichten.
Therefore, we again want to thank Dr. Lothar Hoja!
Article in the magazine ‘frisch!’ from the Friedrich-Alexander-Universiät
Just as we started our practical work in the chemistry lab, one of the editors of the campus magazine ‘frisch!’ visited us in our lab.                 We showed him our work, the syntheses of the azo dye and discussed iGEM and our project.                 We want to thank the team of ‘frisch!’ for this great article. ‘Robotic muscles from the test tube’ can be found in the ‘frisch!’ magazine.

Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#FruitDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," a means to achieve a knockout. Using a Cas9 endogenous to another strain of L. Johnsonii, our plan was to replace our target genes with a reporter construct of our own design.
By taking advantage of the polycistronic nature of transcription in prokaryotes, it is possible to construct a template for homologous recombination that is only transcribed once successfully copied into the genome. Choosing homology arms that only include a RBS and the coding sequences of adjacent genes, we planned to introduce a split intein into the genome. The two halves of this intein, when coexpressed, rejoin a split GFP-protein. This strategy should enable a quick and inexpensive selection of clones bearing the desired modifications.
Mainly due to time constraints, the modification of the Lactobacillus genome was not realized. In the course of the project, several Cas9-fusion proteins were designed. Due to a lack of opportunity to test these constructs in Lactobacillus Johnsonii, they will be tested in different model organisms.
Quantitative Fructose test
To prove the effectiveness of our transformed lactobacilli, we had to come up with a quantitative fructose assay. Many coulometric assays with the possibility of quantitative measurement are available for sugars, many of which having the problem of distinguishing between different kinds of sugars, especially between Glucose and Fructose due to chemical similarity. After screening multiple tests we decided to use a test published by the WHO for the proof of fertility in human semen using an Indole reaction. The test provides a rather sensitive method to measure the Fructose concentration even in presence of Glucose.  Following the indole reaction, the quantitative measurement of the test was done photometrically at 470nm with a standard spectrophotometer."

Reaching Out
In the age of modern science where new discoveries come out around the clock it may be difficult to establish a good connection between the scientific community and the public. The gap of knowledge between researchers and the public may lead to complications and possibly make the public reluctant to trust scientific research. It is therefore very important to try to reduce"

STRAINS (E. coli)
In order to assess biofilms as a system we were required to choose discrete elements, i.e. genes, to perturb from the wild type. Using the EcoCyc database as a reference we developed a regulatory map of any genes we could find related to biofilms. This map helped us identify key regulatory genes that we expected would affect the eventual phenotypic output of the biofilm; either by virtue of being a deletion strain or by the genetic element being overexpressed through our pEBS + {target gene} transformed strains. Listed below are the deletion and transformed strains we assayed along with their expected phenotypes.
BW25113 Wild Type (Weak Biofilm Response Control)
MG1655 Wild Type (Strong Biofilm Response Control)
BW25113 pEBS-csgD
Regulator of genes involved in curli assembly; it is induced in  mid-exponential phase, allowing csg-dependent genes to become activated in stationary phase. [1]
BW25113 pEBS-fimB
The gene fimB mediates off to on switching of fim operon, while fimE mediates on to off switching of the fim operon. Its deletion should in principle repress the fim operon, while its overexpression should in principle encourage fimbriae formation. [2]
BW25113 pEBS-mlrA
MlrA stands for a merR-like regulator A, which regulates curli production. Its overexpression should in principle suppress curli formation, while its deletion should in principle encourage curli formation. [3]
BW25113 pEBS-ompA
The protein OmpA influences cellulose production by  repressing cellulose production with CpxRA stress response system; it is  overexpressed in biofilm formation and repressed when cells are exposed to  visible light. [4]
BW25113 pEBS-ydeH
YdeH is a diguanylate cyclase, whose product is c-di-GMP. c-di-GMP regulates both biofilm formation and motility. YdeH deletion has been shown to reduce "

As the act of patenting is costly, we were also introduced to the concept of strategic patenting. This practice ensures that the patentee has a much time as possible to work on their IP while being protected before fully committing economically to the patenting process. Since we will be disclosing the majority of out findings on the iGEM wiki in late October, the ability to file a patent in many international markets are limited as they immediately label any knowledge on the internet as public domain. For a patent in Canada/United States, there is a one-year grace period after the date of disclosure in order to file a patent before the IP becomes part of the public domain. During this time period, one can file for a provisional patent valid for Canada and the U.S, the function of the provisional patent is to serve as a place holder for a patent down the line and lasts for a year from the date of filing. After the 12 months, one can go straight into a U.S. patent which lasts 20 years or can file a Paris Convention Treaty Patent, which would extend protection by 18 months which allows for more time to get research funding, additional development and entrepreneurship.
As a team we were also curious to see how intellectual property rights in emerging markets affected patenting. The rationale behind this exploration was to explore intellectual property in other emerging markets and see whether or not dNANO could potentially commercialized. We then contacted and collaborated with the Sichuan University (SCU-China) iGEM team in order to compare and contrast intellectual property rights in Canada and in China.
We realized that some countries have compulsory licencing where the government is able to licence out one’s IP without prior consent of the inventor. Usually, these are granted under special circumstances such as a national emergency and ultimately undermines the inventor’s autonomy with the IP. P

Entrepreneurship
Most patents lead to business development in some capacity. As a project that originated from the university, share of the venture would be divided in a way where a third is assigned to the university, a third is assigned to the inventors and the last third is assigned to the party that is responsible for commercialization. So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology"

Overview
Genetic doping has been on the list of prohibited substances since 2003 and its use has been suspected for almost as long. However, until today no method for gene doping detection has been implemented by the World Anti-doping Agency. By developing and demonstrating a proof-of-principle of our method, ADOPE, we can be the first to this niche market. Our analysis and market research lead us to a distinct value proposition canvas revealing the needs of our main stakeholders, the anti-doping agencies.
We also identified applications beyond our current scope. The method is highly valuable  to the Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association , who would like to see our method implemented in horse racing doping tests. In addition, the Dutch National Bloodbank Sanquin would like to apply the method for less invasive prenatal screening, and the Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research (RIKILT) for food safety applications.
We have taken significant steps to ensure the future implementation of our idea. By writing a grant application to the Partnership for Clean Competition and a collaboration proposal with Oxford Nanopore Technologies , we are in the starting blocks to demonstrate the applicability of ADOPE in the field. A second grant application is in preparation by the Brouns lab (TU Delft) , our supervising lab, involving the Delft Sports Engineering Institute . The institute would further support the development of our ideas financially  and connect with an extensive network in the world of professional sports. Oxford Nanopore Technologies indicated that our proposal is of interest to them and it would fit well within their plans.
Based on our network consisting of companies and institutions, we see an ideal basis to achieve a demonstration of our technology.  We aim to become the first and best gene doping detection method to be implemented in doping"

Bordeaux,2016,Team:Bordeaux#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"As stated before, our modelling choice was to implement a multi-agent systems. Multi-agent modelling is frequently used to model biological phenomena. It stands out against continuous mathematical modelling, which is often used for predictions at a population level [1] .
Multi-agent modelling offers different advantages :
Stochasticity : contrary to mathematical deterministic equations, it is much easier to induce randomness in multi-agents models.
Heterogeneity within a population.
Interaction between the different agents
2. Overview
Our programming choices
Our main concern in this project was the rapidity of the simulation. Indeed, bacteria can quickly develop, and our processor may have to face a horde of ever-growing agents. Hence, we chose to implement our simulation in C++.
Our program's dependencies are detailed in the software section .
Creating the agents and environment
Initially, an empty lattice is created, containing n number of squares. This number is determined by the height and length of the lattice provided by the user, and set by default at 1000x1000. A square is identified by its id in the lattice and can contain bacteria. If there is more than one bacterium, the bacteria are  piled up in the square, with of course a limit to the piling,also set by the user.
The bacterial agents are then created, and randomly set in different squares. Each bacterial cell possesses certain characteristics such as a mass, a volume,  an identifier of the square the cell is in etc.
Figure 1: Grid with randomly placed bacteria
3. How does it work?
Bacterial growth
This model can de divided into two main parts : the growth of the bacterial population and the transmission and maintenance of plasmids in the population.
For the growth of our bacterium agents, we tried two different implementations. The first one is an adaptation of bacterial growth implemented for the first time in Bacsim [2] and based on Donachie and Robison model for cell division. The second is adapted from the Indisim methodology [3] for bacterial growth simulation.
Bacterial growth based on Donachie's model
Figure 1 shows the schedule of activities bacteria repeat once every time-step and will serve to further explain them.
Figure 2: Flowchart with the bacterial growth steps
Donachie's model is based on the dependence of the median cell's volume on growth rate during exponential growth. Each cell volume depends on the cell's growth rate, which itself depends on substrate uptake and metabolism. So the formula we used for the volume is V = Vμ∗2μ⁄ln(2) where μ is the growth rate updated at"
Lethbridge_HS,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"aceous mold from the fungi family). Dextranase, by degrading parts of the EPS matrix would allow for Mnase to further seep into the biofilm, and thus increase the overall efficiency of the mixture.   What we are doing differently. Past projects have targeted the bonds within the biofilm structure to disperse the biofilms, but since there is a variety of major bonds found within different biofilms, the effects of the construct have been limited to some bacterial species. But, by targeting the extracellular DNA and the exopolysaccharide matrix (common components of almost every biofilm), our aim is to create a general all-purpose dispersant, capable of working on a variety of biofilms, thriving in a variety of settings.  Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix: Sticky Stuff! The bacteria in the biofilm are surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. This matrix is comprised of water, which hydrates the cells; various sugars, to provide nutrients and the sticky structure of the biofilm; proteins, which are typically enzymes; lipids; and extracellular DNA, which serves as a structural component of the biofilms. The EPS matrix constitutes 50-90% of a biofilm’s organic matter. The purpose of the EPS matrix is to adhere the bacteria to a surface and protect the biofilm against any harsh environmental conditions. The matrix also provides a “transport system” so that nutrients, water, and enzymes can move around the structure to meet the needs of each cell.  The production of the EPS matrix is, in part, regulated by quorum sensing; this is a way for bacteria to communicate with each other via chemical signalling molecules. Like a “quorum”, once there are enough bacteria, the bacteria are able to communicate with each other to collectively express a gene, in this is case they would be producing the EPS.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a physical disruption of E. coli cells using heat and sonication followed by solvent based extraction of internal free amino acids. This method is useful for extraction of internal amino acids from numerous and multiple samples.
TD: Did you also measure the composition of your cultivation media to know how much of the produced amino acids are exported? If you did, can you suggest a method to use here as well?
Sh: I was using minimal media for all my experiments and during the chemical analysis of my samples for amino acid quantification I always used asterile control media. This was especially important because minimal media contains ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source and the NH-group here interferes with LC-MS measurements. More specifically because we were derivatizing (using FMOC to basically label the amino groups to make it detectable in the machine) the samples prior to amino acid quantification and we had to add excess reagent to first nullify the NH-groups already present in blank minimal media.
TD: We are working on a co-culture with different organism classes. Did you use organisms other than E. coli and what are your experiences?
Sh: We used Acinetobacter baylyi in the cross-feeder cocultures with E. coli. A. baylyi is a gram negative soil dwelling bacteria hence not very different from E. coli in terms of amino acid biosynthetic pathways and lab cultivation. It was however tricky to introduce the auxotrophic and over-production mutations in A. baylyi as compared to E. coli. This (genetic manipulation) I think is the biggest hurdle in organisms that are less established than E. Coli, followed by finding the right media that supports the growth of all partners.
TD: What do you think are the advantages of co-cultures and co-cultivation in general?
Sh: I think co-culture and co-cultivation approaches can give us a lot more information about bacterial behaviour than isolation based techniques. By culturing bacteria with other organisms we introduce a factor in its environment that can result in a number of reactions or interactions, both positive and negative. Hence such techniques can lead to novel compounds being produced by the involved bacteria.
TD: Thank you very much, for your precious advice and time. You helped us a lot!"

Figure 27: A thin layer of polysiloxane works as a gasket. The easiest way to apply it is by using a syringe.
To print out the cell, a 3D printer which can print on a base area of at least 8 cm x 8 cm is needed. Many universities already own 3D printers. Hackerspaces, which today exist in many cities, may also have one. As a third option, it is possible to upload the files to an online 3D-printing service and buy the prints.  To ensure E. coli can live inside the fuel cell, we recommend using PLA or ABS plastics for printing. It might be necessary to drill through the bores for the M3 threaded rods depending on the precision of the 3D printer. In order to make the system air tight, a roughly 0.3 mm thick layer of polysiloxane should be spread on the skid of the four parts (see Figure 27). If there is no need to use the tube connectors, they can be sealed using polysiloxane as well.
Carbon-based materials are the cheapest option for electrode materials. For more information on these materials see the anode and cathode sections. The cheapest available material for the proton exchange membrane is a pig’s bladder, which can likely be acquired for free from a local butcher. However, commercial proton exchange membranes like DuPont’s Nafion N117 Membrane will probably deliver better results. With prices of about 3€ per fuel cell, these are quite expensive though. Finally, wires are needed to tap the electrodes. Silver-coated copper wire is cheap and delivers good results.

Lab Safety
Under standard Workplace Health & Safety guidelines, prior to entering the lab for the first time, team members were given a safety induction. This outlined both appropriate laboratory behaviour and laboratory safety features such as: the location of emergency showers; eyewash stations; fire and chemical extinguishers; fire blankets; and emergency power shut off points. All team members wore appropriate personal protective equipment upon entry into the laboratory, which consisted of a lab coat, enclosed sturdy footwear, safety glasses, and tied back hair (where applicable). No eating or drinking occurred within the laboratory and all wet lab work was conducted within the laboratory.
A laboratory technician, academic advisor, or staff member, was always present when any wet lab work was being conducted within the laboratory, and all team members were briefed on the operation of certain pieces of equipment prior to their usage. All potentially hazardous biological substances was disposed of into relevant waste and biohazardous material bins, and benches were cleaned down with ethanol to disinfect them at the end of the day, or after the completion of our experiments. We used designated fridges and freezers for storing our biological products and used biosafety cabinets when diluting H2 gas producing, Hydrogen Gas Production Gene Cluster cultures down to a concentration required for Clark electrode measurements.

Project Safety
The E. coli DH5α strain (a K-12 derivative) that we have modified (or engineered) is classified under Australian Law as a safe strain as host genes cannot be transferred and is unlikely to mutate. The Escherichia coli is a knockout strain from the human gut microbiome and would require additional nutrients to grow in the environment freely (the addition of thiamine and leucine), and it has no pathogenesis factors classifying it as a biosafety level 1 organism (BSL-1).
The genes we have added are from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and are therefore not readily found throughout the environment in plants, algae, and other bacteria. These genes would not give rise to a resistance or survival advantage, because they have been engineered"

A. Both a positive and a negative control would be supplied with the device. The negative control would be a plate that was identical to all other receptacles except that it would contain no bacterial culture and thus would also function as a reference measurement. The positive control would be a source of light such as an LED which would give a reliable intensity and wavelength of light. The light source should be of a very low light level so that it would be consistent with the level of light produced by the luciferase. The latter could be built in to future versions of the L.A.S.S.O.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DS"

European Union – “Synthetic biology is the engineering of biological components and systems that do not exist in nature and the re-engineering of existing biological elements; it is determined on the intentional design of artificial biological systems, rather than on the understanding of natural biology.”
Dutch COGEM – “Synthetic biology focuses on the design and synthesis of artificial genes and complete biological systems and on changing existing organisms, aimed at acquiring useful functions.”
Jay Keasling – “The development of well characterized biological components that ban be easily assembled into larger functioning devices and systems to accomplish many particular goals.”
Steven Benner & Michael Sismour  – “Synthetic biologists come in two broad classes. One uses unnatural molecules to reproduce emergent behaviours from natural biology, with the goal of creating artificial life. The other seeks interchangeable parts from natural biology to assemble into systems that function unnaturally.”
Berkeley University – “The design and construction of biological parts, devices and systems and the redesigning of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes.”
Only by looking at these examples, one can observe that what is meant with the term “synthetic biology” involves different things. Therefore, it is probably more appropriate to speak of the “field of synthetic biology” combining different life science related technologies, rather than classify it as a single technology in itself. At least, one can claim that synthetic biology encompasses constructing and deconstructing biological processes of “life”, with life in different gradations of naturalness or artificialness. Exactly this suffix, which states that there are several levels of what is considered natural or artificial (synthetic), implies that perception and hence ethical considerations related to the autonomy of life are important topics to consider in the field of synthetic biology. How synthetic can biology actually be? To what extent can biology be engineered? To give at least some answers to these questions in the following paragraphs, one must first analyze which risks are concerned in synthetic biology. These are described in the next paragraph.
3.2 Risks related to synthetic biology: bioerror or bioterror?
As is probably the case with any “new” technology, besides a number of new applications synthetic biology also comes with a number of new risks. In this paragraph, the term “risk” is introduced first. Hereafter, risks associated with new technologies like synthetic biology are mentioned. Finally, risks associated with open source technology  are brought up.
3.2.1 Risks and risk perception

BBa_K1132016: Promoter (OmpR, positive) followed by RFP protein generator and Cph8 (Cph1/EnvZ fusion) under TetR repressible promoter
Chimeric Cph1 light receptor/EnvZ protein requires phycocyanobilin (PCB) biosynthetic genes for PCB formation (ho1 and PcyA). The exposure to red light (660nm) inhibits the activity of the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. In the dark, the EnvZ histidine kinase phosphorylates endogenous OmpR, a transcription factor which activates transcription from the OmpC promoter. This part must be used in E.coli deficient in wild-type EnvZ.
The promoter p(TetR) is constitutively on and repressed by TetR (Part:BBa_P0440). TetR binds to the p(TetR) and inhibits its operation. It regulates Cph8 (Part:BBa_K1132015) production. Tetracycline or aTc (anhydrotetracycline) binds to TetR and allows Cph8 production.
This part is an intermediate Biobrick for the characterisation of the red light responsive system (Part:BBa_K1132017) with the RFP protein as output. The monomeric RFP is a Red Fluorescent Protein with an excitation peak at 584 nm and an emission peak at 607 nm. The RFP is positively regulated by OmpR-controlled promoter. Phosphorylated OmpR binds to the operator sites and activates transcription of RFP.

Marketing and Outreach for June 3rd 2009
Today, our iGEM Calgary team was interviewed by the CTV news courtesy of Shelly Makrugin. In her story she covered areas such as what iGEM is, what is synthetic biology, what is our project this year and what could be the potential applications of our project. The most important thing that excited her was our competition against teams such as Harvard and Stanford.
Since I was leading our iGEM Calgary team at the Campus Fair, I started making preparations for the campus fair.

Working with the Listen Event
Everything has to be added into chat so answers to questions are entered into the chat window, which I do not really like since mistakes are easy to make and I also keep communicating with a black board that uses one of the channels I am using as well.
Learned about the listen event:
Uses channels and messages and keeps track of a avatar’s id so this will be very useful for: Giving out inventory, dividing messages up
Cycle of the PCR are complete now and an amplified piece of DNA, which is rezzed beside it and can be taken into the avatar’s inventory to be used for something else later on like running a gel.

Zhejiang Province Distribution
According to the above result, Zhejiang is one of the most regions of termite occupation and plagued by them.
Harmful Dominant Species
Around the World
2013 reported in the literature, 371 destructive termite species occupy 12.5% of current total species. Among them, 104 species such as Coptotermes formosanus; Coptotermes rhinotermitidae; Cryptotermes domesticus; Cryptotermes dudley are harmful dominant and subdominant species, which occupies 3.5% of the total numbers.
Mainland China
In mainland China, Coptotermes formosanus is the kind of species doing harm to housing constructions even on 20 floors; woods; communication facilities ect.
Zhejiang Province
As for urban housing, Reticulitermes speratus is the main species followed by Coptotermes formosanus. As for rural country housing and landacaping， Coptotermes formosanus is the main species.
Taking factors of distribution and dominant damage into account,
we choose Coptotermes formosanus as our major target to control terminate.
Damage of Termite
Termites feed on woods, and can digest lignocellulose. When they feed on housing construction, landscaping and other commercial products, they become economic pests.
These are the following characteristics of damage:
Overview
The harm that termites bring to human mainly reflects in two aspects. One is that termites take materials rich in lignocellulose as food, which causes property damage to human beings. It is reported that, the direct loss induced by termites is beyond 220 billion dollars per year. The other is that, the holes left by termites crawling could affect the integrity and security of buildings, dams and trees. What‘s more, the hazards caused by termites to communal facilities such as large reinforced concrete bridges, gas lines, are frequently reported these years. It really influences public safety and people‘s life in a negative way.
Concealment
Because of the photophobic habit of termites, they always move in a covert condition. It often takes a long time from termites invasion to being discovered. The special hazardous way of termites makes people ignore their invasion at the early time. But once been discovered, they usually have caused a certain financial loss or major accidents. This habit also makes termites one the city pests, which are the most difficult and expensive to control.

Modeling
The fascinating properties of pattern creating bacteria can be translated into                         the language of mathematics. In this subsection we investigate the                         equations behind the behavior of the genetically modified organisms created in                         the wetlab. For this purpose, a layered approach seems appropriate. Colony level modeling employs                         partial differential equations to describe large cell groups which are treated                         as a continuum. Internal level models describe the interactions that happen                         within single cells. Finally the hybrid model merges the two approaches into a                         final description of our pattern forming cells.
Colony
Our colony layer model relies on a Keller-Segel type system of partial differential                                         equations. These equations are simulated using finite differences.
Hybrid
The hybrid model represents an intermediate level of detail in between the colony level model and the internal model. Bacteria are treated as individual agents, while chemical species are modeled using partial differential equations.
Internal
Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.
FBA (Toulouse)
As a part of our modeling cooperation we exchanged models with the Toulouse                                         team. This is the flux balance analysis they performed for us.

The Filter Issue
Filters are widely used in everyday life and within the lab. Filters, such as Brita filters for removing calcium and other contaminants from drinking water and plumbing systems are abundant. In the lab, filters (here usually refered to as columns) are used for DNA/protein purification and for protein characterization.
Fig. 1: Filters for different applications.
Synthetic beads
Such filters usually consist of a cartridge that is filled with some type of matrix which determines the function of the filter. To maximize the surface in a minimal volume, microbeads are commonly used in all types of filters. These beads have a specific size and can for example be used to display protein on their surface. The coupling of proteins to the beads is based on affinity binding. An example are Ni-NTA resins (or beads) that can be used to bind proteins that harbour a His-tag. If a protein is bound this way to the beads, its features then determine the functional properties of such protein-loaded beads.
Such beads are usually quite expensive and coupling of proteins to the beads is laborious, as the protein has to  be expressed, bound to the beads and then washed. Additionally, the binding of the protein is non-covalent.
SynBio beads
To solve this problem, we have developed a synthetic biology solution in our project Beadzillus, in which biological beads display a protein of choice. We call these biological beads Sporobeads.
But what are our biological beads made of? Using clever natural engineering millions of years ago, evolution developed endospores of the soil bacteria Bacillus"

This device also contains a generator of red fluorescent protein (RFP) controlled by the cstA promoter. PcstA is induced by cAMP, which makes it usable as a reporter system for our bacterial two-hybrid system. When using a cyaA-deficient strain, red colonies will form when a protein-protein interaction occurs.
In our project we worked with the three target proteins: carbon storage regulator A, CsrA, ( BBa_K1638037 ), the RNase adaptive protein, Yhbj, ( BBa_K1638038 ) and the RNA-binding protein, Hfq. ( BBa_K1638039 ).
Figure 3: Modified peptide aptamer Device: Peptide aptamer-scaffold fused to the T18 domain through intein and a flexible linker.
Our device with T18 domain is our peptide aptamer device. It contains the human thioredoxin (hTrx)-based peptide aptamer conjugated to the T18 domains through a flexible linker. The device is controlled by the strong hybrid promoter PLlacO-1. Reference: Lutz R, Bujard H.

[PubMed]
The hTrx-scaffold contains a XhoI restriction site that enables insertion of a random nucleotide library. The resctrion site is situated in the active site of hTrx leaving it functionless when a library is inserted. The design of this peptide aptamer is inspired by Borghouts C. et al..

    Thirdly, we fight together. University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire summer vacation in the lab for their project and force their ways out towards light and truth together. A day usually started with two teams’ early morning greetings at the building hall and ended up with “good bye” in the evening. The way back to dorm listened the bitter and sweet they shared with each other. What a great scene we created. What a goal we have been always chasing after.

    In Nanjing, we shared our project ideas with several teams coming from different parts of China at the BUDS conference and got some really awesome feedback, and each of the attendees is highly experienced at and dedicated to iGEM. In addition to us, the representatives from the iGEM teams of SJTU, NJU, SYSU and TJU etc. attended this meeting.
Fig.3 The students present at the meeting having a lively discussion
    During the two-day-long discussion, we thoroughly exchanged our perspectives on almost every aspects on preparation for iGEM. We shared the ideas of our projects this year first. We then had a share in the experience of team construction, project design, human practice, cultivating new teammates and source obtainment. We gained a lot of practical advice on overcoming the difficulties of these terms, which we had met and we would meet. Team Fudan provided us with literature concerning cell sensing and response behavior they came across before, which they thought might help us. Also, we were inspired to visit a video game company, for example, to ask the professional for advice, which did motivate us to adjust our game to be more fascinating.

A3: Let’s categorize them into three kinds. The first one is slow cracks: they happened slowly and infect long term; second is structural cracks: this kind of cracks happens when there is unexpected struck; Third is the cracks come from expansion and contraction. When they stir the concrete water will react with it and start to heat. So when it cools down, there will be cracks from contraction. If the crack is less than 2mm, we will brush a closing layer on the surface. If it is bigger than 2mm, we will use high pressure to pump the Inorganic cement or other kind of adhesive into the cracks which we call concrete injection.
Q4：How do you detect the micro cracks?
A4: There are many techniques being used around the world nowadays. For example, high definitions photograph.
Q5：What do you think of our project this year?
A4: It certainly represent the future, it can be used on many aspects of multiple constructions. I just wish that this doesn’t stop in the lab. I hope it can be put into use as soon as possible.
Research and questionnaire on buildings in the village
To further consider the feasibility of our idea applying into human life, we set off for some traditional village asking for their feedback. On September 23th and 24th, 2017, we visited Chendian Village, Chaonan District, Shantou, Guangdong, and conducted surveys, questionnaires, interviews to the local resident. See the QUESTIONAIRE here.
According to the questionaire, many residents here still keep the traditional layout and ornament. In addition to the living place for a dozen of people, a family will also leave special rooms for ancestor and God worship. Chaoshan people have their own unique understanding about family and clan, which is sometimes expressed in their houses. Generally, they hope the house built by themselves can be passed down from generation to generation, yet they also worry about the house quality. Due to the climate and terrain conditions, the residences built with traditional techniques are easy to have cracks on the walls. According to our investigation, cracks occur on nearly 60 percent of the houses, and even on those built three years ago.
When we introduced those new material to them, they were absolutely delighted. Some people think that this project is awesome because it not only makes restoration but also achieves “prevention”, which gives them much sense of security. Others realize that it is a combination of society"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

The electrophoresis showed the expected length of the transformed DNA for all the clones.
Miniprep of the BW25141 and BW23474 strains transformed with <partinfo>BBa_K300008</partinfo> yielded a DNA concentration of ~20 ng/ul (qualitatively comparable with medium copy number plasmids) and ~90-100 ng/ul (qualitatively comparable with high copy number plasmids). The results shown in the table above also show that the R6K plasmid in pir+ and pir-116 strains was transformed with the same efficiency as the pSB*** positive control plasmid, demonstrating that the R6K origin doesn't give any handicap in plasmid transformation. So, the BW25141 and BW23474 strains can be successfully used to propagate the integrative vector after the excision of the pUC19-derived high copy replication origin, present in the default insert <partinfo>BBa_I52002</partinfo>.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," mature engineering clades, models simplify the real work and facilitate design in ideal conditions. Other models then evaluate the proposed designs more thoroughly and either send the designers back to the drawing board or to the test bench; that is the essence of our design approach: a progressive dance where modelling and design come ever closer together.
A. THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF THE CIRCUIT
Wet Lab Input
The sequences of the plasmids used for the construction of the cell-type classifier between HeLa cells and healthy cells described in [ 4 ] were kindly provided by Prof. Xie. We've used these plasmids as a starting point to “detach” three different mammalian promoters, four different protein coding regions and two polyA signals-terminators, codon-optimize them in order to make them BioBrick compatible and order them for de novo gene synthesis. Analytically:
1. Promoters
-CMV (strong constitutive promoter from the human cytomegalovirus)
-TRE (inducible tetracycline response element promoter)
-CAGop (strong hybrid CAG promoter followed by an intron with two LacO sites [ 2 ]
2. Protein Coding Regions
-rtTA (reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator by fusing rTetR with VP16, utilized in Tet-On systems) [ 10 ]
-LacI (DNA-binding transcription factor that binds to LacO sites)
- Transcriptional repressor
-DsRed (Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein)
-Apoptin
3.  polyA signals & terminators (include the motif AAUAAA which promotes both polyadenylation and termination)
-SV40 polyA
-rbGlob polyA*
*Next to the rbGlob polyA (upstream) there is a sequence coding for a synthetic miRNA, targeting a region of firefly luciferase [ 11 ]. It is a post-transcriptional repressor, named FF4.
As a result, using these Basic Parts , a large number of circuit topologies can be envisioned.
Dry Lab Input
There is an ongoing debate regarding the choice of using transcriptional repressors (LacI) that act as a roadblock to RNA Polymerase or posttranscriptional repressors (FF4 and other synthetic intronic miRNAs) that act by a completely different mechanism by mRNA degradation. Experimental evidence [ 4 ] support the combination of transcriptional and post-trascriptional repression as a boost in circuit performance. However, we wanted to proceed to"

Part K1228002 is designed by our team. It is a rabies virus strain ERA glycoprotein coding sequence. The glycoprotein is the main protective antigen of rabies virus which can induce the body to produce neutralizing antibody.
2.For the moving question
In order to know whether the modified B.subtilis can be regurgitated by flea, two experiments are designed One is to feed flea using modified B.subtilis that can express GFP. This design is to know whether the flea can eat bacillus subtilis that colonizes in the proventricular. Another goal is to test whether the bacteria can make flea vomit.
Fig. 2.shows the genetic circuit of GFP device. Promoter Veg is a constitutive promoter that constitutively expresses the P43 protein in bacillus subtilis .It was designed by iGEM08_Imperial_college. The rest is a GFP generator designed by Igem08_UNIPV-Pavia.
Notice: We stopped this experiment because of safety reason. We haven’t found safe flea to achieve this experiment. Although we currently cannot provide experimental data to solve this question, we are ready to provide a complete experiment protocol and the devices needed in the experiment. In the future, when we make sure it is safe enough to release flea, we will cooperate with professional institutes to finish it.
3.For the safety question
A certain number of infectious bacteria carried by flea will cause potential risks which are hard to control, so broad spectrum Antimicrobial Peptides have been designed as secreted protein to kill those infectious bacteria such as Yersinia pestis.
Fig. 3.a shows the genetic circuit of the device secreting Human Lysozyme in bacillus subtilis. Part K541501 contains constitutive promoter veg(K143012), Ribosome Binding Site spoVG(K143021) and signal peptide SacB. iGEM11_FAGEM designed this part and it worked very good in B.subtilis. Part K122800 was designed by our team. Human lysozyme (hLZ) exhibits microbicidal activity to various degrees against several bacterial strains.
Fig. 3.b shows the genetic circuit of the device secreting Lactoferrin in B.subtilis. This protein has a broad spectrum of anti-infection and anti-inflammatory function.

Therefore, we went to Lund in the beginning of the summer to present our project idea for the other Nordic iGEM teams at the annual Nordic iGEM Conference. This was also a great opportunity to meet other teams and discuss problems. On the conference we presented our project during a poster session and a presentation and got valuable feedback from the judges and our newly found peers.
Almedalen 2018
Almedalen is the biggest political event in Sweden, hosted annually for the past 50 years with 4311 different events during 8 days. It is a summer hotspot for politicians and companies, with 45 000 people joining together for open discussions about the future of society. Facing election year in Sweden, we felt that it was important to go there and ask people what they think about synthetic biology and Biotic Blue. The Human Practices team got a lot of insight in how people outside research may think about Biotic Blue, and how important it is to be transparent in the iGEM work. Specifically, we found our conversation with the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) interesting. Their task is to deal with all the radioactive waste from nuclear power plants in Sweden in a safe way. We discussed the importance of inviting the society to the discussion of how different technologies are used. We also talked about safety and how important the trust from the community is when using new technologies. We left Almedalen thinking about the main purpose of evolving and creating new solutions, and what industries that need to be thought of when going from ideation to implementation.
Global Impact Day
We were invited to attend the Global Impact Day with focus on Environmental Awareness in Kista (Stockholm), hosted by the AlMaghrib Institute. The AlMaghrib Institute works for premier Islamic education and has branches all over the world. The same event was held on several locations on the same day. At the event, we got to educate the public about the problems and danger that we are faced with if not treating pharmaceuticals in wastewater. We got to show the community what a group of 20 students can do together with synthetic biology, and how they can contribute to solve a persistent problem in line with iGEM guidelines.
The team talked about:
Creating awareness about the problem of pharmaceuticals in wastewater
Introduce the synthetic biology approach on a basic level that we have worked on (enzyme engineering and its implementation with our experimental work and product design)

Furthermore, as part of our outreach directed at university students, we combined our recruitment campaign for an IT whiz to help with our wiki, with a presentation on what iGEM was all about. We lecture bashed over several weeks, presenting over 11 times.
For general public
After promoting the iGEM competition to the Victorian State Chair of National Science Week (NSW) - Nick Besley, our team decided to field a stall in ‘Market of the Mind’ – a NSW event aimed at the general public located in a high foot traffic area alongside the Yarra River in Southbank across the river from Flinders St Station. Luckily, our stall was located next to the bar, which meant there was a lot of foot traffic directed to our happy team members wearing our iGEM team t-shirts.
Using a true/false quiz, armed with Ferrero Rochers as rewards for getting all the answers correct, we had over 30 quiz contestants engage with us on the first night and 35+ contestants on the second day.

Intellectual Property
Our team considered the question of ‘how should we proceed if we want to retain IP rights on our project’?
Before attempting to answer this pertinent IP question, our team leader decided to recruit two more team members who had some intellectual property experience to complement the learning on patent law that a few early team members had acquired in their biotechnology undergraduate degrees. Both the new team members had previously filed provisional patents; one had filed some in Russia and the other in Australia, offering two perspectives on this question of IP.
In answering this question, we approached our universities’ tech transfer office to gain clarity over our team’s discussions and brainstorm sessions on whether our project was patentable.
The tech transfer office advised us that our project may have commercial applications, however it was probably too soon to act on the idea and convert it into a provisional patent, so"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

For control tests, either 50ul of protein or 10µl of either mRNA added alone
Cells were live imaged on an inverted confocal fluorescence microscope using a 10X objective 3 hours after treatment. The slides were illuminated with a 488 nm laser and images were collected through a filter set used for detecting EGFP emission.
After live imaging, the cells were fixed on the chambered slides with 4% PFA for 20 minutes and coverslipped with Vectashield containing DAPI to image nuclei. The fixed cells were imaged on a confocal microscope.
Results
Neither imaging sessions were able to detect green fluorescence beyond background fluorescence.
Improvements
Longer incubation time: While it has been observed that treatment of cell cultures with naked mRNA encoding fluorescent proteins results in detectable fluorescent as early as 2 hours post treatment (Leonhardt et. al., 2014), it is possible that encapsulation of mRNA in a protein nanocompartment would result in delayed translation. We will attempt this test again with longer incubation times to see if this is the case.
More mRNA: the cells were only ~60% confluent, and each well was treated with only 1 µg of mRNA. As we did not see Clover expression, even in the naked mRNA It is possible that the cells did not receive enough mRNA to produce detectable amounts of Clover protein. We will increase the amount of mRNA added
Modified encapsulation: it is possible that the methods used here (vortexing ArcMin protein and heat treating ArcMin protein and Clover mRNA) may not have disrupted the ArcMin PNC, preventing the Clover mRNA from entering the PNC. It is also possible that the ArcMin proteins may not have reformed PNCs after these approaches to disruption. Going forward, we will express the ArcMin protein and translate Clover mRNA in the same cell. This way, the mRNA is available for encapsulation as the ArcMin PNCs are being formed.
mRNA capping: Mammalian mRNAs must be poly-adenylated on the 3’ end and have a 5’ cap in order for translation to be initiated. In-vitro transcription with T7 polymerase can produce poly-adenylated.

Sinorhizobium
We pursued two types of transformation into rhizobia: conjugation and electroporation. While our conjugation efficiencies of the desired pKT230 plasmid into E. coli were very high (~90%), our conjugation was inconclusive in rhizobium because many of our strains had several innate antibiotic resistances and thus there was growth on the negative controls. However, once we optimized our electroporation protocols by adjusting centrifugation speeds, antibiotic concentrations, and electroporation voltages and pulses, we were able to successfully transform our plasmids of interest into rhizobia.

Selection
Cyanobacterium
PCC7002 was found to be susceptible to all antibiotics tested around standard E. coli concentrations, though light-sensitive antibiotics (tetracycline and rifampicin) were less effective due to degradation in light-saturated growth chambers. Click on the links below to see the growth curves for PCC7002 samples grown in different concentrations of tested antibiotics.

Sinorhizobium
Our main selection for transformation was antibiotic resistance. Before conducting electroporations, it was important to establish the innate resistances in our rhizobial strains by doing antibiotic resistance assays, both on plates and in liquid cultures. We observed that resistances changed depending on the growing media (Tryptic Soy Broth vs. LB) and conditions (liquid vs. plate). Our selection for the incorporation of LIC plasmids was sucrose.

mutS Gene Knockout
We successfully obtained mutS knockout genotypes of PCC7002 by transforming linear fragments for homologous recombination. Presumably due to the polyploidy of PCC7002 cells, however, we did not obtain homozygous ∆mutS mutants; doing so will require several more rounds of growth and plating for single colonies.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.
This will be a title
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Air Force Research Laboratory
We also discussed our project with Dr. Naik, a chief scientist at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL),  who provided us with feedback on our project and valuable background information. Dr. Wendy Goodson from AFRL was also able to supply us with isolates of fungi and bacteria from actual biofuel fuel tanks, which allowed us to design our microbe to target specifically the organisms found in fuel tanks. For example, we were able to use Psuedomonas aeruginosa as a target for our detect mechanism since we knew it was found in fuel tanks, and we were able to test our destroy mechanism on one of the fungal isolates, Yarrowia lipolytica. Additionally, Dr. Goodson also supplied us with a number of pictures of biofilms, fuel tanks, and pipes, along with a scanning electron microscope image of a biofilm, all of which helped us envision the problem and develop our solution.

Meeting with Mike Turner
We were able to reach out and contact Mike Turner, the U.S. Representative for Ohio's 10th congressional district and has served that position since 2003. We were very fortunate to be able to talk to Mike Turner about our project and discuss possible legislature idea based on our research and completed project. Throughout our research, we were surprised to see how little legislature was in place and how slow the change to biofuel was because of various factors such as fouling. One of our goals established at the beginning of the project was to talk to local and state legislature in order to display our work and bring awareness to biofuels. The schedule of the day is shown below.

[Yan-Kay] “I was in a focus group last week about how education has changed from GSCE level to undergrad, and I think one of the issues we all thought was that creativity seems to decrease as you go up because most students tend to study for the sake of getting through exams. So being in an iGEM team, we have a lot more scope of different ideas and try to implement those ideas”.
[Adam] “Yeah, probably I’m more learning doing this than during my course”.
[Georgia] “Yeah, I would agree. I learned more in these last six months working on this project than I have – I’ve learned more practically like in lectures, you just try to absorb information but you never really have the chance to apply it. And here, like literally every day you’re solving problems. It’s like a nice work-out for your brain. And you never collaborate as a team. I mean, obviously you do in like research but a lot of the time being a scientist is quite a solitary role and this is like a lovely team thing where everybody bounces off each other and kind of just (…). And it’s not just science as well, we’re doing like human practice and public engagement and we get to develop our animation and web design skills. It’s just awesome! You do so much and you learn so much”!
It can be said that the operational structure of the iGEM competition thus works as an incentive to learn your scientific craft in a way that encompasses its role in relation to society. All competing teams are in the running for several awards based on the various aspects of their projects but they can also win a prize for being the best in their own project category or ‘track’. UCL iGEM 2014 competed in the Environment Track and can thus win a prize for the best environmental project (Balmer and Bulpin 2013). The incentives of the competition are shaped by the governing values as explained by Randy Rettberg at the end of last year’s jamboree: effort, accomplishment, respect (for other people involved and for the technology), cooperation (with regard to open-source science for transparency) and integrity (in being truthful about the science) (iGEM 2013b). These shape the reflexive nature of the work that has been done within the iGEM framework and enable the students expand or ‘open up’ their views on the decision-making process"

Due to covalent linkage, stringent washing can be used to achieve high purity of the recombinant protein that is subsequently released by cleavage of a designated protease.
Overall, our novel approach for protein purification is reliable and highly specific. It provides a better solution to reach high protein purity and quality by remedying many drawbacks of currently used methods.
Design
Magnetic bacteria Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium. It produces a unique organelle known as Magnetosome using iron and other metal ions. Magnetosome consists of uniform nano-sized magnetic particles (50 to 100 nm) arranged as chains in cytoplasm and embraced by a stable lipid bilayer membrane, and exhibits strong ferrimagnetism.
Fig.2 Transmission electron microscope image of (A) AMB-1 and (B) Magnetosome
Magnetosome has been used in various biomedical applications because it is easy to handle and can be used to separate target molecules from reaction mixes. Several proteins are identified to tightly bind to the membrane of Magnetosome, such as MagA, Mms16, and Mms13. Among them, Mms13 has the highest affinity to the magnetic core, and its anchoring efficiency is also better than other Mms proteins. Thus, a protein of interest can be expressed on the Magnetosome when fused with Mms13. The magnetic particles can be easily extracted and purified from bacterial lysate of AMB-1 transformant using a magnet.
Fig.3 Proteins on the Magnetosome’s membrane and AMB-1 modification by transformed with Mms13 protein.
Choosing an appropriate tag is crucial for detecting and purifying a recombinant protein. However, the interaction of tags with corresponding ligands is typically reversible and mostly has low affinity. Streptococcus pyogenes fibro-nectin-binding protein FbaB contains a domain with a spontaneous isopeptide bond between Lys31 and Asp117. This domain can be splitted into two fragments: the small one (13 amino acids) is named as Spytag, while the big one (116 amino acids) is Spycatcher. When they meet together, the two parts can specifically associate and spontaneously form an isopeptide bond. The reaction can take place in diverse conditions, even in relatively extreme pH and temperatures.

Trigger RNA-Toehold-GFP System
We aimed to show Toehold switch system’s incapability of protein expression when it is alone, which means the Trigger RNA and Toehold Switch must coexist  for protein expression. To observe  Toehold swtich’s and and Toehold Swtich-Trigger RNA’s coexisting results both, we designed Toehold switch and trigger RNA in different biobricks. Because of origin incompatibility process, we had to clone these two different gene sequences into different plasmids. Thus we cloned Toehold-GFP into ColA originated PColA plasmid, and Trigger RNA into ColE originated PSB1C3 plasmid.
The ordered form of Toehold G-blocks is shown above. We preferred to use T7 promoter, which is a very strong promoter in this gene’s design. Thus there won’t be any difficulty in Toehold-GFP RNA’s production. The RBS of GFP presented in Toehold structure. To clone Toehold-GFP sequence into PSB2C3 and pColA plasmids both, we added RFC 10 suffix region on 3’ end and RFC 10 prefix region  on 5’ end of Toehold-GFP. We also put BamHI restriction sitebetween Toehold and GFP. After GFP expression, which shows that Toehold-trigger system works, any protein could be replaced with GFP.  In our project, GFP will be replaced with TEV protease.
Trigger RNA, which turns on Toehold switch system, is shown above in its ordered form as G-Blocks. In the design of this biobrick, we used T7 promoter, which has a strong mRNA production rate. By doing these, an enough amount of Trigger RNA will be produced to open Toeholds. There is no RBS in this product, because Trigger RNA doesn’t codes a protein. Its only task is opening Toehold switch in order to produce protein. To clone Trigger RNA sequence into PSB1C3 plasmid, we added RFC10 prefix on 3’ end and RFC10 suffix on 5’ end.

Safe-by-Design
The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) challenged us to take part in their safe-by-design challenge. This challenge was about integrating safety into different phases of our project. To get started, we wrote a proposal which we discussed with RIVM experts over Skype. We got to realize that safety goes beyond technical issues and that it is important to consider safety from the initial ideation stage to the final implementation.
For this project, we broke safety down into eight different issues, which we had recognized with the help of some stakeholders and experts (see our integrated practices). Once we had identified the main issues, we consulted more experts and stakeholders to think of possible solutions. An overview of our Safe-by-Design trajectory can be found in the infographic below. The details are provided underneath.
The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.

Design trajectory
Start of the trajectory
Experts: Korienke Smit and Niek Savelkoul (RIVM)
We wrote a proposal in which we outlined our safety plans. In a subsequent Skype call, we received feedback on our proposal from two RIVM experts. Their main feedback was that we should only discuss safety in the context of our own project, rather than focusing on general safety-related topics.
Bacterial escape
Problem: We need a safe method for working with E. coli which prevents its escape into the environment.
Experts: Prof. Jan van Hest, Cécile van der Vlugt (RIVM)
Solution: Our hydrogel-adhesin system would prevent leakage. Incorporation of dependence on an artificial amino acid ensures that E. coli would not be able to survive outside the gel.
More information
As we described on the Product Design page, the risk of environmental escape limits the use                             of genetically modified organisms. Environmental escape not only is a risk that should be                             avoided out of public and environmental"

This means our dynamic model can accurately quantify the translational activity of the RBS from experimental data.
 
According to the fitting results (Fig. 3), the  dynamic model successfully approximated the behavior of our low-temperature  release system. The model equations present interesting mathematical properties  that can be used to explore how qualitative features of the genetic circuit  depend on reaction parameters. This method of dynamic modeling can be used to  guide the choice of genetic ‘parts’ for implementation in circuit design in the  future.

When cells started to divide, the plasmids are allocated into two filial cells evenly. During the lifespan of a single cell, the number of replicated plasmids obey Poisson distribution.
Assumptions
(1)The expression interval of cells $x\sim N(40, 2^2).$
(2)When cells exit expression interval, they start to divide and cease to express mRFP.
(3)When reenter expression interval, AraC's concentration would be reset to 0 and restart oscillation.
(4)The division interval of cells $x\sim N(20, 1^2).$
(5)Certain amount of cells, which is proportion to square of population, is 'sentenced' to dead in every round. They are picked randomly.
(6)AraC's concentration is proportion to plasmid copies.
(7)When cells are dividing, the plasmid copies would increase by y, and y~Pois(50), then split evenly into two filial cells when division is ended.
(8)Two filial cells would experience different division intervals.
(9)All the cell generate the same AraC's curve, whose period is 44.8 minutes and is a numeric solve of DDEs mentioned in the last section.
(10)AraC output of each cell are not synchronized in the beginning.
Results and Fitting
Fig 1.Population of bacteria against time. Average = 105180, largest difference Δ = 5667
The population of bacteria is fluctuating within a small range (5667/105180 = 0.0539) and generally steady, showing that the logistic model is feasible and this model is successfully simulating the population within microencapsulation.
Fig 2.AraC concentration of oscillating cells within microencapsulation.
The multi cells oscillation simulation suggests that even with that amount of cells, the oscillation will still exist just like a single one. We then fit this curve with our wet-lab result, which is a curve of a oscillating cells' fluorescence intensity.
We first draw the Q-Q plot between two groups of data for a explicit visual comparison to see whether further analysis is needed for determination:
In this figure, we can see that these two groups of data are quite similar. Then time dimension should be taken into consideration.
Since data from simuation and data from experiment have different unit and different period, we choose data of two periods and then have them normalized using"

Policy & Practices
During the past summer, we not only refined the technical and biological sides of Cellock Holmes but also considered other aspects of our iGEM project such as social acceptance, biosafety and economical relevance.  Will society accept the technology we develop? How can we convince skeptics that synthetic biology is safe? Does our product have economical relevance and how can we best market what we built? What is the target group that might benefit from our devices, and can we make our developments available to not only the privileged population but to everybody in the world? At the meetup of the German iGEM teams in Munich earlier this summer, we also prepared a suggestion on how to handle intellectual proporty rights on BioBricks.
These are only a few of the questions we discussed within our team. To read more about the different aspects of our Policy & Practices work, please click on a panel below:

Spreading the Idea of Synthetic Biology
How can we convince people that the technology we develop is safe to use and that the problems we tackle with our project concern everybody? Unfortunately, lots of people around the world are scared of genetically modified organisms and any application related to them. Though we believe that natural skepticism towards new and unproved technologies is not just good but especially desirable, the current fear some people encounter gene technology with is a bit disproportionate and might be counterproductive to technological and scientific advance in related fields.
However, as reported, for example, in an article published in a major local newspaper's magazine, Kölner Stadtanzeiger, the social acceptance of biotechnological products could be higher if people felt informed better and understood the underlying science. Following up"

Money does not make the world go round, energy does.The ability to effectively generate, store and conveniently access energy is the hallmark of the developed world. These systems are integral to our everyday lives including: transport, heating, industrial production, control of water supply and recreation.
The Global Energy Crisis
Fossil fuels have been the staple of energy needs throughout the 20th century. Their consumption far exceeds the rate which they can be formed and this has led theorists to predict the catastrophic economic consequences of exhausting the non-recyclable resource, culminating in theories such as the famous 'peak oil' proposition [1]. While advances in technology for gas and oil exploration and extraction have resolved the scarcity of energy resources in the short-term [2]. Furthermore our capacity to withstand the release of carbon by-products remains a pertinent challenge to our generation.
Renewable resources utilise natural energy in a sustainable, long term manner. Methods of harvesting can be direct or indirect including converting light to electricity in solar cells or harnessing the power of the wind or the waves. These characteristically produce few harmful byproducts. One of humanity's first energy sources was also renewable: the usage of biofuels, organisms that harvested solar energy and stored them as energetic organic compounds. These were burnt, and in the present time, fermented, allowing a useful conversion of solar energy to that useful for human purposes.
Solar Energy Redux: Obtaining Usable Energy
Despite the higher efficiency of direct photovoltaic conversion of photons to electrical energy, biofuels remain a relevant option.  Concerns have been raised regarding the industrial processes and hazardous materials involved in the creation of photovoltaic systems, often requiring significant fossil fuel energy to produce [3, 4]. Biofuels are cheaper, requiring less capital and energy to produce. They are self-replicating and require uncomplicated"

After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Project Abstract
Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that affects many. It affects those working around radiation facilities, as well as, those who are exposed to it due to widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor or the Chernobyl reactor. Penn State’s team project will focus on using a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to develop a robust and reliable biosensor which utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch coupled with a fast-acting reporter capable of producing an easily visible effect. We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters. Our hope is that the basis of our biological dosimeter system will prove to be an effective genetic system capable of detecting harmful levels of radiation and relaying it to those working in the field or an affected area. We envision our system to not only be useful in such applications, but also be capable of further expansion and evolution through the expanding field of synthetic biology.
.
Design
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team. Additionally a modified version of the RecA protein is introduced into the system in order to provide efficient activation of the sensor circuit. Many of the genes for detecting radiation used in this bacterial system have homologous counter-parts in Eukaryotic cells. For instance the RecA protein used in our system is part of a larger family of strand-exchange proteins involved in homologus recombination and DNA repair. Some other examples of this family include the Eukaryotic proteins Rad51 and Dcm1. For this reason it can be thought that a system similar to ours could one-day be used in self-replicating in vivo biosensors for radiation pollution bioremediation purposes and other important applications.

As science students we are often confronted with misconceptions from the public. From the meaning of genes to the explanation of molecular phenomena. Politicians and the media often depict science in a very inaccurate manner, which may be why the public is often sceptical about science and scientific progress. But it may also be to us, the scientists, to come down from our ivory tower, better public relations and communicate science in an open and comprehensible manner.
But as scientists we also must be wary and critical of our progress, as being at the forefront of technology also implies a huge ethical burden, of which we need to be aware of. So the question is not only: “Can we innovate?” but also: “Should we innovate?”
To tackle both of these points - the open exchange between science and community, as well as responding to the ethical problem of necessity – we conducted a multitude of social research and tutoring programs.
Integrated Human Practices
Chlamydial infections are easy to treat and therefore not a serious health problem in industrial countries. However, due to the lack of affordable diagnostic methods infections with chlamydia trachomatis still often lead to trachoma and blindness in developing countries. With our device we want to tackle this problem. To find out whether our applicational design is fitting for current trachoma elimination strategies in affected countries, and whether legislation would limit the use of a diagnostic device with GMOs, we started our Integrated Practices Approach. Thanks to the Synenergene grant we managed to travel to Africa and study first-hand the progress of fighting chlamydia in the field. In Malawi, which is to the south-east of Africa, we visited the BICO institute, supported by a multitude of international partners, which organizes the fight against trachoma in Malawi. Quite successfully, we might add. Our intention was in finding out whether our applicational design is fitting for current trachoma elimination strategies, and how legislation would limit the use of a diagnostical device with GMOs.
