Cambridge-JIC,2015,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ure-based mechanism for sample translation.
Although OpenScope is an upright microscope, it makes use of plastic flexure in the microscope stage to give fine control of translation along the x- and y-axis. In this respect, it uses Dr Bowman's design concepts and develops them in the context of a different microscope type. While the PiScope [5] uses the flexure mechanism for z-axis translation, this was seen as incompatible with the necessity for modularity in OpenScope. For this reason, OpenScope instead uses a more simple screw-based system for focusing up and down. For analysis of these systems, see the Specifications page.
Open-Source Hardware and Community Improvement
Based on research carried out as part of our Human Practices project, it was decided that the most appropriate license for OpenScope’s documentation would be a Copyleft license. In using a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, OpenScope’s designs have been made available to the community with the assurance that they, along with any derivative work, will remain accessible into the future. Importantly, this gives the community of ‘makers’ the freedom to modify, improve and re-distribute our designs.
As such, OpenScope has the potential to evolve over time and even diversify into different projects. Scientists and enthusiasts alike will be able to tailor both the hardware and software to their specific needs as a whole or independently. Essentially, the OpenScope project can continue long after the iGEM competition has finished.
Desktop CNC integration
When considering Stretch Goals for our project, it was recognised that removing the chassis and replacing it with the headpiece of a desktop CNC machine could provide a sample screening system. This was tested in the lab, using the Raspberry Pi camera for macro imaging. As a proof of principle, this demonstrated that because of its modular and digital nature, the potential for developing the OpenScope project in different directions is huge.
Modularity
OpenScope makes use of two key open-source hardware components, namely the Arduino [6] (a microprocessor) and the Raspberry Pi [7] (a low-cost computer). The well-developed community of ‘makers’ associated with these components, and their versatility, are directly transferable to OpenScope itself. In addition, they represent a standardised aspect of our project that is compatible with an existing (and rapidly growing) array of hardware projects and scientific equipment. Examples include Arduino-based centrifuges and spectrometers [8] as well as the RepRap 3D printer [9].
The Raspberry Pi makes OpenScope entirely digital, letting the user control and program it using specifically designed software. New software can easily be"

Summary
For antibiotic detection, most research is currently focused on real time PCR with specific probes that anneal to the antibiotic resistance genes. This method is comparable to our method, as specific primers are required per resistance. We decided to try out the Milk DNA Isolation Kit to be able to compare our boiling method with a commercially available isolation method.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," was finalized. We much appreciate that they truly dared to turn some of our ideas down, if they thought that these ideas wouldn’t result in a successful project. With ideas where they saw potential they encouraged us enormously. They have also helped us during the course of our project - for example the degradation part of our project would not have ended up being what it is without their help. We also practiced our Boston presentation and got feedback on that from them.
As we didn’t have much experience on protein production in yeast and as it was in a focal role in our project, we needed some help in planning our enzyme constructs. Alexander Frey from Aalto University turned out to be a great help in this. He helped us decide what kind of signal sequences we should have for protein secretion. He also questioned our choice to use yeast at all in the enzyme production, and made us broaden our thinking and justify our ideas. Putting a lot of thought into justifications for our choices at this point of our project turned out to be very useful, since after that, we didn’t have to regret that we should have done something in a completely different way.
If the Cyanobacteria group and professor Frey along with his group affected the degradation aspect of our project the most, Jussi Jäntti and his research group from VTT likely contributed the most to the detection part. They gave us valuable input on our thoughts of harnessing the yeast stress response, and for example commented on our transporter constructs and gave ideas on tags to facilitate the verification of its expression. They also gave us input on our results and gave ideas on possibilities to take things further, e.g. giving the idea about using flow cytometry to verify stress promoter functionality. Without them we probably wouldn’t have thought to use flow cytometry, which ended up providing important support and verification for our other results!
Even though our team had students from fields ranging from biotechnology to mathematics, there wasn’t anyone who really understood both fields well enough to have a clear idea of what modelling is like in the field synthetic biology. That’s why meeting Merja Oja, who works with modeling biological systems, was very important in the beginning of our project. After that we were able to also think about the modelling part of our project and how it could support the experimental parts of our work. We ended up creating two different models: a molecular model and a mathematical model, both on our detection system. Integrating modeling as part of our project provided interesting new challenges for our mathematicians.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," the social sciences to design experiments outside the laboratory. Therefore, the concept of the experimental knowledge society is used where the boundaries between science and society are increasingly blurred and experts collaborate with laypeople so that science is democratised beyond the laboratory. In dealing with uncertainty, this then means that ""knowledge about what is unknown can be fed into each subsequent step of an implementation to expose it to further observation and to turn recognized nonknowledge into extended knowledge""(Gross 2010: 171). In terms of governance, Zhang (2013) has also included this playful and experimental features as it being a form of art (Carlson 2010; Zhang 2013). As Randy Rettberg argues, ""iGEM is a human mechanism to bring focus"" and ""engineering biology is just playing fun. That is what we are here to celebrate at the Jamboree"" (iGEM 2013b). Team member Behzad also considered the playful and creative aspect as essential in making them learn more effectively:
""I did a placement during last summer and, I mean, you spend a lot of time in the lab but what you don’t get, you don’t get any of the planning codes. You don’t – there’s no self-directing like a case I did (…) was not “maybe you should try that”. It was more following orders rather [...] than creativity"".
The way iGEM works as a concept for education is thus quite different, giving the student the opportunity to be reflexive about what they are learning instead of being acquiescent in a learning process layed out and predetermined by conventional educators. Moreover, what some team members acknowledged about this in particular is that working on their project signified an introduction into thinking holistically about what they are doing:
[Georgia]""For my chemistry, for my degree, I’ve spent a lot of time in the lab, like four hours every day but you are literally just following a recipe. There’s no time to think about what you’re doing. You literally work on this deadline and you just try to get things done perfectly and yet you learn how to reflux without burning your stuff but you don’t know what’s going on. I mean, you don’t know what you’re doing and in this case, because you’re planning every step of the way, you know exactly why and what you’re doing"".
[Adam] ""Because you get a bigger picture"".
[Georgia] ""Yeah, a whole picture"".
This way of thinking was also felt by the team in the way that when one is immersed in the practice of synthetic biology, one gets"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Specificity_-_-_TEXT.html," thuringiensis from dead mites, as well as mutating an existing Cry toxin. For testing the potential toxins that were obtained, we employed an in vitro toxicity assay with brush border membrane vesicles made from Varroa mites. The vesicles contain fluorophores. When a Cry toxin is applied that is toxic to Varroa mites it binds the receptors on the vesicles, rupturing them and releasing the fluorophores.
In Vitro Assay
A High Throughput Method to Test Cry Toxin Activity
Cry toxins have been found to have activity towards insects of different phylogenetic orders. In short, a functional Cry protein is only active when specific binding occurs to the gut membrane of the target insect. In more detail, these receptors have been found in the gut epithelium cells, where the Cry proteins polymerize binding to its membrane receptor forming pores. After the formation of these ion channels, the osmotic pressure is disturbed resulting in cell death of the target host 1, 2 .
Although a number of Cry toxins have been (partly) characterized, a toxin specific to Varroa destructor has yet to be found. For this reason, we developed an in vitro toxicity test in order to be able to efficiently screen Cry toxins on their activity against V. destructor. From the V. destructor, Brush Border Membrane Vesicles (BBMV's) were made and loaded with the fluorophore 6-carboxyfluorescein to test the pore formation ability of Cry proteins, see Figure 1a. As a proof of principle, BBMV's from the gut of Tenebrio molitor were made and loaded with 6-carboxyfluorescein to test the pore formation ability of Cry3Aa, which is known to be toxic to T. molitor larvae 3, 4 .
Figure 1. Schematic overview of the function of the in vitro assay to the activity of Cry proteins. (a) When active Cry toxins are mixed with BBMV's incorporated with fluorophores , (b) they will bind to their receptors and create pores into the membrane. (c) The thereby induced leaking of fluorophores results in an increase in fluorescence.
BBMV's are composed of phospholipid double layers originating from midgut membrane cells. This membrane therefore should also contain the membrane proteins of the midgut membrane.  After incorporation of 6-carboxyfluorescein into the BBMV's the presence of an active Cry toxin can principally be detected as followed: the Cry toxins will bind to their"

09:30 start to try tie up loose ends on initial ideas before the 14:00 meeting with team advisors. Okay, so the 09:30 start went slightly less to plan than we'd hoped, ranging from a few members arriving bright and breezy to those not so bright and breezy ones (Matt ""12pm"" ford). That aside the morning consisted of drawing up ideas for parts needed for desalination (e.g. ion channels or the 'bacman system' created by Newcastle University). Further work on Sheffield iGEM 2008 was made. We're now in the hope of modifying the system with an easier reporter (e.g. those used by Cambridge 2009's E.chromi). This could potentially give rise to a universal pathogen detector E.coli, with various colour outputs depending on the pathogen present. There is potential to engineer this system in B.subtillus as a proof of principle project to produce a dry, portable biosensor for pathogens. Following lunch at Interval, we met up with advisors fearing a grilling. Overall however, our hard work appears to have paid off, with all ideas appearing realistic within the 10 weeks (except using fuel cells for desalination, which Greg is having a further look into for us). We're now going to further research the ion channels that might make desalination possible. Improving Sheffield 2008's project was very popular at the meeting - many ideas have now been born from this, so full steam ahead at looking for biobricks tomorrow. Post-grilling we took some nice photos to go up on here and visited the molecular biology and biotechnology labs with Qaiser. We finished off the day with a round of drinks at the University Arms where we talked about the 1000000 keyrings Steve's ordering, Nii's gloves and performing our Jamboree presentation through the medium of dance.
Quotes of the day:

Modelling sub-team formed. Currently we do not know if our method of using ferritin to identify and separate DNA of interest will be successful. I was in charge of finding alternative reporter genes that will indicate the presence of DNA of interest. Specifically Lisa and Rai came up a list of interesting and widely used reporter genes that I should look in to, in the hope that eventually a differential equation based model can be developed. The differential model would help us predict their signal strength for any given input conditions of cells etc. This week I mostly did qualitative research, where I found out how the genes work, what equipment is needed, and started on learning their kinetics.
Those reporter genes can be divided into two categories: enzymes or proteins. β-galactosidase, luciferase and horseradish peroxidase all report promoter activities by reacting with a substrate that will either emit light or undergo color change. I have found that between the two enzymes luciferase has superior sensitivity and linear response range over GFP and β-glactosidase (Nakajima and Ohmiya, 2010). On the other hand GFP, FRET and BRET behave similarly but themselves don't catalyze substrates. GFP is able to fluoresces on its own. For FRET two things (nanoparticles or FPs) acting as donor/acceptor are required; when they are close enough and an external source provides excitement, the donor transfer light received to acceptor which emits a different light (Piston and Kremers, 2007). BRET is"

This device mean to test feasibility of N/P comparator,replacing Nitrate,Phosphate inputs by IPTG,aTc.
Small RNA Spot42 controls the GFP mRNA translation by blocking the RBS in galK.The galK and E0040 is fused together using ClaI site to avoid stop condon in standard scar.J23106 is a moderate promotor,and galK’s RBS is a moderate one.
Spot42 sRNA is under control of aTc inducible device,the buffer RNA SrlA is under control of IPTG inducible device.
Spot42 ( BBa_K737058 )is a multitarget small RNA that mediates the discoordinate expression of the E.coli galactose operon and other sugar metabolic pathway,such as galK,nanC,ytfJ,srlA,which are the 5’ leader sequence of the corresponding metabolic enzymes.
Take galK for example,Spot42 causes translation repression by base pairing to RBS in the 5’ leader sequence,then block the recognition of the antiSD sequence on 30S subunit. It’s a very strong pairing(up to 20bases),but it only causes 2.6 fold repression according to Johannes H. Urban and Jo¨ rg Vogel,for it doesn’t result in the degradation of the RNA complex by RNaseE(ssRNA degradation) and RNaseIII(dsRNA degradation),both of them are major enzymes that causes RNA degradation in vivo.Spot42-galK complex degrades in a slow and presently unclear way. The base pairing is initiated by the recognition of seed region,which plays a significant role in the repression efficiency.

BBa_J364100 is a bicistronic design element (BCD2) that functions as a more controllable                 device to control translation comparing to prokaryotic RBS that may not be functionable with different coding                 sequences. In BCD, by ribosomes binding to the SD core sequence (SD1), the leader peptide will be synthesized,                 it gives SD1-directed ribosomes that recognizes and initiates translation via another SD site (SD2), following                 that, GOI (gene of interest) will be expressed.

GFP coding device
This biobrick was used as a reporter for our donor cells during the conjugation. We chose to work with Bba_E0840 because it contained a weak RBS, and so it wouldn’t weaken the transcription of essential genes and/or of our low copy           conjugation plasmid.
Figure 1: GFP coding device
This device is composed of two subparts:
LacI regulated promoter Bba_R0010
This promoter comes from the Lac operon. It’s a strong promoter in absence of the expressed LacI gene. If this gene is expressed, the LacI protein can be inhibited by lactose or his non metabolizable homolog, IPTG.
GFP generator Bba_E0840 Bba_R0010
This part consists in a weak RBS ( Bba_B0030 ) ), a GFP gene ( Bba_E0040 ) and two terminators ( Bba_B0010 , Bba_B0012 ).

RFP Reporter – Receiver Cells
As a proof of concept, our idea was to target a gene encoding for a red fluorescent protein carried on a low copy plasmid in the recipient cells. Those plasmids were available in the iGEM 2018 DNA distribution kit as a composite part.
To perform our experiments, we studied three parts with different resistance genes :
pSB4C5 - J04450
pSB4K5 - J04450
pSB4A5 - J04450
Figure 3: RFP reporter plasmid design used in receiver strains
We further characterized the pSB4K5_J04450 system by studying its lifetime in DH5α. This allowed us to study whether the fluorescence loss was due to the natural loss of the plasmid or the cut made by our CRISPR Cas9 system.

They are able to tolerate deadily UV radiation and osmotic rays [18] , as well as the almost complete dehydration by switching to ‘anhydrobiotic state’, which confer resistance towards various environmental extremes.
What’s worth mentioning is that, anhydrobiotic ability is observed in various invertebrates, tardigrades, arthropods, and nematodes [14] . Trehalose are suggested to have an important role mediating desiccation resistance in anhydrobiotic organisms, however, the accumulation of trehalose is observed when the last two phylum subjected to desiccation, but not in tardigrades [15,16] . With further searching, we noticed that tardigrades’ anhydrobiotic ability are mediated by a rather novel class of protein called TDPs (tardigrades intrinsically disorded proteins)----the protein that our iGEM team is currently focusing on.
About our project
a) Inspiration
Every year, iGEM competition motivates teams from all over the world to devise numerous great project, genetically engineered organisms are designed to serve in wide range of fields. However, when it comes to application, the regulation of gene expression is not the only rising issue, but also the resilience of these engineered organisms that we need to concern. For example, some team’s bacteria have to work in dessert with extremely low water content( .ref ), or when cell components are freeze dried on the test paper to make a paper based biosensor, the system must undergo severe dehydration for storage and transport, and this would probably hamper their effectiveness during work.( .ref ). Our investigationfor the 2016 iGEM projects showed that over 299 entries, x% engineered organisms are facing practical issues related with extreme working conditions or environmental stress. As a consequence, team SIAT-SCIE is focusing on how we can transform the resilience of tardigrades into the engineered organisms. Increasing their efficiency during work and gives them greater potential to be put into real practice.
b) What are we doing?
Our first goal is to test whether TDPs can provide desiccation resistance for enzyme in vitro.
Secondly, we transfer our designed plasmid into DH5α and express TDP in vivo to see if it can confer desiccation resistance, by comparing the engineered strain with the E. coli that didn’t express the TDP gene. Hence a protection mechanism is developed, which can facilitate other iGEM teams"

U OF C iGEM: REPROGRAMMING A LANGUAGE AND A COMMUNITY
The progression of strong scientific research depends on whether industry and the public know about it and understand how the research can be applied. With this in mind, the U of C iGEM team’s work stretches far beyond the wetlab. We pursued initiatives all the way from mathematical modelling to ethics and from education to fundraising. Below there is a list of all the aspects of our project with respective icons and a brief description about each endeavour. These icons are present throughout our wiki so you can keep track of which aspect of our project you are learning about.
LAB. For the wetlab, we explored the concept of Quorum Sensing, a cell-to-cell communication process used by bacteria. We constructed the V. harveyi AI-2 signalling system in E. coli. This system allows for the fined tuned coordination of bacterial behaviour in that bacterial colonies are able to act as single entities.
MODELLING. We modelled the AI-2 signalling system using mathematical modelling (Matlab) and the novel Membrane Computing (Mathematica) frameworks. The purpose of these models is to characterize the AI-2 signalling system by predicting and evaluating certain parameters.
HUMAN PRACTICES. We pursued various approaches to communicate with the public about Synthetic Biology, iGEM and iGEM at the UofC. This initiative is important to gain an understanding of the public perception of Synthetic Biology, whether the public knows about this field or not. We investigated the ethical issues surrounding this emerging field as well as novel means to communicate our research work with the public.
SECOND LIFE. Education is a fundamental aspect of iGEM because synthetic biology is an emerging field in which students have limited knowledge before participating. We have created and are continually developing an educational tool for teaching synthetic biology within the virtual world of Second Life. This interactive platform has been used to teach the potential applications of synthetic biology, the assembly of genetic circuits, and molecular biology lab procedures. We"
NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Denmonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," of the secretory tag YebF, we transformed the constructed YebF-GFP plasmid into DH5α and cultured overnight at 37 ℃. The supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was taken for fluorescence detection. The results are shown in the Figure 6. But we forgot to set up a positive control group. Due to time constraints, we have no time to repeat this experiment. But as a secretory tag used in both the literature and the iGEM team, we believe it can actually work.
We transformed the IL10-flag plasmid into BL21, and incubated at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to OD = 0.2. After 2 h of growth at 37 ℃, IPTG was added and induced at 30 ℃ for 16 h. Then, the bacterial solution was lysed and the expression of IL10 was detected by western blot (Figure 7). We used the human IL10 sequence optimized by E. coli from the previous iGEM team (the original part is BBa_K554004 ). So we have reason to believe that we have successfully expressed IL10. As a widely validated and used cytokine, we believe it can play an immunosuppressive role in vivo.
Lane 1: Negative control (cell lysate without IPTG induction); Lane 2: 0.5mM IPTG, Lane3: 1mM IPTG                 induction for 16h at 30℃.
We transformed the plasmid of myrosinase-his into BL21, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight and diluted to OD = 0.2. After growth for 2 h at 37 ℃, different concentrations of IPTG were added and induced at 16 ℃ for 16 h. The bacterial cell lysis was then performed to detect the expression of myrosinase by SDS-PAGE (Figure 8). The sequence of the myrosinase enzyme was optimized based on the K12 strain and the position of the strip is almost correct, so we believe we have successfully expressed it. The myrosinase can convert glucosinolates contained in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane which has well-known anti-cancer activity. A literature earlier this year (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-017-0181-y) has validated the activity of myrosinase expressed by E. coli Nissle 1917 in"

Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," excited fluorophores to non-excited fluorophores can occur when the two fluorophores are within a distance of 5 nm (Alberts et al., 2015). Labelling molecules of interest with different fluorophores enables the recognition of instances when they are at such close proximity, which typically only occurs when the molecules are interacting (Alberts et al., 2015). In order for the energy transfer to occur, the excitation spectrum of one fluorophore must overlap with the emission spectrum of another (Alberts et al., 2015). In this project, the excitation of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) at approximately 430 nm will result in emission from yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) at approximately 535 nm if the associated prion domain is successful in increasing the interactive potential of the fluorophores (Alberts et al., 2015). FRET, as a part of this project design, is expected to demonstrate the ability of prion domains to bring together different proteins in an attempt to manipulate cellular processes. PrD CFP and PrD YFP have been biobricked and placed in the registry.

Abstracts or summary of different teams’ projects that worked with riboregulators
The usage of the riboregulator system can be versatile; Different teams utilized the system in different ways. In general, introducing the riboregulator system to a certain circuit allows another level regulation. The new level of regulation then can give possible outcomes such as: specific interaction/communication (UC Berkeley 2006/ Caltech 2007); minimization of leakage by introducing post-transcriptional repression (Calgary 2007); and modulation of different concentrations of desired outcome (K.U. Leuven 2009).
One drawback of riboregulator system in the context of iGEM is that teams that originally have riboregulator incorporated in their systems drop the use of riboregulator of because of time restraint (Calgary 2007). This is because when riboregulators are used to introduce another level of regulation, it becomes a supplementary part of the project; Usually, even without the extra level of regulation, the teams can prove the functionality of their systems. Therefore when the time is limited, and when the teams prioritize the things they need to do, they end up dropping the riboregulator system.

Abstract: “Networks of interacting cells provide the basis for neural learning. We have developed the process of addressable conjugation for communication within a network of E. coli bacteria. Here, bacteria send messages to one another via conjugation of plasmid DNAs, but the message is only meaningful to cells with a matching address sequence. In this way, the Watson Crick base-pairing of addressing sequences replaces the spatial connectivity present in neural systems. To construct this system, we have adapted natural conjugation systems as the communication device. Information contained in the transferred plasmids is only accessible by ""unlocking"" the message using RNA based 'keys'. The resulting addressable conjugation process is being adapted to construct a network of NAND logic gates in bacterial cultures. Ultimately, this will allow us to develop networks of bacteria capable of trained learning.”

During this week we started doing real progress. The second app - the timeline - was impelmented, we created a homepage draft and finally we also started doing the text mining on the abstracts of the teams.
Week 10
This week we had a non-sunny sunday indoors programming all day with the goal to finish the whole project. As it turned out in the end this was way too ambitious. Nevertheless we reimplemented our scoring function, created several different homepage designs, continued the text mining and generated a set of raw filtering functions. After this sunday we all focused on a different project or on our bachelor thesis.
Week 15
After a long break full of work we slowly started to finsih on this project and implemented a draft for the topics app.
Week 18
Since we still didn't have the functional filter, they were fixed. Thus we could now start exploring the data we generated and unfortunately we noticed, that part of the data was wrong or not passed through the filters correctly. So we started fixing bugs...
Week 19
In this week we found out that using external stylesheets and javascript together with the R code for the apps is easier than we thought. Thus we did some restyling and put the filters into a notebook. In parallel we worked on the data completion.
Week 20
Now that we finally understood how many opportunities shiny offers, we generated new apps, added a tabular output of the teams and added more filter functions. These also include a filter for the team name. Unfortunately it turned out, that the methods extraction is anything but stable.
Week 22
This week we took a closer look at the methods. We went through prominent iGEM teams and addedmethods to our list, that could actually be found in the abstracts.
Week 23
The week before wiki freeze - we did lots of style adjustments and added many details to our apps in order to present a fully developed tool. To actually use the tool you can now just click on the link above this box.

Reimplementation of scraping
As the scraping scripts we started out with had a rather high run time and were organised pretty complicated, the whole thing was rewritten. The spiders use the central team ( https://igem.org/Team_List?year=%d ) and results ( https://igem.org/Results?year=%d ) page per year to go through all the teams at once instead of opening, editing and closing the JSON results file for every team. Within each team page HtmlXPathSelectors are used to generate the single values. As this of course"

He is a chemist with an artistic heart, deeply attracted by CS and mathematics and has a final goal to become a philosopher.
Yi WU
Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.
Xiaohan HU
More detail please!
Xiaohan is a junior majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics at UCAS.
Taking apart in iGEM and working with so many outstanding teammates were some interesting attempts for her. At least she knows how to keep calm now.
She was responsible for the artistic design of the project.
She has a bunch of seemingly unrelated hobbies in her daily life, such as debating, painting and literature. What she wants to do further is to make all these hobbies be related.

Awesome at regular performance in complex biological systems. Majorly deals with ocean of numbers this year. Concentrates on modally and numerical analysis, take a bit of contribution on the design of hardware.
Away from the computer screen, favorites are songs and joggings. Likes traveling and eating special local foods. Fan of sci-fic movies and tech. product.
Yuqing LEI
Tomorcolumn is another day.
Yuqing is a sophomore majoring in biology at UCAS.
The year just passed witnessed the vigorous gcolumnth of her, which was due to the learning and working experience with iGEM team members.
While she used to be quiet and nervous, experience in iGEM really changed her a lot. Now, she has been more outgoing and warm-hearted, and never afraid to face challenges and difficulties.
She still enjoys reading and traveling alone, but becomes more open to new friends and new ideas.

British_Columbia,2013,Team:British Columbia#humanpractices#GMOTimeline_-_-_TEXT.html," the U.S. food market due to increased competition from longer-lasting, conventional varieties.
Requirements for labeling of novel foods and ingredients, those that have not been used for human consumption in the EU, are outlined. The labels are required to include characteristics and materials which may affect the health of some individuals and materials that give rise to ethical concerns.
After the delivery of unlabelled genetically engineered soybeans from U.S. to European ports, Greenpeace led protests in front of multinational food companies across Europe. As media attention intensifies, Austria and Italy refuse imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and France suspends all GMO imports until regulatory legislation can be reviewed.
The FDA Modernization Act is signed and streamlines the FDA’s procedures relating to the regulation of food, drugs, devices and biological products. Critics fear that the legislation will encourage more crop deregulation.
1998
Monsanto introduces Roundup-ready corn and canola which supposedly increase crop yields over conventional varieties. (Twenty years later, studies show that this claim is unsupported.)
1999
Mounting environmental and health concerns surrounding GM crops in Europe leads big food manufacturers to commit to removing all GM ingredients in EU food products. Major food chains in England including Sainsbury, Tesco, Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and McDonalds also announce their intention to avoid all GM ingredients.
2000
The EU adopts regulations stipulating that even additives and flavoring must be specifically labeled if DNA or protein of GMO origin is present in the final product.
Several countries pass laws requiring GM food labels: Australia, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, and Russia pass laws requiring labels for GM foods.
The FDA announces that the labeling of GM foods would remain voluntary in the U.S., but also publishes guidelines for companies that wish to label their products as ""free of genetic modification"". The U.S. Department of Agriculture also promises to develop standardized tests for GM foods.
2001
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan follow suit and also pass laws requiring special labels for GM foods.
2003
GloFish, a GM fluorescent fish first developed in 1999, is introduced to the U.S. market after being made available in Taiwan earlier in 2003. This product is banned in California due to a regulation that bans all GM fish. They are also banned in Canada and within the EU. However, since their introduction, there have been no reports of any ecological concerns associated with their sale.
Greenpeace praises the EU for adopting the world’s strictest and most comprehensive rules on GMOs. The new system requires that all genetically engineered ingredients – from consumer products to animal"

Growth Curves of Microorganisms
Growth course across species of microorganisms exhibit some common characteristic behaviour. Typically, the growth curve of a population has an initial lag phase, with limited growth, and exponential phase, where the doubling time is constant, and finally, a stationary phase, where the population capacity has been reached, either because of limitation on resources or physical space.

User Testing
This device is meant to go out to fellow iGEMers and Hackerspaces. To validate the assumptions we had when building the prototype, we brought it to our friends from the local hackerspace Biologigaragen and our highschool student Tobias.
Higschool Student: Tobias
The purpose of this experiment was to test whether the instructions provided in our protocol were sufficient for someone who had never before worked with the device. Tobias volunteered to carry out the experiment. He had the task to compare two different Y. lipolytica strains growing on YPD. He was provided with the robot, all necessary material and the protocol and then left on his own device.
Tobias had no problems following the protocol we wrote. He found the menu very intuitive and liked the overall design. However, he mentioned that it was difficult to take the cuvettes out again from the robot because the holder is embedded very deeply in the housing. He helped himself by removing a panel and accessing the chambers from the side. A future prototype should be build slightly larger in order to increase comfort.
Despite the positive feedback, the experiment failed. This was due to a major flaw in the protocol given to him. It did not include calibration of the airflow. Therefore Tobias left the valve"

The samples contained as well general laccase samples for activity tests but also the flow through from the purification process to check if any laccase is lost during this process. The results show no enzyme activity in any case.
Output of enzyme activity measurements via oxidized ABTS and OD420. Measured is the flow through of ECOL , XCCL , TTHL , BHAL and BPUL . E. coli KRX (no plasmid) was used as negativ control and cells containing a plasmid with ligase was used for the control of induction. The elution buffer was as well tested as a negative control.

Dominik tried to regenerate the column. After that we measured new dilution series from all three estrogens. Once again all substrates left the column together with the solvent. That means the column is defect.
We ordered new C18-columns from Knauer and waited for their arriving. A Eurosphere and a Bluespehere column.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html,"  The first round of digestion/ligation/transformation lead to 36 samples likely containing our parts. Samples were then sent in for sequencing. The sequencing results again indicated that the correct promoter (Pveg) was present, but the other pieces of our construct beyond that were not present. We made overnights of all remaining (untested) colonies from the successful plates, but the cPCR failed so we did not go on to prepare these. The second batch of digestion/ligation/transformation we did this week failed as there was no growth at all on the plates. We were using the original synthesized products directly in this restriction digest, instead of putting a small amount it into E. coli and letting the E.coli mass produce it. Therefore, at the end of the week all we had to submit to the iGEM registry was 17 constructs that we had in a different vector. They were unable to be properly inserted into the accepted iGEM vector pSB1C3. We still want people to be able to use these parts that we worked really hard designing for our project so we still posted the information about them on our parts page.
Table 1:Indicates the progress made thus far in BioBricking our parts for the iGEM registry.
Week 21: Oct 13 - 17
Aside from working on content for our Wiki, we attempted to demonstrate the interaction between our reporter and repressor genes. We essentially carried out a double transformation of E. coli. Competent cells were made from E. coli colonies that were initially transformed with the reporter gene, producing red colonies. These competent cells were then transformed with the repressor gene. The reporter gene was carried by a chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid vector and the repressor gene was carried by an ampicillin-resistant plasmid vector, allowing for a reliable double-resistance selection.
The results of our double-transformation showed functional evidence for the interaction between our reporter and repressor genes; we observed a repression of the expression of the RFP reporter. Plates with the two antibiotics produced white colonies indicating that both plasmids were successfully transformed and that RFP was not being expressed. Few red colonies were observed at the edges of the lawn. The occurance of red colonies at the edges are most likely satellite colonies, that is colonies without ampicilin resistance (i.e. without the repressor) which survived due to the breakdown of antibiotic by cells with true ampicilin resistance. Our controls consisted of plating the cells that contain only the reporter gene, and hence only have chloramphenicol"

Abstract
We placed genes from fireflies and bioluminescent bacteria into E.coli. Codon optimisation and single amino acid mutagenesis allowed us to generate bright light output in a range of different colours. Future applications include  and quantitative biosensors and biological alternatives to conventional lighting.

The Project
A flask lit by E. coli transformed with one of our constructs
E. coli transformed with our different coloured bioluminescent systems
Team members illuminated only by our bacteria
Over the course of the summer we built a set of BioBricks to allow bioluminescence in a wide range of colours which have applications both as reporters for biosensors and as natural light sources . We also developed software tools to aid construction of BioBrick parts and devices.
Project Firefly
We adopted a number of strategies to extend the use of firefly luciferase:
Codon optimisation for increased light output
Use of a luciferin regenerating enzyme .
Mutagenesis to create a number of different colours
Project Vibrio
We complemented these firefly systems, which require the addition of the substrate luciferin, with light producing systems from Vibrio fischeri.  We believe we have"

UNIFI,2017,Team:UNIFI#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"ielefeld Team, they gave us a ton of tips about iGEM competition since many of its aspects were hidden to us. We actually discovered how deep is the rabbit hole! In the lab we resuspended the primers we constructed and ordered to do the PCRs on IDT’s fragments. And to check our first Gibson Assembly reaction’s work we did a PCR and the electrophoresis run: so we start a long series of faint stripe on the gel to fight with!
24/07 → Skype #2 with Bielefeld: they deeply explained us the function of the wiki and the complexity of building it, looks like we have a lot to think about! Also they gave us very useful advices on Human Practices, explaining us the goals and objectives of such a difficult task.
31/07 → Skype #3 : discussion about the wiki, Maximilian suggested to avoid javascrit considering that it’s harder to handle and we haven’t any informatics in our team!
August:
It was all about the development of the wiki and the human practices. We received two parts from Bielefeld team's project to work upon, so that we could do something in exchange for their mentoring in the frame of the ongoing collaboration. This month our project in lab was mostly frozen until the fourth week.
07/08 → Skype #4: Chris shared with us his protocol for the growth of the Escherichia coli to be engineered with their two recombinant plasmids; as soon as we receive them, we will be able to investigate the differences in the expression of the proteins encoded in their sequence. They also gave us some tips for our travel to Boston for the Jamboree!
21/08 → Skype #5: discussion about how to develop conferences for our Human Practices, calling different professors and experts to have their opinions about our project. Also, we asked many info on medal criterias and how to reach them.
21/08 – 23/08 → We did PCR on each IDT’s fragment: after each amplifications we obtained only a few fragments amplificated, that we stored carefully and then we continued with the PCRs.
28/08 → Skype #6: Our fluorimeter is pretty good and can help a lot our German friends! We can take a lot of measurements during the exponential phase in an automatic way, improving a lot their data. They gave us advices on how we could solve our problems with PCR, since it's not working for 5 of our 9 DNA fragments!!

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Carbon Black production and reduce the frequency of these harmful practices. Our use of synthetic biology to produce the pigments will allow us to have a minimal amount of byproducts, which include Carbon dioxide and cellular debris. Our project will become more applicable in the industry as the world moves away from the use of petroleum, as more money is being invested into sources of renewable energy, as shown in Figure 1.
This graph reveals that the global community is putting increasing importance on the need for alternative sources of energy. Investment has increased significantly in the past decade, from $7 billion in 2000, to $154 billion in 2010(4). This increase in investment will eventually result in less demand for petroleum-based energy, which will in turn result in a decrease in the availability of the Carbon Black pigment. This is when a product such as our own will flourish in the ink industry and its related sectors.
Interview with Dr. Greg Vilk
Members of our team had the amazing opportunity to interview Dr. Greg Vilk, who has a phD in biochemistry and works in the liaison office at the University of Lethbridge. During the meeting, a discussion on how our project would develop as a business took place, allowing us to gain more information on how patents and other intellectual properties work. As well, Mr. Sean Roberts and Mr. Keith Aiken were also in attendance during the meeting, adding more perspectives and ideas during the discussion.
In regards to Intellectual Property (IP), we learned of the different types that it can include, such as trademarks, trade secrets, and patents. Dr. Vilk discussed of how the different types of IP can be used together to create value for the product. Moving on to patents, we learned of a public database (lens.org) to search for pre-existing patents on the different enzymes, and parts of our construct. This is crucial as if a patent already exists, it will be difficult for us to use in a business. The discussion then turned to looking at the commercialization viewpoint of iGEM. If our ink production did turn into a business, who would obtain the profits, iGEM or our team? This led to realizing that the best option is to enter a partnership with iGEM to benefit both parties, if a business were to develop.
The conversation then turned to marketing. As the largest benefit in our pigment production is the friendliness to the environment, this would be the angle that our marketing would be based upon. It was also suggested for our team to focus on the successful production of just one pigment instead of all four, as this is an example of"

Why Bioremediation?
As conventional sources of oil are depleted, there is a demand for petroleum products from other sources. Novel technologies have made once non-economic extraction methods much simpler and cost-effective. A region of explosive growth is in Oil Sands, a resource home to Western Canada.
As the Albertan Oil Sands ( continue to be developed, companies will face significant environmental remediation challenges. In order to ensure the preservation of the environment, novel strategies to find and degrade the toxic by-products of bitumen processing must be implemented.
The QGEM 2011 team was largely motivated by successes such as the use of the bacterium Pseudomonas putida in bioremediation, which proved that microbial biodegradation of environmental pollutants is a viable possibility. However, we wished to push the boundaries further, by creating a multicellular eukaryotic organism which could chemotax towards and breakdown certain types of pollutants.  The potential for this kind of organism would be great, as it would have a broader travel range than microbes, would be generally safe to use, and could be applied to field assay tests (such as tests for toxins).
back to top
Why an Eukaryotic Organism?
Our team isn't the first to genetically engineer a bioremediation solution. And we certainly won't be the last.
Many iGEM teams have developed projects that:
- Have a biosensor for toxic or polluting chemicals,
- Can degrade hydrocarbons,
- Contain a genetic kill switch to prevent.
For our 2011 project, we wouldn't to design one organism that could accomplish these"
SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," infecting cells and some of the characteristics of Lentivirus. As Lentivirus belongs to RNA virus and the RNA virus’ coat protein contains the reverse transcriptase, the reverse transcriptase of Lentivirus after the invasion of the cells is brought into the cell by the virus itself. So there are differential equations as follows:
Reverse transcriptase:
The synthesis of cDNA:
The synthesis of double stranded DNA:
The synthesis of provirus DNA:
DNA negative strand transcription:
DNA positive strand replication:
Five kinds of nucleotides:
Among them, x1 to x5 represent positive strand, negative strand, cDNA, double stranded DNA and provirus DNA relatively, x6 to x10 represent five nucleotides, x11 represents the reverse transcriptase, bi(i=6,……,10)，ci(i=1,2)，di(i=1,……,5) and mi(i=1,2,3,4,11) are all constant. v1 and v2 are the maximum reaction rate for the two reactions; δ 1 represents the initial amount of reverse transcriptase in Lentivirus; δi(i=6,……,10) represent the five kinds of the initial amount of nucleotides and they are all constant.
figure.13
From the image above, the quantity of the intermediate products produced by Lentivirus in the process of making the host cell death increased rapidly and reached stable, which, in quantity, can be directly explained why Lentivirus can not produce the structural proteins as HIV virus and achieve the assembly of the virus particles, so that the amount of the intermediate production continued to grow.
6.Discussion
In the process of modeling, there exists a lot of problems. First, considering the production of cGMP can inhibit the reaction system. therefore, we assume that NO seperated from sGC and D2 transforming into D1 are the cGMP mediated process, so we use the feedback factor m to show the degree of the feedback. The question here is whether the degree of feedback will be in accordance with the order we have chosen. Second, there is no conclusion about the research of Lentivirus and the model is only based on the HIV research results of scientific workers. Therefore, in this sense, the model of Lentivirus’ transfection and gene combination in HEK293 cells still exist defects.
Despite the above limitations, our model can still an extensible framework for the study of the important NO-cGMP signaling mechanisms. Considering the big variety of cells across different tissues and species, NO-cGMP mechanisms are bound to vary and have designs that are specific to cell types"
UNICAMP-EMSE_Brazil,2011,Team:UNICAMP-EMSE Brazil#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," for microorganism growth; freezers and refrigerators exclusively used for maintaining culture media and bacterial cultures; specifically designated sharps collection bin; easily accessible instructions on how to deal with contamination events; and log book for recording spills and contamination events. The laboratory has doors with a biohazard sign and access to a specifically designated culture room is restricted to trained personnel. The culture room is provided with a sink and has a controlled environment, without opened windows; its tiled floor can be easily cleaned, and the bench tops are impervious to water and resistant to moderate heat and moderately corrosive organic solvents. Insect and rodent control programs are in effect at UNICAMP.
In Brazil we follow the guidelines instituted by CTNBio (National Technical Commission for Biosafety) and CBMEG is certified to work with GMOs (CQB 0086/98, http://www.ctnbio.gov.br/index.php/content/view/2267.html?id=09&op=2 ).
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
One suggestion in the biosafety of the researcher is to include in the iGEM parts kit the bacterial less endotoxicchassi (developed by Berkeley UC 2007), to avoid serious septic problems in the case of an accident that leads to an intense contact with the bacteria (eye or bloodstream contact, inhalation or ingestion).
Another suggestion for population and environment safety is to (somehow) include in all biobricks an operating unit that detects if the bacteria is not in a culture media (detects some molecule produced through the metabolism of a specific media constituent) and express lysozyme to kill it if it's released in the environment (idea inspired by Team UNICAMP-Brazil 2009).
NEW SAFETY AND SECURITY QUESTIONS:
1. Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose: a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab? b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by  design or accident? c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident? d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups  or states?
As far as we know, there are no risks related to our biobrick. Our model is a bacteria, and we will take every care so that it doesn’t get released by accident, but it is not more harmful then any other laboratory"

Overview
The plants root exudates contain TCA intermediates that can attract bacteria having the ability of chemotaxis.  Click here to learn more about root exudates. E.coli has five kinds of chemoreceptors, which interact with factors of the flagella that leads to chemotaxis . But E.coli doesn’t have specific chemotaxis towards some TCA intermediates while Pseudomonas putida has some McpS, like McfQ and McfR. We made a part BBa- containing the sequence of McfR, which detects succinate, malate and fumarate. Then we detected its chemotaxis towards malate and succinate, you can download our protocol which is based on the work 2011_Imperial_College_London had done before.click here to see the results. At last, we designed a model to mimic the movement pattern and predict the efficiency of the Prometheus E.coli.
Root exudates
Plants secrete both high- and low-molecular weight compounds from their roots, and these root exudates play an important role not only as nutrients for soil microbes but also as signal molecules in plant–microbe interactions (Sugiyama & Yazaki) . In the wild, legume plants establish symbiotic interactions with rhizobia and arbuscular mycor"

The two PCR products were digested with EcoR I / BamH I, or BamH I / Pst I and cloned into EcoR I / Pst I -digested pSB1K3 in one step (fig), which was verified by DNA sequencing.Then the RBS and terminator is added.
Based on the same strategy, MBP-His6 was constructed by using two different pairs of primers, which is used for MBP expression test by western blot. The two PCR products were digested with Nde I / BamH I, or BamH I / Xho I and cloned into Nde I / Xho I -digested pET 21a, which contains a region encoding six histines, in one step to construct pET 21a – mbp , which was verified by DNA sequencing.
Expression Experiment and Function Test:
To test the function of this part, both expression experiment and function test is necessary. We have verified the size of the expressed proteins with SDS-page and Western blot. Besides, to test the efficiency of mercury binding, we also carried out the function test with ICP-AES with the mercury gradient from 10^-8M to 10^-6M.
Results:
Expression of proteins
The plasmid PET21a-mbp is transferred to E.coli strain BL21, which can generate T7polyerase when induced with IPTG. Both induced cells and uninduced cells(as control) are centrifuged to get the cytosol, the periplasm and the membrane separated. The SDS-page and Western blot of the expressed proteins show that induced cells expressed an identical IPTG-inducible protein at the proper place with the size of ~12kD which consists with the predicted size, indicating that the engineered MBP can be expressed in the cytosol.
Function test Having made sure that the protein can express normally in the cytosol, the function tests experiment are carried out with ICP-AES. To test the efficiency of mercury absorption of MBP in different concentration of mercury, the concentration gradient is set from 10^-8M to 10^-6M, the results are shown in figure 3. It is obvious that the efficiency of MBP increases with the increase of the mercury concentration and it can binding Hg(II) with high efficiency and high sensitivity from the concentration of 10^-7 M compared to that of the control.

Probiotic Production
Probiotics, by definition, are living microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. It has long been suggested to be health beneficial with effects like prevention of AAD (antibiotic associated diarrhoea) [1] , increase HDL in blood [2] , and when prescription of antibiotic has interrupt microbial balance in the gastrointestinal tract, probiotic may be able to restored the balance [1] . Nowadays, people have increased awareness of probiotics’ importance for health, the demand from the market thus rise and various production techniques are employed. In order for the probiotics to maintain their effectiveness all though their shelf-life, they need to be dried into pallets or powder before releasing into the market. Spray, freeze, vacuum and fluid bed drying are four major ways [3] . However, stress would be induced during the drying process and will severely affect the viability and thus the effectiveness of probiotics after rehydration.

Main feature
Cheap to scale up, powder characteristic can be controlled
Batch process, involve sublimation, micronisation step is needed to further break the dry cake into particles
Rather like freeze drying, despite water evaporation happened, instead of sublimation
Dried bacteria may be carried away by the drying air result in low yeild
Within all these different methods, they have one thing in common—various stress are induced during the dehydration process, examples like shear stress [4,8] ,"

We conducted a survey for evaluation and found our project content well received by the community: 80% of first time BOINC users was also interested in the information on synthetic biology and over 60% of the users had never heard of iGEM before and got involved into synthetic biology via iGEM@home. The succes of the project was reflected and stimulated by the national and international press.

Principle of Distributed Computing
Introduction
The creative concepts developed and the plethora of information gathered during the last decade by iGEM teams from all over the world proof efforts in Human Practices worth to be rewarded with a track of its own in this year’s iGEM competition. Since iGEM teams from Heidelberg have always been interested in the question how laymen citizens can get involved into synthetic biology, they already introduced new concepts to the community to improve communication (first abstract page in multiple languages, first site tour for laymen, first mascot 2008), to do research on the mechanisms of science communication (2010) and to encourage reflection by philosophers and artists as representers of society (2010, 2013). Following the findings of our former team mates , also supported by literature as described here , that acceptance towards a technology is not correlated with the information provided to a sceptic public, we rather aim at involving the public into the creative process of scientific work. In the style of the new iGEM community labs track that encourages science amateurs to contribute “beyond the accolades of scientific publishing and economic reward”, we sought for a new way to involve laymen in actual science and build a strong community of well informed supporters and communicators of synthetic biology at the same time. Thereby we want to lay the foundation for a democratization of Science in an enlightened society. Now we proudly present the crowdsourcing and communication platform iGEM@home!

Toronto,2017,Team:Toronto#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," products generated with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase. When used at a final concentration of 1X, the Q5 Reaction Buffer provides the optimal Mg2+ concentration.
Deoxynucleotides: The final concentration of dNTPs is typically 200μM of each deoxynucleotide. Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase cannot incorporate dUTP and is not recommended for use with uracil-containing primers or templates.
Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase concentration: We generally recommend using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase at a final concentration of 20units/mL (1.0 units/50μL reaction). However, the optimal concentration of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase may vary from 10–40 units/mL (0.5–2 units/50 μL reaction) depending on amplicon length and difficulty. Do not exceed 2 units/50 μL reaction, especially for amplicons longer than 5 kb.
Buffers: The 5X Q5 Reaction Buffer provided with the enzyme is recommended as the first-choice buffer for robust, high-fidelity amplification. The 5X Q5 Reaction Buffer is detergent-free and contains 2.0 mM Mg++ at the final (1X) concentration.
Amplification of some difficult targets, like GC-rich sequences or secondary structures, may be improved by the addition of 1X Q5 High GC Enhancer. The Q5 High GC Enhancer is not a buffer and should not be used alone. It should be added only to reactions with the Q5 Reaction Buffer when other conditions have failed.
Denaturation: An initial denaturation of 30 seconds at 98°C is sufficient for most amplicons from pure DNA templates. Longer denaturation times can be used (up to 3 minutes) for templates that require it.
During thermocycling, the denaturation step should be kept to a minimum. Typically, a 5–10 second denaturation at 98°C is recommended for most templates.
Annealing: Optimal annealing temperatures for Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase tend to be higher than for other PCR polymerases. The NEB Tm Calculator should be used to determine the annealing temperature when using this enzyme. Typically, use a 10–30 second annealing step at 3°C above the Tm of the lower Tm primer. A temperature gradient can also be used to optimize the annealing temperature for each primer pair.
For high Tm primer pairs, two-step cycling without a separate annealing step"

         If possible, based on the principles mentioned above, we will develop a mobile phone app to optimize                     our method of quantitative measurement. People can use our devices to qualitatively detect whether there                     are heavy metal ions in the solution, and use their cell phone to scan the sample after the chromogenic                     reaction to quantitatively measure the intensity of the ions.

    Both of these two classes of methods have several drawbacks. Skin tests requires well trained medical workers; these tests themselves may result in hypersensitive response, hence are not suited for ones with severe allergy; prick test is painful, some children and their parents are not willing to do such test; also, anti-allergy medicines like antihistamine drug and cortisone, can interfere the test, increasing the possibility of yielding false negative result.
    Serological tests for IgE is more safe and accurate, since it only requires blood sample, and the influences of most anti-allergy drugs on the concentration of serum IgE is negligible. In addition, serum IgE assay can be operated by technicians without systematic medical training. However, serological tests are much more expensive, and requires relatively long time.
    These drawbacks motivate us to develop a novel allergen test method combining the advantages of skin test and serological assay, which we called ATM (allergen test master). ATM is a high cost-effective method based on yeast whole cell biosensor, which can be operated in vitro by people without any medical training, and capable of giving out test results within 24 hours.

Rub L - Bgal brick
Description: Includes the lacZ gene ( BBa_I732005 ), which encodes for the β-galactosidase attached with a linker ( BBa_K105012 ) to the large subunit of the RuBisCO ( BBa_K1113701 ) under the regulation of the pBad/araC promoter ( BBa_I0500 ), and includes a RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The construct was made to prove the delivery of the β-galactosidase to the inside of the BMC and to test reactions in vitro within the carboxysome.
The large subunit of the RuBisCO was obtained from the pHnCBS1D plasmid (plasmid provided by David Savage, Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley).
This part was constructed with a mutation on the prefix (from “cggccgc” to “atacctg”), which erases the NotI restriction site. This modification allows the correct design of primers for Gibson Assembly. This part was constructed on the pSB4K5 standard vector.
RubL-GFP-ssrA
Description: This part consist on the superfolder GFP ( BBa_I746916 ) attached to two targeting sequences: The large subunit of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase enzyme, RuBisCO, ( BBa_K1113701 ), which targets into the inside of Carboxysome, and the ssrA degradation tag ( BBa_M0052 ), which is a targeting sequence for degradation by the protease ClpXP. This construct was used as a reporter for the correct assembly of the Carboxysome. It works with the competition of the two targeting sequence., In case of a correct assembly of the Carboxysome, the microcompartment will keep the fluorescent protein protected inside it, in any other case this will be degraded by the protease.
The large subunit of RuBisCO was obtained from the pHnCBS1D plasmid (plasmid provided by David Savage, Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley). All the others are bricks available on the Registry.

  Biofilm has been our team’s long-standing interest. Though our motivation to study biofilm at first is on its effective elimination, a review paper on biofilm totally changed our view of it and led us into a new direction.  When something as difficult to eliminate and natural as biofilm is, can we make use of it instead of destroying it? Following this strand of thought, we started to investigate the advantages brought by the advent of biofilm for the bacteria, such as its increased resistance to harsh conditions under which normal cells cannot survive. Another fascinating fact about biofilm is that cells are differentially expressed to form different layers within biofilm.
We continued to develop our project from two ideas based on the background. The first is based on biofilm’s differentiated expression. We hope to construct a three-layer stratified expression system within biofilm in response to oxygen concentration gradient. This could serve as a prototype for future construction simply by replacing the reporter gene with user’s target genes. The second idea stems from the biofilm’s strong resistance to bad growth conditions, such as when surrounded by high concentrations of heavy metal. We want to engineer and develop our biofilm into the second generation of biosensor. As a natural concentration gradient of heavy metal is formed along the depth of biofilm, with the same threshold for detection constructed in all the cells, the whole biofilm system would be able to detect different levels of the heavy metal concentration in its surrounding environment.

Quantitative Impact
CF in Numbers
Introduction

Conclusions
Introduction
An important aspect of how the L.A.S.S.O. could be usefully implemented into society was to understand the associated costs. Hence we constructed several financial models. We started by following the assumption that The Lung Ranger, and more specifically the implemented L.A.S.S.O., would yield faster, quantitative bacterial load readings than is possible with the present testing procedure. This would lead to faster treatment and thus create a healthier CF community requiring less hospital treatment. We used the data available from the CF Registry 2013 Annual Report and investigated the amount of time CF patients spend on IV treatment at home and at the hospital. We then introduced three test hypotheses: successful implementation of the L.A.S.S.O. could decrease the IV treatment duration by 10%, 30% and 50%, respectively. Following through with this idea we were able to see the impact this had with regards to the scale of the CF patient community, the UK National Health Service (NHS) and ‘UK PLC’.
Models
The CF patients remained at the core of our project; during our visits to the clinics, many patients expressed that they would rather continue treatment at home than in hospital when possible. This would help to minimise disruption to their working lives, the feeling of isolation in hospital and help to give patients some autonomy over their condition. Thus, we wanted to quantify the number of days a typical member of the CF community was absent from"

Presentation at 2nd meeting
We had a second meeting to study about iGEM registry.
We learned about:
A reason for using low # in plasmid backbone's operation, and its merits and demerits.
How to express parts of plasmid such as RBS, promoter, ...etc.
Types of restriction enzymes
Why a scar occurs and how to prevent it (Silver's method, application of Berkley's method, Lim standard)
How to construct a backbone having desired origins and antibiotic resistance based on Reshma method.
Practical usage in companies.
Both parts and plasmids can be archived (recording, saving, storing)
What we didn't understand were:
Why scars occur, and preventing shift caused from it, and a relationship between mixed and scar.
What the meaning of 'shuffling protein domain' and 'overhanging of 4 base pair' in Lims standard are.
Relationship between restriction sites E, S, N.
2/18 - Parts registry
We continued studying about parts registry.

Since its first appearance in New York in 2007, White Nose Syndrome (WNS) has quickly spread across the United States and Canada. By 2012, the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimated at least 6 million bats had already succumbed to the disease, while state and federal agencies have scrambled to close off caves and protect unaffected bat populations. North American bats hibernate over the winter for upwards of four months. During this torpor, they awaken every few weeks, but infrequently enough to conserve energy in the form of fat. Current understanding of WNS suggests the psychrophilic fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, kills bats in two ways as their body temperature drops during hibernation. Infected bats arouse from torpor more frequently and for longer periods, using more energy without food available to replenish it. Additionally, damage to the thin wing membranes hinders flight while inducing a variety of physiological changes and inflammation.
For an interactive map of the spread of White-Nose Syndrome, visit the USGS tool .
There is hope for infected bats, despite mortality rates in excess of 90% for some cave populations. Bats with the fungus that survive until arousal in the spring have demonstrated an ability to recover from the disease. It is likely that bats with a mild-enough infection to subsist until the end of hibernation can mount a stronger immune response as energy use is no longer suppressed.
Traditionally, efforts to kill the fungus using antifungal agents would be the intuitive response to a goal of reducing the severity of disease. A developing understanding of microbes’ roles in ecosystems and the lack of knowledge about caves, however, mean that methods which indiscriminately kill fungi could severely impact cave ecology. Antifungals could kill fungi which compete with P. destructans on the bats’ skin, or disrupt cave function. Handling and treating bats as they are affected during hibernation is also counterproductive, as disturbing bats wastes their valuable energy reserves. We instead began our plan for defending bats from White Nose Syndrome with the volatile compound ocimene. Potentially effective without contact with the bats, ocimene has demonstrated an ability to delay the growth of fungi, thus giving bats a better chance at fighting the infection when they arouse.
We intended to produce (E)-beta-ocimene, a monoterpene, using two plasmids encoding potential mevalonate pathways. These pathways were constructed from the codon-optimized genes of Enterococcus"

BioBrick Safety Sheet (BSS)
Design of the Biobrick Safety Sheet
Synthetic biology is a new and emerging discipline with a lot of potential but also with an important part of risk. But unlike other disciplines such as chemistry there is no standard and reliable way of assessing risk! Where does every component of our Biobrick come from? What was its initial function in nature? Should we fear a particular interaction with another component? Has a particular mutation been observed? These are the question that each biologist has asked himself at least once but could not find an answer because it is too complicated and exhausting! To release your pain the Grenoble Team proposed to include safety informations in the registry part. Thus every team and every biologist would be able to have access to these information and even add his own observations and experimental results to enlarge the database. To sum up, the Biobrick Safety Sheet includes mainly two sections:
A section where we specify the biobrick, the origin and the initial function of each component in nature (promoter, rbs, coding sequence…), the intrinsic safety of each component and the other components it could interact with.
A section that lists: the random interactions we observed during the construction, the results of at least one experiment that considers the environment in which the biobrick will evolve and other experiments we think it is important to consider in order to assess the biobrick risk level.
So, if every iGEM team cooperates and accepts to fill BSS, over years, the iGEM community will have access to a large biobricks database with the possible interactions for each biobrick in different environments. This will help have a deeper idea of the biobrick potential risk and thus enhance safety in synthetic biology. Furthermore this BSS was also designed to help teams communicate with other laboratories during their projects. Indeed what has to be done when there is a lack of information is to contact experts in biology and synthetic biology. They may have a deeper point of view than iGEM team members. This can be an advantage for the project as well as the improvement of the safety. But if we want to have fruitful links"

Synthetic Biology Exhibition during the  HKUST Information Day
Date:  29th September, 2018
Time:  9:00 - 17:00
Venue:  HKUST Academic concourse
Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is considered as a type of renewable bioenergy that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy. However, microbial fuel cells still pose advantages and disadvantages like other types of renewable energies. In order to minimize the disadvantages and to make MFC a best-suited renewable energy source for Hong Kong, the HKUST team tries to bring the idea of MFC to the public and raise further discussions for improvement of our design. We did this by organizing an exhibition booth during the HKUST Information Day with the following aims:
Promote synthetic biology as a tool to solve current problems and explain on how the synthetic biology field tries to involve safety, ethics, policies, and the environment into our research and product designs.
Promote renewable energies as part of our project theme of environmental sustainability.
Integrate stakeholders to our product design by demonstrating our project and conducting surveys for the users to discover the public’s concerns and an area of focus for product improvements.
The university's information day aimed to provide undergraduate admission information for high school students from all over Hong Kong. Visitors in this events, therefore, mainly consist of senior high school students and their parents with the urge to find out more information about our university and the programs offered. We took this opportunity to conduct our public engagement and education for potential high school students to learn more about synthetic biology and will one day join us to improve our society.
To enhance active engagement, we have used 3D DNA and plasmid models to introduce the basic concepts of DNA as a coding tool for all living organisms and how recombinant technologies can combine functions of different organisms for the benefits of humans and the environment. Students were able to enhance their knowledge through hands-on trials of finding complementary sticky ends in individual plasmids and combines parts together by “ligation”. A mini-game of “How to build your own MFC” was also introduced to test"
