Freiburg,2015,Team:Freiburg#Labjournals#irif_-_-_TEXT.html," Surface Chemistry group 3-4 days prior to our measurement. Before iRIF measurement, fluorescence was measured on the array scanner to see the Cy5 control spot.  Spots were hardly visible in fluorescence (values had to be cranked up to absolute max!)
iRIf measurement failed for various reasons: the iRIf syringe did not suck up the solutions it was programmed to. The also rack did not move the way it was supposed to. We got air-bubbles because the syringe did not go far enough into the eppis and sucked up air which entered the flowchamber. Interestingly, the bubbles adhered exactly where the location of the spotts were.
Antigfp-gfp binding could not be observed due to the fact that the spots were covered by air-bubbles. Details can be seen on a movie made from the results.
⇒ Conclusions: We can't make any because the machine was broken.
Slide 314: Flourescence measurement - Strep-Cy5 bound fine, stamp was flooded without any major problems
Practicing Stamping of our logo in new machine
2015.05.19: Measured 2 slides with 1 stamp logo stamp each (Dia Chip logo) Slides used: 303 & 314. Slides were stamped and then preblocked with 50µg/ml BSA solution for 30min. Flow chamber was also preblocked for approx. 30 min. New iRIF setup showed various troubles. Camera exposure time was wrong, as well as some other settings. Kinda got over that part eventually.  Results: First slide (303) showed bubbles again. The measurement was stopped, then restarted with an extra 1%NP40 wash-step. Bubbles still persisted so we continued to measure anyways. Once the measurement time should have been over, the control software didn't show up that it had completed. Finally we realized that some solutions weren't used at all, or at least less was taken out than should have.. so maybe the „solution-wagon“ got stuck during the measurement.. we're kinda clueless about that step. UPDATE: The syringe didn't go deep enough into the eppis -_-
Slide 303 since the other slide showd bubbles, we tried to rub over the slide that was still incubating with a kimtech tissue and put new blocking buffer on top of it. Result: No bubbles showed up.. because there was no more stamp on the slide Conclusion: don't rub with Kimtech tissue on stamps of plasmaactivated slides

Another Definition of Reaction Parameters
By constructing the two interwined database, we can easily retrieve chemical dynamics parameters, match reactions or substances, traverse possibly extended bio-network or reaction network. Above all, we can retrieve enough information to abstract the real, substential system to soundly built linear/nonlinear ODE array system, based on which, we can predict behavior, modify choices and make suggestions.
Though there does exist quite a lot of standard protocols and techniques depicting measurements to quantify bio-chemical reaction parameters under strictly defined reacting environment, the high cost and usually mediocre outcome still can hardly live up to prople's needs. Now assume the modeling has enough precision of simulation/identification, we can loose the strict requirements of reaction system and leave the addtional complexity originated from loosen conditions to the program, and choose experimental data from a much wider range of reactions to 'fit' the 'true"

The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37°C
After the restriction digests, the products had to be checked for their length. So, an agarose gel was run for both the cut GFP-plasmids and the cut promoter region. A photograph was taken and following conclusions were made:
Plasmids with GFP appeared to have cut decently
Promoter region: the partial digestion did not seem to have done the trick. We only found a lane around 360 bp while we expected to find another lane just under 200 bp due to cutting at the ""forbidden"" SpeI site in the middle. As we did not find this lane in our gel we concluded that SpeI probably did not cut. This might be because it was diluted too much or because we did not incubate long enough.
We concluded to purify both the plasmids and the promoter region through gel extraction.  After nanodropping, we had these results:
Plasmids:
Concentration: 22ng/µl
260/280: 1,83
Promoter region (two samples):
Concentration: 31,7ng/µl and 32,7ng/µl
260/280: 1,84 and 2,06
The conclusion of the day was to redo a partial digestion on the promoter regions, this time under different conditions (longer incubation time and less diluted). At the same time a Knelow technique would be used on the newly PCR-ed promoter region in order to cut out the SpeI site.

Fluorescence of RFP expressed by the weak and strong constitutive promoters were measured relative to the negative control WT E. coli MG1655. Samples where measured in technical replicates and standard error of mean is shown, but are in several cases indistinguishable from the graph.
The data obtained in this experiment revealed that the strong promoter displayed a higher basal level of RFP expression than the weak promoter. Moreover, both promoters exhibited similar decrease in fluorescence over time, as seen in Figure 2, indicating that a considerable portion of the cell populations for both promoters lost their ability to fluoresce during growth, with one population containing around 60% non-fluorescent bacteria, clearly divided from the fluorescent portion. As expected, the strong promoter displayed a high level of RFP expression, roughly 500-fold of the non-fluorescent MG1655 control at 1 hour. A 10-fold decrease in fluorescence was observed from 1 hour to 4 hours. The RFP expression mediated by the weak promoter exhibited a similar decrease in fluorescence over time, though with measured fluorescence levels 5 times lower than for the strong promoter.
Comparing these findings to the fluorescence microscopy data, it was hypothesised, that the increasing noise could be caused by bacterial plasmid loss. This could be ascribed to degradation of ampicillin in the medium, since the mechanism behind ampicillin resistance relies on the β-lactamase mediated cleavage of the antibiotic, thereby relieving the selective pressure. Consequently, the bacteria, which have lost their plasmid could be able to compete with the bacteria still containing their plasmid.
The fluorescence microscopy for the strong promoter did not exhibit a considerable level of noise, however, this does not reject the hypothesis. The increase in noise was revealed by flow cytometry, as measurements were carried out at several times throughout growth. However, the fluorescence microscopy measurements were only carried out once in the exponential phase, where the noise was not prevalent yet.
To substantiate the hypothesis, the experiment was performed anew using M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2 % glycerol and 100 µg/mL ampicillin, in an attempt to decrease the plasmid loss rate and optimise the selection.
The resulting data revealed, that the decrease in fluorescence levels had a lower rate for both promoters when the bacteria were cultured in M9 minimal medium, seen in the right graph in Figure 2, than in LB medium, seen in the left graph in Figure 2. Furthermore, when the bacteria were grown in M"

After tetracycline selection for successful landing pad integrants, the cell is transformed with a donor plasmid carrying the desired insertion fragment; this fragment is excised by I-SceI and incorporated into the landing pad via recombination at the landing pad regions.[6]
First round of recombineering consists of three rounds of PCR for the construction of recombinant genome cassettes which subsequently positively selected by selection markers such as Tetr. In the second step, TetA marker was released by simultaneous induction of I-SceI and Red recombinase expression which serves as a negative selection.[7] (More details in Method.)

2 Flavins producing system
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, a facultative anaerobe, has been widely used as a model anode biocatalyst in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) due to its easiness of cultivation, adaptability to aerobic and anaerobic environment and both respiratory and electron transfer versatility. [8]
Particularly, EET pathway can be subdivided into direct EET and mediated EET and the latter one limits the efficiency of electron transfer between bacteria and electrode due to the deficiency of electron mediator. To regulate relations of energy and information in the consortium, flavins hold the key to success.
It is widely accepted that interfacial EET is the rate-limiting step in the EET processes which can be relieved by some redox active molecules such as quinines and metal-centered porphyrin-ring derivatives. However, those redox active molecules are generally costly and toxic to anodic electricigens. Besides, Shewanella is capable of utilizing self-secreted flavins like riboflavin (RF) to accelerate EET, which is much more efficiently than other exogenous active molecules. More specifically, riboflavin (RF) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) enhance EET more than five times, with much lower"

We will patent our product with the help of the IP department of the Valorisation Centre.
Patent ownership
It is important to determine the ownership of intellectual property generated at the TU Delft. The product development is a result of the collaboration between a team of students and employers from the TU Delft. Intellectual property, generated by employees of TU Delft are generally property of TU Delft. The intellectual property generated by students can be, depending on the circumstances, owned by the students, the TU Delft or a combination of both. For example, when students are coached by TU Delft employees who contribute to the invention, they can be co-inventors and TU Delft can have a (partial) claim on the IP.
To determine the contribution to the invention of the individual students and TU Delft employees, we have to determine what the individual share is of every stakeholder in the developing process. The Valorisation Centre can help in this process.
As the worth of a patent can be diminished by having multiple owners a  common solution is that the co-inventors that are not TU Delft employees transfer their rights resulting from their co-inventorship to TU Delft, who will become the sole owner of the patent. In return the startup company can agree on the conditions for an (exclusive) license and future transfer of the patent to the company. In these conditions the co-inventorship of the student team will be taken into account.

Market definition
The biological microlens can be employed for a large number of applications. For example, single microlenses are often used to couple light to optical fibers, while microlens arrays can for example be used for CCD arrays and for digital projectors, where they focus light to specific areas of the LCD. With microlenses it is possible to make lightweight compact imaging devices. Therefore, they could also be used in for example mobile phones. Furthermore, microlenses can also be used as encapsulation layer for solar panels in order to increase the efficiency of these panels. We will firstly focus upon this last possible application. The business strategy is to introduce the biological MLAs in the solar energy market first.
The final customers will be the end users of the solar panels. This can be both individuals and companies. In the Netherlands, 70% of the total solar panels are in possession of households, while 30% of the solar panels are used"

iGEM community
Over the course of our summer we have thoroughly enjoyed being a part of the iGEM community. We were lucky enough to spend almost every day with the Edinburgh University Overgrad Team as we shared a lab, and even luckier to meet so many great teams at the Northern and UK Meet-up.
Babbling about our poster at the UK meet-up in London.
We invited all the Scottish teams + Newcastle to Edinburgh for the Northern Meet-up! Good times, good presentations, and good Pizza!
One of the best things about meeting new teams was discussing ideas with them, and being able to have ideas to help other teams. From this set up a few collaborations:
Dundee University
We first met the Dundee undergraduate team over Skype and kept up regular Skype calls for the first few weeks of the summer. During one of our calls they told us about an idea they had for human practices; they thought it would be a good idea to host a public debate on GMO policy. In particular they wanted something that would start a discussion in groups that weren't necessarily scientists. We agreed that this would be a great idea and when they asked us to help them plan it we were more than happy to oblige! We helped the Dundee team set up their debate by contacting our University debate team and getting them involved. Since the Dundee team are working on antimicrobial resistance, and looking at a way to combat it using GM bacteria in feed for farm animals, we worked with our debate team and the Dundee debate team to come up with a motion that would discuss the issues surrounding the project. We settled on the motion ""This House Would Ban the Development of GM products"". We really feel that this motion reflected the issues that the Dundee team had addressed throughout the course of their project.
We offered to host the debate in Edinburgh and on October 5th the Dundee iGEM and debate teams came down to visit us and have the debate! It was a"

From all of these presentations and interactions with younger individuals, we had a strong intuition that it had made an influence on their awareness of synthetic biology. This intuition was supported by the positive feedback provided by teachers and students. An awareness of how new scientific technologies can be a feasible solution to a possible energy crisis. Technologies such as synthetic biology, with endless capabilities to achieve efficacy, since no one knows what tomorrow brings. For more information about this read To Future iGEM Teams
Final Presentation at SDU-Denmark
The day before we travelled to Boston, we booked one of the big auditoriums at the University of Southern Denmark, for the final rehearsal of our jamboree presentation. We made sure to take note of all the feedback and tips we received, while also implementing these into our final presentation. This event was promoted on all the information screens at our university in order to attract a broad audience and increase the interest for iGEM. Thus, making it possible to reach a substantial amount of future applications for the SDU-iGEM team and ensure that the iGEM spirit will continue to prosper in the future!
Social Media
Social media is an easy way to impact a high number of people, so a strategy was concocted with the intention of reaching as many people as possible with our outreach. Our strategy yielded marvellous results, amongst which was a video on our project, that reached viewers equal to 16% of our hometown’s population, along with becoming the second most seen bulletin of the year from University of Southern Denmark. They have also asked us to film our experiences at the Jamboree, which will feature on the homepage of the student’ initiative BetonTV. Several articles were written about our project in local newspapers, one was even featured in the saturday special.

As part of our iGEM project we wanted to raise awareness on synthetic biology. As such it seemed beneficial to have a successful social media strategy. The motivation for such a strategy came from the knowledge that social media in general has a large influence on people, especially the younger generation."

Put the fruit in the plastic bag and carefully smashed it.
Add the solution A and the protease in to the plastic bag and shake it evenly.
Use the filter to dilate the puree and liquid, and keep the liquid test tube.
Slowly and gently use the dropper to add the 95% ice alcohol into the test tube alone the tube wall.
Wait for 5 minutes(do not shake it or mix it), you can observe some withe cotton shape DNA was appeared around the border of two liquid.
WHY DO WE CHOOSE THIS TOPIC?
Apparently, we are iGEM team, it is our responsible to introduce synthetic biology  to the next generation. However, Taiwan’s student start the biology lesson basically at fourth grade, we are afraid if we just introduce synthetic biology to them, they could not absorb well, so we decided to start with beginner lesson, DNA and heredity. Besides, we want to teach them that every one is unique in his or her beautiful way, and everything is a little present from your mom and dad.
The Process
We start our lesson with a Chinese saying “A dragon will give birth to a dragon, a phenix will give birth to a phenix, and the mice will give birth to a mice that dig holes.” It means that “like farther like son”, heredity can not hide. We ask the children to think about"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," and IM injections. The arrows indicate viral vector transfer from one body compartment to another and the kinetic rate constant (k) associated with the transfer.
Detailed Compartment Model
Our model starts from the point of injection, which is either intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). The advantage of intravenous injections is that the viral vectors immediately enter blood circulation. The means that more vectors reach the target kidney cells before they are degraded. However, intravenous injections require a qualified doctor to administer and can lead to vein damage such as phlebitis. Intramuscular injection does not have these issues. On top of this, they can supply relatively large volumes of the gene doping DNA as the muscles have larger uptake capacity than the veins. The major disadvantage of intramuscular injection compared to intravenous injections is the added degradation of the vectors in the muscle, leading to larger doses being required for the same effect as an IV dose. Finally, intramuscular injections can cause local swelling, drainage and severe pain at the site of injection. Nevertheless, we take both ways of administration into account.
Pharmacological compartment models are developed to understand the distribution of drugs administered to the human body by oral or, intramuscular, or intravenous routes ( Khanday et al. 2017 ). They are formulated based on diffusion processes using Fick’s principle and law of mass action. The same diffusion processes affect the administered adenoviral vectors. We start with pharmacological compartment models for both injection types as displayed in Figure 10. Here it is assumed that the mixing of the vectors with blood is instantaneous, based on an article by Tarr et al. 1933 ). Prof. Beltman, Assistant Professor Biomedical Modelling at Leiden University, later agreed with this assumption.
There are multiple tissues producing EPO, including liver, brain and kidney tissue. The main cell population responsible for EPO production are the interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney, spanning an average population of approximately 100 million cells, which produce more than 80% of the EPO in blood ( Weidemann & Johnson 2009 ).
From the compartment models in figure 10, equations 1 and 2 can be derived for the intravenous administration.
$$\frac{d[c_{blood}]}{dt} = -(k_{blood}+kel_{blood})[c_{blood}]+k_{tissue}[c_{tissue}]\tag{1}$$
$$\frac{d[c_{tissue}]}{dt} = k_{blood}[c_{blood}]-(k"

4. UCCKE Sharing Session: How to start an iGEM project
From the previous activities, our theme circumvents about synthetic biology and biosafety. This time was a bit different, we were invited to share our iGEM experience and general approach on how to design an iGEM project to high school students. We got feedback that only a few high school students plan to join the iGEM in future.
We introduced a “Top-down Design” which is a common and easy method for high school students to brainstorm a project idea. We used the example of planning our summer vacation as a parallel comparison with the “Top-down Design” topic - building a system at hierarchical level (from large to small). We also mentioned some important issues that they should pay attention to. For example, biosafety and fundamental knowledges of synthetic biology.
5. Synthetic Biology 1 Translation
Throughout our interaction with general public in Hong Kong, one obstacles we spot when communicating with them is the medium of instruction. While Hong Kong is a place where English is the secondary language, students especially from public high school are taught in Chinese. Interesting sources for learning synthetic biology with Chinese as a medium of instruction is also limited.
At the same time, we encountered Mr. Ariel Lindner who introduced us Synthetic Biology 1 page and invited us to collaborate in Chinese translation with Mr. Edwin Wintermute. We translated subtitles and voice-over for four videos shared by Synthetic Biology 1. Each video has both Cantonese and Mandarin versions. Our translated videos have been uploaded on bilibili website: https://space.bilibili.com/178821464/#!/ which is also accessible in China.
6. Inno-Carnival 2017
As Jamboree is coming, we prepared ourselves to share this year’s HKUST iGEM project to public in Hong Kong. Throughout this summer, we have encountered many challenges, and also gained experience from lab and human practices. It is our time to share what we know and have done so far to public.
We had an interview for InnoCarnival whom we can share our iGEM experience and the idea of our project. We set our booth with our handmade DNA showcases, and also showing an animated video made by ourselves about our construct design on TV screen for better visualization and understanding. We also set a stand to distribute our leaflet containing biosafety information and our"

MODULE 3: CHATTERBOX
Our aim with ChatterPlant was to increase sustainability of food production with a Synbio approach. To reach this final end different systems were tested and finally implemented in the device known as ChatterBox.
The first one is temperature regulation, key to control plant’s metabolism and homeostasis. With our refrigeration system we were able to stabilize 20 ºC in the growing chamber, an ideal temperature for growth.
Figure 13. Graphic representation of the temperature control carried out by the ChatterBox system.
Also, humidity is a very important factor to keep in mind, a low humidity level can induce stress, so we designed and tested a low cost DIY humidifier capable of proving a fine mist.
Figure 14. Picture of a ChatterBox prototype used in one of our first light-induction expression experiments.
Next step, light. With the white LED strips direct sunlight was substituted. Entering the SynBio field, with the “Optogenetic lamps” and their specific wavelength the conformation of a protein was changed in the plant’s genome.
Finally, color changes in the leaves caused by an infection were detected with the camera and recognition software as shown in Figure 15
Figure 15. Demonstration of the results of the visual recognition software (right) after processing a real plant picture with induction of leave’s color change (left).
 
MODULE 4: PLANTLABCO
Figure 16. Frontpage of PlantLabCo online platform.
The objective of PlantLabCo was to provide a solution to the main problems that Plant SynBio researches are facing up to know. In order to achieve this goal we studied the different tools that were provided in other fields of study to solve similar problems. After the proper research was taken we arrived to the point in which PlantLabCo is today. The four main approaches that we took were:
Creating a forum where Plant SynBio researches can actively discuss and interact freely, discuss and explore every aspect of this field.
Provide a web repository for experiments to be upload and consulted following a standardized system of information and metadata.
Presenting a modeling software tool capable of recreating a vast amount of circuits to ease and help with the mathematical modeling as it is a key component on Plant SynBio
An informative magazine that works as a medium to spread and educate the general public about this field

The Stomach & Proteolysis:
The stomach is the first point at which polypeptides are broken down. It is here that large polypeptides are broken down into peptides. This process broadly involves two steps. First polypeptides are denatured by stomach acid, which causes them to open up. Subsequently, these denatured polypeptides are attacked by the protease pepsin. Pepsin is a powerful protease that cleaves at the N-terminus after aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. The optimum pH of pepsin is from 1.5 to 2, at a pH of above 5 denaturation occurs. This means that pepsin is only functional in the acidic environment of the stomach. Small peptides leaving the stomach are later broken down into amino acids once they enter the duodenum.
The Stomach Simulator
One of the enzymes that we are showcasing is phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) (as a treatment for PKU). If this enzyme was simply swallowed in an unencapsulated form it would be cleaved in 146 places by pepsin in the stomach.
Click on the perform button to see a simulated digestion of PAH by pepsin. Alternativly, paste in your own sequence into the box below to see if it would be a good candidate for encapsulation.

Unfortunately over the weekend our PCR gel of the 8 transformed colonies did not show that CRO had been ligated into the plasmid. Each lane on the gel showed a band that was the same as the control. It could be that the ligation failed, or perhaps we didn't choose any colony that had taken up the plasmid and CRO. Whatever the reason be, we're troubleshooting. We submitted sequencing for two of the colonies (two for which we had overnights already prepared), and then we shifted gears from Lambda and CRO to our Quorum Sensing construct, about which Clarice knows the most. It's quite confusing. The only thing I feel confident saying is that the construct is NOT what we expect it to be. It is not what last year's iGEM group says it is. Kelton and Clarice submitted many sections of the plasmid for sequencing again. I spent most of my time working on the Children's Book. Our presentation at the Orem Library is July 9th.

Regulation bacteria
The focus was on finding the magical molecule 'X'. Ideas that gathered the most attention:
Ideas concerning aquaria (nutrients for fish):
Essential amino acids (Methionine/Leucine/etc..)
Vitamines (Vitamine K/Thiamin/Choline)
Odour bacteria (Manage the concentration of odour that is synthesized and transported)
Vanilla odour
biobricks for odour:
Odor bricks
(Banana odour generator)
(Wintergreen odour generator)
(Feruloyl-CoA hydratase for vanillin biosynthesis protein generator) <-- no experience/DNA available (yet)
(Synthetic periplasmic binding protein that docks a vanillin molecule) Receptor molecule
Experience from iGEM 2006 MIT group wintergreen and banana odor generator
Experience from Igem 2006 valencia group Vanillin detector system
Problem: Vanillin receptor and light receptor use the same ompr-p molecule. So, either find a different receptor for vanillin/other receptor or use a different regulator system, such as chemical receptors or others...
The system for measuring the difference between desired value (light) and the vanillin concentration would be competitive binding of repressor and activator. However, if both"
Sheffield,2014,Team:Sheffield#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," throughout the UK there are approximately 200,000 sewer blockages a year. As many as 75% of the afforementioned blockages are estimated to be caused the inproper disposal of fat, oil and greases. Water UK speculate that the incidence of such blockages is on the increase. The treatment of fatberg blockages costs water companies in the UK millions of pounds every month which is reflecting in the rising cost of water bills in the UK. Key problems resulting from the development of fatbergs include sewer flooding, rat infestations and odour problems.
This problem is not specific to the UK, but is becoming increasingly commonplace in more economically developed countries including the USA and Australia to name but a few. The increasing number of blockages has been linked to the rapid increase in the number of food service establishments in metropolitan areas. Many countries have legal provisions requiring food service establishments dispose of fats, oils and greases through grease interceptors, however, such devices are often insufficiently designed to cope with large volumes of waste material and are incapable of effective FOG separation from the kitchen waste stream.
A related problem we intend to solve is the build up of hair that becomes trapped in plugholes in basins, baths and showers. Hair attracts grease and dirt particulates which build up in drainage systems and restrict the flow of water through pipes. Our project has focused on development of constructs that produce lipase and keratinase enzymes to degrade FOGs and hair. These constructs are designed to sit within a small, under-sink bioreactor that will produce and feed them into the waste system as the sink is drained.

Cruzipain as a biomarker
Most current tests for Chagas disease focus on detecting the whole parasite, T. cruzi , its DNA, or antibodies produced in response to its biomarkers. We looked at a traditionally difficult biomarker, cruzipain, a specific cysteine protease. Most tests have failed to use it because it has many isoforms and no stable epitope, demonstrating the flaws in relying on detecting the structure of biomolecules in disease diagnostics. However, given the conserved cleavage sequence of its substrates and frequency of other pathogen associated proteases we decided cruzipain was ideal to use in our synthetic biology system. Cruzipain is secreted by the parasite, and as the parasite is present in relatively high concentrations during the acute phase of the disease, it follows that there are likely to be relatively high concentrations of cruzipain present in the blood making detection feasible. It is also highly specific to T. cruzi , reducing likelihood of false positives. By looking at the protease directly we also overcome a traditional problem which is diagnosis of newborn babies, who do not have fully developed immune systems and can therefore not use immunological tests. This developed our focus on congenital diagnosis.
Ultimately, we designed and investigated two systems to detect it - one DNA-based; one protein-based.
Design-Build-Test cycle
We applied the engineering cycle from Imperial 2011 to our project . The cycle shows how interactions with modellers, consumers, and the public, contribute to the development and wet lab integration of the project.  The constant dialogue enabled by the cycle is key to creating a product that matches the needs of the consumer as well as being scientifically sound. Crucially, it  allows for iterative improvement of the device.

Originally we envisioned producing the anticoagulant peptide directly from our system. However, results from our modelling data suggested that this would not be fast enough to prevent blood clotting. Thus, we needed an amplification system to increase the speed of anticoagulant production and we settled on doing this by releasing it from a sterically hindered system by cleavage by TEV protease. From there, we considered the options of how we could control the levels of TEV protease in the system.

Will the risk associated with the release of genetically modified organims in the wild always be too big? No risk is acceptable if there are no benefits. This being said, no, the risk will not always be too big. Theu human being is currently in the process of altering many things: the way to give birth, the way to die, human genes are being modified. However, the release og genetically modifed bacteria in the wild has to be un-demonized. There is the need for a global, TRANSPARENT discussion.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"] It has a broad substrate specificity and can transport many mono- and divalent cations as well as a variety or drugs. [9].  According to Valerio et al., the QDR2 transporter from the yeast strain VL3 is the most similar to human OATP out of all  S. cerevisiae strains. [2] We also did a BLAST search to confirm this data and come to the conclusion that QDR2 transporter from VL3 corresponded best to the human OATP transporter out of all yeast transporters. Transporters from all other common S. cerevisiae strains differ significantly from these.
It has been confirmed that the QDR2 transporter from VL3 can import microcystin [2]. We reasoned that by replacing the original QDR2 transporter of a S. cerevisiae lab strain (W303a/SS238) with the VL3 variant of the QDR2 transporter we could enable toxin import in a new strain. The reason for not wanting to work with VL3 was that itâ€™s used and optimized for wine production, not for extensive gene engineering. Another reason for not choosing to engineer VL3 was that we would have had to do auxotrophic mutations for it first as such kind of this strain was not available. However, we planned to use VL3 as a positive control in our experiments to compare how changing the transporter of a lab strain effects observed toxicity effects. This way, we hope to see whether toxicity behaviour corresponding to VL3 can be observed.
Final Product
For the final product, we will need to have both the VL3 transporter and the stress promoter in yeast cells.  The colour of two lake water samples, one supplemented with a defined quantity of engineered S. cerevisiae cells and one with unmodified yeast, can then be compared, and the toxin concentration can be calculated easily from a standard curve utilizing known toxin concentrations. In the final product, we would have a test device containing the measurement and control yeasts. The user could add a small amount of sample water to be measured and analyse it with a mobile app that tells about the toxicity based on the colour difference between the sample and the control. The idea is explained shortly in figure 2.

The survey brought up economical aspects to include the general public’s view on how the program should be financed and how much they themselves would be willing to pay for an examination. The survey was divided into smokers and non-smokers since it was considered interesting to study the difference in perspective. For smokers as many as 95,5% would attend a free of charge, annual examination if they were called to it. If the examination instead would cost each participant money, the participation was reduced to 69,7%. For non-smokers the free of charge examination would have a participation of 87,8% that was reduced to 54,5% when charged. This shows that smokers generally are more inclined to test themselves for lung cancer and that more smokers are willing to pay for an examination. This is also shown by the results from the question of how much the participants would be willing to pay. For the smokers, 4,5% would be willing to pay more than 900 SEK (~115 USD, see Figure 2) but for the non-smokers, the figure was instead only 0,8% , see Figure 3.
Figure 2. Statistics from the survey show what smokers would be willing to pay for an examination.
Figure 3. Statistics from the survey show what non- smokers would be willing to pay for an examination.
As seen in the survey, the interest for paying for lung cancer screenings is higher among smokers compared to the rest of the population. According to Mr. Björk there is a mentality around lung cancer that smokers only have themselves to blame if they get the disease. This mentality can lead to objections if the screening program were to be funded by the government. But early detection could save the society money especially in combination with quit-smoking campaigns.
To conclude, the first three points in the criteria for a screening program proposed by Socialstyrelsen, have been shown to be fulfilled. This is further supported by the article by Detterbeck et al. (2013), that confirms the need for a screening program for lung cancer and what benefits it would give [11]. Due to the early stage of the biosensor it is hard to ensure compliance of the two criteria with respect to the diagnostic device. This is regarded as fundamental properties when developing the sensor further and will always be kept in mind. The last criteria is considered fulfilled, both due to the cost efficiency of the biosensor which was established earlier as well as based on the results from the survey. It showed a high willingness to participate in a future screening program for lung cancer.

Degradation tag is a useful part in synthetic biology. It can be attached to any protein and then help engineer controllable protein degradation. This year, to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Abstract

Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.

Moreover, their membranes endow exosomes with a specific cell tropism, attaching themselves to target cells by a range of surface adhesion proteins and vector ligands. Besides, exosomes are endogenous transporters, so they are unlikely to exert toxicity or immune response[5]. Hence, exosome is regarded as a potentially ideal siRNA delivery tool with advantages in three aspects: RNA-loading, targeting and safety.
placeiRGD
Moreover, exosomes can be endowed with the ability of targeting specific disease site through genetic modification of donor cells. In order to obtain exosomes with tumor-targeting ability, we redesigned natural exosomes by installing a tumor-targeting short peptide onto their surface. We chose iRGD, a tumor-penetrating peptide. Some studies have shown that iRGD homes to tumors by strictly binding to αν integrins which are specifically expressed on tumor cells and the endothelium of tumor vessels[6]. Meanwhile, iRGD peptide also own the ability of penetrating tumor tissue against interstitial pressure[7]. When combined with a drug, iRGD peptide can carry the drug deep into the extravascular tumor tissue.
whatshotiRGD-Lamp2b
We engineered our chassis, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, to express a fusion protein composed of the exosomal membrane protein Lamp2b and the tumor-targeting short peptide iRGD. Lamp2b (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2b) is a protein found specifically abundant on the surface of exosomes. By genetically engineering the iRGD peptide to the outer membrane portion of Lamp2b, Lamp2b can bring the iRGD peptide to the surface of exosomes. Then the iRGD peptide can guide exosomes to the specific tumor tissue. Through these modifications, exosomes will be conferred on tumor-targeting ability.
photoFig 2. We connected iRGD to Lamp2b using a glycine-linker to construct our fusion protein and promoted its expression by the promoter Pcmv. Then, our site-specific exosomes could deliver siRNA to tumor tissue.
filter_dramaConstruction of an efficient drug delivery system
During experiment, we transfected siRNA plasmid and target plasmid (coding our engineered fusion protein) into HEK293 cells to obtain exosomes with KRAS siRNA inside and iRGD peptide on their surface membranes. When the modified exosomes are injected into the bloodstream, the iRGD peptide will guide exosomes deep into tumor tissue and the exosomes will specifically recognize tumor cells"

In 2008, the iGEM team from the University of Alberta submitted the bisdAB genes from S. bisphenolicum AO1 to the registry of standard biological parts in the so called Freiburg BioBrick assembly standard (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo>). In order to degrade BPA in a cell free system, a FNR BioBrick is also needed. As demonstrated, the BisdA and BisdB work together in a cell-free system with spinach reductase and they work intracellular in E. coli, it can be assumed that it is possible to produce all components necessary to degrade BPA in a cell free system in E. coli. To achieve this a ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase BioBrick, isolated from E. coli, is provided by the Bielefeld-Germany 2011 iGEM team (<partinfo>K525499</partinfo>).

NAD+ detection
NAD+ in general
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, abbreviated NAD+, is an ubiquitous and indispensable cofactor for all living organisms ( Bi et al., 2011 ). The molecule has a wide range of physiological functions in cellular processes (fig. 2) and has a great impact on the cell integrity ( Grahnert et al., 2011 ). It is integrated into the energy metabolism and determines the redox status of the cell due to its purpose as a reduction equivalent. This is strongly linked to the control of signaling and transcriptional events. For instance, NAD+ has been recently described as a modulator of immune functions ( Grahnert et al., 2011 ) and a master regulator of transcription ( Ghosh et al., 2010 ). Several enzymes"

    However, from our Orthogonality test and killing test , we find that we can just find warrior II that can be killed by warriors from the other group but not itself. Warrior I cannot satisfy this Therefore, we improved our gene circuit by choosing specific combinations of AHL, receptor and promoter.
II Design 2.0
Fig. 2 Improved gene circuit of two warriors. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II. The gene circuits of beggar and farmer are modified in a similar way.
    In this circuit, warrior II can only be killed by C4HSL secreted by warrior I, but not 3OC6HSL secreted by itself. (This can be shown in Orthogonality test )
    Without TetR, we can see that C4HSL can activate expression of LacI by binding to RhlR and LuxR from results of orthogonality test . However, we have TetR here! C4HSL forms a complex with the protein RhlR inside warrior I. This complex activate expression of TetR, TetR can then inhibit the promoter Plux/tetR, thus counteracting the self-activating effect. In this way, the expression of LacI is not activated so warrior I does not kill itself. We modify the gene circuits of beggar I and farmer I in a similar way so that warrior I no longer kill them. Its feasibility can be seen in Improved gene cicuit ."

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," 95% confidence interval of the dependent variable means under the different levels of the independent variable, and then we can analyze the degree of the different levels. But the precondition is that the data should satisfy the homogeneity of variance, in other words, the variance of the data should be the independent identically distributed. In the next part of the modeling, we will use the one-way analysis of variance to analyze the data, and then deal with the data.
To determine whether the data suitable for single factor analysis of variance
We use the SPSS to do the homogeneity test of variance with the data we got, the outcome is shown in the figure below:
Fig.4 The figure of the data’s homogeneity test of variance
From the figure, we can see the data’s variance is 0.519, bigger than 0.05. Therefore, we can think the data meets the requirement about the homogeneity of variance and we can use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data.
3.0 - Construct the F-test statistics
The independent variable is a classified variable which values 0 and 1 to describe whether the tax is added into the test tube. The dependent variable is the change of the micrutubule’ length, our modeling is shown below:
$$ y = u_i + \varepsilon_{ij} \tag{1} $$
In the equation (1), \(y\) is the dependent variable, the change of the microtubule's length. \(y_{ij}\) is the \(j\) observed value of the independent variable under the \(i\) level. is the mean of dependent variable under the \(i\) level.  stands for the residual between dependent variable’s value and it’s mean value,  also obey the normal distribution  \(N(0, \sigma_i ^2)\)
Then we construct the F test statistics. First, we define the quadratic sum of the residual:
$$ SSE = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (y_{ij}-\overline y_1)^2 \tag{2}$$
And the quadratic sum of the elements:
$$ SSA = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i (\overline y_{1}-\overline y)^2 \tag{3}$$
SSA reflects the variance between different levels and the difference is made by the different elements; SSE reflects the variance in a certain level and this random difference is due to the selected sample’s random. For example, the measured length of the micro"

TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#Ecoli_-_-_TEXT.html," also demonstrates that the pH variation in the culture media of E.coli also fluctuate around 6.
We add the gene of P-asr before the gene of glsa and construct a plasmid with pet28 as the backbone. We then transform it into E.coli DH5α  and test the variation of pH during fermentation. The results is presented by the line graph below and we put it in comparison with the one with empty plasmid and the one with only GlsA. We can observe that the pH is maintaining at around 5.
We put the transformed E.coli in co-culture with the transformed G.xylinus, detected the BC film they produced. The data are as follows.
Control of Population Level
We worry that the if the cell concentration of E.coli is too high, E.coli will compete with G.xylinus for nutrients leading to an negative impact on its growth. Therefore, we introduce Quorum sensing system and autophagy gene φx174E in E.coli.
In order to control population levels , we engineered a synchronized lysis circuit (SLC) using cou- pled positive and negative feedback loops that have previously been used to generate robust oscillatory dynamics. The circuit(BBa_K2267040) consists of a common promoter that drives expression of both its own activator (positive feedback) and a lysis gene (negative feedback).
Specifically, the luxI promoter regulates production of autoinducer (AHL), which binds LuxR and enables it to transcriptionally activate the promoter. Negative feedback arises from cell death that is triggered by a bacteriophage lysis gene (φX174 E) which is also under control of the luxI promoter. AHL can diffuse to neighbouring cells and thus provides an intercellular synchronization mechanism.
Quorum-sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules termed autoinducers whose external concentration increases as a function of increasing cell-population density.
Bacteria detect the accumulation of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of these autoinducers and alter gene expression, and therefore behavior, in response. Using these signal-response systems, bacteria synchronize particular behaviors on a population-wide scale and thus function as multicellular organisms.
We modify the plux hoping to increase its sensitivity and we choose to conduct point mutation in the region of -10 according to the literature. Down below is the exact mutaion point and we add an indicator gfp after plux. We try to acquire a plux with higher sensitivity via modelling.
The bacterial population dynamics arising from the synchronized lysis circuit can be conceptualized as a slow build-up"

OUR BACTERIAL SYSTEM
Prior to working directly in fish,we needed to set out our experiments  in a relatively safe and predictable chassis. The simplicity of a bacterial molecular and regulator system, their ability to divide exponentially, and carry out complex tasks has provided Synthetic Biologists an ability to genetically engineer their genome in order to find eco-friendly solutions. E.coli serves as a valuable chassis for such systems which have real world implications. (7)
Our Test-phase Detection Systems will be inserted inside an E-coli DH5α cell, which will be heavy-metal specific and shall work only in the presence of contaminants in the water resource. The system will consist of metal inducible promoters which are sensitive to the exposure of heavy-metals. These heavy-metal inducible promoters of four of our devices are regulated by regulators; activators and repressors which activate the promoter only in the presence of the specific heavy metal. These promoters are placed under control of a constitutive promoter. The activated promoters initiate the translation of reporter genes, ultimately expressing chromoproteins. This is the basic concept of our biosensor which will allow rapid and simultaneous detection of six heavy metals in water.
The Devices Which Will Save Water!
Arsenic Detection Device
We utilized arsenic inducible promoter (BBa_J33201) characterized by iGEM Edinburgh 2006. This part comprises of arsenic detoxification (ars) operon which is regulated by it’s repressor ArsR. Arsenic binds to the repressor ArsR and inhibits it’s ability to repress the promoter; subsequently resulting in the activation of promoter and expression of the gene present in the downstream region of the promoter. (8) We used Goniopora tenuidens GFP-like chromoprotein as our reporter gene. It is present in Goniopora tenuidens and is lilac in color.

Our construct which includes GFP goes like this;
Promoter  / RBS / GFP(K608008) +  FimH / Terminator (K2052014)
We have ligated our construct(K2052014) with K608008. After ligation, we have obtained many colonies that we have confirm their proper ligation through PCR. Here you can see our results;
Ligated Parts Transformation Results
Figure 1: After ligating two construct we have  obtain colonies 2:1 (insert:vector) ratio, and transform them into E.coli BL21.
Confirmational PCR Result
Figure 2: Constitutive promoter-RBS-GFP- Fimh-Double terminator cloned into pSB1C3 and after ligation we have transformed into E.coli BL21. Colony PCR results here you can see; one primer stick on insert and another stick on vector. The expected  lenght of product is around 700bp.
CoCulture and Fluoresence Microscopy
Figure 3: Here, upper left picture shows the cells only and next to it we have taken picture of CaCo2 cells cocultured with Gfp tagged FimH. Bottom pictures were taken under the Fluoresence Microscope but we havent seen any illumination that we have expected. We thought that the fusion of these proteins can change the folding of each protein and resulted in no accumulation of bacteria on cancer cells and any  presence of  GFP illumination.
After we havent seen any GFP activity we prepared a new experimental set up for Flowcytometry to be sure whether our control group(only GFP producing bacteria) is working or not and then we wanted to summarize our findings.
Flowcytometry Result
Figure 4: After measuring GFP signals we have obtained these graphs. Here upper triplet stand for Mock(reference point) analysis that is the bacterial culture transformed with only FimH. Middle triplet stand  for only GFP expressed bacterial culture analysis which gave a peak that could be used as a control group. We have obtained the peaks in the FL1 channel of Fluorescence Microscope. The bottom triplet was GFP tagged FimH expressed bacterial group and as we have shown there is any signal depend on GFP activity.
Possible Outcomes of All Our Experimental Findings
After we did co-culture with CaCo-2 cells, we didn’t observe any clumps around cancer cells, but we observed our freely located bacteria without GFP illumination . We concluded from the results that because there wasn’t any ribosome binding site between GFP and FimH proteins,"

To test T7 RNAP AND-gate, the same assay protocol for split-GFP gate was followed. In addition to DH5α and DH5α-Z1 carrying N-term module alone, C-term module alone, or the complete AND-gate, the testing strains carried both the pT7-GFP reporter construct in pSB3K3 vector. The same sample preparation and induction conditions were used, along with identical plate-reader settings and time-course.  As with the split-GFP AND-gate, the split T7 RNAP AND-gate reported no increase in fluorescence under any condition. While cellular growth measured by absorbance at 600 nm behaved as would be expected.
Discussion
The lack of fluorescent output from either the split-GFP AND-gate or the split T7 RNAP AND-gate can be explained by the errors found during DNA sequencing of the constructs. For the GFP AND-gate, both the N and C-terminal modules possessed improper spacing between the ribosome binding site and their ATG start codon. This error in the C-terminal module was down to a mistake during design of the Forward PCR amplification primer, where the “long” BioBrick prefix was used instead of the two-nucleotide shorter version intended for parts beginning with ATG. With the N-terminal split-GFP module we relied on a pre-existing BioBrick that also contained an elongated prefix; ending TAGA instead of TAG. This may be explained if the original producers of the part amplified it using a Taq PCR polymerase, that adds single Adenines to the 5’ ends of its amplified fragment.  With T7-RNAP gate, we were unlucky by selecting a colony for the N-terminal module that contained a 4-nucleotide deletion within the R0040N promoter sequence. If compared to the part-registry annotations of R0040, these 4 nucleotides are located between the -35 and -10 sites of the promoter. The proper spacing of -35 and -10 sites is crucial for E. coli RNA polymerase recruitment and transcription. Had this sequence error been caught before the next assembly stage, then it would have been possible to sequence a larger number of the promoter-ligation colonies, to find a transformant where the R0040N promoter was fully intact.  In all three of these cases, small nucleotide sequence errors outside of the coding region of the parts appear to have rendered them inert. With a few more weeks of lab work, it may have been possible"

Our Goal
For our prototype we wanted to really showcase how our construct would work in a real life scenario in terms of forming an actual clot and how long it would take as well as the application method of using a pre-filled syringe.
Initial Design
For our initial design of our prototype we started off with the blood being contained in a tank where it will then be sucked up and go through some medical tubing. Then there would be a flow meter that would measure the pressure of the blood. The tubing will lead the blood to our slab of meat that is contained inside of our splash box. (The splash box initial design would be made out of plexiglass so that the viewer can see nicely through it). At this point the blood will be gushing out, simulating an actual wound site. Then more medical tubing will allow for the excess blood to go through our second flow meter where it will again measure the pressure before it is collected in our blood bucket at the end.
Buying All Of The Parts
When it came to actually buying all of our prototype parts, we had to take the prices of every part into perspective. Because the flow meters are really expensive we decided not to include them in the final design of our prototype. We bought four different types of medical tubing (one clear type of tubing that had a fairly small diameter, another clear one with a larger diameter, a yellow flexible one that also had a large diameter and a blue one that had a small diameter). In total the tubing was around $30.00 and the one that we chose to use in our prototype was the small clear one because we want to show the blood as it travels through it and it fit around the tip of the syringe nicely. We decided to just use a syringe instead of using the flow meters to pump the blood up from the container, so we will fill the syringe up with the blood before we attach it to the tubing. We also"

How does it work?
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the plasmid constructs used in our project.
alcR
alcR (BBa_K2092002) is a positive regulatory gene in the ethanol regulon of filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans (A.nidulans). It encodes a protein that acts as a transcription factor which would bind to its target promoters alcA (PalcA, BBa_K2092001 ) and aldA. The expression of the downstream gene of PalcA is strongly induced through the positive transcriptional regulator AlcR protein by various substrates such as ethanol and threonine. For our project, we were interested in the ability of the AlcR protein, under the influence of ethanol, to initiate transcription of chromoproteins by binding to specific sites on the PalcA ( BBa_K2092002 ) [1]. The chromoproteins used were from previously characterised BioBricks by 2013 iGEM Uppsala-S"

NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#HPA#Essay_-_-_TEXT.html," ethics
We are not denying that DIYbio has a lot of potential. That potential can be tapped, surely and safely, if the community can address the safety & security concerns. By practicing good transparency & accountability, most of the battle against malicious intent will have been won.
Earlier this year, DIYbio was not allowed to participate in iGEM'09 due to a number of factors. Among these, the most important was that iGEM undergraduate teams had an academic safety framework that DIYbio (as a community) did not have. As such, DIYbio could be a safety liability until this could be implemented.
On that note, the team is compelled to agree with iGEM's offical ruling about the need for safety framework. If DIYbio gets to participate in iGEM, it will instantly gain public exposure among core demographics, like undergraduates.  So it would be great if DIYbio is legitimized as a worthy example of responsible & safe citizen experimentation. Not only would good press attract a large population to pick up DIYbio, the lack of bad press would be the equivalent of removing a major potential thorn. The DIYbio community must treat early criticism as an opportunity to improve, rather than roadblocks.
Fortunately, this attitude is clearly present in the DIYbio community. Instead of getting discouraged or resentful about getting disqualified, quick action was taken and discussions are underway on how to consolidate and effect a safety protocol and framework for the DIYbio community. This is a commendable attitude. Keep up the great work, DIYbio!
To address the ethics issue, we have a message for DIYbiologists. This was actually one issue the opposition brought up that the proposition could not in good conscience argue with, in our internal team debate. Ethics usually comes down to a moral judgement call, and usually it is only resolved when the higher authority imposes strict rules on whether or not an ethically-controversial issue can be pursued.
In DIYbio's case, we may not be able to enforce or impose perceived ethical absolutes. So we must appeal to DIYbiologists' reason and intellect.
A final word
We would like to end our essay with this firm, serious and yet hopeful message. According to Markus Schmidt, renowned biosecurity expert, the time for debate is now, whether or not we vote in favour of DIYbio. The time is ripe for DIYbio to flourish; but just as possible are the potential hazards. It would be preferable if we, as a society, are all agreeable on the direction of DIYbio.
Team's Message
We must be cautiously optimistic about DIYbio's potential"

Basic Parts
FOR ANTIDOTE
MSMEG_5998 ( BBa_K2382001 )
This is an enzyme that could degrade aflatoxin with the aid of coenzyme F420. It belongs to the F420H2-dependent reductases family from Mycobacterium Smegmatis.
F420-Dependent Glucose-6- phosphate Dehydrogenase ( BBa_K2382002 )
The working condition of MSMEG_5998 includes the help from coenzyme F420. F420-dependent glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (FGD) is the enzyme that reduces the F420 being used by MSMEG_5998 and make it available again.
T7 promoter & Lac operator and RBS from PET-29a ( BBa_K2382003 )
This part originated from pET-29 a (+) Vectors, and it is composed of T7 promoter, Lac operator, and RBS.
Thioredoxin with polylinker( BBa_K2382004 )
This part previously functioned as a DNA recombination and repair protein in E. coli. It is also found that Thioredoxin is capable of increasing enzyme activity of our protein, MSMEG5998. We designed a polylinker that has multiple restriction cutting sites at the end of this part for future iGEM teams who want to make their protein more effective.

Hey, I'm Vic, an undergraduate senior student majoring in mathematical statistics. Yet my research field is biology statistics, and that is why I'm here.
For IGEM, I'm mainly responsible for human practice and have been giving lectures as well as other promotions on both synthesis biology and IGAM. It is this special experience that has not only made my college life amazing, but also presented me with a broader view of biology. Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

OUC-China,2012,Team:OUC-China#Project#Supplementary_-_-_TEXT.html," suggests that the locations of complementary pairing site in transcripts of many spot42 targets are quite different. Given that the complexity of sRNA-mRNA interactions, we tried our best to protect the original secondary structure from alteration or destroy. Moreover, both transcripts of nanC and srlA are picked out from their transcription start site(+1) by PCR to reduce the probability that RNA pairs are out of action after assembling.
Fig. Mutational Analysis of Base-Pairing Interactions between Spot 42 and Target mRNAs[1]
Results for b-galactosidase assays for lacZ translational fusions with compensatory mutations in the predicted location of base pairing with Spot 42. Derivatives of PM1205 Dspf::kanR transformed with the indicated plasmid were grown in LB to an OD600 of 0.1 and treated with 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% arabinose and 1 mM IPTG for 1 hr before being subjected to b-galactosidase assays. The mutations in pSpot42 variant I–III correspond to the indicated mutations in Figure A. The reported averages and standard deviations are from measurements of cultures from three separate colonies[1].
The assays showed that nanC::lacZ fusion can ben perfectly silenced by spt42 as high as 47-fold repression rate. And it also indicated that mutation in the first location (5’-3’) for predicted complementary pairing can strongly alter the interaction which tells us this site is crucial for interaction between spot42 and nanC. Other sites seem negligible to the interaction. SrlA, though no longer the highest repressing target, still showcased its trapping capacity for being inhibited by spot42.
Figure B showed that the complemetary mutation in nanC can offset the corresponding mutation in spot42, which displays great potential for our orthogonal ratio sensor design .

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," see the effect that the change had. The most sensitive parameter was the duration of each time step shown in Figure 6. At low time step durations, there is a comparatively high variation in the run time of the reactor and so is considered a sensitive region. Since we are using the smallest possible time steps in our model for the greatest degree of accuracy, this means that the time step which we are using falls in this sensitive region and requires attention. We used the experimental results described previously in order to make our model more accurate. One way we fitted the model to the experimental results was to tweak how the flow of ions interacts with the pili during each time step and as such, we are confident that the change during each time step is as precise as possible.

The following graphs show the other parameters which we tested. These graphs are very linear with no particularly sensitive regions, as such while we have been as accurate as possible with determining the values of the parameters, there are no regions with cause for concern.

May:
We started to build the main idea of our project.
15/05 → Arrival of the iGEM kit. Full of wonderful parts with an incredible varieties of functions, giving us a great push towards our goals!
17/05 - 06/06 → Development of the bioinformatic part of the project. During this period we mostly constructed our plasmid so that we could order the missing parts and start with the laboratory work.
June:
In this month we dedicated mainly to laboratory work to make practice in bacterial transformation in order to improve our results.
13/06 → First bacterial transformation of Competent cells test kit in E.coli with salin and thermal shock method; sadly first attempt failed.
15/06 → Second bacterial transformation with Competent cells test kit in E. coli with salin and thermal shock method; we failed again: it was TOO hot in the lab!
20/06 → Third bacterial transformation of Competent cells test kit in E. coli and this time we made all the steps in ice and IT WORKED!
22/06 → First attempt of transformation with K876011 part: unfortunately it didn’t work..!
26/06 → We didn’t give up and did the electroporation to transform our electro-competent cells: it worked!
30/06 → Finally we stored the K876011 strain in glycerol!
July:
We participated to the European meetup in Delft to expose our project and to meet all the other European teams! It has been an amazing experience and after it we started a collaboration with the CeBiTec-Bielefeld team; we decided in agreement to Skype every week so that we could learn from a more expert team as their. We started to work on the missing plasmid, too
06/07-08/07 → European meeting in Delft, three days weren’t enough for such a beautiful experience!
11/07 → Arrival of the Gibson Assembly kit! We immediately tried it on the fragments received from IDT’s.
17/07 → first Skype with the Bielefeld Team, they gave us a ton of tips about iGEM competition since many of its aspects were hidden to us. We actually discovered how"

Hey there, I'm Christine. I'm currently an undecided second-year at Michigan, but I have many interests, including art, music, film, dogs, and food(so basically nothing that's a viable career path!). I've been trying to learn some coding and design, so joining the iGEM team was a great way to start developing both those skills. Outside of this, other life goals include raising a golden retriever and pomsky, publishing a novel, and traveling around France (I refuse to let 4 years of French go to waste).

Hi, I'm Kristine. I'm a junior in informatics, which is basically statistics plus computer science. I enjoy baking. My current favorite recipe is glazed lemon cake. You would usually find me in the Children's Literature section in libraries, because I really love picture books.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," have our E. coli contained within dialysis tubing and put close proximity to the plants rather than in direct contact with them.
JUNE 26, 2017
Dr. Tim Setter
If the E. coli weren’t going to be in direct contact with the plant, we needed to know the optimal place to put them. We spoke to Dr. Tim Setter, a professor and the chair of the section of soil and crop science. He studies the mechanisms of drought stress response in plants. While drought is not a problem in hydroponics, flooding is. The major consequence of flooding is reduced oxygen levels around the roots, thus leading to an oxidative stress response. He informed us that oxidants may leak out from the plant roots if there is high enough stress, which informed our decision to place the bacteria around the roots of the plants.
AUGUST 2, 2017
Dr. Jed Sparks
After meeting with professors to discuss the foundational advance aspects of our project, we wanted to learn more about the bigger picture - the ecological context in which oxidative stress functions. For this reason, we met with Dr. Jed Sparks of the Department of Evolution and Ecological Biology, He told us that soils and the environment in general are usually very effective at quenching exogenous ROS, but this advantage disappears in a hydroponic setting, where the roots of the plant are no longer in soil, but in an aqueous solution. This showed us that quantifying and responding to ROS may be beneficial to the health of the plants. However, optimization is necessary to prevent interference with plant metabolic and signaling pathways that involve ROS. Once again, this led to our decision to have antioxidant expression controlled by a light sensitive promoter that could be activated or deactivated on demand to maintain a certain level of ROS.
Additionally, Dr. Sparks showed us hydroponic setups that he uses to test genetically modified potatoes. These potatoes are able to scavenge nitrogen based pollutants in the atmosphere. Dr. Sparks also gave us pointers on how to grow using a hydroponic system.
Plant Biologists
Overview
We sought out research on the core of hydroponics: the plants. We spoke to plant biologists in a number of specialties to ask whether controlling oxidative stress could benefit plant growth. Their input gave us the necessary knowledge to safely alter the reactive oxygen species level in the environment without harming the plants we are trying to grow. Through these professors we not only gained effective understanding of plant physiology but also built upon the literature we had read to gain background on oxidative stress’ effects on plants. Moreover, experts who focused specifically on hydroponic systems"

Safety
Most of the following information can also be found on our iGEM Safety Form
Basic Safety
Before beginning work in the lab, we learnt basic lab safety.  This included: •Knowledge of fire exits •Knowledge of first aid kit location/names of qualified first aiders in the building •Always wearing a lab coat inside the lab •Reading and signing the relevant COSHH forms •How to store flammable/toxic chemicals •How to dispose of hazardous, and potentially hazardous, waste materials. •Good microbiological practice, such as sterilisation techniques and correct disposal of biological materials.
Risk Assessments
Alongside the igem safety form, we were also required by the University to complete a GM risk assessment for our labwork. The dry lab team also compiled a risk assessment for their experiments, as they involved electrical devices and liquids in close proximity.  Risk assessments were also required for both Science Centre Events.

Current Risks of Our Project
To the Health and Safety of Team Members and/or other Lab Workers
The risks are small to negligible – we are working with the K-12 strain on E.coil, which is genetically crippled to the extend that it cannot survive outside the lab environment (and has also lost its capacity to colonise the mammalian gut).  The genes we are inserting into E.coli K12 do not increase its pathogenicity.  Despite this, there is still a very small risk that the organism could revert back and/or regain it's ability to colonise.  So, we still use rubber gloves and wash our hands when leaving the lab.

Ointment against MRSA ( Top )
Purified or partially purified bacteriocins hold great promise in treating an unhealthy bacterial flora by targeting pathogenic bacteria. They may be employed as pharmabiotics or novel alternatives to existing antibiotics. Promising results have been shown in fighting MRSA with purified bacteriocins Dobson, A., et al. (2012). ""Bacteriocins Bacteriocin production: a probiotic trait?"" Appl Environ Microbiol, 78, 1-6. . Hans Jørn Kolmos suggested that we could use pure bacteriocins in a ointment, which can be applied at the nostrils to avoid MRSA that typically niches here. Applying the bacteriocins at the nose will make their effect most effective on carriers.
Bacteriocins for medical equipment ( Top )
It has been proven that surgical suture coating with antimicrobial peptides incorporated is more effective than the Vicryl Plus Antimicrobial Suture against S. aureus in time-kill experiments Li, Y., et al. (2012). ""New bactericidal surgical suture coating"" Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids., 28(33), pp. 12134–9. . There lies therefore great potential in using bacteriocins for medical equipment.
Spider Silk
Recombinant spider silk can be used for many purposes. Today’s goal for wound treatment is a patch that can provide protection, care and minimize the amount of pain, the patient might experience. During our project with creating Bacto-Aid, we found out that the silk’s potential is great. Here is some of the ideas for its future application.
Creation of skin cell culture ( Top )
It has been a goal for many years to get a material that is as close to human skin as possible, because skin grafting from other parts of the body or donors is often limited. There has also been tentatives of combining it with keratinocytes and fibroblasts to create a skin cell culturing. It was also shown that spider silk could guide the proliferation of the cells in the proper directions (staying in the frame) Wendt, H., et al. (2011). ""Artificial skin--culturing of different skin cell lines for generating an artificial skin substitute on cross-weaved spider silk fibres."" PLoS ONE, 6(7), pp. e21833. .

CPU BioX Club Academic Association
In the joint efforts of all CPU_CHINA iGEMers, we established the first life science academic association in China Pharmaceutical University---- CPU BioX Club (Figure 16). The daily activities of CPU BioX Club include:
Figure 16. The speech meeting for establishing the club
1. Journal Club
It is held mainly by students in CPU BioX Club. We invite a reporter to make the presentation of the latest discoveries every week. The reporter will introduce the new discovery of medicine, synthetic biology and so forth. Our team members have absorbed a lot of knowledge, which widens our horizons and provides us with novel ideas (Figure 17).
Figure 17. The journal club
2. Academic debate contest
We encourage all students to participate in the debate contest. In the debate contest, we argued about some scientific problems such as whether tumorigenesis was determined by congenital genes. After a series of debate contests, all of team members have developed a critical thinking and judged scientific problems more dialectic (Figure 18).
Figure 18. Students in the debate contest
3. Thematic academic reports
According to the content which students were interested in, we invited professors of the relevant research areas to come to have the academic reports on their research areas to explain for the students’ questions (figure 19).
Figure 19. The teacher having the academic reports on their research areas
Teaching in high school
Invited by the biology teacher of the senior secondary school affiliated to the Bohai University in Jinzhou, Liaoning Province (Figure 20), our team members went to the high school for the students who were interested in biology to introduce the progress of synthetic biology and immunotherapy research. It actively promoted iGEM, and guided more people to join us in the development of synthetic biology to contribute their own strength.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#People_-_-_TEXT.html,"I have been doing background research and working in the lab, focusing on the degradation part of the project. It has been a summer of growth media and Western blots for me. Other than that, I worked on presentations and the introduction video.
I joined iGEM because the opportunity to work in a trendy field like synthetic biology and that too in a student-led team seemed too good to miss! It’s one of the best decisions I have taken this year. During the hours spent in the lab I learnt much about time management and planning. After iGEM I have a newfound enthusiasm for facing challenges.

Mathematics at the University of Helsinki
Spring 2016. I saw a poster in the hallways of Kumpula, advertising a synthetic biology competition I had never heard of. I was     a mathematician with only a vague idea of what synthetic biology even meant, so of course I immediately applied... and got chosen!
In the team I've mostly been doing everything related to computers. I'm the guy responsible for our website, the backend of the CollabSeeker,     and the WikiFire+ tool used by our wiki group. I also did modelling and helped with the numerical simulations, and the others even let me into     the lab a couple of times. It's really been a great summer!

IIT_Delhi,2015,Team:IIT Delhi#project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ooter tank design to reduce power consumption in the blower, as well as the heat exchanger.
Hence, through optimization, we aim to finally reach a design which gets the engine to work efficiently at even higher trade-off points. Conventionally, diesel engines are operated at temperature ranges which are not very high, as operation at high temperature leads to higher amount of NOx in the exhaust. Thus, they are always operated at a trade-off temperature lower than these high temperature values, to reduce NOx emission, however, also leading to a decrease in the engine’s efficiency, and increased amounts of CO and soot emission (due to more unburnt C content in the exhaust now). SC-R’s are not efficient enough, and thus, do not lead to a significant increase in the trade-off temperature. Thus, if an efficient and cost effective design of this NRFA driven pollution crusader device is realized, it would bring about a remarkable change in the automobile and diesel engine industry, and increase the efficiency of these devices, while reducing both the cost, and carbon footprints on the environment.
Conclusion
We were able to materialize our dream of designing the perfect ""Pollution Crusader"" prototype model, using the genetically engineered Eco.coli bacteria, to a very good extent, if not fully.
From the viewpoint of Synthetic Biology, we succeeded in obtaining the desired clones. Indeed, we were able to express relevant genes as per our requirements. We have been successful in cloning a total of 5 relevant bio bricks:
BBa_K1866006 (P + RBS + NrfA)
BBa_K1866007 (NosZ + SYFP)
BBa_K1866008 (P + RBS + NrfA + SYFP)
BBa_K1866009 (P + RBS + SQR)
BBa_K1866010 (P + RBS + NosZ + SYFP)
We have submitted these parts in the iGEM registry for future use by any iGEM team.
While working in the project, towards the end, the main complexity we faced was of Heme protein. It is so because most of the enzymes we were using were Cytochrome C Hemo proteins, which require a Heme group for thein 100% activity. While scavenging the research papers, we found out that nobody, till date had found a perfect solution for the over expression of Heme protein. Under the constraints of time, we managed to compile the literature, designed the perfect strategy and using Copasi (modelling tool), we found some novel pathways to regulate and manipulate the"

Background
In the development of biosynthesis, numerous logic pathways have been designed to fullfil certain functions. However, all these imaginative designs lack an important feature ---- once they are designed, no further alter can be done to the unit, which makes it difficult to be applied as fundamental units to large-scale complex systems.
Inspiration
Since many of us frequently deal with complex electric circuits, we get inspiration from an electronic component, PLD, to solve this problem. A PLD or programmable logic device is used to build reconfigurable digital circuits. Unlike a logic gate, which has a fixed function, a PLD has an undefined function at the time of manufacture. Before the PLD can be used in a circuit it must be programmed, that is, reconfigured. As is the fact, PLD serves as a milestone in the progress of digital technology and is now widespread in digital logic experiments. Thus we were motivated to apply it in cells and make  logic-flexible, in another word, programmable gene circuits.

Hi, I'm Zhen Wang, I mainly work on MoDeL and Database of iGAME. As a member of Lixin He's research group, I focus mainly on calculation of quantum information, quantum correlation and entanglement.
You might have noticed that my address is same as Liao's. Yes, we are from the same Research Group, and the same department, too. It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.
As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!

It is my second year of studying in computer applied technology lab of Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master candidate. I am interesting in software engineering and Computer Sicence.  Last year I noticed the recruit advertisement of iGem 2010 USTC_Software team in school BBS website. I make the decision to apply immediately. It's really happy for me during those past server months working with our team.
I play Ping Pong most during my spare time, because Ping Pong is a sport emphasizes on speed, skill and acting harmony ability rather than brute force. And I go jogging every day, which i think is a good way to relieve  pressure and keep me in health!
I want to be a brilliant software engineer developing some brilliant works. I gain strong knowledge in software engineering and computer algorithms. IGEM 2010 is one step to my ambitions,"
