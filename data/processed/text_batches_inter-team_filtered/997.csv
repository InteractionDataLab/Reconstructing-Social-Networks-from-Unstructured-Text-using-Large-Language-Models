Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Cadmium_-_-_TEXT.html," development of grazing animals (Nandi et al. 2009).
Nephrotoxicity
In humans cadmium is nephrotoxic leading to damage to the proximal kidney tubules, which are the main site of accumulation.
Heavy metals such as cadmium have been shown to be involved in reactions that produce reactive oxygen species which leads to amplified lipid peroxidation, damage to DNA and an upset in calcium homeostasis (Manca et al., 1991; Kumar et al., 1996; El-Maraghy et al., 2001; M´endez-Armenta et al., 2003; L´opez et al., 2006).
There is evidence that cadmium serves as a competitive ion to calcium as it blocks all known calcium influx routes and also interferes with any neurotransmission initiated by calcium (Viarengo and Nicotera, 1991; Guan et al., 1988; Usai et al., 1999). However there is also evidence that cadmium ions increase the concentrations of calcium in a cell – this concentration is usually cytotoxic leading to cell death (possibly the mechanism by which cadmium kills) (Orrenius and Nicotera, 1994).
Bone demineralisation
Exposure has also been linked to bone demineralisation. Cadmium was also responsible for causing a condition termed Itai-Itai Disease initially reported in a population in Toyama, Japan (Nordberg, 2004). The condition is characterised by the weakening of the bones, resulting in pain especially in the spine and leg bone areas. Progression of disease starts off as a gradually debilitating condition whereby the patient may find walking almost impossible. From that point onwards, the additional symptoms onset rapidly – these include kidney disorders, extreme pain, and bone breakage from the slightest of disturbances (an example is coughing). The end result is death (J.W. Hamilton, 2009)
Cancer?
It has also been recently suggested that low level exposure to cadmium can increase cancer risks, and cadmium has since been classified as a human carcinogen (Jarup and Akesson. 2009).
Neurotoxicity
Cadmium also has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, even though the amounts reaching the brain are small (Pal et al., 1993). The significance of the blood-brain barrier and cadmium neurotoxicity are confirmed in rat experiments, where infant rats suffer a larger degree of cadmium toxicity than do adult rats. The adult rats would have had more"

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry.

After pouring, set the plates to cool in stacks of 2 or 3, as this takes up less space. Don't stack the plates too high – we want to prevent spills.
Rinse the bottle with water before the remnants solidify and become hard to remove.
Allow the plates to cool for at least 20 minutes until the agar has solidified. Flip the plates to prevent condensation forming on the agar. The plates can then be stacked and stored in plastic bags (ideally re- use the plastic bags that the plates come in.)
The agar plates should be stored in a 4oC freezer, should be good for 1-2 months
KB Leaving the Lab
Prior to leaving the lab, you should:
Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
Wipe down your workspace.
Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly stored in the fridge.

Antibiotic Stock Preparation
Written by Tim Lee
Background
The preparation of antibiotic stock is a relatively simple series of mixing and dilutions. The antibiotic stocks are typically made from four antibiotics : Ampicillin, Kanamycin, Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol. With the exception of chloramphenicol, the other antibiotics are light sensitive and once stock is prepared they are wrapped in foil to reduce light exposure.
An antibiotic comes in a powder form as the basic stock and is mixed with milli-Q water to form a stock solution. Antibiotic stock preparation follows the same basic process for each antibiotic, varying only in concentration which is dependent on the type of antibiotic used.
Antibiotic stocks are prepared for use either in liquid or solid media. In the case of liquid media, the antibiotic stock is simply added and mixed in. For solid media, usually agar and LB, the media is sent for autoclaving, and while the media is still hot the antibiotic is added and mixed. This is to ensure that the antibiotic can be mixed evenly amongst the media before it solidifies into a solid state.
Antibiotics are used for the purpose of selection. In terms of synthetic biology, plasmids confer selective antibiotic resistance when successfully transformed into their target bacteria. Using liquid or solid growth media"

Design decisions for an improved disassembly and reassembly of ferritin
Disassembly:
Since pH induced ferritin disassembly using a regular ferritin requires strong acids a modified version was developed by H. Chen et. al. To allow for the disassembly of ferritin at a pH closer to neutral compared to the wild type the E-helix and DE turn (Fig. 2 marked in green) of the ferritin subunit where removed.

With help from other iGEM teams in China who volunteered to validate our circuit in their own lab, we obtained a large amount of data for modelling and modifying our system (see collaboration).

Lecture 1: Disease Modelling and Regenerative Medicine (Nephro)Pharmacology by Dr. Silvia Mihaila
Dr. Silvia Mihaila is currently working on a bioartificial kidney, a kidney-on-a-chip device, at UMC Utrecht guided by Prof. Dr. R. Masereeuw. This was also the main topic of her lecture. She was born in Romania, did her PhD in the USA followed by a post-doc in the Netherlands. As a globe-trotter she encountered a lot of differences in these various education systems.
The goal of the Masereeuw group is to develop novel therapeutic strategies to accelerate organ function recovery during renal failure. Besides that, they are developing novel interventions for renal disease by gaining insight in processes that determine the excretion of metabolic wastes and drugs by the kidneys. Dr. Mihaila’s work covers the optimization and upscaling of the bioartificial kidney system, including in vitro evaluation of long-term function and stability, and subsequently, the in vivo validation of efficacy and tolerability.

To combat this problem we have hosted an event with iGEM Stockholm and Lund which shed light on the growing problem of burnouts and how to prevent them. To further spread the knowledge we have published a booklet about it! The booklet is a summary of useful guidelines and techniques to prevent team members from burn outs. It also speaks about the current situation in iGEM which we have summarised after performing an international survey with answers from current team members and previous team members all over the world.

We adapted this system for the reconstitution of split luciferase                                     to create a blue-light sensor, which enables easy characterization for further                                     experiments.                                     The N- and C-terminal split fragments of the firefly luciferase were fused to the                                     C-terminus of the CRY2PHR and the CIBN proteins, since this topology has previously                                     been shown to work with the Cre recombinase.
CRY2PHR/CIBN light inducible receptor fused to split                                             luciferase responded to light efficiently and repeatedly.
(A) Response to light depended on the                                                 amount of the CIBN:cLuc plasmid. After induction the cells transfected with                                                 the CIBN:cLuc and CRY2PHR:nLuc encoding plasmids were lysed and luciferase activity was determined                                                 with the dual luciferase assay.                                                 (B) CRY2PHR light reporter was induced repeatedly. Following the                                                 addition of luciferin to the medium, cells transfected with                                                the CIBN:cLuc and CRY2PHR:nLuc encoding plasmids                                                 (ratio 1:3) were induced with blue light at 460nm and left in the dark for indicated periods.
As luciferase activity was highest with a 1:3 ratio of CRY2PHR:CIBN constructs (

A), all subsequent experiments were performed with this ratio. Next we tested if                                     this system could be induced repeatedly in real time. The CRY2PHR/CIBN system showed a                                     maximum activity after 2 minutes of induction and dropped to background 10 minutes                                     after                                     the stimulus was removed. The system could be induced repeatedly and reach high levels of activation at each stimulation (

To implement light as one of the input signals for protease-based                                     signalling pathways or logic functions, we fused the CRY2PHR and the CIBN domains to                                     the N- and C-terminal                                     split domains of 3 different proteases (TEVp, TEVpE and PPVp) (

Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. If the DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications (sequencing, blut-ended-ligation) let the column stand 2-5 minutes after addition of Buffer PE. Centrifuge the QIAquick column in the provided 2 mL collection tube for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
Elution
To elute DNA, add 50 µL Buffer EB (10 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, add 30 µL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick column, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. After the addition of Buffer EB to the QIAquick membrane, increasing the incubation time up to 4 min can increase the yield of purified DNA.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of loading dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.

BioIQS-Barcelona,2018,Team:BioIQS-Barcelona#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". We created a bash script which takes a text input message and converts                                         it to binary by the ASCII code using the xxd command. Then, using a random                                         function, the program assigns a DNA nucleotide to each binary value (A or C to                                         0, G or T to 1). Finally, it checks if the GC content is between the specified                                         boundaries (by default, 40-60%). Thanks to the random function, the GC content                                         is usually between 50%. Only when encoding single ASCII characters the program                                         needs to perform more than one iteration to get the appropriate GC content. The                                         generated output consists of the written message in the input format, in binary                                         and in DNA. It also incorporates a title recreating the FASTA format used to                                         identify the DNA sequences (and in this case, the message). The program was also adapted to convert songs in mp3 format to DNA sequences, to convert                                         multiple text messages in the same file and to send the generated DNA messages                                         by mail. In addition, the program displayed in a very visual way how the                                         message was being encoded in binary and then in DNA.
We used the created program to convert several short text                                         messages about synthetic biology into DNA sequences. We then printed only this                                         DNA sequences with their title and including a guide on how this information is                                         encoded on the other face of the paper. We printed nearly 300 copies of the                                         messages and gave it to students in our university. The message contained                                         information about where to locate the DNA information workshop and an                                         invitation to come in order to decode their DNA message.
This way, we attracted the students to the workshop,                                         where we told them the information about natural information on DNA. In                                         addition, we organized some other small activities related to science and                                         celiac disease (i.e. a guess what contest, in which the participants tried to                                         identify the content of a science picture between two possible options). All                                         the students who came had their message decoded by us. We could quickly                                         identify the message by its title and write down the content of the message in                                         text format in their DNA message paper.
Finally, if the participants correctly identified more                                         than 2 of 3 scientific pictures, we gave them the opportunity to write their                                         own message and have it coded in DNA and sent to their mail by the program we                                         created. Most of the messages consisted of the name of the participants and                                         some student jokes. However, the final objective was to have fun while learning                                         about DNA information storage, so mission accomplished!

Sigma D
It was porposed that perhaps sigma D could be used to make a stochastic switch however perhaps not enough is known about how it is regulated?
The factors that are responsible for the stationary-phase elevation in sigD levels are unknown. sigD-dependent transcription declines after the onset of sporulation, and inactivation of sigD itself causes no overt defect in sporulation, therefore sigD’s contribution to sporulation, if any, is modest. Present evidence demonstrates that sigD is primarily involved in the expression of flagellar, motility, and autolysin genes and their regulators.

Synthetic Switches
Synthetic bistable toggle switches constructed from LacI and Cl repressors can also be used. Theese repressors repress each other creating a bistable switch with two negative feedback loops. Bistable switch with two positive feedback can also be considered.

Project Description
Two Bacteria = Two Solutions
Our project seeks to engineer two separate strains of bacterium to solve problems related to lead pollution. Our first bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, will function as a biosensor by changing colors to indicate how much lead contamination, if any, is present in a sample of water. If lead is present, our second bacterium, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, can be taken daily as a probiotic to potentially reduce the amount of lead contamination in ingested water.
Got Lead?
Lead contamination in drinking water is becoming a larger problem due to the aging infrastructure present in America and other countries with lead pipes (Ciccatelli). Our project was namely inspired by the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, which has left many of the city’s inhabitants without drinkable tap water since 2014 (Flint). While the problem in Flint certainly is extreme, lead pollution is actually found all over the US, including Massachusetts (Globe). If there is a lead pipe anywhere between the source of your water and your faucet, you could have lead contamination.
Unfortunately, many lead detection products today only offer a ‘yes/no’ detection system, set off if the quantity of lead in the sample is above a certain level. Even once lead is detected, homeowners and renters alike may be unable to change the source of their water due to financial and other restrictions associated with lead filtration and other methods available today. Our project aims to overcome these problems, while affordably and accessibly providing answers to the questions “Is there lead in my water, and how much?” as well as “What can I do about the lead right now?”
The Engineering Behind it All
Bio-Detection
Our Bacillus subtilis biosensor will contain a plasmid with three chromoprotein genes, each with a slightly different version of a promoter which is responsive to lead concentration. This will result in three different colors to be produced at different concentrations of lead: low, medium, and high. This will help users understand that they have lead in their water in addition to how much.

Purification of Trametes versicolor tvel5 PCR product.
With the cDNA samples we got out of the siliques of A. thaliana we did two PCRs. After waiting a hour for the PCR to stop, we started a gel, hoping for really thick bands. But nonetheless there were non. Also the PCR with actin primers didn't give a result. A possible reason for this could have been contaminations like salts in our samples. Before translating the mRNA into cDNA we measured the following properties: 260/280: 1.93 and 260/230: 1.28. This indicates a high salt concentration which could be interfering during the PCR. For the next PCR we want to wash our cDNA and hope for better results with a clean and pretty sample.

what we have achieved
This is the first time that we have been lucky enough to enter this competition. We should note that all the gene cloning experiments conducted over the past 5 months have been carried out by the six Undergraduate team members. Professor Robert Willows kindly provided us with the pET-3A vector with the Heme Oxygenase gene already inserted and the sequencing was done by the Macquarie Sequencing Facility.
We have established a foundation upon which Macquarie University teams can build on in future years and will encourage students to take part in such a fantastic competition and have as much fun as we have!

Server site
To store the sensor data the Arduino connects to a web server via WLAN. The sensor measurements are encoded as GET parameters and sent to the server in a HTTP request, then save.php stores them in a MySQL database. The data can be viewed by visiting index.php , which accesses the MySQL database and plots the sensor data in a graph. To view new data sets in real time real.php periodically requests new data from the server by using AJAX. An example of this setup can be viewed at http://igem.wzw.tum.de/arduino .

Figure 1: Random and biased walks.  Left:  A random walk in isotropic environments.  When the cell's motors rotate CCW, the flagellar filaments form a trailing bundle that pushes the cell forward.  When one or more of the flagellar motors reverses to CW rotation, that filament undergoes a shape change (owing to the torque reversal) that disrupts the bundle.  Until all motors once again turn in the CCW direction, the filaments act independently to push and pull the cell in a chaotic tumbling motion.  Tumbling episodes enable the cell to try new, randomly-determined swimming directions.  Right  A biased walk In a chemoeffector gradient.  Sensory information suppresses tumbling whenever the cell happens to head in a favorable direction.  The cells cannot head directly up-gradient because they are frequently knocked off course by Brownian motion..
The chemotaxis signaling pathway of E.coli
E. coli senses chemoeffector gradients in temporal fashion by comparing current concentrations to those encountered over the past few seconds of travel.  E. coli has four transmembrane chemoreceptors, known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), that have periplasmic ligand binding sites and conserved cytoplasmic signaling domains (Fig. 4).  MCPs record the cell's recent chemical past in the form of reversible methylation of specific glutamic acid residues in the cytoplasmic signaling domain (open and filled circles in Fig. 4).  Whenever current ligand occupancy state fails to coincide with the methylation record, the MCP initiates a motor control response and a feedback circuit that updates the methylation record to achieve sensory adaptation and cessation of the motor response. A fifth MCP-like protein, Aer, mediates aerotactic responses by monitoring redox changes in the electron transport chain.  Aer undergoes sensory adaptation through a poorly-understood, methylation-independent mechanism. The five MCP-family receptors in E. coli utilize a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to control flagellar rotation and sensory adaptation (Fig. 4).  CheW and CheA generate receptor signals; CheY and CheZ control motor responses; CheR and CheB regulate MCP methylation state.
Figure 2: Signaling components and circuit logic.  E. coli receptors employ a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins: CheW and CheA interact with receptor molecules to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals;"
Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to impact are mainly students in the third and fifth semesters of high school. However, as part of the 10th anniversary, we are looking to expand our impact. This year the event will be extended to junior high and professional students.
Estimated Outreach
The estimated outreach, considering that it was a national invitation within all the high school campus of our Institution, is expected to be for 400 students of the Tecnológico de Monterrey.
Why is it important to iGEM?
Tec-Chihuahua strongly believes that TecChMun is a key way to spread knowledge about biotechnology and synthetic biology among young students and professors. Furthermore, we are sure that by discussing as delegates from different countries, students are going to be able to acquire a general and more abroad perspective of the different necessities, demands, and problems that scientific society and the general un public suffer around the world.
How is Tec-Chihuahua influencing the project?
Topic Selection
As we already mention, we intend to create a more realistic approach to today's relevant problematics. Taking this in consideration, the emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, nanotechnology and much more, are part of today's topics within UN committees such as ECOSOC. Therefore, Tec-Chihuahua will support this year by helping before, during and after the event. More specifically, we had helped with the topic selection for some of the committees re-directing them to the biology aspect. Here are some examples that will be held:
“Antibiotic Resistance” as the main topic in General Assembly.
“Erwinion’s biocontrol is out of control” as sudden and  hypothetical criss at Security Council Crisis.
“Bioterrorism: Virus synthesis with synthetic biology” at the Security Council.
Also you can display the whole committees and topics that will be addressed during TecChMun 20th anniversary. Most of our topics are displayed as top secret as some committees (Security Council) don't know yet their topic.
Committes and Topics
Advising and Mentoring
We were aware that the majority of High Schoolers might not know the complete  political/scientific background from the biological topics. That is why we recommended to the TecChMun organizers that the best way to contextualize this issues was through our project. In this way, we could help the different delegates to achieve a more focus posture according to their country and the problematic.
First, we gather with the representatives from the General Assembly (which were the ones that notice that their delegates were more disperse). In this occasion, we talk about how"

UT-Tokyo,2010,Team:UT-Tokyo#Consideration_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM Kyoto suggested ""Human Practice iGEM Japan"" project to team iGEM UT-Tokyo and the other iGEM teams in Japan.We , team Tokyo decided to conduct a joint survey. In Japan, it is said that most people are negative for genetic modification, especially for genetically modified food. Therefore, we made the survey to investigate the actual condition. The five Japan teams were participated in this project aggregating a number of surveys to obtain statistical data. We discussed the contents of the questionnaire through Skype meeting. However, the contents of the questionnaire, a concrete plan remained undecided. Therefore, we, team UT-Tokyo proposed to conduct a survey in the lastest university festival. The questionnaire has many descriptive questions with extensive amount of information. We later examined the contents of the questionnaire and accumulate lots of important information.  During the discussion towards the contents, we came to aware many unpredicted problems, such as the survey time, the number of the questions, the way to aggregate the statistical data, the image of genetic modification by the examinee could make a difference in the result. By making a improvement towards the problems above, for example, we made another questionnaire with multiple-choice questions, and then  obtained a lager achievement on the number of the questionnaires received.
We, team UT-Tokyo have been trying to achieve a new value by examining the results of the two survey above (the one with descriptive questions and the one with multiple-choice questions), and that is the certainty from the voice of the examinees and the over 1,500 respondents to the descriptive questions. Other teams in Japan have truncated the results obtained in the university festival ( we call it the May Festival), we team UT-Tokyo aggregated the statistic data.

""Since the chemical prime-age in the early 19th century most organic substances employed in medicine, food production, as constructional material or as fuel got replaced by new synthetic ones. As a result even former popular plants with a medical, societal or industrial backround sank into oblivion with a bad reputation as unaesthetical weeds. Our association with chemicals and plants has not changed since, although we know today that chemical products may cause harmful side-effects as cancer.  That is why kokoromo, as a green project, not only presents itself as a buyable product, but also as a intermediator between a modern human's needs and a plants right to exist. Kokoromo demonstrates an alternative for a greener and more sustainable lifestyle in coexistance with plants.""

Figure 3: Western blots showing the whole cell (A) and supernatant samples (B) of both our fusion proteins along with OsmY-HA and empty vector using a RNAP antibody
However, we had to make sure that our cells were not lysing in the process and releasing their contents into their surroundings; thus we once again performed a western blot, this time using a different anti-body used to check the presence of RNA polymerase which is only found inside of the cell. From the results we can see that each different cell was very rich in RNA polymerase, however we could not detect it in the supernatant (Fig. 3).
Motility Assays
Figure 4: Bar graph showing average colony area and standard deviation of replicates (A) and diagrams of relevant spiRNA constructs below (B). Photographs representative of motility assays of expressed above (C)
We created two spiRNA agents specific for fliC in E. coli using BBa_K1963004 and transformed these plasmids in to MG1655 E. coli cells. We ran motility assays on these strains to see if our spiRNA was binding to the fliC mRNA, preventing translation and inhibiting the ability to swim. We used non taregtting spiRNA on a plate as a positive control and compared it to spiRNA with a 24 bp sequence of CDS which is part of fliC and on spiRNA-RBS-CDS which also covered the ribosome binding site.
For our non-targeting spiRNA plate, we saw a larger colony size than the two other plates which showed a very small amount of growth. This indicates that our spiRNA containing a micC Hfq binding site from E. coli is successfully binding to the CDS and stopping the bacteria from swimming (Fig. 4A). We then worked out the average colony area. We got a larger average colony size for our empty vector than our two plates with our spiRNA. This again infers that our spiRNA is indeed working in the way that we expected. The spiRNA seems to work better for the CDS than the RBS-CDS as we got a smaller average colony size and a smaller standard deviation, however, we would need to run some further experiments to see if this is truly the case.
Looking at these results, it can be"

EPFL,2017,Team:EPFL#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for trained personnel to administer the tests.  Our project set out to address this issue. From the start, we identified several key design requirements that our product would have to meet. It would need to be affordable to meet the budget constraints of developing countries. It would need to be easily distributable and able to work under a wide range of conditions. Moreover, it would need to be easy and intuitive to use so that only minimal training would be necessary to administer the test.
So far, detecting biomarkers usually requires a laboratory setting. We would like to present a novel approach to this problem and introduce our concept.
Our detection scheme
Antibodies are the most prominent research tool to detect the presence of a protein in a given sample. However, looking more closely at the established ELISA scheme, one may see the advantages that switching from antibodies to aptamers may bring.
First and foremost, aptamers can target proteins and small molecules in a way antibodies cannot. In fact, the minimal size of the proteins that an antibody can target is 600 Daltons, whereas that of an aptamer is about 60 Daltons.
A second reason to choose aptamers over antibodies is the development process. To generate an antibody, you would need an immune response in an animal model. This is quite a long process that takes about 6 months. In comparison, you could generate aptamers within a couple of months performing a SELEX over an initial DNA library.
For these reasons, we opted out of ELISA in favor of an ELISA derived assay based on aptamers.  In this assay, the target protein would be bound by an aptamer pair in a sandwich assay.
Figure 1 :General scheme of ELISA
Figure 2 : Aptamer-based sandwich assay
How we address these challenges
We wanted to optimize our product to create a tool as cost-efficient, robust and easy to use as possible. The different parts of our project address each one of these requirements.
Firstly we kept the costs of our biosensor low by using crude lysates from E. Coli to make our cell-free expression systems (CFES) instead of the PURE system used by Pardee et al 2 . According to a paper from Sun et al. 3 , home-made lysate costs approximatively 0.03$ per μL (depending on the method of cell lysis) instead of 0.79$ for PURExpress .
Then all the aptamers and toehold switches, because they are made of DNA, are stable at room temperature and do not require a cold-chain storage"

It is very important also because it make us question ourselves about if the projects that we are developing are good for the communities around us, or if it just can get to be a problem for them. In addition, it is the area that focus on explaining everything that is done by scientists, in a way that every kind of public can understand, so that all the people is informed about what is going on on the labs.""
Emmanuel: ""This kind of projects requires to have a human practices because as we are playing to be gods, doing what we want with living systems, someone has to put a limit to our inventions, and verify that we are not harming anyone; consequently we have to show that our intentions are good and that we are doing it for the great good. But sometimes even though we have a good purpose, people doesn’t understand, so we, by doing human practices, convince them that this is the future and that we are doing it as a part of human evolution.""
Arturo: ""In my opinion,The Human Practices project, as one of the key parts in order to develop an iGEM project is possible because in this new branch of life sciences, there is a clear link to the outreach and introduction of concepts at different levels of the society of each country. This is not a science or venture that it´s away from the scrutiny and constant feedback from the public.
Therefore it is strongly justified to implementing Human Practices because otherwise the applications that are planned to be develop will lack of purpose if they are not intended to improve the human life, animal and our planet. Awareness and a clear assimilation of the concepts of synthetic biology is the primary objective of Human Practices aspects in all iGEM competition projects.""
William: ""Personally I think this is because due to the great potential of the area where the competition takes place: the synthetic biology and genetics. These areas are taboo-science that most people see with fear and do not see justification from the moral point of view. But the truth is that these sciences taken in a responsible and humane, can solve many of the problems that the mankind are facing today.
The most common example is the production of food: making plants resistant to pests, more profitable or more nutritious. In the medicine is also used to produce new drugs and therapies that help to save lives.
At the same time human practice also motivate researchers to develop useful projects for humanity. Who does not want to go down in history as the one who changed all the mankind for the good?""

Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched and there may be more than one regions. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the task is reduced to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. In each combination, matchings of different chains should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to"

Cloning the toxins in a low copy number plasmid in combination with the antitoxins
Following the previous results, the toxins (Zeta and Kid) were transformed in E. Coli containing the antitoxins, Epsilon and Kid. When taking this approach, successful restriction digestion of the combination of both plasmids, showed the presence of the toxin and antitoxins (Figure 3) in JM109 E. Coli cells, that contain the LacI repressor.
Figure 3. Restriction enzyme digestion gel (XbaI and PstI) of T-A behind the LacI promoter in pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 for antitoxins and toxins, respectively. As indicated in the right part of the gel image, all the expected fragments can be identified in the gel. Expected digestion sizes: Kis 301 bp, Kid 376 bp, Epsilon 316 bp, Zeta 907 bp, LacI promoter 200 bp, Kis + pLacI 501 bp, Kid + pLacI 577 bp, Epsilon + pLacI 517 bp, Zeta + pLacI 1.108 bp, pSB1C3 2070 bp and pSB3K3 2750 bp
Separating toxins and antitoxins.
Once obtained the cells with the combination of toxins and antitoxins, we aimed to separate them by gel electrophoresis. We evaluate the most optimal setup to determine the optimum agarose percentage, voltage and time of electrophoresis. The plasmids were physically separated, as can be seen in Figure 4, the high copy number plasmid (pSB1C3) is smaller in size, therefore, runs further and has a higher intensity. Toxin bands for Kid and Zeta were extracted and purified from the gel and a PCR to check for the presence of the antitoxins was performed. The results showed that the isolated toxins still had amplification bands corresponding to the antitoxins. Due to lack of time no further steps were performed to continue building the double plasmid interdependent T-A system. Nonetheless, we introduced in the iGEM"

B Plasmid with lux pR Mutant 10 is transferred into E.coli DH5α. The bacteria were treated without or with 10-10, 10-9, 10-8 M AHL inducing.
We repeated AHL stimulation test on Mutant 5 and Mutant 10 (Figure.2) and decided to combine the two mutations together to form a new promotor with high intensity and small leakage. We named it lux pR-HS. We tested lux pR-HS under the same conditions. We can see that the lux pR-HS has similar leakage to Mutant 10, while it has much higher expression intensity. (Figure.3) The statistics of relative induction and leakage intensity of the 10 Mutants and lux pR-HS are shown in Table.1
Figure.3. Leakage and 10-10 M AHL stimulation of lux pR promotor WT, Mutant 5, Mutant 10 and HS.
The fluorescence strengths and OD values are measured by microplate reader respectively at 510 nm and 600 nm wavelength. Plasmids with lux pR promotor WT, Mutant 5 and Mutant 10 are transferred into E.coli DH5α. A The bacteria were treated without AHL inducing. High (Fluorescence/OD) ratio indicates strong leakage of promotor. B The bacteria were treated with 10-10 M AHL induction. High (Fluorescence/OD) ratio indicates high expression intensity.
Table.1. Results of  lux pR mutation analysis.
As for why some mutations on -35 to -37 sites would decrease the leakage of lux pR without severely influencing the expression level, we have some hypotheses and explanations. It is reported that -35 to -37 sites are last three bases of lux box which is upstream of the lux promotor and bound specifically by luxR, one of regulatory protein involved in lux expression system.[1] G-36T mutation has less influence than other mutation on sites -35 to -37, which is same to our result. Besides, G-36T is not involved in the two regions of nucleotides -52 to -50 and -39 to -37 which directly contacted with luxR protein. Therefore, this single substitution of nucleotide would decrease the leakage of lux promotor without influencing the expression level too much.[2]

Lethbridge_HS,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the patient is able to consent they must provide this consent. The second issue is surrounding that of the use of a GMO on a person. Many people are against GMOs or have religious perspectives stating that they should not use GMOs. The same as above applies when applying the first do no harm principle. If in a high stress situation it is up to the doctor to do what they think is best for their patient. But if the patient is conscious they must understand that it is a GMO and consent. The third consideration factors into the very basic ethical approval of the project. If a number of professionals both within the medical practical field and synthetic biology field feel as though this project or any other part of its testing, construction etc have negatives which outweigh the positives it is not ethical or in accordance with the ‘do no harm' perspective and so the project or that part of the project must be abandoned by the team.
Catholic Ethics
From the Catholic perception man is created in the image and likeness of God, and with this must include a profound amount of respect for creation and its miracle. Synthetic biology can be a valuable resource to human progress, when used properly. Catholicism has established that within the church our central moral and unethical complication is the manipulation of life. (2) As a result, science and technology should never alone be the meaning of existence and human progress; we still must find a balance of what ‘manipulation of life’ really is. (1)  Gene manipulation is a growing domain within biology which has drawn vital questions and concerns. The current rapid development within synthetic biology ensures we must be quick to follow and respect the standards within the field.
Before deciding the ethical accountability of a project you must first develop a perspective on what is and what is not the manipulation of life. There are many views and opinions describing the sinfulness of tinkering with human life, such as stem cell and embryo alterations which has been clearly outlined as unethical by the catechism. (2) The Vatican says that “applied biology and medicine work together for the integral good of human life when they come to the aid of a person stricken by illness and infirmity and when they respect his or her dignity as a creature of God.” (1) There are many views and opinions describing the sinfulness of tinkering with human life, such as stem cell and embryo alterations which has been clearly outlined as unethical by the catechism. (2) Alternatively, is putting a plasmid into a bacterium the same concept, or is it separate in classification?  To answer this, we must look at the fact that bacteria"

Wednesday, 27th July
Today we had a meeting with the professors to update them on our progress. We   also had the RCA group with us to talk about their ideas. The main feedback from   the meeting was that we need to figure out our kill switch or containment   mechanism asap for the human practices so that it can actually inform our design   rather than be tagged on. This is for the containment of bacteria in soil as   well as the issue of horizontal gene transfer. We also found out that Prof   Kitney knows everyone.

Nikki redefined the problem our project wants to solve; she suggested   that it might be better if we don’t focus on solving desertification completely,   but integrate our project with green plant process to help in re-vegetation.
Chris found a paper, which describes the auxin production in a cell. So   we are going to have journal club tomorrow to discuss about it. And he also   transformed three plasmids into E.coli, which can be used later for Gibson   Assembly.
Ming and Rebekka were taking care of the seeds. Rebekka also contacted   Dr. Robert Cariffiths at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology about soil   microbiology. While, Ming helped us ding research about modeling of branch of   root. Many thanks for Ming from modeling team!!

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," was to design a completely orthogonal import system. Next was the knockout of endogenous import systems. However, a few proteins are imported neither by the Pex5 nor the Pex7 import machinery. Therefore, specific genome engineering designs, such as knockouts, deleting or redirecting the protein localization could be utilized for the ultimate goal of creating a synthetic organelle.
Additionally, knockouts or genome integrations enable customization of the peroxisomal properties, such as membrane permeability, size/number, decoupling of peroxisomes from cytoskeleton and the peroxisomal metabolism.
All these strategies allow a rational design of an artificial compartment, which is fully engineerable regarding  the proteome, metabolome and the entire peroxisomal environment.
Design of yeast multi -knockout strains
The Crispr Cas9 System
The demands on yeast engineering have significantly increased with the design of more complex systems and extensive metabolic pathways. Genetic techniques that have historically relied on marker recycling are unable to keep up with the ambitions of synthetic biologists. In recent years the Crispr Cas9 system has been used for several strain-engineering purposes, including:
Markerless integration of multiple genetic cassettes into selected genomic loci
Multiplexed and iterative gene knockouts without the need to recycle a marker
Precise genome editing – nucleotide substitutions, etc.
We utilized the Cas9 system as a tool for peroxisomal engineering and have adopted the existing toolbox from (Lee et al. 2015) and the complete cloning system which also provides the possibilities for genome integration and gene editing by Cas9. For this, two oligonucleotides have to be designed for targeting the Cas protein to the gene of interest.
Figure 1: Plasmid construction for the gRNA expression plasmid
Two oligos, containing the targeting sequence of the gRNA, have to be annealed and can then be integrated in the gRNA entry Vector by a Golden Gate reaction. Adapted from ( Lee et al. 2015 )
Several gRNA vectors can subsequently be assembled into one vector with a Cas9 expression cassette and then be transformed into yeast. The expression of Cas9 together with gene specific gRNA´s leads to double strand breakage followed by non-homologous end joining repair or homologous recombination, in case of added repair DNA (figure 3).

Compared with control groups, green fluorescence intensity and mRNA levels were dramatically reduced in groups treated with gRNA and tCas9-CIBN.These results suggest that gRNA can specifically guide tCas9 to target upstream of CSPA promoter, thereby inhibiting CSPA promoter to reduce GFP expression levels.
Testing tCas9-VP64
We tested our tCas9-VP64 fusion protein by transforming it into BL21 cells along with a guide RNA which will target the tCas9-VP64 to upstream regulatory sites on our reporter construct and activate the expression of GFP. We showed that our tCas9-VP64 fusion is fully functional.
Application:Light-inducible Gene Activation
We construct this new system in prokaryotic cells and to explore the optimal combination of these two techniques in order to enable the most efficient gene regulation with light. We have generated a GFP expression system that is blue light inducible in E. coli. The activation of the GFP gene would require targeting an activator  (vp64) to a sequence upstream of the promoter of GFP. tCas9 allows us to target the promoter of GFP using a guide RNA specific to that sequence.
We also Improved a previous iGEM project
We improved CRY2 ( BBa_K1592015 ) and CIB1 ( BBa_K1592016 ). These biobricks are key BioBrics in "" A live eukaryotic cell based auto-cementation kit "" project of HUST-China 2015. CIB1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, would interact with cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), a blue light stimulated photoreceptor.

To regulate DNA transcription by blue light, the system is based on a two-hybrid interaction in which a light-mediated protein interaction brings together two halves (a binding domain and an activation domain) of a split transcription factor.
We improved the function of CRY2 ( BBa_K1592015 ) and CIB1 ( BBa_K1592016 ) and enter our parts ( BBa_K1982005 and BBa_K1982000 ) in the Registry. Please see the Registry page of this two parts.

Details about apparatus were also put on every Lab our team members may appear. Moreover, we had a special training leading every pre-researchers to good laboratory practice before they undertaking there work in Lab.
In addition, there are a number of lab reagents we required for our project that might be harmful on contact. To reduce the risk of these chemicals, chemical safety sheets were written to inform researchers to work with them safely. As for the UV risk, researchers are required to wear personal protective equipment, such as UV protective goggles.
Public Safety
All the waste, under the guidance of our instructors and advisers, is well taken care of. To have better understanding of public safety protecting, we invited several experienced researcher, including the vice-president of our faculty.
Project Safety
No extra contaminating product nor harmful outputs has been found during the whole process of our research, indicating a reliable design and safe bio-brick parts/devices. Up till now, no safety issues has been raised, whether from our teammates or our instructors.
And, yes, we followed every steps hanged on the Safety Hub. In addition, all the requirement were carefully read, forms like Check-Ins or About Our Lab were completed on time.
Suggestion on Safety
We believe that more concentration should be paid on recyclable bio-consumables which are more environmental friendly than disposable supplies but may cause more safety problems.
Improvement
As is known to all, until iPSC came to light, cell differentiation in vivo is generally differentiated from stem cells as a source of a variety of differentiation, while the animal somatic cells is generally considered not pluripotent. Although. by inducing expression of progenitor cells for the treatment of disease has thus become possible, to give the desired cell line is still inconvenient for the patient.
    That is why we are trying to establish a conceptual cell lines——to design a plasmid controller, which will be stably transfected to cells, and thus to make the cell express different genes induced to differentiate into different cell by the addition of different chemicals. Since, our plasmid controller may have an advance in both cost and efficiency, we wanna make it a gift, for both institute and hospital, which solves the sharp conflicts between doctors and patients. We put this idea into every human practice we hold aiming at rise a wide concentration about conflicts between doctors and patients, to make things cheap and quick.

pFET3
FET3 is an essential element of S. cerevisiae’s iron metabolism. It is a multicopper oxidase which is responsible for iron (Fe(II)) uptake in yeast [Askwith et al 1994] . It is only expressed when intracellular metal levels, such as zinc and iron, are low, and repressed if metal levels are high [Lyons et al 2004] . High iron levels can thereby repress the pFET3-promoter. pFET3 can also be repressed by activation of the PAQR receptor family after binding of its ligand. Introduction of mPRs and addition of progesterone or progesterone-like molecules should induce the PAQR pathway and therefore repress the pFET3 promotor, resulting in a decrease luciferase signal.
pENO2
pENO2 is the promoter of the ENO2 gene encoding  yeast enolase ( BBa_K392001 ). Enolase II plays an important role in glycolysis [Entian KD et al. 1987] . Being a  phosphopyruvate hydratase, it catalyses the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, as well as its opposite reaction during gluconeogenesis. The enolase promoter pENO2 in yeast is therefore glucose-inducible and addition of glucose should increase signal readout.
pGal1
The GAL genes encode for proteins which enable the growth on galactose by converting galactose into glucose. GAL1 codes for the galactokinase which traps galactose inside the cell by phosphorylating C1. The GAL1 promoter is induced in the presence of galactose in the cell and repressed if glucose is present ( BBa_J63006 ).
pADH
The promoter of the ADH gene, coding for the alcohol dehydrogenase [Bennetzen JL and Hall BD 1982] , is a constitutively active promoter, because of which it is often used as a positive control for gene expression ( BBa_J63005 ).
pSUC2
The SUC2 gene codes for a sucrose hydrolysing enzyme. The pSUC2 ( BBa_K950003 ) promoter is heavily repressed by high levels of glucose [Lutfiyya and Johnston 1996] ."

THE IDEA
Our aim in this part of the project is to detect when the yeast starts fermenting. At the end of the project we will be able to “ask”  the yeast if there is still any glucose in the medium or not through the addition of H2O2. Furthermore, we will be able to know for how long the media has been running out of  glucose. In conclusion, this project allows us to know how much time has elapsed since the fermentation began.
To do this, we are going to use two gene constructions:
• The ADH2 promoter is fused to the YAP1 protein coding sequence. The YAP1 protein is a yeast transcription factor regulator of H2O2 adaptive response. It is stored in the cytoplasm in normal conditions and, in the presence of H2O2, it is transported to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. The ADH2 promoter is activated in the absence of glucose.
Thus, complete disappearance of glucose triggers the production of YAP1 in the cytoplasm, and YAP1 concentration increases if the lack of glucose continues. Notice that we are working with a delta-yap1 mutant strain as a recipient of our construct.
• The TRR promoter is fused to the GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein) coding sequence. The green fluorescent protein can be detected by fluorescent emission. The tiorredoxin reductase promoter is activated by two transcriptional factors, YAP1 and SKN7 in the oxidative form. Both of them can only bind to the promoter if H2O2 has been previously added to the culture medium.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time"

Analyzing electrophoresis gel, differences of native IgA protein and  recombinant IgA fused with MstX can be observed. It is extremely important that MstX in this case ensures higher-level yield of integral membrane proteins in E. coli as well.
According to these results, we validated that chosen integral membrane proteins are expressed in cells. In addition to this, their expression in cell-free system could be also expected. Moreover, MstX increases these MPs yield by functioning as a chaperone and enabling our target proteins to fold into their native conformations in the membrane even more efficiently.
Using MstX in cell-free systems is extremely advantageous as it allows effortless protein research without any need for additional protein purification step. Also, this fusion tag is universal as MstX it is compatible with different kinds of membrane proteins. In addition to this, the final task was to refine our cell-free system with MstX in order to make system more efficient and even more suitable for protein research.
To demonstrate that MstX is beneficial to cell-free system not only for membrane protein expression, it was fused with single-chain variable fragment (scFv; Fig. 2). It was decided to do so as scFvs are usually prone to form aggregates and lose their function in vitro. We thought that MstX could stabilize scFvs and prevent aggregation. As a result, we observed that MstX fusion could enhance scFv solubility allowing it to use in cell-free systems.
Fig. 3 Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) expression in IVTT system; SDS-PAGE. M - protein ladder, + - positive control DHFR, 1 - scFv, 2 - MstX-scFv, - negative control (without template DNA)
Analyzing the reaction samples, sediments in scFv were observed, which meant that scFv aggregated. However, in MstX-scFv sample there were no sediments. By analysing electrophoresis results (Fig. 3) it can be seen that MstX prevented formation of the aggregates which resulted in higher scFv expression yield.

Also correct information from doctors and specialists were spread through those videos.             (2)    We held synthetic biology workshops in our university, NCKU, to promote synthetic biology and interdisciplinary cooperation.              for further information, please go to Human Practices

1.    Integrated Human Practices
This summer we proudly hosted iGEM 2016 Asia-Pacific Conference , gathering over 20 teams, 180 iGEMers, from three different regions. During the conference, all teams and iGEMers had the opportunity to present their own project as well as to realize to others' project. In addition, we invited experts and specialists from the fields of industry and media to share their perspectives from the different aspects. It is also good for us to seek the opportunity for university-industry collaboration. Within these campaigns, a great opportunity was offered for iGEMers to interact with each other, and we received a lot of positive good responses! So our team has not only performed the lab work but also gone beyond the lab.
2.    Proof of Concept
To prove that U-KNOW can prevent diabetes by detecting, we performed several Urine Functional Tests .   Our Detection Circuit( BBa_K1920001 ) do differentiate Diabetic urine samples with Control, and the sensitivity can reach 95%, which was already further improved to 100%.
For Safety, we tested our Safety Circuit( BBa_K1920006 ) and proved that our design can protect U-KNOW users as well as the environment from bacteria contamination.
To know more, please look at Result/Proof
3.    Demonstrate Your Work
To bring U-KNOW to the real world condition, we built different versions of device prototypes .             We believe welcome you to become a U-KNOW user, ""Prevention is better than cure"", so easy and early detection by using U-KNOW is helpful for pre-diabetes management.             U-KNOW Makes You Know !

Missouri_Miners,2011,Team:Missouri Miners#EducationalEvents_-_-_TEXT.html," we think synthetic biology is so important and how synthetic biology research can be applied across many disciplines. This not only served as a great recruitment tool for our team, but also helped spread the word about this exciting research.
In-Class Informationals
Our iGEM team collaborated with faculty members in the Biology, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Psychology Departments to give guest presentations in classes, seminars, and meetings. These presentations covered the basics of what synthetic biology and iGEM are all about. We talked about how standard parts work, using legos as an analogy, and the breadth of applications of iGEM projects. We also gave a run-down on some of our team's past research and why being a part of an iGEM team is a great experience, from late nights in the lab to having fun and learning at the Jamboree.
Exploring Synthetic Biology Activities
In April 2011, our iGEM team went to the local high school and presented to their Science Olympiad team about synthetic biology and iGEM. We did an Exploring Synthetic Biology activity with the students and advisors of the Science Olympiad team. The activity explained how different systems could be put together using different parts, and how using different parts yields systems with different functions. The activity also demonstrated the concept of using standardized parts for easy biobrick assembly. Both students and advisors seemed very interested. We were happy to find that both groups learned a lot from our presentation and activity.
Our team also performed the Exploring Synthetic Biology activity with a high school leadership group that was visiting campus. After the event, several of the students expressed interest in participating in iGEM or synthetic biology research in the future.
Speak UP Speak OUT for Synthetic Biology
Missouri S&T's Leadership and Cultural Programs organizes a peer education program called Speak UP Speak OUT. The goal of the program is to facilitate open discussions among students about current and sometimes controversial issues that are relevant to our lives. Our iGEM team suggested synthetic biology as a topic of discussion. During the synthetic biology Speak UP Speak OUT, students from different backgrounds came together to discuss different aspects of synthetic biology. Most students did not even know what synthetic biology was when they arrived. The discussion moved from dangers and benefits of synthetic biology to public perception of synthetic biology, especially in media and worst-case scenario movies. It was an interesting discussion, especially since most students involved had ""outside"" perceptions since they did not have much biology background. At the end of the discussion, the whole group agreed that it was a very interesting topic of discussion and that Speak UP Speak OUT should host another discussion about"

At Bordeaux, our supervisor is not there to tell us what to do or even how to do it. He is there to teach us how to handle our team, how to think for ourselves and act independently. However, he has given us time and effort to make our project come to life and the whole team is greatful!

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," flexible connectors (3-10 residues), but when faced with a long region lacking in secondary structures, they fail to predict an appropriate structure.
To overcome this limitation, we therefore needed to find an innovative method well-suited to predicting the 3D conformation of long IDRs.
The LAAS, Laboratoire d'Analyses et d'Architecture des Systèmes, a French National Scientific Research Centre, developed original approaches for efficient large-scale molecular conformational sampling  and exploration. These methods, recently developed by a colleague of our modelling supervisor and still in press, rely on the modelisation of molecular structures as polyarticulated mechanisms8. Based on this modelisation, efficient algorithms derived from robotics have been adapted to explore molecular rearrangements. These algorithms allow us to avoid expensive molecular modelling methods and to access macromolecular rearrangements, thus overcoming limitations of traditional approaches.
These methods have recently been extended to explore IDRs and generate realistic conformational ensembles, and are integrated into the Psf-Amc library developed at LAAS. By disregarding secondary structure and seeking simply the angles between amino acids in an IDR, their approach builds protein chains incrementally from N- to C-termini. A database of experimentally-determined angles between tripeptides is sampled for each step, and the angle selected in this manner is added to the chain, then checked for collisions.
Two strategies can be used. The first, Single Residue Sampling (SRS), considers each amino acid individually to find appropriate angles, ignoring the residues flanking it (except if it is followed by a proline). The second, Triple Residue Sampling (TRS), takes the neighbouring amino acids into account when selecting the angles to add to the chain. This does require additional constraints applied onto the selection, to respect the angles found when adding the previous amino acid. The TRS strategy requires more calculation time, but is better at finding partially structured regions in the protein chain8.
AzF Building and Parameterization
Incorporating an unnatural amino acid into a protein is a complex task not just for molecular biologists, but also for molecular modellers. Most protein prediction and modelling algorithms use predefined force field parameters for the 20 canonical amino acids, which simplify parameterization. Using AzF meant building the 3D structure and then generating specific parameters for it. Rather than go through this whole pipeline multiple times, we opted to construct it bonded with the DBCO-Fluorescein, the fluorophore that we were using in the wetlab. This proved harder to accomplish than originally planned.

Melanin (MelA)
Melanin, a biological pigment widely found in terrestrial flora and fauna, is a complex oxidation product of amino acid tyrosine. Melanin plays diverse roles in a myriad of organisms. As far as the human is concerned, melanin is the primary determinant of human skin color and pupils or irises of the eyes. It is also an important signal molecule in the human neural system. For microorganisms, melanin would protect them by against ultraviolet radiation effect from sunlight, which is detrimental to most of the organisms.
Due to the fact that the dark pigment derived from MelA gene has extensive wavelength absorbance, we decided to transform MelA gene combined with particular constitute promoter into Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to measure the growth curve and photosynthetic efficiency of it. Based on the well-elaborated procedure provide by IGEM Tokyo Tech 20099, we had intended to replicate their experiment to produce melanin massively first in E. coli, but failed to succeed due to inconsistence of DNA sequence. Therefore, we had no alternative but to turn to DNA synthesis and directly transform MelA gene ligated with our backbone into microalgae.

Astaxanthin (CrtW & CrtZ)
Astaxanthin is a high value and natural pink pigment which can be found in microalgae, yeast and some sea creatures. It is special due to its antioxidant activity and has been suggested being beneficial in cardiovascular, immune, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases and skin health.  Although it has lots of benefits, astaxanthin is still a product result in a minority amount in the carotenoid synthesis pathway compare with other carotenoid families and yet, the artificial chemical synthesis cost high and result in the least production.
Astaxanthin synthesis does not naturally exist in the S. elongatus PCC7942. But fortunately, after literature review, we found out that S. elongatus PCC7942 has a similar pathway with other microalgae which can synthesize astaxanthin, and the only difference is, S. elongatus PCC7942 lack of two necessary gene: beta-carotene ketolase (crtW) and beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtZ) to undergo this pathway.10, 11 Thus, we used IDT service to synthesize these two genes and construct it on pPIGBACK,"

6/29/2015: Day 20
We started to reiteration process. So THUS BEGAN PAPER PROTOTYPE ROUND 2!!!!! We spent much of the day brainstorming and discussing possible new designs with Orit and the rest of the team. To be honest here, I have a love/hate relationship with paper prototypes. But trust me people, paper prototypes are super important and necessary when designing interfaces. They are so so important, and a lot of thought and detail is put into these prototypes that are valuable when designing the real thing.
6/30/2015: Day 21
A Wellesley alum came to visit us in the lab. She has been in the design industry for a while and gave a lot of great insight and feedback while brainstorming. After having a great discussion with her and  reflecting on a lot of her suggestions, the team and I iterated again, the paper prototype. Finally towards the end of the day, we finally came up with the current iteration of our paper prototype.
7/1/2015: Day 22
Today, Natalie came to visit our lab. We gave her a short presentation about our project and then she looked at our paper prototype. She gave us a lot of suggestions and feedback for us, and it was super helpful to have someone who is a synthetic biologist to come in and look over our project. The other interns came today as well. We spent most of the day filming our paper prototype. We also sent a video of our new paper prototype in action to The Tech today as well. Casey, who has worked in the lab previously and has participated in previous iGEMS also came into as they are helping us with a lot of the graphics for our project.
7/2/2015: Day 23
Today we worked on finishing up our paper prototype as well as editing our word choice and phrasing of words. We also went to the CS/Math/Physics lecture today during lunch time. The editing and word choice was pretty in depth and very detail oriented so it took us a while to determine all the phrasings in the project that are going to be used.
7/7/2015: Day 24
Casey came and visited us. We talked about design and we also discussed the challenges with our design. They had some really good sketches planned out already which is super exciting. I always wished I was super good a drawing and designing, and I was super amazed by how awesome Casey is! ! ! !

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#criticalThinking_-_-_TEXT.html,"-natural human? By the proportion of gene modified or by the number of genes modified, that is a question.
We are really glad to see Merry Lin and Yaobin Ouyang who have a better understanding about jurisprudence and philosophy. And we had communication with them too. There is not doubt that without their help, there won’t be any thing about the critical thinking of law related to gene technology as we will mention below.
Dialogue with experts in biology
In order to have a more clear understanding about how China government regulate drug development, we have an interview with Doctor Huang, a teacher who has medical science background and specialize in biology. According to the conversation with Doctor Huang, we know that the review conducted by the official organization puts more emphases on the formal procedure. The review procedure is so comprehensive that it always takes a longer time than some developed countries to permit the new medicine to come to market.
And Doctor Huang also told us that only if we can make any progress in reducing drug toxicity, lowering drug price, and identifying therapeutic targets, then we succeed. However, she also mentioned that gene therapy is a technique full with dangerousness and controversy. Up until now, there are not brand safe and effective means in delivering the therapeutic gene in clinical trials because each method has its shortage. For instance, adeno-associated viruses don’t integrate DNA into the chromosome while the lentivirus do, which was spoken highly of for its efficiency and was censured for its possibility causing inserted oncogenous mutation.
Finally she encourages us just to do it and don’t worry too much about its application limited by disadvantage compared to existing chemicals, because elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of myocardial ischemic using synthetic biology alerting signal transduction pathway is something remarkable. As you find the way you alter signal transduction pathway work, you can try to alter many other pathways, most of which lead to lesion of our body like the rheumatism, based on the bio-bricks you made.
Dialogues with law experts
In order to have a better understanding about law and regulation actuality in China, we have an long talk with Shiwen Zhou, professor of South China University of Technology, who has written a book called strategic studies in the patent protection of gene and gene resources, is good at teaching and scientific research of Civil and Commercial Law and Intellectual Property Law.
She once worked in Guangdong Higher People's Court as a judge and has great experience in judicial work in Intellectual Property Law. As a visiting scholar of American Pacific University and Visiting Professor in McCain George School of Law, she provided us with a full-scale perspective of gene technology"

CCA_San_Diego,2017,Team:CCA San Diego#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," containers, oil deposits, and landfills contributing to PAH contamination can be targeted for bioremediation efforts. Centers for remediation efforts may use our bacteria to degrade specific PAH compounds within groundwater in the affected areas.
Byproduct Management
Industrial byproducts may be filtered into waste management treatments in order for bioremediation process to target phenanthrene, fluorene, and even naphthalene compounds located in industrial waste products like plastics, pesticides, and oil products.
Hazard Identification
Growth of CCA_San_Diego’s bacteria in PAH contaminated water environments signifies the existence of contaminants in reservoir systems in the absence of a carbon source. Future combination of an identification system as well as our pathway can be used for contamination identification.
Reaction Completion Identification
For future research design, reporter plasmids can be used to identify the intermediates of salicylate and phthalate in order to signify the completion of degradation of PAHs for efficient and quick processing of contaminated water.
Why hasn’t this been done before?
There are several enzymes involved in the PAH upper catabolic pathway. The aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds is typically initiated by oxygenases that catalyze the incorporation of two oxygen atoms into the aromatic ring followed by a dehydrogenation reaction catalyzed by dehydrogenases. Theses enzymes are designated RHDO (ring hydroxylating dioxygenases). The dioxygenases responsible for the first step in the aerobic oxidation of lower molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. naphthalene, biphenyl, benzene, and certain other aromatic compounds, share many similarities with genes for which the sequence is known. In contrast, there is little information about bacterial genes encoding proteins for the degradation of higher molecular weight PAH such as phenanthrene and fluorene.
What are we doing?
To be able to degrade as many aromatic compounds as possible, our approach involves converging the various degradation pathways and augmenting the genes, which is possible through common intermediates. To that end, we would clone the genes upstream of the common intermediates and introduce them into a bacteria that would already contain one or more degradation pathways already containing genes downstream of the intermediates. The host strain already has a piece of the pathway, and by a process of engineering, we are augmenting its gene pool and its capacity to degrade.
In the first phase of our research, a comprehensive literature and genome search was conducted to identify microorganisms with published annotated genes capable of degrading the most abundant PAH in crude oils.
In the second phase, operons were designed as synthetic"

Spider Silk
Spider silk consists of repetitive sequences which account for often more than 90% of its structure. Repetitive sequences are located in the middle of the whole spider silk protein. The terminals of the protein are nonrepetitive and assemble spider silk proteins into fibers. Spider silk has unique properties. It has high resilience and it is not only strong but also elastic1. However, spiders can't be farmed, which makes spider silk production difficult2. Spider silk has been produced synthetically in several host organisms, such as bacteria, yeast, plants, and silkworms3.

Binding with CBM and KBD
Natural dyes have problems with the color fading. To solve that, we created constructs with chromoproteins linked to binding domains. With the help of the binding domains, chromoproteins will bind to the desired surfaces better and stay on them longer.
The cellulose binding module we used is CBM3 from Clostridium thermocellum that is thermostable in high temperatures, which makes it ideal to use with our heat-dependent purification protocol. CBM enables the binding to cellulose-based materials such as cotton in our textile-oriented approach. Cellulose-based materials are used in many forms, e.g. plastic-like materials, which makes it possible to use our dyeing method in other applications than just textiles.

In a perfect model the validation sets will be identical, but this is never the case because of various noise. We have in this plot estimate that we have a limit of quantification of 50mM (+-20%) ethanol and a limit of detection of about 12.5mM ethanol.
Matrix plot over the samples spectra that we try to determine ethanol concentration in. Quite similar right :-)
Bar plot over the predicted values with deviation, to the left we have a series of samples from cultures containing the ethanol and butanol constructs under various conditions, to the right we have samples from cultures containing a non functional ethanol construct
Numerical values for above graph
The results are not too good to be honest but they gives an indication of the ethanol concentrations. There is a clear difference between the functional and non functional inserts. The model is not fitted for butanol but seems to be able to detect also larger alcohols, to avoid this these alcohols/contaminants have to be included in the calibration-set. A bit surprising is the lack of difference between the IPTG induced and non induced samples, this can mean that our promoter is leaking. Maybe our M15 strain doesn't contain the lac repressor after all.

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," order to fulfill its use. There is a possibility here that the bacteria becomes endemic in the environment during the test, causing lethal or severe damage to animals, plants or humans before one could destroy the bacteria. The St Andrews team then proceeded to discuss the ethical duty and responsibility of GEMs. Questions such as who defines what life is, and whether scientists alone should define life, were discussed by St Andrews. The controversial concept of scientist playing god through synthetic biology was discussed, emphasizing the issue that scientist might end up modifying biological systems before they properly understand them. Dual-use dilemma was discussed in which the nuclear fission experiments in 20th Century was used as an example.
St Andrews used the last part of their presentation to explain that though these issues are pressing there are many ways that they can be prevented. It is foremost, for scientist worldwide to be primarily concerned with the protection of the public. In actual fact Bioterrorism is realistically not a big threat because there are large amounts of resources required to synthesize and produce a virulent strain of bacteria/virus. In addition, the risk of colonization of synthetic bacteria is also very small, as they would most likely be out competed by their naturally occurring counterparts in an open environment. Using the kill switch (which the St Andrews iGEM team 2011 has built) as an example, cell level safeguards, along with laboratory protocols and transportation procedures can be tailored to substantially eliminate any big threat in Synthetic Biology.
The Response
A lot of interesting questions were raised after the presentations. Among them where issues on patenting, and someone had read an inaccurate representation of a scientific discovery/breakthrough in the press. The Dundee team emphasized the danger of incorrect coverage of science in the media. There was a suggestion that Synthetic Biology could have a fact check website, like politics have, where journalists could evaluate the credibility of media’s coverage on a topic.

UMaryland,2015,Team:UMaryland#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," study lutein production, she told us that, while her experience with lutein itself was limited, she was well informed about retinal health and some of the causes of macular degeneration.  From our conversation, we learned that age-related macular degeneration can be attributed to a few factors: smoking, immune responses based on bacterial infections, genetics, and, as its name suggests, aging. She also supported the notion that lutein is an effective vitamin supplement to help maintain and improve ocular health.
Columbia, Maryland
Our next interview was with Dr. Nosheen Ahmed. While Dr. Esumi had more experience with the tissue cells that cause AMD when dysfunctional, Dr. Ahmed had more experience with the disease itself, its symptoms, its common treatments, how it affects the lives of patients, etc.  From the interview with Dr. Ahmed, we learned that a good prevention method for those at risk for AMD is a change in lifestyle habits. For example, quitting smoking, minimizing computer use, and improving one's diet all could benefit eye health. Optometrists recommend a lot of leafy greens and dark vegetables, which contain a variety of carotenoids, including lutein. Dr. Ahmed stated that not many studies has been done with lutein but there is a consensus it has a positive effect on AMD.  She also discussed that many patients will not recognize AMD as it develops. As the vision decreases or spotting occurs, they think they may only need glasses. More research is needed for the disease and potential treatments as well as vitamins like lutein which can help.
Bioprocess Scale-up Facility
As part of our side project on the biosynthesis of lutein and to acquire a better understanding of the challenges facing synthetic biology entrepreneurs in moving their project from a proof of concept to an industrial level we visited the University of Maryland Bioprocess Scale-up Facility . BSF is a facility at the University of Maryland which provides training and is contracted by biotechnology companies in the region to optimize and prove scale up of their biosynthesis and fermentation processes to the industrial level. They kindly allowed us to tour the facility and learn about some of the unique challenges involved in reaching industrial size in a bioprocess. Gaining a greater appreciation for this both informed and invigorated our goal of making synthetic biology cheaper, safer, and more affordable for community DIY labs and entrepreneurs.

When we left Hannover Monday morning, we decided to stop by in Bielefeld to meet the rest of their team. This way they too got to test our OD and fluorescence measurement device and we got to eat some delicious ribes cake :)
Five hours later, we left the Bielefeld team to eat some incredibly spicy pizza and continue our journey back home to Aachen. On the Autobahn we took the time to write down all experiences and things we learned to share them with our team in the coming days.
tl;dr: We had an awesome trip to the Maker Faire Hannover, presented our devices to hundreds of people and met the teams Braunschweig and Bielefeld.
If you like to see more about our weekend have a look at the following gallery =)

After this short description of misused biological components there is still the question what impact biological warfare will have in the future of mankind.
Broad avilibility of knowledge
n the life sciences information has allways been freely acessible for everybody who is interested in the results of a particular research project. The combination of this global availibility with the new possibilities of the internet broad for literature search and availibility of gene sequences made it easiere to collect informations for a possible misuse.
For the overwhelming majority this open availibility is absolutely desirely but on the other hand there are also examples of research results that bear a very high risk to be misused.
Following we present the three most controversial discussed publications that could also be read as a ""How to create your own bioweapon"".
Mousepox Virus in Australien
The Australian research group around Jackson et al. ; 2001 16 inserted the coding region of the IL-4 gne into the genome of mousepox. They hoped to create a virus that sterilizes mice and thus provides a means for pest control. Contrarely to their expectations they had created a superstrain that killed even naturally resistent mice and mice that had been vaccinated against normal mousepox. This discovery could potentially be used to make smallpox resistant to potential vaccines.
Synthesis of a Polio Virus

Public outreach
Radio
On the 9.06 we were interviewed by one of the leading radio channels in Israel.
We explained about synthetic biology, and presented our project.
nAccording to poles there are 330,000 listeners on average.
Social networks (FB, Twitter)
In addition to reaching out to people based locally and across the country, we wanted to communicate with people on a global scale. To achieve this; we utilised Facebook and Twitter to reach fellow iGEM teams, friends, family and indeed anybody who is interested in what we had to say! We posted news articles, updates on our progress, and more.
In total, we gained 3,674 followers on Facebook, and 214 followers on Twitter.
The majority of people who liked us on Facebook were based in Israel, but we also had plenty of ‘likes’ from people all across the globe.
Movie
We invested a lot of time and effort to think about the movie motive that will enable us to reach out to as wider audience.              For many people, synthetic biology might be horrid, scary, difficult, and complicated. But through movies, we're trying to put a new point of view of synthetic biology, where people will be able to visualize the idea and creates exciting adventure in their mind.              In the movie we also explained about the competition and our project.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," CO2 into methane. Both substrates were intimately linked with our project: the CO2 was the sustainability problem we had to tackle, while methane was a substrate that could be processed by our Alkane Metabolism pathway. Seeing this connection, we asked for their permission to borrow their construct design to improve our system overall.
Originally, we meant to use E. coli bacteria to secrete laccase for PE plastic degradation and Shewanella, stored in the MFC, to house the alkane channel and alkane metabolism pathway. However, to integrate insights from both Professor Bookhart and the HKJS_S team, we decided to change our final system design into one single Bacterial Artificial Chromosome, so that our individual systems could be housed in one single cell to increase the automation of our project. This modification will be implemented upon successful attempts on PE degradation and Alkane metabolism. The new schematic is as follows:
As usual, laccase degrades PE into alkanes (refer to our PE degredation page for details). The AlkL gene (coding for Alkane outer membrane channel protein) allows larger alkanes to enter the transformed Shewanella and the ASS cluster allows the cell to process it (please see our Alkane metabolism page for details). In addition, we added a nitrogenase gene to convert the CO2 products into methane. The idea is that since methane can also be processed by the ASS cluster, CO2 produced by Shewanella during respiration can be recycled into the MFC system.
According to our modelling, carbon dioxide can be converted into methane after undergoing reduction process, in which the molecule uses the energy from the sun/catalyst to break up the CO2 molecule into carbon and oxygen atoms, then combine with hydrogen to form methane and water, as explained on the chemical equation below.
Using irreversible Henri-Michaelis-Menten Kinetics, we tried to consolidate an enzyme-catalyzed reaction with a single reaction and and reaction rate equation with Vmax of 0.8 ± 0.07 nmol/min and a Km for CO2 of 23.3 ± 3.7 mM [1].
From this graph, it can be seen that it takes over 3 hours to fully convert 10 nmol of CO2 into methane. It appears to verify that common features of homogeneous catalysts for CO2 reduction to CH4 are low reaction rates (e.g., turnover frequencies) and limited number of turnovers (e.g., turnover number) before inactivation of the catalyst [2].
Since laccase takes about 80 days"
SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," local feedback loop of the final product's cGMP level is a regulator of sGC desensitization. In the hypothesis that cGMP may not be a direct inhibitor of sGC activity, it may be the second messenger that generates negative feedback. We assume that NO separated from sGC and D2 becoming D1 are cGMP mediated processes. In our model, the rate constant of D2 returning to D1 can be expressed as:
k4=K4[cGMP]m
K4 is constant. Here, we assume that k4 is mth order of cGMP concentration, where m is the feedback strength of cGMP.
Summarizing the analysis of sGC kinetics above, we using differential equation to describe the whole process:
Let D1=[D1]/[D0], D3=[D3]/[D0], D2=[D2]/[D0]. Meanwhile, we assume that the total concentration of sGC is constant, that is to say D1+D3+D2=1.
We suppose that the NO is immediately consumed when NO is separated from the D2 or leaves the sGC, and generate other substances that make NO no longer free but produce other biochemical components. Thus the result of NO-sGC interaction is that NO have a net loss. The total consumption rate of NO including NO binding sGC can be approximated as a first order kinetic equation:
Here, Lno is the total amount of NO in cells and in the outside, which represens the available amount NO in physiological or experimental conditions, t is time; Kno express the total consumption rate constant of NO, which reflects the bioactivity of NO.
2.2 cGMP's synthesis and degratation
Since the synthesis of cGMP is after sGC(D2)'s forming which has catalytic activity, we assume the yield of cGMP generated from GTP mainly depends on the degree of D2’s activity. cGMP's life is determined by PDE5A's multiple subtypes. PDE5A can be hydrolyzed to GMP. The process of production and degradation can be modeled by Michealis equation:
Supposing that GTP is abundant, the yield of cGMP mainly depend on the concentration of sGC. Studies suggested PDE5A with different substrate affinity、subcellular's position and kinetic properties can catalysis cGMP's hydrolysis. cGMP's balance equation is:
d[cGMP]/dt = VsGC,maxD2- VPDE,max[cGMP"

All the primers have arrived. We conducted PCR using these primers (12 pairs, 4 systems, 3 parts/groups).
The part of LeuB had been contracted so we can start to connect a loop to test leuB from today. Firstly we did the enzyme digestion for leuB, No3 and K115001 (T vector). We made three tubes of No.6 in TB liquid medium for shaking-incubation and determined the concentration of No.8, then condensed it.
9-8
Contract the plasmids form No.6 and check yesterday’s result of enzyme digestion by gel electrophoresis. The result showed no problem. Then we conducted large scale collection of T vector and determined its concentration. Besides, we did the ligation of leuB and No.3, and condensed No.8 part and did the ligation of it with plasmid of No.6 (concentration determined in advance) and leuB. The sites of digestion were: ⑥（E,S）；⑥（X,P）;leu(X,P);⑧（E,S）；In the meantime we use primers to conduct PCR of the part which were not successfully standardized yesterday.
In the afternoon we observed fluorescent protein in induced loop II.
Transformation of RFP-PSB1C3 was finished for further ligation.
We also reserved 18-3&11-16.
9-9
We tested the enzyme digestion result of No.8, No.6 and leuB by gel-electrophoresis and it showed no problem. So we continued to conduct the ligation of 8&6 and 6&leuB.
9-10
Today we conducted the transformation and coating of 8&6 and leuB. In the afternoon we inoculated leuB&3 from plat dishes to LB liquid medium for shaking incubation.  In the test of loop by fluorescence, we cultured RFP-expressed bacteria in LB liquid medium for overnight and observed under fluorescent microscope. It showed a weak red color. We added IPTG into the bacilli and the red color became more obvious after 2 hours. And the control group did not show any changes, proving that RFP was normal. The over-all result of the fluorescence test of loops showed obvious fluorescence in loop I and weak fluorescence in loop II. Thus, we still doubted the problem was on No."

Imagine an undercover agent exposing his id, who is going to commit suicide by taking a poisonous substance. What components in the substance could be and in what situation the agent would trigger the suiciding process.
Back to the view of a microbial cell, normally, a cell has a programmed suicide or defending mechanism to response to unfavorable environments or to outcompete other organisms.
What have iGEMers done?
Lysis gene [ BBa_K117000 ] created by NTU-Singapore in 2008 encodes Lysis protein which could not only lyse bacterial cell membrane but also activate the endonuclease of Colicin E7 (ColE7). The lysis-colicin is one class of bacteriocins which are produced to response to worsening environmental conditions and outcompete other bacteria1
NucA [ BBa_K1159105 ] created by TU-Munich in 2013 from Staphylococcus aureus produces a thermostable exo- and endo-nuclease that is able to degrade genomic DNAs2. NucA also has a role in the cleavage of extracellular DNAs and preventing biofilm formation.

Triggering the suicide circuit
In our case of sugar hijacking, ideally, the tiny, living “agents” are supposed to kill themselves in the story to make a happy ending. Therefore, we introduced a glucose responsive elements and a repressor circuit to be connected to suicide genes (lysis and NucA).
Promoter Pcar [ BBa_K861171 ] is a glucose responsive promoter created by WHU-China in 2012. Pcar promoter region was de novo  designed with overlapping of CRP and RNA polymerase binding site. The initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase may be hindered by the binding of CRP, which occurs at the formation of cAMP-CRP complex in the low concentration of glucose. In other words, when the amount of glucose is high enough, Pcar would be turned on after the leaving of"

Directed Evolution of Educational Outreach
Bringing synthetic biology and the iGEM projects in contact with the public is a relevant part of the iGEM competition. In order to reach various interested groups, we conducted several activities to increase our public outreach. However, providing information about synthetic biology and scientific projects is often afflicted with several difficulties. Our experience in public relations especially with young people at the pupils’ academy and the nonscientific audience at the NRW day 2016 shows, that explaining synthetic biology and iGEM projects understandable is very complicated and not always successful. This incomprehension could lead to disinterest or refusal. Similar to our project “Evobodies – Molecular Speed Dating”, an optimal adaption to the target is essential in public communication. Different target groups require various approaches of interaction.
To optimize our public and educational outreach we considered possibilities to reach non-scientific and young people. In conversation with a cultural anthropologist of Frankfurt´s Goethe University we discussed possibilities.
