Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"1). If humans are ever to live on the surface of Mars, the problem of radiation must be addressed.
While there are many proposed solutions to mitigating this radiation for astronauts or other life forms on the surface, one strategy that has not yet been studied extensively is the use of lipids to block radiation. Lipids could be especially useful at blocking galactic cosmic rays because of their high hydrogen density. According to Jonathan Pellish, a space radiation engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, ""The best way to stop particle radiation is by running that energetic particle into something that's a similar size."" (Frazier 2015). Because galactic cosmic rays consist of high energy protons and neutrons, the best way to block it would be with hydrogen which has a nucleus similar in size. The high hydrogen content of plastics is already being investigated at NASA where plastics and other trash is being compacted into tiles with the hope that they will provide increased radiation protection. Lipids are similar in structure and hydrogen density to plastics and so we investigated the possibility of creating lipids to shield our habitat from galactic cosmic rays.To this end our team identified a species of filamentous fungus which produces more lipids than other species, Mucor circinelloides (Xia et al. 2011). We considered incorporating this species of fungus into our structure to increase the radiation protective abilities. Our team took some pictures of this species under a phase contrast microscope that can be seen below.

We were not able to test the radiation protection abilities of this species but believe it could be promising. Our collaborating team, DTU, also sought to reduce radiation damage by increasing production of melanin, a pigment effective against solar radiation in the form of ultraviolet absorbtion (Brenner 2008). The results of their work can be seen on their wiki: DTU iGEM

However, because the repression efficiency of cI is significantly higher than that of LacIM1, cI effectively shuts off LacI expression while the LacIM1 concentration is below the threshold required to repress GFP production. This difference between the cI and LacIM1 repression efficiencies, in combination with a feed-forward loop that begins with LuxR and culminates in GFP, affords the circuit the desired non-monotonic response to AHL dosages.

2.Preparation for competent B. subtilis cells
Streak out the strain to be made competent on an LB or TBAB agar plate as a large patch and incubate overnight at 30 ℃. The following morning scrape off the cell growth off the plate and use to inoculate fresh, pre-warmed, SpC medium to give an OD600 reading of about 0.5. Incubate the culture at about 37℃ with vigorous aeration and take periodic OD readings to assess cell growth. When the rate of cell growth is seen to depart from exponential inoculate 200ml of pre-warmed, SpⅡmedium with 2ml of stationary-phase culture and continue incubation at 37℃ with slower aeration. After 90min incubation, pellet the cells by centrifugation at room temperature. Carefully decant the supernatant into a sterile container and save. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 18ml of saved supernatant and add 2ml of sterile glycerol; mix gently. Aliquot the competent cells in sterile tubes, freeze rapidly in liquid nitrogen or a dry-ice bath and store at -70℃.

Furthermore, hyperglycemia can also cause the filtration in the glomerular to accelerate, which leads to its hypertrophy. As the function of kidney is gradually damaged, it can no longer eliminate the deleterious substances from our body. With urea and creatinine surging, a person could eventually end up in renal failure. From above, we can get a conclusion that diabetes is surely a thorny chronic disease that we should be cautious of.
But, Dr. Wu also said that each part of the endocrine system in our body have its own balance mechanism. It doesn’t make any sense that you can prevent diabetes by just having a non-sugar diet since the mechanism of diabetes is far more complicated than we can envisage.
“Why not orient your product to the purpose of losing weight?” He told us. For those who love confections and for those in the meantime yearning to stay in a great stature, how they can reduce the consumption of sugar is sure to be a topic of significant importance. As long as the effect of our product is testified, welfare is sure to be brought to the society. However, he also gave us a warning. Hypoglycemia, which may put a man to death in a very short time, is what we should face prudently. What he said, again, make us realize the very importance of the suicide control system designed in our product.
   After the interview with Dr. Wu, we had a thorough discussion. Yes, exactly, it is comparatively difficult to control the concentration of blood glucose. Therefore, We decided to position the main aim of our project to weight losing, and thus, we’re soon heading for another interview with a fitness instructor,whose work is related to weight control.

After we had a discussion with Dr. Wu, we changed our aim from controlling diabetes to losing weight. Since weight losing is nothing more than controlling the diet and exercising for most people, we soon contacted with a fitness coach and paid a visit to his workshop, so as to learn the relation between them and our project.
While we are conversing with the coach, we had a heart full of doubt: Where’s the dumbbells or treadmills we usually see in a gym? After we consult the coach, he told us that the main point of “fitness"

DESCRIPTION OF OUR PROJECT
The goal of this project is to engineer a biological circuit that utilizes E. coli plasmid DNA sequences and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter to detect arsenic. The constitutive promoter in our construct produces a regulatory protein ArsR that binds with arsenic ions and triggers visible fluorescence. Our team will demonstrate this circuit using a cell-free lateral flow paper-based system. Ultimately, the purpose of this circuit will be to provide an inexpensive and ubiquitous arsenic sensor for testing environmental samples. ​
Goal #1
Design and create a synthetic biological circuit containing a reporter protein regulated by arsenic ions.
Goal #2
Demonstrate that the circuit can detect arsenic in solution in cells or using cell-free lysates.
Goal #3
Determine the conditions needed for cell-free lysates to detect EPA limits for harmful concentrations of arsenic.
why we chose arsenic
Arsenic was selected by Cadets2Vets as the first chemical we would attempt to detect using a biological circuit. It is naturally found in the environment, especially in groundwater, and around industrial plants as a byproduct of manufacturing practices.​
The detection of arsenic is especially important to team members in the Puget Sound area, because North Tacoma is a Superfund Site. The ASARCO smelting company smokestack, erected in 1917, was a symbol of economic prosperity and booming business in the developing city of Tacoma. The copper smelting site on Ruston’s shore in Puget Sound brought jobs and wealth to the area. Unfortunately, over the course of its 100 years of operation, the plant had been"

Throughout out our project we kept a detailed and through notebook and timeline. We found that having a daily, weekly, and monthly structure greatly helped in our time management. As we are a team in the Southern Hemisphere, we undertook our project during university semesters and thus effective time management was critical in helping us balance university, iGEM, work, and everything else.
Example of our week-by-week schedule
Every day in the lab we would begin by asking ourselves what needed to be done that day and in what order. After every day we evaluated our progress and asked ourselves four questions -
What did we achieve?
How efficient were we?
What can we improve on?
What is the plan for tomorrow
Thus, we knew exactly what experiments needed to be done on each day. This allowed us to work faster and more efficient, it also created an easy transition between the different lab members as one member could pick up where the other left off without having to chase them down to find out the important information about the past experiment.
Furthermore, we had weekly meetings and the occassinal skype session.
William Ramsay once said:
""Progress is made by trial and failure; the failures are generally a hundred times more numerous than the successes ; yet they are usually left unchronicled""
This was not the case for our team as we sought to extensively chronicle all the successes and failures. We hope our observations and troubleshooting will help future iGEM teams.

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#ApproachA_-_-_TEXT.html," The Tar receptor on the left, senses a specific molecule and induces a fast phosphorylation cascade. This results in a change in the rotational bias of the flagellum, i.e. the proportion of CW vs CCW rotations.
The underlying pathway of the first approach is the natural bacterial chemotaxis pathway. Chemotaxis is the mechanism underlying the movement of bacteria along a concentration gradient. E. coli swim mainly with their flagella, which can adopt two separate modes of rotation: counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW), resulting in a straight run forward or a tumble to change direction, respectively. The binding of the ligand to the Tar receptor induces a fast phosphorylation cascade via CheA and CheY followed by a decrease in the bacterium’s natural tumbling frequency, i.e. its bias towards the CCW rotation (see Fig.1).     To utilize this process as a biosensor, we tethered the bacteria specifically at their flagella to a glass surface.[1] For this, we coated the glass surface with an antibody specific for the flagellar protein FliC. The antibody binds to the surface due to intermolecular interactions with the silica. [2] The tethering results in a translation of the flagellar rotation into a rotation of the whole bacterial body (see Fig. 2). Hence, a change in ligand concentration directly influences the rotational bias of the tethered bacteria.
This figure shows a cartoon of a tethered bacterium. The cell is specifically tethered to the glass surface at its flagellum. This translates the flagellar rotation into a spinning of the whole bacterial body.
The natural chemotaxis pathway contains an adaptation system, consisting of the proteins CheR and CheB, which respectively methylate or demethylate the Tar receptor, depending on the ligand concentration in the environment. This system allows the bacteria to adjust their receptor sensitivity continuously. CheR and CheB react in the order of a few seconds. Hence, the expected signal of rotational bias is a continuous CCW rotation right after induction, which persists for several seconds to a few minutes depending on the size of the step change of the concentration and re-adapts to the initial value (see Model Link).  Through image analysis, this information can be directly used as the output of the biosensor.
Imaging

Modeling Example: Sunlight Responsor System
Here we raise an example of a specific device models, which includes the source of the device, its formulae with numerical solutions, and comparison with our experiment data as a test of model. We provide this example to better explain the modeling function of our software, and we make further error analysis to examine the accuracy of our models, as an effective proof.
System Overview
This system consists of a sunlight (UVB) sensor and a toggle switch, which is our combination of the two mentioned structures.
The E.coli will produce GFP protein without sunlight while they will produce YFP protein under sunlight. As the sunlight sensor, it has a coding sequence of UVR8-TetR protein. This protein can join into a dimer which can act like the TetR dimer to induce the promoter TetR. When the E.coli is exposed to sunlight, the UVR8-TetR protein dimer will become a monomer so that the promoter TetR will not be induced.
Circuit Graph
Formulae
Assume that
, which is a t-based function that represents the trend of UVB, to serve as the human-defined condition of the whole device. The whole equation group is shown as below, obeying the rule system we introduced in the former modeling page:
In which we introduce five Eigen functions, signaled as χ , to help make judge of certain terms in equations. Thus when the symbol substance appears, the χ function value will equals to 1, making sense of the term including it; otherwise χ function value equals to 0. By Eigen functions we create the switch of important conditions or changes of some chemicals or necessary structures in equations, to reach the flexibility for users to lead in or move out something in the circuits.

Flagella
Biobrick assembly and sequence
We succesfully assembled the biobrick K343004 , which consists of the TetR repressible promoter R0040 followed by the ribosome binding site B0034, the coding sequence K343000 and the terminators B0010 and B0012.
This was achieved through ""standard"" silver assembly and confirmed via sequencing with biobrick verification forward 2 (VF2) and verification reverse (VR) primers.
Sequencing results for K343004
When comparing the theoretical sequence with the sequence done on the part K343004 the two sequences were identical.
Effect
Our results from the motility assay with semi-solid agar confirm that the biobrick does in fact increase the motility of the cells. We believe this is caused by hyperflagellation facilitated by the overexpression of the flhD/C operon.
The stability of pSB1C3-K343004 is most likely <20 generations, however the stability of pSB3T5-K343004 was not determined.
The growth assay showed no significant difference between the wild type and the cells containing either pSB1C3-K343004 or pSB3K3-K343004.
In a phase contrast microscope we observed that MG1655 containing pSB1C3-K343004 was longer that wild type. This support the theory that the cells are hyperflagellated and therefore stays longer in the G2-phase in the cell cycle.    For further information, raw data and background of the assay see characterization of K343004 .

Biobrick assembly and sequence
We succesfully assembled the biobrick K343006 , which consists of the TetR repressible promoter R0040 followed by the ribosome binding site B0034, the coding sequence K343002 and the terminators B0010 and B0012.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," From a public perspective point of view we discussed the need to stress the fact our system is simply a modification of ""natural"" processes - that is we are only modifying bacteria native to the tailings ponds, not introducing new organisms to the environment. To further address safety concerns, we also need to emphasize the multiple layers of biological and physical control that we plan to design.
Follow-Up Interviews
Our second iteration of interviews were conducted once we had a more concrete product built. The purpose of these interviews was to see whether we had successfully addressed the concerns of the first iteration interviews. We also wanted to see whether any new issues with the design existed, which would provide us with potential future directions to take FRED and OSCAR. Kelly Roberge, an independent oil consultant, suggested we investigate ways of dealing with the clay and silt particles in tailings pond water that would enter our bioreactor system.  This can be a major problem since these mature fine tailings have a thick consistency that could clog the system.
Kelly Roberge, of K. Roberge Consulting Ltd. Discussing Bioreactor Improvements
We spoke to Kelly Roberge of K. Roberge Consulting Ltd. who is an independent consultant for the oil sands focusing on mature fine tailings (MFT). He mentioned that in the past 4 years, there has been an increase in looking at biological techniques in the oil sands for remediation, both in understanding natively present microbial life as well as introducing engineered systems.
The major concerns that he had with our present design were issues with scale-up. These were things such as the amount of toxins that would have to be processed to provide constant generation of product, residence time in the bioreactor, as well as the ability for our system to be scaled up to an industrial size. Though we still have much research to do toward this goal of reaching industrial capacity, we did a model scale-up experiment of OSCAR by growing the PetroBrick containing E. coli in our model bioreactor system. The results of this experiment can be found on our Synergy page.
In addition, there was a concern raised with the composition of the tailings themselves, due to the mature fine tailings sludge (MFT). In the future we should look at addressing  the capacity of OSCAR to deal with these MFT components. Some suggestions that were made would be to utilize OSCAR in parallel with MFT settling techniques or with runoff water from the tailings drying processes. The sensitivity of our system to these fine tailings and to bitumen would also have to be evaluated and made"
NAU-CHINA,2017,Team:NAU-CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"  morbidity is, vomitoxin content is almost in 1500~1600ppm. Last year the situation is relatively more serious, the wheat vomitoxin content is about 7500ppm. While the EU criteria on the vomitoxin stipulate the vomitoxin should be less than 1000ppm.
2. What is the cause of wheat scab disease?
——the incidence of wheat scab has a great relationship with weather,the growth of winter wheat cultivated in Jiangsu province depends on the next year April’s weather. Although China has an old poverb ""Man will conquer nature"", but people engaged in farming industry will substantiate that people will never conquer the nature . The yield and morbidity of wheat  are sheer dependent on the weather . Once the wheat scab occurs , there is no other way back.
3.What are the dominant ways to control wheat scab?
——Spraying pesticides in the blossoming stage of wheat. When wheats are about to blossom, we will spray pesticide on every single wheat we see. Another massive scale spray will be expected to  need  at the 10% to 15% of blossoming stage. During the entire growth cycle, we will have to control the times of pesticide utilization, generally it is no more than three times. However wheat scab can only be prevented, it can not be cured. Once it happens in the field, there is no other way back. Like the human skin, once the skin is damaged, the bacteria will arrive and reproduce immediately.
4.Will wheat scab be resistant to the usage of pesticides?
——Unfortunately yes, thus every year pesticide will be renovated and replaced, pesticide researchers will also introduce new pesticides every year. A pesticide will be replaced and disappear for up to two years. Actually, pesticide used in field crop will be expected to need a renovation every year, even it is for killing weeds and Aphidoidea.
5.How to deal with the infected wheat?
——Wheat with serious infection, the vomitoxin content is way higher than the criteria, it can not be made as food for human. However, they are more prone to be made into feed. The two toxins produced by the scab can be accumulated in the food chain . As a farmer who cultivate wheat , I am also very concerned about the problem of mycotoxins in food. It now appears that there is a great potential that excessive mycotoxins may be in the food, these food flows into the market circulation,  the crippling hazard to the  human body"
Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Community#Podcasts#Transcripts_-_-_TEXT.html," as safe as tomatoes bred by conventional means, but production ceased in 1997 due to production costs. But there are a lot of concerns about the safety of genetically modified food.
Alex: Yeah these foods have sometimes been referred to as “Franeknstein foods”, A major concern about modifying food is inadvertently triggering an allergic reaction. Specific proteins in milk, eggs, wheat, fish, tree nuts, peanuts, soybeans, and shellfish cause over 90% of food allergies, and if one of these proteins was used in a genetically modified food it could unknowingly trigger an allergic reaction.
Dev: This scenario is unlikely though because of safeguards that are already in place from organizations such as the FDA. Producers of genetically modified food must prove that they have not incorporated any allergenic substance into their product. If they are unable to prove this, a label will be put on the product to alert consumers of the risk.
Alex: But governmental organizations aren’t always successful in properly managing genetically modified organisms. There was an example of this in genetically modified trees in China. China has planted over one million genetically modified trees that were designed to contain genes that would make the trees resistant to insects and pests. Because the trees are not classified as crops, China's Ministry of Agriculture has no control over genetically modified trees and they are allowed to plant without having to meet the same standards as food. It was then determined that the trees ""are so widely planted in northern China that pollen and seed dispersal cannot be prevented"".
Dev: So what other dangers are there if this were to happen to a genetically modified crop?
Alex: One of the dangers that I’ve heard about is the potential for genes to be “leaked” to the naturally occurring form of organism, or even genes being transferred into bacteria in the human gut.
Dev: And there is some legitimacy in this concern. Researchers from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne proved that in an experiment on intestinal bacteria that DNA plasmids can be taken up by these gut cells. This only happened in one in every 300 cells though, and another experiment confirmed that some transgenes in GM foods might survive passage through the small intestine.  In this experiment, 19 volunteers ate a burger and milkshake containing genetically modified soya. 7 of the volunteers have had their colons previously removed, which allowed them to examine ileostomoy bags to look for gene transfer in the gut. It was found that 3.7% of the DNA had survived, and some of it had been transferred to bacteria in the gut.
Alex: Yeah that’s true, but they were unable to isolate"

Lors de la phase de latence, appelée cycle lysogène, le génome reste « inactif » et aucun vecteur cellulaire n’est produit au sein du vecteur tissulaire . Alors que pendant la phase d’expression et de libération, appelée cycle lytique, le génome est transcrit et répliqué, afin de produire des vecteurs cellulaires.
Cependant le vecteur tissulaire n’est pas l’hôte naturelle du vecteur cellulaire. Ainsi, si l’on veut induire une phase de latence, il nous faut la provoquer. Le système de délivrance implanté dans le vecteur tissulaire induit justement cette phase de latence.
Le plasmide de contrôle de délivrance du vecteur cellulaire induit un cycle lysogène chez ce dernier.
Le cycle lysogène est un phénomène naturellement présent chez le bactériophage lambda, le vecteur cellulaire. Lors de ce cycle, le génome phagique est inséré dans le génome bactérien sous la forme d’un prophage, il devient partie intégrante du génome de l’hôte.
A l’état de prophage, toute transcription est réprimée. Seul le gène cI, responsable du maintien du cycle lysogène, est exprimé.
La fixation de cI sur les opérateurs de la région de contrôle des promoteurs pR et pL, bloque l’expression des gènes et permet le maintien de la lysogénie. cI bloque de surcroit son propre promoteur, pRM, permettant ainsi une autorégulation de sa transcription.
Le bactériophage est maintenu sous la forme lysogène aussi longtemps que cI est exprimé. Dans le cas du DVS , l’expression de cI n’est plus contrôlée par le promoteur pRM, mais induite par un promoteur répressible LacP/O fusionné au gène cI. Si celui-ci n’est pas répressé, alors, comme dans le schéma naturel du bactériophage lambda, l’expression des gènes est inhibée.
En revanche, lorsque le signal de délivrance du vecteur cellulaire, la doxycycline, est injecté, alors le promoteur"

During her studies, Xiaoting became highly interested in gene therapy due to several internships at the German Cancer Research Centre, different departments of the University of Heidelberg and Imperial College London. In her opinion, synthetic biology can revolutionize gene therapy by creating non-existing parts which will reduce side effects and increase the efficiency of gene therapy methods. She is glad to work with a nice group of students and advisors and is looking forward to the jamboree!

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," whilst our technology might be useful for ripeness monitoring, it would not replace the manual handling stage of this process. Instead, FPA suggested that perhaps a sensor that could remain in one of the cold rooms and send a live feed of ethylene levels to a computer in a cost-effective way would be a useful application for their context. For example, FPA handles shipments of kiwifruit arriving in Sydney on behalf of Zespri given they already have the facilities to do so. As part of this arrangement, there are temperature sensors installed in the cold rooms that send a constant temperature reading to Zespri in New Zealand, to ensure FPA are complying with Zespri’s required temperature guidelines. An ethylene sensor could thus serve a similar function.  Consequently, multiple designs were brainstormed and evaluated.
Design Options
Fruit sticker
A small, oval-shaped fruit sticker identical to current ones used to label the origin of all fruit produce could be applied to produce. The latex/cell-coated paper could be coated on the underside with an FDA-approved adhesive. These stickers could be applied to the produce at the same time as other sticker labelling, such that no extra processing would be required.
Scanner
A hand-held scanner device, designed for workers responsible for monitoring or handling fruit in the transportation or storage process. A slip of latex/cell-coated paper could be slipped into the front of the device prior to each use, and the device could be pointed at each crate/shipment/piece to measure the cumulative ethylene levels to which it has been exposed.
Curved handheld stick
Shaped like a spoon, with a narrow body designed to fit into the palm of the hand of the user and a slightly larger round head with a viewing window at the top, this sensor is also designed for workers monitoring storage rooms or shipments. A latex/cell-coated paper strip is to be inserted into the top of the device for each use, which can be seen through the viewing window.
Industrial sticker
A modification of the fruit sticker, this industrial sticker would have a more durable cellulose blend base and would be larger in size. It could also feature shipping information or labelling to reduce the packaging on a crate. This design is ideal for industrial use, such as in shipping containers or on produce storage shelves. It has the potential to give an average reading for a sample of produce, rather than an individual cumulative ethylene reading.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,": how can we best bind metals on a molecular level, and how can we use synthetic biology to create a platform for functionalizing mycelial material? We also considered the advantages of our platform in comparison to previous efforts, such as flagella-based or cellulose filtration tools [10, 11]. One of the largest benefits of using mycelium material is that it leverages the concept of economies of scale, and presents an entirely feasible option of scale-up of our technology to a level that could be successfully implemented on a space mission and on earth in developing countries with poor access to clean water. Fungi are capable of displaying growth on an enormous variety of biomass types, and grow at a rate that is unparalleled by other biological agents used in synthetic biology today [12].
2.2 Chitin Binding
We sought to find ways to utilize mycotecture and enhance its properties, and in the process realized that chitin is ubiquitous in nature in organisms ranging from fungi to insects - in fact, it’s the second most abundant biopolymer on earth [13]. Methods to take advantage of this fact using synthetic biology are limited - we established a part collection using chitin binding domains as a novel platform to functionalize chitin-containing surfaces, with almost unlimited potential for modifying regions of organisms. We demonstrated the utility through designing novel biological cross-linking glues, fluorescent dyes, but most directly, filtration tools. Our use of the CBD in fusion protein production forms an important pipeline for future teams and the global scientific community for numerous applications, and here we focused on its use for metal recovery from mixed aqueous solution.
2.3 Copper Binding
We then sought to optimize the actual binding interaction between our peptides and metals. We chose copper as our proof of concept as a metal that is both biologically and economically important. When looking at past iGEM teams working with metal binding domains, we found that very few, if any, focused on optimizing the manner in which the metals were bound, instead choosing to simply obtain a binding domain from nature and attempting to implement it. We thought we could do better. A researcher in our lab, Dr. Jesica Urbina, developed a 20 amino acid long peptide (referred to as HHTC-Re (HNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGC), that is a modified peptide with  substituted amino acids adapted from the peptide HHTC designed by Kozisek et al. [14]. We wondered whether we could apply this in tandem with repeats to bind multiple copper atoms to the same biomolecule, and if we could use chitin binding domains ("

University of Electronic Science and Technology of China
This year we continued our cooperation with University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. We helped their team with the cryostat section process, and they returned the favor helping us acquiring RBS sequences and analyzing them.
Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University
We maintained close cooperation with XJTLU-CHINA team since November 2014.Experiences on how our team run the team and recruit were shared and instructions were given to XJTLU-CHINA team. We also noticed them some problems that might trouble them and some important things that they should pay close attention to. Specific document was made to help instruct them when using the iGEM website, including how to search and acquire bio-bricks. Considering the circumstances they were in, we gave our personal advice and answers to their question without reservation.

Brown,2010,Team:Brown#Project#Light pattern#Logic design_-_-_TEXT.html," Memory Module is a crucial way-point in the circuit, as without it the circuit would merely return to its original state when the light turns back OFF.
Third is the IF&NOT Module that generates the third state. As this module can only be active following the first and second states, its activation must depend on the presence of memory ON and the absence of some factor produced only when the light is some α state.
Finally, the last piece of the circuit is the AND Module , which produces the fourth and final state in our circuit. This module uses AND logic because it requires two inputs: one that is only expressed when the third state is active and a second that is expressed when the light is in some β state (the opposite of the previous light state, for the user has inputted a change!).

Conversion Module
In order to design the Conversion Module, which converts light ON/OFF to transcription ON/OFF, we looked to past years' iGEM team projects. We found (quite easily, in fact, as it won best new part) team EPF-Lausanne 2009's E.Colight project, which characterized a synthetic protein LovTAP capable of acting as a repressor like tryptophan when exposed to 470nm light. You can read more about their project here . As EPF-Lausanne describes, ""Upon light induction, a conformational change is transmitted from the light-sensitive to the DNA-binding domain, which ultimately results in an increase of the regulatory domain's affinity for its respective DNA binding site.""
Conformational changes in the LovTAP dimer. Taken from Strickland et al. via EPF-Lausanne '09
This sounds like a match for what we desire! This LovTAP molecule is changed shape under exposure to light, and changes back to its original form when that light is removed. Furthermore, this part has been well characterized. Part of this characterization by the EPF-Lausanne team involved the creation of a read out system, which undergoes a change in transcriptional output in response to the changing conformation of the LovTAP protein under 470nm light. Thus, contained in EPF-Lausanne's work from last year is the essentials of the Conversion Module: <partinfo>BBa_K191003</partinfo> generates"

-KK Our transformations worked this time and we had several beautiful lawns of E.Coli. The E. Coli did NOT fluoresce either red or green to the naked eye. We haven’t yet looked at them under UV light. Clarisse streaked several singles, and also set up two overnight colonies. Kelton and I practiced streaking to singles for the first time, using old plates. We placed our E.Coli singles in the 37 degree room to grow, along with the overnights on the shaker. Most of today we spent presenting our progress thus far. It appears that bacteriophage K139 will not be very useful to us, as we will need to use E.Coli bacteriophage lambda for our system. Dr. Grose has ordered Lambda and it is on it’s way. Our goal is to incorporate the Lambda genome as a lysogenic prophage into the genome of E.Coli, and have that prophage remain dormant until the presence of cholera’s autoreceptor triggers the phage to be excised from E.Coli’s genome and become lytic. The lysogeny/lysis balance is determined by the relative concentrations of two proteins, CRO and CI. The two proteins are mutually exclusive; if one is being expressed, then the other cannot be expressed, because they share a promoter region. Expression of CRO triggers the events that lead to replication and lysis. Expression of CI induces and maintains lysogeny. Our plan is clone the CI protein into E.Coli following the Qrr4 protein and the CRO protein following Hap"

Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan
We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Chiao Tung University from July 31st to August 4th 2017. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 6 members of our team was sent to Taiwan.
During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, changed ideas and learned from one another. The conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.

Software Promotion
Since our software is an open and fantastic platform with practical functions for synthetic biologists, it’s of great importance to promote our software to synthetic biology related users.
To find out whether our improvement above is useful or not, We packed up an alpha version distributing to schoolmates whose major is biology in September. And in October we packed a more advanced version to some igem teams worldwide. We introduced them to Biohub and its basic usage. After they had used this software for a while, most of them reported that it was quite useful. And then we have packed our completed version to the real synthetic biologists by now.

Project outlook and Future prospects
As a parallel project, some of us, who were taking the Project Management class as part of our subjects for this year, worked on a profound research regarding how viable and what would be the requirements to be fulfilled in order to do the following: creating and establishing a pilot plant that is capable of reproducing the lab experiment.
This project had the specific intention of realize an estimation of the costs that a person will incur if he/she/they were planning to develop the iGEM Biosint_Mexico 2016 project at a semi-industrial scale. It includes the essential elements required to provide an overview of the net flow the company will be exposed to, such as: costs of all types, prices of every material/equipment/space and the initial monetary investment in order to start a company of this kind.
The costs estimation will include, specifically:
 - Unitary cost of reagents.
 - Cost of laboratory equipment and instruments.
 - Shipping cost for the reagents and materials(if the company settle down in Querétaro México).
 - Estimated production cost.
 - Rent of space and installations.
As part of the objectives the Biosint_Mexico team have, this pilot plant will be a microbiological fermentation unit capable of produce and extract hypotaurine for the enrichment of other food products, energetic beverages and food supplements. This after find out that the molecule in question is highly used in the animals food industry as well as in the beverages ones. Several plants include the hypotaurine and the taurine in their products as part of their regular formulation, but there’s no other way of producing it that isn’t"

We mixed and matched different parts from the registry with our finishing touch to build our state of the art P.A.S.E machinery.
BBa_K1223001 -  P.A.S.E 1 cassette:
This part was designed to fulfill the self destruct system of P.A.S.E 1. It contains a toxin system based on phage lysis system of holin (BBa_K112805) and lysozyme (BBa_K112301). Holin protein causes ""pores"" in the inner membrane, which allows lysozyme to access and break down the peptidoglycan of the cell wall, causing lysis and eventually death. The toxins are regulated by cI regulated promoter (BBa_R0051). This part is designed to integrate into the cell's genome via homologous recombination and therefore it contains homologous regions at its ends. Kanamycin resistance was added for selectivity. Therefore, when transforming in bacteria only the cells that have gone through double recombination with the insert will survive.
The part was characterized through sequencing and restriction digest with BamHI and EcorRV.
BBa_K1223005 -  cI Translational Unit:
This part was designed to function as a biological timer for our P.A.S.E 1 system. It includes an assembly of two existing parts from the Registry, Lac/Ara-1 IPTG Inducible promoter (BBa_K354000) and LVA-tagged cI repressor protein (BBa_K327018). In order to extend the half life of the cI protein, we removed the LVA tail. The part was characterized through sequencing and restriction digest with Pvull and HindIII. In addition, the promoter’s performance under the presence of IPTG and Arabinose was analyzed via comassie staining. The cI protein is 29 KDa.
BBa_K1223002 -  P.A.S.E 2 cassette:
This part is the heart of the P.A.S.E. 2 system. It is intended to be incorporated into E.coli BL21 genome by recombineering, and therefore has a homologous region in each side that direct the recombination into the right place in the genome. This part is used to replace the native promoter and regulatory sequences upstream of the CDS of the TyrS gene that encodes for the enzyme Tyrosine Synth"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#IP#_-_-_TEXT.html,", and to assess the legal protection and ownership protection we require being a former iGEM project.
Patent Protection and Trade Secrets
The technology that we have developed, for the purpose of IP protection can be placed into two categories: 1) the Pseudomonas strain of bacteria genetically engineered to detect toxins in the environment; and 2) the electrochemical platform technology used to convert the sensory element used in the Pseudomonas into an electrical output.  Both present unique challenges towards IP protection.  Presently, we plan to keep our Pseudomonas organism as a trade secret, filing a patent on this technology later in our development.  Patenting of strains will also have to be carefully assessed since it fully discloses the nature and important components required for the system to work.  Due to the increasing ease of genetic manipulation, it could be easy for competitive parties to copy and modify our system in the future.  We can further protect our IP through genetic kill switch technology, and other genetic mechanisms of making it difficult to identify our organism of which we have experience with from 2012.  Each new product which is developed by the company will be treated in a unique circumstance.
The electrochemical sensing platform is the key component to our technology.  It will allow for the development of this product, and could serve as a platform technology for future product lines.  Therefore its protection is key to ensure the development and commercialization of our technology.  In order to protect the technology, our group has filed a provisional patent. This has been completed with Harm Dekkers who is a consultant through HMG Consulting, and has a wide variety of experience with biotechnology related patents.
Our invention is novel and non-obvious and we believe fully-patentable. Some examples of related patents can be seen below.
Table 1. Patents dealing with related technology.
During product development, some engineering hardware/software as well as manufacturing-based IP may be developed.  While the present technology development plan aims to use open-source or generic materials, programs, and systems, it is possible that some intellectual property may be produced from the unique implementation of these systems.  If that becomes the case, the system will be evaluated for their potential patentability.
Patents previously developed as a result of the 2012 iGEM group shall be held by the six iGEM students who are developing the technology.  The patent will be freely licensed to FREDsense in order to ensure that the platform technology will not be hampered in the event that the system can be used for other markets and applications.

Background
Oil sands are a naturally occurring mixture of sand, clay, water, and a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum referred to as bitumen.  These deposits represent approximately two-thirds of the world's total petroleum reserves.  The oil sands in the Athabasca Basin in northeastern Alberta, Canada, are one of the largest reserves containing an estimated 1.7 trillion barrels (270×109 m3).  However, development of the resource comes with a significant environmental footprint. The extraction process to separate the mixture of sand, clay and bitumen produces large volumes of slurry wastes which are stored in 'tailings ponds'. The slurry’s components include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which have been shown to be acutely toxic to aquatic organisms and humans.
It has been reported that a variety of bacteria residing in the ponds are able to break down these contaminants. The breakdown of many PAHs generates a common intermediate – catechol – that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA. Since these reactions naturally proceed at extremely slow rates, we plan to utilize the principle of metabolic channeling to accelerate catechol breakdown. We hypothesize that efficient removal of this intermediate will have a beneficial effect on the rate of biodegradation of the upstream contaminants.

Meet Tsinghua-A and Nankai
Tianjin iGEM established a profound friendship with Tsinghua-A and Nankai University a few years ago. On 13th August, our team members came to Beijing, communicating with Tsinghua-A in depth. Firstly, we visited their laboratory, and observed some experimental operations. Then, we introduced our own project to each other and exchanged views of some practical problems in the experimental during the meeting. Meanwhile, iGEMers in both teams who were in charge of modeling discussed for a long time. Both of us harvest a lot from each other. In a word, the exchange activities enhanced our thoughts of project successfully.
 
We became increasingly aware of the high costs containing experimental material cost, human practice activities spend and registration fee. Our lab was able to cover only a part of the budget. Thus, we hoped to make more and more people who are involved in the field of synthetic biology know our project and do our utmost to persuade them to sponsor us.
We got in touch with more than one hundred companies, most of which are biotechnology companies. (quite part of companies)We introduced the iGEM and our project to them and showed our sponsorship proposal. (Chinese Version) in order to make them interested in our team, sponsor fees and provide experimental materials, technology support. There were quite a few companies directly refusing us which made us very depressed at first. In addition, some experts in companies talked with us very friendly and put forward useful suggestions for us although they did not provide financial support. It's believed that collecting the opinions and suggestions of some officials helped us to improve our project, making it more meaningful. Fortunately, a few companies committed to the value of our project and wanted to support us.
During the event of looking for sponsorship, we not only obtained some sponsor fee from the society but made better promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology. Having listened to the opinions of the experts, we can better our project. Additionally, we also harvest a lot of experience and deepen our understanding of our project when going out of school and contacting with workers and experts."

Collaboration with CIEI-China
Our sister team CIEI-China needed to collect samples to test the salinity of kitchen waste for their project and asked if we can help. In May, our team members provided the kitchen waste from each one’s family, helping them collect more trash samples. Also, some of our team members, together with CIEI-China, asked the local residents from door to door and found the kitchen waste in the local community. Eventually, CIEI-China successfully collected enough trash samples for their project.
In order to check if our citronellol was really effective, in October, we conducted our outdoor experiments in the School of Pharmacy in Southern Medical University in Guangzhou. We invited the members of our dear sister team CIEI-China to do the experiments with us in order to gain more sets of data. Due to the experiments, each people got some mosquito bites. We felt really grateful to CIEI-China for helping us with the experiments, because it was awful to be bitten by the mosquitoes.
Collaboration with College Teams
BIT-China provided us the vector pSB1C3.
We joined in a WeChat group called Conference of China iGEMer Community, which is launched by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. We were motivated to communicate with other teams and learned a lot.
CGEM Summit
We believed that it is of great importance to communicate with other IGEM teams because we could broaden our horizon and get more inspiration of our own project. So, we, CIEI-Beijing, together with our sister team CIEI-China, set up CGEM Summit aiming to share our research and communicate with other about our own latest progress. We invited other three IGEM teams, HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou, RDFZ-China and BIT-China, and some experts to join in our forum.
In this summit, we shared our research with each other, listened to the suggestion from the experts, and developed a further understanding of the great importance and multiple applications of synthetic biology.

LegoRoboBricks for Automated Biobrick DNA Assembly
BioBrick-A-Bot Model C is the prototype of an extensible Genomic Lab Liquid Handling System. We build it using Lego bricks, and it can be easily replicated by other iGEM teams and by researchers in Molecular Biology who cannot afford a typical, $10,000, commercial system. The design is modular plug-and-play, so that we can easily collaborate with future iGEM teams to modify or improve on its design and to add new functionalities.
BioBrick-A-Bot comprised of 2 LegoRoboBrick modules (ALPHA and PHI), mounted on a frame (BETA). Here’s what the acronyms means:
ALPHA – Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly
PHI – Pneumatic Handling Interface
BETA – BioBrick Environment Testing Apparatus
This project needs great precision to position the pipette head accurately in 3-D space, and to transfer a few microliter of fluids. In order to achieve the much needed precision, we have replaced the Lego NXT firmware with RobotC firmware which provide floating point representations.  RobotC also gives us the flexibility to develop sophisticated C programs needed to drive this project. The computations to reverse-triangulate any point in 3-D space is also non-trivial. We use 3x3 rotational matrix to simplify our mathematical modeling .
Due to a hardware limitation of Lego Minsdstorm, each NXT brick can only be connected to a maximum of 3 motors. We need 6 motors for this project, and use 2 NXT bricks. We designed and implemented a Master Slave Synchronization System using blue-tooth wireless technology.  ALPHA is the master and when it is properly positioned at the right location, it will transmit wireless messages to PHI to request the type of pipette operations that it needs (either aspirate, dispense or clean).
We provide a proof of concept of this project by demonstrating the transfer of blue dyes, 4 at"

Generally, we learned the importance and influence of A Detector to the world in the following aspects through communication with clinicians.
If A Detector can be popularized, the physiological indicators of the patient can be measured in time and avoid missing treatment time window. Thus, the survival of critically ill patients will increase to some extent.
Since A Detector can be considered as a platform and the demands of hospitals are diverse, various customized detectors will be born. For long-term goals, if A Detector are intended to be used in public, it will face more stringent requirements in more aspects. Meanwhile, as we concerned about the practical application for A Detector, we consider this human practice a precious chance to have a further understanding from the perspectives of biosecurity and ethics that related to patents’ using experience. And this definitely extends our works in the transformation of scientific and technological achievements.
There is no denying that A Detector still have a long way to go!

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design2_-_-_TEXT.html," optical stimulation. Despite the fact that worms are confined in chips and pushed by the fluid, the channels are specially designed to effectively simulate their normal movement. The material of the chips PDMS is transparent, and it has no influence on the quantification of light signals in optogenetics experiment. Gas molecules, diacetyl and 2-nonanone, can diffuse in PDMS so that the worms can sense the odor of such molecule. As a result, we can observe their preference to these odors.
About light
In our design, a group of optogenetic proteins and optical devices are used. Channelrhodopsins protein CoChR and Chrimson are coupled with dual-Color fluorescence protein GEM-GECO, expressed in the pair of neurons AWA and AWB. This combination is determined to lower the cross-talk and to get clearer image during experiments. Excited by blue light and red light separately, CoChR or Chrimson can induce the change of calcium ion concentration inside the nerve cells. Then it will causes the blue-shift of fluorescence of GEM-GECO. To enhance preciseness and the ability of expansion, we modified the projector and own software of microscope. New filters are installed in the device so that we can simultaneously control the intensity and period of light when stimulating the individual C.elegans during manipulation.

Why is the platform important?
Along with the development of neuroscience, more and more techniques have been used to study the behavior psychology. The original platform of the behavior psychology research, Skinner box, is not suitable for today’s research because its “black-box” model cannot reveal the changes in the organ-isms during the process of their learning new ability. Meanwhile, the former research of learning abil-ity based on C.elegans were more focused on chemical signals like olfactory inducing, heavy mental stimulus. These can demonstrate the existence of the learning behaviors but seems tenable as the relia-ble experimental data, since the residue of the stimuli are hard to erase. Thus, if we aim to study the learning ability associated with neuroscience and behavior psychology, we need to develop a new platform which allows us to explore the inside mechanism. Compared to the traditional methods, light stimulation is easier-controlled and more reliable for the following data analysis. That’s why our project is so important. It employs the optogenetics and neuroimaging to record the change in each neuron during a new abil-ity formed, so we can know what happened actually inside the brain during the ability formed: would the new connection formed between two"

Chitin Deacetylases NodB and COD
Chitosan is a polymeric product of deacetylated chitin, which exists in a wide variety of patterns differing in their degree of deacetylation. Our goal is to design chitosan oligomers with a specific pattern of deacetylation. It can then be used for the production of our hydrogels.
We implemented chitin deacetylases originating from the organisms Sinorhizobium meliloti (NodB) and Vibrio cholerae (COD) into our E. coli cells. These enzymes deacetylate chitin individually. NodB targets the first position of the non-reducing end, while COD works similarly on the second unit. By implementing an orthogonal expression system to regulate the patterns, designer chitosan could be adjusted to the respective task. This would allow the expression of each enzyme separately, creating a defined deacetylation pattern.
What are Chitin Deacetylases?
Chitin deacetylases (CDA) mostly occur in marine bacteria, few in insects, and several in fungi  [1] .
In fungi, for example, CDAs are involved in cell wall formation, sporulation, and catabolism of chitin oligosaccharides. Many plant fungal pathogens secrete CDAs during plant infection. Plants only detect fungal infections by registering chitin. Fungi “turn invisible” by deacetylating chitin into chitosan and thus, outwit the plant defence system  [2] .
The CDAs generate chitosan oligomers from chitin by deacetylating the N-acetylglucosamine units of the substrate  [3] . During deacetylation, acetic acid is cleaved off from a glucosamine unit. Some CDAs may even deacetylate chitosan, creating a double deacetylated oligomer  [2] .
Chitin deacetylases belong to the carbohydrate esterase family 4. All family members, including NodB protein and chitin deacetylases, share the same primary structure called “NodB homology domain” or “polysaccharide deacetylase domain” "

Today I did the miniprep of the Normal RBS control and I got a DNA concentration of 262ng/µl. So I electro-transformed the Normal RBS control with the plasmid 1 of negative cascade in a K12 strain and plated it so that I can do the experiment on monday. I also prepared all the samples to conduct a fluorescence experiment tomorrow. I ran a gel with the controls minipreped today. The results are shown below

Experts Consulted
A significant amount of our time was spent meeting with experts, enabling us to gain a more holistic understanding of our project. This journal allowed us to keep track of all of the information we learnt in each of our meetings, and communicate this information with the team. These meetings were crucial to the development of our project, and we wish to share them with the iGEM community.
Dr. Alexandra George
Senior Lecturer (Intellectual Property) - University of New South Wales
Dr Alexandra George is a senior lecturer in intellectual property (IP) at the University of New South Wales, specialising in international intellectual property, and the philosophy of intellectual property law. Alexandra provided information and support for our team in deciphering Australian patent law, and explained the intersection of the different jurisdictions in which patents may be granted.
Alexandra also commented on a suggestion from the Pasteur Paris iGEM team that a specialty ‘scientific court’ or ‘IP court’, like the Parisian High Court, could be helpful in ensuring that judges approach cases with a correct understanding of the underlying scientific principles. She informed us that the Federal Court of Australia already has an intellectual property ‘National Practice Area’ (NPA), which means IP cases tend to be heard by judges with expertise in this area – although even specialist courts won’t necessarily have expertise in every possible patentable area, and so make heavy use of expert evidence.
Finally, Alexandra told us about some of the differences between intellectual property law in civil and common law jurisdictions, comparing the examples of Australia and France. In Australia, as common law judges tend to come from the Bar, they have often been leading practitioners in IP before they come to sit as judges in this NPA. Whereas in civil law countries like France, judges don’t tend to have practiced IP law previously. Civil law judges also have a more inquisitorial and investigative role, whereas the Australian adversarial system encourages evidence to be given in a manner accessible for judges to make findings of fact to which they can then apply the law.

Human Practice
Overview The aim of our project is to develop a computational tool solving pathway engineering problems with strong practicability and great interactivity. In order to achieve this goal, we did a great deal of human practices with researchers, iGEM teams and social communities throughout our project. Silver ""The most critical part of designing any solution is to understand the problem you're trying to solve."" To become that intimate with the problem, we devoted ourselves to interactive with our software’s end users -- the very people who have this problem -- to understand their workflow and how they think our solution should work. Moreover, we communicated with peers who have the experiences of developing software. From these communications, we got a great deal of suggestions about how to build a software that is friendly, fast, beautiful, responsive, reliable, secure, and scalable. Interview with Prof.Liu Qi At the early stage of our project, we had an interview with Prof. Liu Qi to learn about how bioinformatics could benefit the research of biology field. Prof. Liu Qi currently conducts bioinformatics research at the School of Life Science and Technology of Tongji University. His biomedical Big Data Mining team (BM2, stand for Biological and Medical Big Data Mining) is dedicated to the application of evolving artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to mine high-throughput biometric data and drug data for biological problem mechanisms.
Fig.1. Interview Prof.Liu and learn more about bioinformatics. During two hours communication with Prof. Liu, we learnt a lot about the applications and approaches of bioinformatics in many aspects. Here is the general information we got.
Fig.2. Things we learned about bioinformatics. Prof. Liu inspired us that development of bioinformatics software should encompass biological information acquisition, processing, storage, distribution, analysis, and interpretation that combines the tools and techniques of mathematics, computer science, and biology with the aim of understanding the biological significance of a variety of data. Biology Labs Visiting We visited some of the biology labs in School of Life Science and Technology of Tongji University to study general needs of researchers and knowledge of biosafety in wet lab. We found that most researchers view biological data from previous studies as a treasure. Utilization data rationally not only help experiment design a lot but also benefit discovery of biological mechanisms. This inspires us to develop a tool that gather, integrate and analyze data on a specific aspect in synthetic biology.

pUB110 digestions, keratinase assay, and quikchange mutagenesis research
B.subtilis Backbone
Used FastDigest enzymes and green dye to digest pUB110 for 1 hour
Ran the pUB110 digest (8/26 pUB110 digest with FastDigest enzymes) on a 1% agarose gel:
lane 1: ladder (10ul)
lane 2: fastdigest (20ul)
The pUB110 digest does not seem to have worked.
Will try again tomorrow or Wednesday
Expected sizes:
uncut pUB110: ~4500 bp
vector: ~3500 bp
AflII - NdeI: ~600 bp
NdeI - NdeI: ~400 bp
B.substilis RFP
Realized that BBa_E1010 has no promoter so we shouldn’t expect RFP expression anyway.
Realized that we might not even need the RFP since the instructions for submitting a new biobrick backbone says we only need the prefix/suffix.
Keratinase Assay
Finished compiling keratin plate/keratinase assay information
Called Western Live Poultry and Alliance Poultry Farm to ask for chicken feathers. Will be stopping by tomorrow with garbage bags, gloves, and boots to pick up some really dirty feathers that we’ll need to wash before use.

They sent us their plasmid pUC57amp-cI which is responsible for the repression of the holin and lysozyme genes in their kill switch.  As the repression of these genes is essential to prevent the kill switch from being lethal prematurely, we decided to characterize the promoter units produced by the lac/ara-1 promoter that the cI is controlled by.
The first thing we needed to do was to biobrick the promoter from pUC57amp-cI.  We PCR'd biobrick restriction sites onto the lac/ara-1 promoter along with the RBS.  We then cloned the lac/ara-1 promoter into pSB1C3 backbone.  We extracted the promoter from pSB1C3 with EcoRI and SpeI cut sites, and a GFP reporter E0240 with XbaI and PstI and the backbone was prepared with EcoRI and PstI as per the protocol for characterizing promoter activity on the biobrick website.  At time of writing we are currently cloning the lac/ara-1 GFP construct for characterization.
Collaboration with the Braunschweig iGEM Team from Germany
Jonas Zantow an advisor of the Braunschweig iGEM Team from Germany visited us in Paris. We we showed him our lab and we gave him a quick overview of our projects and what we achieved so far. Also Jonas explained us what the Braunschweig 2013 iGEM Team
is working on and we could help him out with some Literature from our Bibliography we started during our Brainstorming sessions earlier the year. His visit ended - how can it be different, when we have German visitors - over a glass of beer!
Collaboration with the BGU iGEM Team from Israel
A critical part of BGU's project requires a recombination of a linear DNA cassette into the bacterial chromosome.  They sent a cassette required for the recombination as well as the helper plasmid required for it to function.  They sent us their plasmid pUC57amp-cI which is responsible for the repression of the holin and lysozyme genes in their kill switch.

Site-specific mutagenesis of tetR
Back to protocols .
Purpose: induce site-specific mutations in a gene, contained on a plasmid.
Site-specific mutagenesis or site-directed mutagenesis is a method to induce site-specific substitutions, deletions, or insertions in a plasmid. It is carried out using a PCR-like reaction, with two primers: one for the sense strand, one for the antisense strand. Both primers overlap the same region, and contain the desired mutations. At each cycle of the reaction, a mutated copy of the entire plasmid is created. In the end, the original (template) plasmid is digested, leaving only the mutants.
The principle of site-directed mutagenesis is explained in more detail in the manual for their mutagenesis kits.
Once all components (primers, buffers, culture media...) are available, the procedure should take approximately one half-day, followed by an overnight culture, then a miniprep, that should take an hour or so. The procedure is outlined as follows:
Reagent preparation
Primer design and ordering
Culture media preparation
Thermal cycling: extension reaction to copy the template and induce mutations (PCR-like reaction) (1 hour).
Digestion of template: enzymes digest the template (unmutated by definition) to leave only the mutants (5 minutes).
Transformation into competent cells: to repair nicks left in the plasmid by the extension reaction (1.5 hours).
Overnight culture on ampicillin: to select for transformed cells and amplify the mutated DNA (1 night).
Miniprep: to recover the mutated DNA (1 hour).

Dispense 600 µL of each suspension into a disposable tube through a cell strainer. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a flow cytometer of Becton, Dickinson and Company.
3. Results
3-1. Before inducing by phosphate concentration
Fig. 3-5-12 shows the fluorescence intensity of the fresh cultures (the MOPS medium which contains 1.32 mM K2HPO4) incubated until the observed OD600 reached 0.4-0.6 (Assay protocol 2-2-3).  The phoA promoter was repressed because the MOPS medium contained 1.32 mM phosphate, which was a high concentration for phoA promoter.
Fig. 3-5-12. Fluorescence intensity of the fresh cultures
3-2. After inducing by phosphate concentration
Fig. 3-5-13 and Fig. 3-5-14 show the fluorescence intensity of the induced cells by phosphate concentration. In Fig. 3-5-13, we saw that the phoA promoter was repressed by high phosphate concentrations, while the constitutive promoter did not show any significant change. Fig. 3-5-14 also proved that the increase in phosphate concentration repressed the phoA promoter. Fig. 3-5-15 shows the picture of fluorescence of the induced cells. Especially, we confirmed that the phoA promoter was drastically repressed at phosphate concentrations of 100 to 200 µM.

We confirmed that the increase in phosphate concentration repressed the phoA promoter and succeeded in improving the phosphate sensor part.
Though OUC-China 2012 reported a phosphate sensor part including the phoB promoter ( BBa_K737024 ), their part did not have sufficient data for us.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#TheConstructor_-_-_TEXT.html,"2011 an attempt was made to develop an application for the construction of parts from The Registry of Standard Biological Parts. This application was functional, however it could be improved in various ways. As the application was intended for offline use, the application had to be installed on every computer where it was required. Also the installation procedure, including the creation of the database required approximately 4-6 hours.
The installation of the application on multiple machines simultaneously could lead to the problem where the Registry of Standard Biological Parts would not be able to cope with the requests. The main reasons for building a new application was to make it accessible for everybody via an online interface, reduce the load on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and increase the efficiency via a better algorithm.
The iGEM Wageningen 2012 team in collaboration with iGEM Wageningen 2011 designed a completely new application with a completely new interface and made it available for online access. The application called “The Constructor” contains a better algorithm, a user-friendlier interface and is available from an online source.
The Constructor works as follows: The user defines different circuits that are going to be present within a single plasmid. In the next step The Constructor permutes all possible combinations of designed transcription units (TU) and extract parts from The Constructor Database that match any of the TUs. After the retrieval of parts, a shortest path algorithm calculates the most efficient cloning method for the construction of the TUs. A complete overview of the application flow is found in figure 1.
Figure 1: Overview of the workflow of “The Constructor”. The first step is to let the user define the circuits of interest. The constructor permutes all transcription unit arrangements (TU) as a single circuit is independent to one and another it will not have an effect on the separate components. The database is then queried with all possible TUs for the extraction of matching parts
Database
Figure 2: An entity-relationship diagram model of The Constructor database
The database that was created for the storage of all the information that resides within the Registry of Biological Parts was as follows (Figure 2). The database consists of 3 tables namely, superpart, brick and features. The superpart holds all connections between a superpart and the bricks belonging to this superpart. The brick table contains all the biological information such as the name, description, rating, quality, sequence and more. Each brick is also linked to a feature table containing the information of a specific feature belonging to that brick. With this database specifically designed for the storage of the biobricks, a specific application was written"

These 4 colonies with the expected size bands were made into overnight cultures and miniprepped, however the gel of the verification digests showed 3 bands at approximately 2000 bp, 2900 bp, and 5000 bp.
A Kapa PCR of construct 11 was repeated, along with digestion, ligation and transformation.
Week 19: September 2 - September 6
This week, we got the sequencing results for construct 9, 10 and the TALE target sequences. The TALE target sequences (with old and new [B] + [A]) worked. Construct 9 sequencing did not have a good reading with one of the primers, so we send it for sequencing again. Construct 10 didn’t work, so we set up digestion, ligation and transformation again. Colony PCR revealed right-sized  bands for 5 colonies. We step up overnights and mini prepped those over the weekend.
We did colony PCR of construct 11, but the bands were not at the expected size, so we transformed more Top10 cells.
We also received constructs 9, 10 and 11 from GenScript and did a transformation with them. The plates had colonies, but now we have to plasmid switch them to pSB1C3 , because they came in PUC57 backbone. We did colony PCR and mini-prepped the colonies that worked.
Regarding our protein work, we have transformed BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B into E. coli ER2566 and into E. coli BL21, strains commonly used for protein expression. We also tried a different lysis protocol, with glass beads, which had good yields for protein concentration through Bradford assay. We did Western Blot and verified that we have our protein expressed (figure 25).

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKU#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," doxorubicin's intrinsic fluorescence will be quenched. Using the property, we designed fluorescence measurement experiments to determine the drug loading capacity of the NDC. Doxorubicin was incubated with assembled NDC in room temperature for 1 hour at different ratios. The maximum concentration of doxorubicin used was 6 μM such that all the fluorescence signal would be in the linear range.
Dox loading
Figure 9 shows that with higher concentration of NDC to incubate with, the fluorescence signal continues to decrease. There was a linear decrease from 0 to 0.1 μM of NDC. And another linear range which shows the minimum signal, was between 0.3 – 0.5 μM of NDC. The linearity at range 0 to 0.1 μM of NDC added would be explained by the maximum binding of the NDC, in which there are excessive doxorubicin. The linear range at 0.3 – 0.5 μM of NDC would be explained by the complete quenching, which indicated that no free doxorubicin was present in the solvent. The range 0.1 – 0.3 0.3 – 0.5 μM of NDC is not linear. In which there would be a system of equilibrium between free doxorubicin and bound doxorubicin. It would be explained by our mathematical model .
Approach used in Figure 10 started with a fixed NDC concentration, with varying doxorubicin concentrations. Linearity is observed in 0 – 2 μM of doxorubicin, and the slope increases after 2 μM of doxorubicin. A turn is observed in 2 μM of doxorubicin, indicating NDC to doxorubicin ratio more than 1:20 will lead to the decrease the quenching ability of the NDC.
Dox release
The fluorescence signal (Excitation: 480nm, Emission: 595nm) produced by NDC (0.3 μM) loaded with Dox (in 1:20 ratio) in different pH of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). NDC loaded with doxorubicin was incubated at 37 degree Celsius in 384-well plate. PBS was pre-titrated using hydrochloric acid in 37 degree Celsius water bath, such that after the addition of neural samples, the final pH reaches the desired pH at 37 degree Celsius.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," 2018). Although they would be willing to modify its working routines if a new solution could minimize their costs when disposing of patients' urine, they were still not sure about the need to implement a solution in a hospital setting (Personal communication K Sonesson, E Frank and S Rosenborg 10 Sept 2018).
After considering different customers, we conclude that both municipal (with more than 2,000 people connected) and private WWTPs (manufacturing sites of pharmaceutical companies) are our target markets in Sweden, being these customers more cost-effective due to its larger coverage area [12].
Market Size
Our market size (Table 1) is first presented through the calculation of our Total Available Market (TAM), specified through the estimation of our Serviceable Available Market (SAM) and finally described as our Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM).
Table 1. Market size.
There has been a decrease in the number of municipal WWTPs due to the fact that smaller municipal WWTPs are replaced by pumping stations (facilities located before the WWTPs) [10]. However, as the number of households is increasing every year [14], we predict more people will be connected to municipal WWTPs, expanding the capacity of these. As a result, more plants might be built over time.
Regarding the private WWTPs, we also forecast a positive market growth. The Government requirements are getting tighter, resulting in more pharmaceutical manufacturing sites having to incorporate better treatment processes and facilities (Study visit P Gruvstedt 18 Sept 2018).
The market size was finally calculated to be 22 WWTPs. We believe this number represents a realistic result of the addressable market for Biotic Blue.
Competitive Analysis
In order to measure competition intensity, attractiveness and profitability, our analysis was based on the Porter’s Five Forces model (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Porter’s Five Forces model.
Threat of new entrants: medium
Market is not regulated; however, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EAI) is needed
High research costs but sufficient funding in Sweden
Increased awareness of pharmaceutical pollution
Low competition and low brand equity barrier for enzymatic degradation
Strong Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
High switching costs
Threat of substitutes: low
Great number of substitutes but with high energy consumption levels and use of chemicals
High customers’ switching costs and difficulties
Low customer’s propensity of substitution
Bargaining power of suppliers: high
Great variety of suppliers
High production switching costs
Suppliers are not dependant on this industry

How our human practices have been integrated into the project
HP into the design of our project
In our iGEM Booklet, we gathered background knowledge about ""What is solid tumor and how to treat it"". As an educational booklet, knowledge is carefully summarized, including background information, social situation, and critical learning questions. Therefore people with limited Biology background could easily learn something from the booklet. But more importantly, when we gathered information for this handbook, we were also enriched with the knowledge, which helped us design our project at the very beginning more rationally.
For example, by making the booklet, we knew that bifidobacterium, an anaerobic gram positive bacterium, and has been validated on anti-aging, anti infection, relieving constipation, and improving lactose which is not resistant to disease and nutritional immunity. In addition, it has an inhibitory effect on the occurrence and development of a variety of tumors. The characteristics of bifidobacterium impressed us, therefore we decided to make bifidobacterium a part of our design.
Other information we got when we make the booklet are also important and then be integrated into the design of our project. Such as the application of plasmid pMB – 1, the design of adding HU-promoter to improve the expression level of apoptin. More information can be found in our booklet and the website.
How our human practices have been integrated into the project
HP into the execution of our project
1. After introducing our iGEM project in HUST-Cheering meeting, some experts and members from other teams showed great interest in our project, and had a very long discussion. Among all the people we talked to, some of them gave us valuable suggestions, and Professor Kang Ning's suggestion about animal experiments, the in-situ injection method, was applied in our execution of the experiments. Professor Kang was also generous for contributing the experience about in-situ injection. Thanks to Prof. Kang, our experiments were able to progress smoothly.
2. We interviewed Assistant Professor Xiangwei Wu from the University of Texas MD after his lecture about early-disseminated tumor cells as a biomarker for colorectal cancer early detection, during an international"

DNA-based System
Protein-based System
Output
DNA-Based System
To detect cruzipain, its proteolytic function should lead to a detectable output which could be either positive or negative. For our DNA-based system, in which mRNA transcription is being controlled  this would require either using an activating or repressing transcription factor. Cleavage by the protease to allow an activator to work would be a positive output; cleavage to disable a repressor would be a negative output. Inability to repress an activating transcription factor would cause some basal expression that would reduce sensitivity of our output, therefore we chose to investigate repressor proteins which we could edit to be inactivated by cleavage with cruzipain.
After researching several options, we decided on the TetR repressor, as it was shown to be a very strong repressor, and had an easily accessible linker region between its two domains which we could modify to have a cruzipain recognition sequence.
Figure 2: TetR monomer, showing domains
TetR acts as a dimer, and each monomer has a DNA binding domain and a dimerisation domain, consequently the Tet promoter has two TetR binding sites, both needed for full repression of transcription. We took the DNA sequence of TetR Class B from BBa_K106669 and located the linker region using PyMOL and PDB entry 3zqi. The linker region was long enough to modify into a protease recognition sequence.
Due to the dangers of working with a protein from a pathogen, we decided to use a common laboratory protease instead to model our system and provide a proof-of-concept. Therefore, the TetR part we have designed ( BBa_K2450201 ) has a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease recognition site instead of a cruzipain recognition site. The TEV protease is well-characterised, very specific, and can be expressed in simple bacterial systems, making it ideal for testing our sensor.
Figure 3: PyMOL image showing the mutated bases in the linker region
We also believe that this version of TetR provides more versatility for relieving repression of a gene or other DNA sequence, as an alternative to adding tetracycline.
As a control, we also created a part with an unmodified TetR repressor ( BBa_K2450251 ), which would give no output when the TEV protease is added. This would enable us to understand the background rate of transcription and consequently the rate of false positive diagnoses from the repressor being ‘"

The third day was fairly occupied.
Overnight cultures were collected for assays. Essentially, each culture was diluted into same starting Abs readings and incubated for 6 hours. Samples were taken at the starting time and after 6 hours. Abs and fluorescence readings were measured for each sample and then imported into excel file.
While we were waiting for incubation, we diluted the starting sample culture for Colony Forming Units protocols and spread 36 LB plates.
We nearly forgot to calibrate OD reference points at the end of the day!
At last, we counted the colonies (colony forming units) in those 36 plates. It was just an exhausting process!

Molecular Genetics
I've recently completed my BSc in Molecular Genetics and will be entering the Engineering program in the fall of 2009.  Most of my growing-up took place in the small town of Cochrane, Alberta.  My ultimate goals consist of working in the Biotechnology or health care industry.  While my interest in music, movies, snowboarding, and hanging out with friends may seem stereotypical on the surface, they feel unique in their own right and keep me busy most of the time.  This will be my first year on the U of A iGEM team and I am excited to help take the competition to a new level.  I think that iGEM will be a great experience because it demands innovation and collaboration on levels rarely seen in undergraduate programs.
Eric Bennett
Electrical Biomedical Engineering
I am entering my final year of engineering at the U of A.  After graduation, I hope to do research either with a biotechnology company or in grad school.  I think that iGEM is a great way to gain valuable experience and is an effective way of accelerating the field of synthetic biology.  My interests include brain-machine interfacing, genetic engineering, and robotic control systems.  My hobbies include playing guitar, video games, the occasional sport, reading, and fixing my car.
