Nadine made a PCR to prepare next Gibson assembly, ran it on a gel and recovered the according fragments from the gel. Details of the 4 PCRs:
ColE1 backbone with Ptet (from newly assembled J61002 plasmid), final concentration: 15.1 ng/ul
LacI ssrA rrnB T on repressilator plasmid, final concentration: 46.7 ng/ul
T4 lysis cassette on registry plasmid, final concentration: 29.7 ng/ul
RFP amplification with Plac from Gibson J61002 plasmid, final concentration: 61,2 ng/ul
Alessandro made again a digestion on the 4 colonies recovered from last Gibson assembly, with this time also the original J61002 plasmid. See Thursday 7th July for more details. This confirms that colony 3 has somehow reassembled without RFP because it is smaller than colonies 1 and 4. The bands are bigger after digestion because the plasmids have become linear and they run slower than the coiled plasmids.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#KeyDeletion_-_-_TEXT.html," we failed to complete this task.
CRISPR key deletion
Another biological security layer is provided by our key deletion    system. We have been working on two different approaches. Here we are    presenting the second approach, which makes use of a CRISPR/Cas9 system    which will delete the key from the genome if no special treatment is    applied. Addition of atc or tetracycline will stop the Cas9 expression.
This system is highly flexible and biological layers can easily be    added or modified to the wishes of the user. An other goal of the    biological safety layer is to prevent the release of the genetically    modified bacteria carrying our encrypted message or key. The message    and key are integrated into the amyE locus of the Bacillus subtilis genome, with the use of the BBa_K823023 B. subtilis integration vector    . (See integration) This is advantageous, because it has been    demonstrated that the amyE locus can be deleted by using the    CRISPR/Cas9 system [1] .
The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat    (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems are a part of the bacterial adaptive    immune system. Recently a genome editing tool has been designed based    on a type II CRISPR/Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes [2] . The    CRISPR-Cas system needs an additional sequence next to the protospacer    to distinguish the difference between it’s own DNA and “foreign” DNA.    This sequence is the protospacer adjacent motif, also known as PAM    sequence. [3] The PAM motif is essential for cleavage and makes sure    that nearly any DNA can be targeted by crRNA, assisted by    trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) cas9 to bind to the protospacer with    the PAM sequence and cleaves the double-strand DNA (dsDNA). The fusion    of crRNA and tracrRNA is sgRNA. [4]

Restriction digest of esterase, lipase, C3, and A3 were lost. SO, we started all over again (hopefully for the last time) and did a restriction digest of esterase and lipase again. Then, found C3 and A3 digested from a random previous restriction digestion.
ran this restriction digest on a gel, and it looked good
did a PCR of the esterase and lipase stock solutions to produce more.
8/05/17
Lab
Used nanodrop to determine the DNA concentrations of our restricted digest of esterase, lipase, A3, and C3. Data is in Shatera’s notebook. We did this to determine the ratio of microliters of the vector and DNA insert to use for ligation.
Worked out the ratio for ligations using stoichiometry
Ligated using ratios.
Transformed bacteria by heat shocking. We have two groups of the ligation and two groups of the transformed bacteria. After incubating the ligations in room temp for 30 min, the ligations were incubated with some of the bacteria (heat shocked for transformation). Then, after an hour, the bacteria were plated and grown. Then, with the other half of the ligations, we continued to incubate the ligations overnight at 44 degrees after sitting for 30 minutes in room temp. Then, we would transform the bacteria the next day. Then, after an hour, they should be plated to grow.

In this group, I am the unique girl among nine boys, and the most frequently spoken of mine is ""Oh, it's my duty to get some soy sauce! "" Strange, huh?  The  connotation of it is not words but meanings. Those guys are too gentle to arrange me doing something of coding.So I am more involved in clerical works, I design the team uniform and our logo,arrange the scheduling and get in touch with sponsors and alumni connection.

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

What is the Open Lab?
Genspace has a unique opportunity to expand its impact beyond its physical presence in New York and bring hands-on involvement with synthetic biology to schools and communities around the world. The Open Lab is the key step towards this vision; it is the complete set of knowledge, tools, and resources required to successfully develop a thriving community biolab, all created following open source principles. Enthusiast communities and organizations around the world can use the Open Lab to fill in key gaps in knowledge, tools, or resources to launch their own community biolabs.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#News_-_-_TEXT.html," wishes regarding the lab supplies, we discussed the transport of the material. For money is another important factor for efficient work, Erik gave us a short overview with his progresses in finding further sponsors.
Today Heinz gave us a theory lesson about different PCR methods (e.g. QuikChange PCR), adjustable factors and primer design. It was really interesting and helpful to hear about this method from the point of view of a person working in the lab and not just in some theoretical lecture. Afterwards, we discussed the possible applications of the different methods in our project.
19 April 2012,The iGEM team Göttingen 2012 is now complete!
Today was the first meeting with the final lineup of the iGEM team Göttingen! Heinz again introduced the topic to all the new members and shortly described the tasks of each of the three groups the project will be divided in. Then Erik presented to us our first sponsor: the company Sartorius StedimBiotech! We all are very thankful that they support our project with 5000 €! Afterwards we discussed organizational duties like the labbook, fund raising, wiki entries and necessary software. In order to start the actual work in our lab at the MPI, we wrote down a list of further equipment and supplies. Corinna and Berit will ask for the additional material at the universities` store.
04 April 2012, Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH is now Premium Sponsor.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," separately in E. coli after which the best repressing sgRNAs for each toxin would be taken forward and combined in C. difficile. In C. difficile only the expression of sgRNAs and dCas9  is required as all other components necessary for the system to work are already present. The overall toxin repression can then be measured with a cytotoxicity assay.
Vector design details
After thorough consideration, plasmid pMTL84121 was chosen to express our future construct as it contained all the necessary parts for successful cloning:
pCD6 gram+ replicon – for stable maintenance of the vector in C. difficile
p15a+tra gram- replicon – for stable maintenance of the vector in E.coli
catP gene – gives chloramphenicol resistance to bacteria and is used as a selection marker
Multiple cloning sites (MCS) - provides cloning sites for inserts
To test our experiment in E. coli and C. difficile, we constructed the following vector: pMTL84121-PthI-dCas9-Pfdx-tcdR-T10-PtcdA/PtcdB-gusA-T14 + gRNA.
What
Why
pthI
Promoter for dCas9.
dCas9
Cas protein that binds to DNA and blocks transcription due to steric hindrance.
Pfdx
Promoter for tcdR. Promoter team results showed the strongest activity of this promoter in C.difficile than any other chosen promoter aimed at E. coli (link to asRNA)
tcdR
An important regulatory gene in C.difficile, which affects synthesis of toxins A and B as well as other important chemical reactions
T10
Terminator for tcdR. It produces termination of tcdR transcription.
PtcdA/PtcdB
Promoters for toxin A and B respectively.
GusA
Reporter gene
T14
Terminator for reporter gene GusA. It produces termination of GusA transcription.
gRNA
Constructed gRNA complementary to specific region of PtcdA/PtcdB.
Experimental plan:
After carrying our initial planning of the components for our experiment, we came up with a following experimental proposal:
Cloning of PthI-dCas9 insert into pMTL84121: pMTLdCas9
Cloning of ptcdA/ptcdB-GusA-TB0014 into pMTL84121-PthI-dCas9: pMTSdCas9-GusA

The Wet lab is responsible for the whole process of the experiment which includes the design, the operation, and the record of the experiment. The others responsible for the data analyze, wiki, human practice, and presentation. Team members could have few different jobs if they are interested in. On the other hand, we are very fortunate to have many teachers, advisors, experts help us throughout the project and human practice. Here, we would like to offer our sincere thanks to every dedicated member and those supported us along our way.

With just four weeks to go, our project is entering its final phase, yet there's still plenty of work to be done. The team is now concentrated on characterisation, our biobricks are ready to be sent, and we are currently analysing the interlab data. Characterisation involves a number of key areas. The first stage was to carry out toxicity assays, which allow us to determine if our secreted products are toxic to our modified cells. Overall expression has been largely non toxic to the bacteria which is a big success. The next major challenge has been to determine whether the bacteria are successfully secreting our therapeutic molecules. We have used three secretion systems and, at present, one has been confirmed, with the other two being tested currently. Our other main line of experimentation is to determine the effects of our products on biofilms. In order to ensure safety, we are using a closely related, but non-pathogenic, form of pseudomonas.
Now that our wiki is ready, we can begin the process of putting our data in its completed form, ready for the jamboree. At the moment, our wiki has our project outline and model ling data with more content to follow soon. Away from the bench, policy and practices are making further progress. A member of our team is spending the week visiting a UTI clinic in London. This will allow us to conduct interviews with researchers and patients and to gather more feedback on our project. We have also been publicising our project on various media, with responses from, among others, Guardian science and the Wellcome Trust. Over the next few weeks up to wiki freeze, our team will finish characterisation, and complete our wiki. We will also be preparing our poster and presentation ready for Boston.
Until tomorrow...
WHAT'S UP? 06/08/15
Time is moving fast and the jamboree is drawing closer, we are currently 7 weeks into the project and our story is beginning to take shape. In the wet lab, we have now completed the cloning and preparatory work, with several biobricks ready to be sent; some unique and others improved upon. Characterisation and data collection are now our main focus, which means use of a new range of techniques. Members of the team have been getting to grips with toxicity assays to determine whether our products are harmful to the bacteria. Others have been working on fluorescence microscopy which allows us to detect the level of expression. Our next step will be to carry out secretion experiments and test our products on a target biofilm.

Figure 1: Differences between beans seedlings development under different treatments. Different letters above the error bars indicate significant differences at the 0.05 level using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc pairwise multiple comparison test according to Nemenyi. Statistical inferences were made using R package.
Conclusions
Control 1 and 2 groups, as well as Limonene 1 did not affect beans development. DEET toxicity was confirmed, once nether beans nor fungi were able to develop in the group treated with the repellent containing DEET. Treatment with high concentrations     of limonene also affected the development of seeds.
Notes
It is important to report some observations during the experiment: (1) plastic cups containg bean seeds were corroded by repellent with DEET; (2) we observed fungi development around the seeds under all treatments, except in DEET group. We believe     those observations reinforce DEET toxicity.

D. Critical Thinking about Law Related to Gene Technology
Huang Jun, professor of Sun Yat-sen University, led a project team to modify Human embryonic genes to treat β thalassanemia disease by Crispr-Cas9 Technology, which maybe be used to eliminate genetic diseases in the future vastly. In theory, it can also be used to change the color of eyes or intellect etc, and ensure these changes can be passed on to further generations.
What was beyond expectation is that this paper caused enormous ethical issues on a global scale. Many China’s biologists give strong support for it, while it also strongly criticized by many foreign biologists who call for banning the research of editing the human embryonic genes especially in those countries had lax regulation in law.
Prof. Rao Yi, a former dean of the Life Sciences School at Peking University, said that Chinese scientific research needs a more effective ethical regulation urgently. He said that “The more you have in technology, the more we are exposed in danger.” The idea of Chinese researchers is “We correct the mistake after doing the wrong things. But it maybe ignores the process of conceptual discussion.”
Human rights of unborn baby
Image there is a couple doomed to give birth to a baby with a genetic defect due to their genotype and after having gene detecting they decide to edit their embryo so as to have their own healthy baby.
And now here comes the question, should we ignore the embryo’s rights and interests if we fail to edit its gene? Well in many counties embryo is not recognized as people and it’s legal to perform abortion operation so you may be thinking that we can make it legal to perform gene editing in embryo. There is not standard answer for this question since you may come from different countries and have different culture background. But currently we regard it inhuman to do experiment in normal embryo and that is why Doctor Huang in Sun yat-set University choose the embryo with 21-trisomy.
Let’s think about another condition and question. Image the couple find that their"

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Throughout every stage of our project, we asked critical questions, for example, on the assumptions we held about our project, always seeking to involve the academic community in the conversation when bringing our project to fruition.

Prof. Guillaume Lambert, School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University
April 9, 2018
Professor Lambert helped us narrow down the choice of stimuli for our band-pass filter, reminding us of the different qualities of stimuli such as temperature, light, or small molecules. Our conversations ranged from testing methodologies to evaluating possible candidates for the gene components of our project. Through it all, he encouraged us to keep the circuit simple so it can be better modeled and its individual components tested down the line.
Prof. Edwin Kan, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University
April 10, 2018
Professor Kan specializes in biosensors and electrical systems that interface with physiological systems. In our conversation, he provided us with guiding principles to inform the design of our project. He tasked us with considerations such as the weighted logic of bacterial compared to the digital logic of electronics, the presence of biological noise, and the ever present issues of lag time in the response of a possible sensor. These were all important questions for us to ask ourselves as we worked on creating the biological equivalent of a band-pass filter in bacteria.
Prof. John March, School of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University
April 21, 2018
Professor March’s experience with engineering cell signaling pathways helped us frame our project in terms of canonical biological circuits. He introduced us to the potential of developing the feedforward loop motif that was necessary in our circuit.
Dr. Nika Shakiba, Department of Biological Engineering, Weiss Lab for Synthetic Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
August 6, 2018
Dr. Shakiba is a postdoctoral fellow at the Weiss Lab for Synthetic Biology at MIT, a lab at the edge of innovation in synthetic biology. Dr. Shakiba’s holistic input on the general nature of our circuit, which appeared to her as an incoherent feedforward loop, took into account the tuning of the two components of the circuit, the activity of the promoter, and the rates of degradation of the projects. Our discussion with her served as a good checkpoint for refining our project.
Implementation
We decided to use temperature response for our band-pass filter over light and small molecules, due to the abundance of testing methods and less potential error for testing our construct.
We developed a feedforward loop for our circuit and framed our project in"

4. The fourth argument is answering the claim ""We should not colonize Mars"" with the ground ""we have problems on earth that needs to be solved"" making the warrant ""We should not expand our territory when we have problems on earth"". This argument is focused on prioritizing. It isn't really an argument against colonization as much as it is an argument against colonization right now. As Zahan Bharmal writes in the article ""The case against Mars colonization"" in the British media The Guardian ""The most polarising issue in the Mars debate is arguably the tension between those dreaming of a second home and those prioritising the one we have now."" (Bharmal, 2018) He furthermore points out that "" ...if we have not figured out how to deal with problems of our own making here on Earth, there is no guarantee that the same fate would not befall Mars colonists."" (Bharmal 2018). A similar perspective can be found in the article ""Before we colonise Mars, let's look to our problems on Earth""(Glikson, 2017) on the website Phys-org. In the article Glikson states that ""Given the problems we face here on Earth it's important to ask whether we should be better tasked with looking after the only planet we know (so far) that can harbour life ."" (Glikson, 2017) he furthermore argues that  the idea of colonising other planets are misleading because ""It yields an impression in many people's mind that an alternative exists to Earth, a unique (so far) haven of life in the Solar system, currently suffering from global warming, rising oceans, extreme weather events , mass extinction of species and growing risk of nuclear wars."" (Glikson, 2017). This argument is not really an argument that is universally against colonization of Mars, but is rather an argument against colonization of Mars as a priority right now. We asses this to be a strong argument in terms of persuasion of the public, as the international medias are focussing a lot on poverty, climate challenges and other undeniably comprehensive problems for humanity.
We find that economy and priority proves to be very relevant and weighty arguments arguing against colonization of Mars in the near future, and we therefore asses that these will be taken into serious consideration by the average citizen. However they are not really arguments against colonization as a concept as much as they are arguments against colonization as a priority right now. Therefore we find it unlikely that the wish to colonize Mars will gain significant public support right now. However in the future"

Team iGEM14_Imperial and SCU-China 2016 have designed and characterized parts of Vitreoscilla haemoglobin (VHb). Evidence from articles and experiment prove that VHb can successfully help the strain increase its metabolism and accelerate the growth in restricted environment (Part: BBa_K1321200). In 2018, another article suggests that VHb can work more efficiently when using the twin-arginine translocase (Tat) pathway and exporting active Vhb into the periplasm of Escherichia coli1. This phenomenon is remarkable in microaerophilic atmosphere.
TorA is a twin-arginine signal peptide from E. coli. The twin-arginine system a bacterial protein export pathway with the remarkable ability to transport folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Team iGEM17_SSTi-SZGD fused TorA signal peptide directly to the N-terminal of OPH domain, successfully enabling secretion of OPH (gene product of opdA) to the periplasm of E. coli for the development of live cell biocatalysts (Part: BBa_K2244003). Inspired by these works, we improve the previous VHb (BBa_K1321200) by adding TorA signal peptide (sequence obtained from BBa_K2244003) to N-terminal of the VHb. We believe that in this new part, TorA can guide the fused VHb into periplasm, make it work well than before.
We gain VHb directly form official Kit(BBa_K1321200) and gain TorA signal peptide by company synthesis. Then VHb and TorA signal peptides overlap to a complete coding and be infused to our modified pUC19, just after lac promoter and RBS B0034. New plasmid is transformed into strain E. coli"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," / VT. The tortuosity is a parameter of a porous medium that relates to the shortest paths or main paths where diffusion takes place. The constrictivity relates to the change in cross-section of a segment over its length. So whereas the constrictivity can be determined locally, the tortuosity is a parameter that describes a region.
Knowledge about the behaviour of the diffusibility regarding the three parameters described above gives us insight in how a desired effective diffusion constant De can be obtained for our hydrogel. This is relevant because the effective diffusion constant De describes the main transport process in the hydrogel patch that will be used to transport lysostaphin to the skin in order to fight Staphylococcus aureus.
The volume fraction of the hydrogel is found to be 0.9 (2). For a volume fraction above 0.4 it can be assumed that the constricitivy equals 1 (1). Since we will not be investigating hydrogels with low volume fractions we can take the constrictivity out of the formula resulting in equation 2. Since we know the diffusion of eGFP in free medium (3) to be 0.87 e-10 m2/s we can calculate the tortuosity once we have experimentally obtained a value for the effective diffusivity.
Experiment
To determine the hydrogel properties an experiment was conducted to measure the effective diffusion of eGFP in the hydrogel with water as medium. Using eGFP (26.9 KDa) is relevant as its weight is similar to that of lysostaphin (27 KDa).
A cylindrical piece of hydrogel was submerged in eGFP for a day so it would contain eGFP. This piece was then aligned at the circular cross-sections with another piece of hydrogel. Over time eGFP diffuses into the piece of hydrogel where no eGFP is present. The speed of this process depends on the effective diffusion constant. Therefore pictures of the gel were made using a fluorescence camera at different timesteps, after excitation of the GFP at 480 nm UV light exposing for 1 second. These pictures where then analysed digitally. Longitudinal plots were obtained for each timestep, by averaging the intensity perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. The process of the experiment and the way of measuring the images are illustrated in figure 1.

DETECT
Biotechnology for Talented Kids
Talented children are generally well supported in developed countries. Special programs are set in place to find them amongst the general student population and then give them an education suited to their capabilities. Sadly, that is not the case in developing nations such as Mexico.
The first national efforts towards helping gifted children began a few years ago with a ‘speed’ program that let students advance one school year after passing a competence test. As usual in this country, that solution is near-sighted and mostly useless. What talented kids need is an education that advances continuously at their speed of learning and which takes advantage of their innate curiosity and love of knowledge, not a simple ‘one –year ahead’ pass to be redeemed just once at your nearest school (One coupon per person. Subject to restrictions.).
Other efforts towards encouraging children with higher capabilities to endure the mire of normal education have been set up by the government and civil association: Math Olympics (and, more recently, Physics Olympics too). There are three problems with this strategy. First, it is an event –discrete, limited and circumscribed to no more than a few days a year-, it is not an on-going development program nurturing students’ talents. Second, it selects students who are already good at math and simply polishes them through competition –no room for capable kids who want to learn advanced mathematics. And last, as it is limited in time and reach, it is also limited in scope: why just math (or physics)? Why are the other areas of learning left behind when dealing with talented children? Is it because of the myth that only savant-like mathematical prowess is indicative of a brilliant mind? It is a horrendous waste of human resources to channel all gifted students to fit preconceived notions of what ‘geniuses’ are.
Having all of these issues in mind, and having suffered personally the lack of options available to a young student eager to learn concepts beyond the limited school curricula, we set out to offer a solution. Through SyBRE (the student group we founded) we’ve developed a community service called DETECT (Spanish acronym for ‘Detection of Talented Students’). DETECT is a program aimed to detect gifted children and bring them to the Biology and Chemistry areas. Starting this October, we’ll be visiting local schools and applying a battery of IQ tests to students from all basic grades. After selecting the"

During the theoretical design phase it became apparent that recording such information in mutant’s own DNA sequence from which it was synthesized would be the smartest choice. That is because DNA already contains half of the information we want to save - the sequence that codes the biomolecule. As we want to associate the sequence information with the information of catalytic activity, there did not seem to be a better object than the DNA.
But how can we write such information into the DNA? Substrate Nucleotides!
While navigating the vast sea of scientific literature we have stumbled upon a fact that some polymerases do not incorporate nucleotides into DNA sequence if they are modified. We have then come up with an idea to attach the enzyme substrate to the nucleotides and term this compound “Substrate nucleotide”.
Such modified nucleotides then act as a target for various catalytic biomolecules - they would first need to recognise it, bind to it and then chemically convert it, resulting in the removal of the substrate. We call this chemically converted nucleotide a “Product Nucleotide”.
The removal of the different substrates can be achieved by different types of catalytic biomolecules that catalyse a vast range of different chemical reactions. For example, all of the six major classes of enzymes can be used. To explore the prospects of recording the activities of different types of catalytic biomolecules, please head to the Substrate Design Prospects page!
The catalytic molecule acting on the substrate nucleotide is the main principle behind CAT-Seq. A substrate nucleotide cannot be incorporated by DNA polymerase. In contrast - Product Nucleotide can be incorporated.
Yet, such concept alone is not enough to record catalytic activities of the biomolecules. What else is needed? Let’s dive right in.

Every part of the CAT-Seq design page is divided in two main sections:
Design description - an in depth explanation of how a particular part of our system works, how it should be used in real-life situation and why such design choices were adopted.

One way to counterattack this build­up of pyruvate, which will be converted into lactic acid and compromise cell growth/energy, is to push flux through the pyruvate synthase reaction and maximize the production of flavodoxin reductase. This will expend the excess pyruvate concentrations.

Try to maximize ATP
J_exp13
7/2­ Laura and I began running FVA codes for maximizing ATP. We compared these outputs to the max biomass outputs, which we used from our previous flavodoxin trials.
We noticed that most of the reactions whose flux ranges changed by more than 0.001 also changed directionality. We also noticed that many reactions at max ATP had lower bounds that were more positive than their upper bounds. We treated these reactions as if their reaction bounds were reversed. For example, instead of reading the reaction bounds at max ATP for XYLI2 as 1.44E­07 to ­5.893E­7, we read it as ­5.893E­7 to 1.44E­07. A majority of reactions that changed directionality were transporter reactions. Because ATP is indirectly involved with transporting proteins and sugars into the cell, it would make sense as to why maximizing its production would potentially alter the directionality of transporter reactions. This is why we only reported non­transporter reactions that changed directionality, which still consisted of roughly 220 reactions. Of the non­transporter reactions we identified, we only took those reactions whose flux ranges varied by more than 0.005 into account. Reactions that varied by less than 0.005 we regarded as essentially having no change in flux. Analyzing a list this complex is incredibly tedious and would not reveal anything about the effects of maximizing ATP on the model. There are too many factors to take into account. However, our greater difference in flux ranges was 0.02, so there was no need to do a thorough analysis of the data comparisons.

Analysis of high delta flux reactions
J_exp14
Laura and I did a quick analysis of the 317 nonoverlapping reactions which change by more than 0.001 between the N2 fixing and WT WM1788 models.

In order to achieve a reliable and affordable light source, multiple options were investigated. These included Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), an Electroluminescent (EL) Panel and a standard halogen lamp. The advantages and disadvantages are shown in the table below.

Table 2: This table shows the different light sources that were investigated for use in the device.
As a result, the LEDs were chosen for their combination of strength and low-cost.
All light sources considered were capable of emitting white light. However, for detecting the concentration of bacteria in a sample, a light of wavelength 600nm is required. At this length, the waves get scattered by the bacteria in the solution, causing a much greater change in light detected by the sensors under the wells. As such, the chosen light source was provided with a plastic “orange” filter that only allowed 600nm waves to filter through.
Alternatively, plate readers allow for the measurement of a multitude of types of biological experiments such as protein and enzyme assays. The device has been designed to allow for different filters for alternative wavelengths to allow for use as an affordable plate reader. Fortunately, these plastic filters with specifically designated wavelengths can be purchased from the link below for under £10 ($~13). For laboratories wishing to use the plate reader at multiple wavelengths, they can purchase as many filters as required, although a standard range of 400-650nm should be sufficient and cost-effective. Within the device the filters are easily exchangeable, simply slotting into place.
019 Fire - 600nm filter
Tests were completed in order to investigate whether the light was being lost from the device. Preventing excess light from entering the wells would allow the results to be more accurate. As shown in the figures below, the tests were completed in an open lab, in a Styrofoam box, and in an opaque, black Perspex box. The brightness of the individual LEDs were then tested in order to calibrate them.

One of the assets of the device is that the design is based on standard well plates"

Results
Our plan was to express flhDC constitutively with a selection of 8 different Anderson-promoters to achieve different levels of transcription. And indeed BL21 E. coli transformed with these constructs showed a higher motility than empty vector controls or WT cells. However, our results were very inconsistent, especially concerning the different promoter strengths when compared to each other. The troubleshooting revealed that we were missing a RBS between the promoters and the ATG within all our constructs. This probably explains the inconsistent results that did not allow us to quantify the effect of our constructs. We hope to finish these experiments with correct constructs soon because we are eager for presentable results!
Electron microscopy
Overexpression of flagellar genes like fliC or the flhDC operon should result in alterations of the flagellum structure or number, which can be visualized. In the case of fliC, which encodes flagellin, the building block of the flagellum, we expect the emergence of longer filaments. In contrast to this, flhDC as the master regulator is thought to increase the number of flagella when overexpressed, since all genes involved in flagellum assembly should be up-regulated.
In order to visualize these alterations we investigated the E. coli strain BL21, transformed with fliC or flhDC constructs, by using transmission electron microscopy. Both genes were under control of a strong constitutive promoter promoter (J23100). As reference strains we used BL21 cells carrying the same vector with an RFP insert. Furthermore the MG1655 strain, as a more motile strain with non-degenerated flagella, was used.
Fig. 9: Transmission electron microscopy pictures of WT E. coli strain MG1655 (A) and the BL21 strain transformed with K777101, a flhDC construct (B). The single flagella filaments of MG1655 are attached to the cell and visible very clearly. However, our cell densities in the BL21 cultures were not growing very well. Therefore we were not able to get good pictures and had to centrifuge the cells to obtain higher densities. This caused interweaving of the flagella and single filaments were not visible anymore (B).

When working with V. natriegens
ATCC
14048, no special precautions have to be taken since it has been shown that no known pathogenicity associated genes were present (Weinstock et al. 2016) Also, there is continued record of research since 1958 with not a single documented incident of a human infection with V. natriegens.
Molecular Biology
Accessing, altering and understanding the genetics of an organism has become commonplace since sequencing and methods for genetic engineering have become affordable and readily available. Making these tools available for V. natriegens is, therefore, paramount making it an attractive chassis.
Lately, a new branch of microbiologists developed an interest in V. natriegens. Their main focus lies in establishing state of the art methods and bringing V. natriegens to its full potential. We see our project as part of this movement and wish to make V. natriegens easily accessible to researchers. One groundbreaking paper (Weinstock et al. 2016) established several methods to make V. natriegens genetically accessible, as well as characterizing some central genetic parts. This paved the way for more research into applying its potential.
If you want to introduce genetic material into V. natriegens, you have several tried and tested options to choose from. You could use electroporation, a quick and simple method and the one with the highest transformation efficiency. Electroporation can also be used on wildtype cells. Or you could use chemically competent cells, the transformation works very similar to E. coli heat shock transformation. But in order to achieve good efficiencies using chemically competent cells, a nuclease deletion strain is needed. And if you want to insert especially large constructs, you can also use conjugation with very good success ( (Lee et al. 2016; Weinstock et al. 2016).
A fully sequenced genome is also a prerequisite for many studies. Currently, several sequences are available (Lee et al. 2016; Maida et al. 2013), one of them generated by us. The genome has a size of approximately 5.17
Mb
. Automated annotation was performed, revealing more of the genomic structure, as well as enabling the reconstruction of the codon usage profile (Lee et al. 2016).

However, HSPs exist in E.coli can’t improve the heat resistant ability much even when being highly expressed. As a result, we paid our attention to other hot-spring bacteria. After several strains were compared, we chose Tengcongensis MB4 which contains abundant kinds of HSPs. Here is a summary:
After further literature, we verified the function of GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ, TTE, IbpA, FliA, RpoE3 and RpoE7. Here’re the results:

As showed above, GroEL, GroES, DnaK and FliA perform better and we chose these four to construct heat-resistance part.
Intelligent quorum regulating system
We designed an Intelligent quorum regulating system contains three devices to make cell density decrease moderately and control the apoptosis happen in a certain part of cell. The first device is for quorum sensing. The second device is for moderation and targeting and the third device leads to programmed cell death.
The first one is quorum sensing device. Quorum-sensing molecules called AHLs can cross cell membrane freely, which means that it can be used as a symbol of cell density. When the density of AHL is high enough, AHL will combine with a protein called LuxR and become a complex. This complex can inhibit downstream gene, TetR. So the next device will not be inhibited anymore and then begin to work.

We added an oscillating circuit as the moderate device. In this circuit, three proteins inhibit the expression of each other, forming an oscillation as showed in figure 12.
Figure 12:Oscillator gene pathway
The function of oscillator is outputting the CI periodically which leads the accumulation of mazeF. In other words, the accumulation of mazeF is moderated. At the same time, different cells response to this signal differently in the beginning so that the cells responded quicker will die first (more detail in third device).

3.4 Ferritin Strategy
Ferritins as scaffolds for magnetic nanoparticle synthesis
In order to protect themselves against radical stress as well as the lack of co-factors, organisms evolved a high regulated and stable iron acquisition system, also known as iron homeostasis. [Iron Homeostasis of E. coli] To put it in a nutshell iron is taken up by iron transporters or siderophore mediated mechanism and is transporters through the outer membrane into the periplasm, in the periplasm it “changes” transporters and is transported through the inner membrane into the cytoplasm. It always gets released as Fe2+ into the cytoplasm.       In order to protect themselves against superoxide formation by the Fenton-Reaction a lot of organisms evolved iron storage proteins. One of the superfamily of these proteins is called ferritin. These ferritins are highly symmetrical protein nanocages synthesizing iron concentrates required for cells to make cofactors of iron proteins. Through their ability to cage in biominerals they were the first and most obvious scaffolds for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles. These natural metal storage homomers form solid particles inside of their protein shell. Ferritins are ubiquitous in nature and protect the cell from redox stress through iron overload and from iron deficiency. They consist of 24 protein subunits which can consists of a heavy (catalytically active) and light chain (catalytically inactive but stabilizing). Caged ferritin minerals can  have diameters as large as 8-12 nm with thousands of iron and oxygen atoms. Between species ferritins have different affinity for phosphate. Phosphate is low in animal ferritin iron minerals (Fe:P = 8:1) whereas in bacterial and plant ferritins iron minerals are usually occurring in higher relations (Fe:P = 1:1).[1]       Mössbauer studies on the superparamagnetic character of bacterioferritins (bfr) revealed that the phosphate concentration in a ferritin iron mineral reduces superparamegntic effects heavily due to replacement of the iron bridges between the iron atoms with phosphate. As these bridges have a lower exchange constant the order temperature is reduced further. [2]       The hollow ferritin nanocages are used in the chemical industry as scaffolds for synthesis of magnetite particles as well as for delivery of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, drug delivery and catalysis.

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," the year after, some team will use our promoter Fur for environmental uses for example. The potentialty dimension seems very important in iGEM.
The potentiality dimension refers explicitly to the possibilities that remain in the technical beings; in this dimension a technical being is perceived according to what could still be done from it, in what extent does it take part in future technical evolutions, if it can give away an interesting part, structure or function, or if it can serve as a chassis for a new technical being; in this dimension both particular and abstract beings matters because nothing is completely useless and worthless, neither the old object, nor the old idea.
Philosophers' quotes
“Technical objects which, in their relation with the natural world, essentially involve a recurrent causality must be invented rather than developed gradually, because these objects are the cause of their condition of functioning. These objects are viable only if the problem is solved, that is to say, only if they exist along with their associated milieu.
[…] Only thought that is capable of prevision and capable of creative imagination can bring about this reversed conditioning in time: elements that will materially constitute the technical object, and are separated one from the other, without an associated milieu preceding the constitution of the technical object, must be organized in relation to one another as a function of a circular causality that will exist once the object is constituted; what is involved here, then, is a conditioning of the present by the future, a conditioning of the present by what does not yet exist.”
Gilbert Simondon, On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects, unpublished in English. Translation by Mellamphy.
Simondon explains here very well that imagination and creativity are essential to invention, but also that the technical object (even biological ones, engineered by synthetic biology) can only result from this complex process of invention. This is due to the particular nature of the technical object: it must enter a world where it does not belong initially, thus all (or most of) its interactions have to be anticipated. The three dimensions of the technical culture are involved in the invention process, because they are necessary to the good understanding of the technical associated milieu. The iGEM competition requires imagination to invent a biological system that can be integrated in other systems (environmental, biological, technical); it requires creativity to conceive the appropriate construct; it requires a vast technical culture to implement it from the beginning to the end.
Synthetic biology is an applied science, this discipline produces a scientific discourse (theories, hypothesis, experiments, results), but does it produce a true technical culture? The iGEM competition promotes"

Library of functional acids
In our project, the regulation sub-system is constructed to adjust the microenvironment pH by synthesis of acid and alkali. These chemicals can be secreted outside the bacteria and thus change the microenvironment pH. A library for acid synthesis is established and the following kinds of acid are included: lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, succinate, 3-hydroxypropionic acid and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Therefore, we can apply different genes in the regulation sub-system according to various situations or wide-ranging needs.
○ Lactic acid[Expand]
L-Lactic acid, one of the most important chiral molecules and organic acids, is produced via pyruvate from carbohydrates in diverse microorganisms catalyzed by an NAD+-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase [1]. The ldhA gene is used in the synthesis of lactic acid. This gene encodes an L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) which converts pyruvate to L-lactate [2]. The simple pathway of lactic acid synthesis is shown in the figure below:
○ Formic acid[Expand]
Formic acid is a signature fermentation product of many obligate and facultative anaerobes [3-5]. One core enzyme, pyruvate formate-lyase 1[6], is applied to the synthesis of Formic acid. This enzyme work only under anaerobic condition. The figure below shows a simple pathway of formic acid synthesis:
○ Acetic acid[Expand]
In synthesis of acetic acid, two enzymes, phosphate acetyltransferase (pta) [7] and acetate kinase A (ackA) [8] are used. Phosphate acetyltransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:
Substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and phosphate, whereas its two products are CoA and acetyl phosphate [9-11]. ackA can facilitate the production of acetyl-CoA"

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Emilie#enjoy_-_-_TEXT.html," a heated debate on the way it could be used in gene therapy, which has led us to investigate the issue of the responsibility of the outcomes of scientific research. We asked the public in Lausanne about it, and the main answer was neither “the people” nor “politicians”, but by a great margin: “scientists”. Oliver Peter totally agrees with this answer: “That’s very clear and very easy: it’s you [scientists, who are responsible]! You and your conscience. You can never delegate an ethical decision to a committee, to your boss or anyone else for that matter. In the end, if you do not feel good about it, you must not do it, even if people disagree with you”. This, of course, is one way to see the problem. But it creates a paradox: on one side, people ask for more interaction with scientists and on the other side, they fully delegate the responsibility of research to the scientific experts. “It is a very complicated question, and you are talking about the crux of the matter. We do not really know who has to debate. Of course, society, because those are ethics problems that affect it as a whole”, Prof. Duboule says.
How can society as a whole be represented for such a debate? “Scientists have to shed some lights using their knowledge in order to clarify what was not properly understood”, Prof. Trono suggests.  “We need ethicists who think deeply on social repercussions of research. However, the general public also has the role to be well informed, and not indoctrinated. It is a societal dialogue, and this role is claimed by ethics committees – I’m thinking about the National Academy of Sciences in the USA for instance – that aim to represent society as a whole”. Prof. Trono was not the only one to mention ethics committees. “There are national ethics committees consisting of scientists, politicians, and sometimes philosophers in each country. Judgment has to come from there, if those committees are reliable of course. But you, as a scientist, have to wonder about your own project. The first defence line is people [scientists] like you”, Prof. Lefort insists.
Another way the media address the matter of responsibility in Science is by invoking “playing God”, a very strong symbol (which goes back to the polemical way some media cover scientific topics), and can be understood as “not respecting what God gave us by modifying the genome”. Xavier Gavend, theologist and chaplain at EPFL gave us another view on this subject by invoking the great importance of humility ("

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," donor DNA sequence flanked by Mosaic Ends (MEs), which can be recognized by the Tn5 transposase domain for cut and paste integration near the sgRNA target. This disrupts the lacZ gene and renders catalytically inactive beta-galactosidase, which can be visualized by blue/white screening with X-gal figure 9.
Figure 9. Overview of the single-step genome editing mechanism in the in vivo assay. (A) The fusion construct is loaded with a sgRNA that targets lacZ and recognizes ME flanked kanamycin resistance cassette for (B) picking it up. (C) CRISPR-mediation drives the loaded complex to the genomic lacZ locus, where the transposase domain (D) integrates the donor DNA. (E) The host strain contains an integrated copy of kanamycin resistance, while the lacZ gene is disrupted.
In this setup, we required a strain that contains T7 promoter expression system, as well as an intact genomic lacZ copy. Therefore, we chose to work with E. coli BL21DE3 as a host strain for the in vivo assay. This host was transformed to harbor the plasmid containing both the fusion construct ( BBa_K2643000 ) and the lacZ sgRNA cassette ( BBa_K2643010 ). The resulting strain was used for electroporation of donor DNA.
In our laboratory experiments, the donor DNA sequence was a kanamycin resistance expression cassette, flanked with MEs. Integration of this linear fragment into the lacZ locus would thereby confer the ability to grow on medium containing kanamycin, while still making use of the blue/white screen (note the selection medium contains kanamycin, chloramphenicol, IPTG and X-gal). In presence of kanamycin, cells should only be able to grow if the supplied donor DNA sequence is integrated into the genome. For non-targeted integration, intact lacZ confers chromogenic catalytic functionality when growing on X-gal, resulting in a blue colony phenotype. For targeted integration, lacZ is disrupted, resulting in loss of chromogenic capability and thus in a white colony phenotype.

II. Screening
i. Principle :
A real-time polymerase chain reaction is a laboratory technique of molecular biology based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It monitors the amplification of a targeted DNA molecule during the PCR, i.e. in real-time, and not at its end, as in conventional PCR [2] . Thus, we could use real-time PCR to screen the CHO-K1 cells grown from single colony and were transfected with single or low copies of NeoLoxp.
ii. Primer Design and Test
(i). Primer Design
The real-time PCR primers (Forward: TTGTCAAGACCGACCTGTCC, Reverse: TTCAGTGACAACGTCGAGCA) were designed by Primer-BLAST, a tool for finding specific primers, followed by BLAST specificity check.
(ii). Normal PCR Test
Since the designed primer has some base pair matches with the wild-type CHO-K1 cell’s genomic DNA, we need to select an appropriate annealing temperature to avoid unnecessary amplification as well as improving primer efficiency. This figure below shows the gel running result of temperature gradient normal PCR using Premix Taq.
Figure 8. Gel Running Result of Temperature Gradient Normal PCR
The result indicates that 62℃ may be the appropriate annealing temperature since wild-type gDNA shows no sign of PCR amplification at this condition, while it seems to still have PCR bands at 61℃.
(iii). Gel Extraction and Sequencing
The original annealing temperature of the designed primer was 60℃. Since we planed to increased it to 62℃ during real-time PCR, we still need to check whether the amplification product was accurate at 62℃. The sequencing result proved us to be correct (Figure 9).
Figure 9. Sequencing Result of Amplification Product at 62℃
(iv). Primer Efficiency Test
1. Principle:
Real-time PCR can be used to calculate the primer efficiency of PCR amplification via Equation 1. In which X_n
= PCR product quantity after n cycles, X_0
= initial copy number, E
= amplification efficiency, n
= cycle number.
X_n=x_0 \times (1+E)^n
Equation 1
Therefore, we can get Equation 2 below.

pH Optimization
Reaction Mixture
20μL Prussian Blue Ferritin (22μg/mL)
16μL Substrate (TMB or ABTS, 10mg/mL)
32μL Hydrogen Peroxide (30%)
Buffer (pH 2-11) up to 268μL
Combine all of the reagents listed in the reaction mixture, minus hydrogen peroxide.
Set the spectrophotomer to read the appropriate absorbance (650nm for TMB, 415nm for ABTS) for 10 minutes with 10 second intervals.
Add the appropriate amount of hydrogen peroxide, and IMMEDIATELY begin taking readings.
Repeat the experiment multiple times for each pH point (2, 2.73, 3.6, 4, 4.4, 5, 5.6, 8, 9, and 11).
Slopes of each experiment was determined and plotted against pH to determine optimum pH.

Purdue,2013,Team:Purdue#Human Practices#Overview and Project Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," for incorporating Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) into the Girl Scouts curriculum based on the then recent “Generation STEM Report” released by the Girl Scouts Research Institute. In particular, Ms. Payton wanted to organize a Biotechnology workshop for her Scouts in Central Indiana but was not sure how to do so. Aware of our enthusiasm and desire to engage budding scientist, Mrs. Schini referred Ms. Payton to the Purdue iGEM team. Together we organized the implemented the a biotechnology workshop with 6 Girl Scouts ages 9-11 on May 18th 2013.
Impact
We were able to train and inspire 6 Girl Scouts directly! Based on community interest and feedback we plan on implementing workshops every semester for years to come. Talks to reach other sectors of indiana are underway. One day we hope to be adopted into the national program!
Characterization Collaboration
Overview
The creation of a system to facilitate standardization within the Parts Registry could only go so far without teamwork.  We took the concept of teamwork to new heights by reaching out into the iGEM community to achieve the largest collaboration in the history of iGEM.  By working with iGEM teams that span the globe, we set out to create a versatile formatting mechanism for submitting and presenting genetic part information in the Registry.  Although Purdue organized the development of the standardized datasheets, the end result could not have been achieved without the collective knowledge of all those involved.
Impact
All of the feedback collected about disorganization in the Registry underscores the importance of applying standardization not only to the engineering of genetic parts, but also to the presentation of each part's information.  Beyond establishing the need for increased organization in the Parts Registry, we offer a solution to create the necessary standardization.  Through this collaboration, we have established the need for change and proposed a viable solution, with help and strong support from the iGEM community.

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#OpenScience_-_-_TEXT.html," to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts through adopting new technology. Nonetheless, data exchange between GenoCAD and the Registry of Standard Biological Parts has limitations since they are developed independently. As a result, they do not use the same system of categories to describe the BioBricks making “it difficult to map categories of one resource into categories used by another system” (Cai, Wilson, Peccoud, 2010). Cai, Wilson, and Peccoud, the authors of “GenoCAD for iGEM: a grammatical approach to the design of standard-compliant constructs” suggest that an ontology can be developed to regulate the vocabulary used to describe BioBricks. This would solve the problem of the distinct system of categories. Next, they encourage “standards to delimit on DNA sequences of different categories of parts”(Cai, Wilson, Peccoud, 2010) to allow users of GenoCAD to combine parts in any order they desire. iGEM can effectively find solutions to problems such as limitations regarding data exchange between two systems and follows through with its goal to further the Registry.
Once the sequence data is standardized, efforts to make it reusable become the next concern.  The description of parts in the registry is notorious for inconsistency in quality.  While the open sharing of BioBricks is prioritized by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, enforcing “sufficient” documentation and metadata is poorly policed.  Coupled with the inexperience of undergraduates with publishing work and time constraints imposed by a yearly competition cycle, the description pages for individual “bricks” are typically variable in quality. (See this part compared to this part ) with no prerequisites other than sequence and  annotations. This discourages use of the repository by synthetic biology professionals.  Initiatives to combat this gap include a proposal to embed prototypical fact sheets into the practice of documenting the sequences, which would include key measurements, experiment setup (host strain, media, temperature), and characterization parameters  (Müller & Arndt, 2012).  This is also partly addressed by an existing incentive structure embedded in iGEM gold medal criteria where teams are encouraged to:
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.  (Judging/Medals, n.d.)
Therefore, metadata of the DNA sequences describing how the part behaves and the experiments performed to create models of and validate this behaviour could"

Survey questions
Watch our interview! (In French)
English interview subtitles
After this short presentation, they gave us a lot of advice to improve our survey which we did. We presented a new survey on the 17th of April and obtained around 20 answers during this meeting and 53 answers online following this link: (PDF à mettre)  We also discussed during this meeting about the different way we can use to explain Synthetic biology because we still thinking that it was relatively easy to explain it. So, the idea was to do some video, game, and why not an exposition in the Museum Cap Sciences. As, we were already work on a broad game about biology, we decide to try this way.  During the next meeting, the 18 of June, we have presented a first version of our board game: Lab’Life. They give us a lot of advice on the working of the game, on the questions and allow us to better balance the game.
This partnership with Cap Sciences was also useful for the organization of the French Meetup in Bordeaux. They opened the museum so we could present our projects to the general public and get feedback on our communication skills. For more information, please visit our Collaborations page!
Survey results
With our survey, we have succeeded to have 70 answers to our survey on synthetic biology asking for different people which coma from different field as you can see on the graphs below. With the first questions, we can see that a lot of people don’t konw what synthetic biology and even if they answer yes their defenition or not always the right one.
With the following graph, we can see that the fields which people think there can be application for synthetic biology in are related to the environment with also foo industry and farming, and the medicine with health and cosmetics. After come the Energy and scientific outcome. In total, there are 548 votes that mean an average of 7.9 votes per person with the maximum of vote of 15 and the minimum of 1. In conclusion, we can say that in general, people think that there is some application for the synthetic biology.
After the different fields of application, we would like to know which kind of problem people think that synthetic biology can solve. The following graph also shows that people think that synthetic biology can solve medical and environmental issue. In total, there are 341 votes that mean an average of 7.1 votes per person"

For example, if the oligo specification sheet states that 20.3 nmoles of oligo were delivered, add 203 µL TE buffer to obtain a 100 µM stock solution. This stock solution can be diluted as needed into appropriate working solutions.
Resuspension Difficulties. While most oligonucleotides will readily go into solution at concentrations <10 µM, some oligos (with certain fluorophore modifications and some hydrophobic modifications such as cholesterol) can be more difficult to resuspend. For oligos that are harder to resuspend, and for which one might observe residual precipitate present following resuspension, we recommend that the oligo be heated at 55°C for 1–5 minutes, vortexed thoroughly, and then briefly centrifuged. Occasionally, residual by-products of the synthesis reactions remain in the tube and are visible after resuspension. These include Trityl (appears flakey) and CpG (which forms a pellet at the bottom of the tube). Neither of these reagents should negatively impact the performance of an oligonucleotide; however, both can be easily removed by passing the resuspended oligo over a Sephadex G50 column.
Storage Optimal Conditions for Standard DNA Oligonucleotides. IDT has tested the stability of oligonucleotides following various storage conditions (Table 1). The results of these studies indicate that the most stable temperature at which to store a standard DNA oligonucleotide is  20°C. An oligo stored at –20°C is stable for at least 24 months when either dried down, or resuspended in TE buffer or nuclease-free water. Standard DNA oligos dried down or stored at 5°C in TE buffer or water were found to be stable for long periods; however, better stability is achieved by freezing if the oligos are to be stored for extended periods. Standard DNA oligos stored at 37°C are stable for at least 6 weeks in water, or 25 weeks dried down or in TE. Storage at higher temperatures is not recommended; however, accidents can happen, such as oligos being left on the bench top overnight or freezers failing at the weekend, and it is important to understand that the stability of the oligo should not be affected. Regardless of the storage temperature, TE buffer, rather than water or dried down, is optimal for long-term storage. Storing Oligos with Fluorophores. Typically, fluorophore labeled oligos show a reduction in signal of about 20% after"

Before the lecture we made a survey, finding that in fact nearly 70% of the respondents didn’t understand the meaning of the term. Fortunately through our lecture, we got our audience across to the basic principle and a general situation of synthetic biology. The lecture was held in the chemistry lecture hall, Xiamen University on July 7th. And there was no empty seat in the hall, which was far beyond our expectation. Lots of students even stood the whole lecture. The lecture has five parts, including introduction of synthetic biology, iGEM, iGEM-XMU , iGEM-HS program and our following activity——campus fair.
Synthetic biology is a newly-developing subject. Our iGEM-XMU team used simple words with vivid pictures to illustrate the generation and development of this discipline. What’s more, we introduced some basic knowledge of genetic safety in an interesting video. These unfamiliar words such as bacteria and gene got across well in our lecture. And pointed to the worrying biosafety in the lab as well as in the public, we introduced some basic knowledge and principal related to biosafety. Some high school students talked with us about genetically modified food and transgenic technology after the lecture. As we expected, these students are just like seeds we sow to help synthetic biology and genetic engineering well understood by the public. More important thing is, this younger generation could accept synthetic biology, genetic engineering and other advanced science and technology under a promise of a correct understanding of biosafety and ethical problems related with transgenic technology. It would be really beneficial to the whole society we hope.
In addition, we introduced iGEM, including the start, development and goal of this competition to have the high school students know why we are crazy about it. After that we presented some excellent projects, from biosynthesis to software, to stimulate them to enjoy this game. Every program included has its specialty, from bacteria with fluorescence to E.coli that can detect spoiled meat, as well as a kind of automatic LegoTM robot. They were all impressed by the charming synthetic biology shows. iGEM-XMU, a good team with two gold medals in Asia division in the last two years was invited to MIT to compete with the top undergraduates all over the world and achieved a great success. We then introduced our development and our 2013 team, including our project.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Modeling#pqs_-_-_TEXT.html,",  after testing several model hypotheses, it was found that increasing the number of promoters had the greatest impact on the expression of mCherry (varying other experimentally controllable parameters were predicted to have essentially no effect on expression level).
When the number of promoters in the model was increased by 10-fold (30 to 300) there was a corresponding 10-fold increase in the “high” mCherry expression, as shown in Fig 5. We suggested that increasing the number of promoters would be the only practical method of significantly increasing mCherry expression. However it was subsequently discovered that the number of promoters in our chassis could not be increased significantly as high numbers proved toxic.
Conclusions
Our models revealed a distinct switch behaviour in the signal-response curve for mCherry expression.  Using this analysis we put forward the hypothesis that  the synthetic PQS concentrations used in our experiments were not sufficiently high and, although these experiments were conducted using a range of synthetic PQS levels, this range corresponded to fold changes in the low-response region shown in Fig 2.
The predicted switch behaviour has important and positive consequences for the L.A.S.S.O. - we predict that the mCherry output level would be distinctly bimodal, avoiding the necessity for sensitive calibration of the detecting device - low signals would result in approximately no response, whereas supercritical signals would induce maximal response from the sample.

From these 5 purifications, we calculated a standard curve to which we compared the integral value of the 5.12 ppm peak originating from our Dxs + HRT2 strain.
From the sample with the lowest amount of polyisoprene added (0.2 mg), no peaks could be identified, indicating the detection limit of the H1-NMR setup. Together with normalized peak integrals from the other 4 samples, we calculated the standard curve depicted in fig. 13. Based on the standard curve and the integral originating from the sample containing 3.2 mg polyisoprene (Fig. 13, 12), we roughly estimate our polyisoprene yields to be in the range of 0.5-5 mg polyisoprene/L (fig. 11). We realize that this yield estimation is far from optimal, however, only the sensitivity of H1-NMR allowed us to give a rough estimate of our yield.

Figure 13.  
When we tried to weigh our yield, we observed a many-fold increased yield compared to our input amount, and we assume that this conflicting reading is due to the presence of cell debris and other impurities adding to the output reading. This situation forced us to seek other yield calculation strategies, such as H1-NMR.

Explore SynthetINK
Our Project: SynthetINK
Most people fail to realize just how expensive, and environmentally detrimental current inks and its production methods are. For instance, the pigment Carbon Black is produced by the combustion of petroleum, leading to a great release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As well, modern ink production methods involve mining for minerals and harvesting large amounts of plants. This process produces large amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds, more commonly known as VOC’s, which are harmful to the environment. Looking to the price, current inks found in markets range from $0.53 to $3.40.The price of ink can even be compared to that of Chanel no.5 perfume, which costs anywhere from $2.50 to $3.30. In addition to this, ink companies are known to spend billions of dollars per year for testing and manufacturing ink products. It is simple to see why current ink production methods should change.
SynthetINK is our solution to these harmful effects of ink production. We are producing pigments in the bacteria Escherichia coli, using four constructs to create four different pigments in bacteria that will be extracted from the cells using an organic extraction. Following extraction, the ink will be placed into a fountain pen as a proof of concept.The pigment will be able to be used in a variety of applications, such as paint, printers, and textiles.
Looking into the human practices aspect of the project, our team has planned for a number of interviews to be conducted throughout the course of the season. We have interviewed a few experts in the industry and they have stated that they would be very interested in using our project in their businesses. We have also hosted a parent-teacher night to spread synthetic biology aspects to the community, as well as to display our project. Besides this, we intend to create a mathematical model of the growth of our bacteria and the expression of the genes and pigments produced.
Our hope is to successfully produce an ink at the end of the season to be showcased to the world.
Environmental Impact
With SynthetINK, our primary focus is a drastically reduced environmental footprint compared to modern ink"

STIMULI PROTOCOLS
Prelude
We looked at the effect of various stimuli on the polysaccharides, proteins, and structures  involved in the various stages of a biofilm. In particular, we looked at varying concentrations of  nutrients, physical environments, and media.
For nutrients, we chose three levels of stimulation – zero stimulation, medium stimulation, and  maximum stimulation. Their effects on the biofilm response were then observed and analysed  through a battery of assays looking at the levels of biofilm components.
The stimuli were administered and the cell cultures were incubated for 48 (±3) hours at 23  degrees Celsius, which is the optimum temperature for biofilm growth (White-Ziegler et al. 2008). As bacteria turn their environment acidic as a result of anaerobic metabolism, buffered LB was  used using the phosphate salts, potassium phosphate monobasic and potassium phosphate  dibasic. pH 7 was adjusted for using 0.1 M concentration in Luria Broth. The E. coli cells were  incubated in buffered LB to maintain pH 7 and eliminate the extraneous variable of acidity. The  stock solutions for the stimuli were also created in buffered LB to prevent uneven nutrient levels; the phosphate salts are a systematic error across all inoculations and can thus be ignored.
In continuation with the project, we are planning to optimize results by combining the treatments which give the best results.
Ethanol
Reasoning: Given the large quantity of literature on the effect of ethanol on biofilm, it is a very important  stimulus. The ethanol concentrations being tested in this experiment are 0.53% and 2%.  Cegelskiet al. (2012) found that the level of some proteins involved in biofilm formation  increases in the presence of ethanol. They also found UT189 strain colonies to be 55% larger  (colony morphology assay). Cell viability is compromised at concentrations exceeding 4%. Materials for Ethanol stimulus: • Overnight cultures of E. coli
•40% EtOH solution prepared in phosphate buffered LB
• 96-well plate
Protocol:
1. Grow overnight culture of E. coli in phosphate buffered media.
2. Add 200 µL of "

In order to reflect the affinity of Salmonella to tumor cells and to normal cells, we                     hope that the difference between experimental results of tumor cells and normal cells is obvious.                     However, the numbers of bacteria in different host cells are difficult to count, and we can only count the                     number of infected cells and calculate their the proportions. Therefore, we need to                     predict the time when the difference is most obvious. Our App just can do this for us.
Chemical control model
Profile
The Tet repressor protein (tetR) regulates transcription of tetracyclines resistance protein, tetA.                     The expression of tetA must be strictly regulated since tetA is a membrane-spanning H+-[Tc-Mg]2+ antiporter which means it can lower the pH environment of cytoplasm. As a result, the natural                     circuit of tetracyclines regulation is a negative-feedback circuit2. Tc is the inducer,                     which shows                     high affinity to tetR protein. The tetR protein binds to tetO sequence on DNA specifically, thus                     inhibits the expression of Tet promoter. When Tc or other similar molecules like ATc                     (anhydrotetracycline) diffuse into bacteria, they will bind to tetR protein and unleash the tetR                     protein from DNA, and thus relieve the inhibition and start the expression of Tet promoter.
In our project, we choose ATc (anhydrotetracyclines) as the inducer. ATc is less harmful to                     bacteria than Tc and about 100-fold higher affinity to tetR than Tc2.
The ATc model aims to predict and solve two problems: first, how fast does the circuit react to                     ATc; second, how many target gene will express in the bacteria community under a certain                     concentration of ATc.
Hypothesis
There are two tetO sites on the Tet promoter and both can bind to tetR protein randomly and inhibit                     the promoter’s expression independently. To make the condition simple, we consider the two tetO                     sites into one as we just want to explain the relationship between the promoter inhibition and                     the tetR protein expression.
In our project, the ATc concentration in our incubation environment is uniform, and the diffusion                     rate of anhydrotetracycline can be ignored3. In spite of this, the degradation rate of                     ATc under 37℃ must be taken into account as reported4.
Based on these facts, we give the following hypotheses:

Ben Gurion University: Beersheba, Israel
As it is our university's first time competing in iGEM, we found neighborly mentors in the team from Ben Gurion University (BGU) - only a two hour drive away from our own university! For one, they helped us design an overall yearly program for iGEM tasks based on their previous experiences, also sharing a detailed budget plan with our PI for reference.
BGU we instrumental in our completion of the interlab study, which was a necessity for our team to fulfil our medal requirements. Our team did not meet the Interlab standards by the first deadline, and as such it was critical that we did it right for the final submission in August. BGU assisted us by troubleshooting issues we had in our first try, helped us plan out the experiment well, and even provided is with comptent D5a E. coli, which we ran out of when we need them most.
Finally, BGU hosted a meetup between our two teams which included a quick tour and presentation by our hosts, help establishing good presentation structure for the conference, and a super-fun bowling game!

13. This time, the cells were resuspended with 2 mL of 20% glycerol.
14. Quickly, the solution was aliquoted in 55 µL of solution into the pre-chilled centrifuge tubes.
15. The cells were stored in the -80C fridge until they were needed to be used.
Making Agar Plates
Purpose: In order to make antibiotic resistant plates in order to test and make sure that cells have incorporated the desired plasmid.
Procedure:
1. The autoclave was turned on to warm up.
2. 300 mL of distilled water was measured and put in an appropriately sized beaker.
3. 7.5 g of LB miller and 4.5 g of Agar powder were measured and added to the distilled water in the beaker.
4a. The bottle was autoclaved for sterilization purposes.
4b. While the autoclave was running, ~16 Petri dishes were labeled with the date and the type of antibiotic that would be added to the plates.
5. The bottle was removed from the autoclave and then allowed to cool to about 60 C.
6. When the bottle was cooled, 300 µL of the desired antibiotic was added to the solution.
7. The bottle was swirled to ensure that the antibiotic was mixed equally in the solution.
8. Approximately 50 mL of the solution was distributed to each of the Petri dishes, under sterile conditions, and allowed to cool.
9. Once the agar had solidified, they were placed lid side down and stored in the refrigerator. *Note: Lid side down is important so that any condensation does not collect on the agar. This could affect the quality of the plates.
Transformation
Purpose: This procedure is done in order to incorporate new genetic material into a cell. This lab uses transformation on bacterial cells to insert plasmids. Once the desired plasmids have been constructed and isolated, they are inserted in to the cells by electroporation or heat shock. Once these cells have the new genetic material introduced, they are allowed to grow and recover in a shaker and then are plated so that cells without the incorporated antibiotic resistance and the new gene will die.
Procedure:
1.A 50 µL aliquot of electrocompetent cells were allowed to thaw on ice.
2. An electroporation cuvette was put on ice to chill.
3. 2-3µL of the desired plasmid was added to the electrocompetent cells and mixed gently by pipetting.
4. The cuvette was wiped and"

With help from other iGEM teams in China who volunteered to validate our circuit in their own lab, we obtained a large amount of data for modelling and modifying our system (see collaboration).

Bac to the Future
TOOL OVERVIEW
Bac to the Future is an art installation and web application that aims to communicate core concepts of synthetic biology to non-scientists by engaging users in a fun and interactive environment. Specifically, our team focused on how an interactive and user-friendly application could demonstrate the significance of DNA as a powerful encoding language, as well as the potential for bacteria to be used as archival data storage. By visiting our application's virtual lab bench and following a step-by-step protocol, users can select tweets with the hashtag #iGEM2013, encode these tweets into DNA, and insert their encoded messages into digital E. coli bacteria.
At the Wellesley College Human-Computer Interaction lab , we are interested in exploring how next-generation technology could facilitate the learning of complex scientific concepts and promote educational outreach. With this goal in mind, we chose to deploy both a web application for wider distribution and greater accessibility, as well as an interactive art installation for exhibition purposes.
Our project was inspired by an experiment conducted by the Church Lab at Harvard Medical School , which used bacteria DNA to store encoded book citations. In designing the user experience, we integrated relevant and familiar components such as dictionaries, and simplified the experimental protocol to promote intuitive understanding. In addition, we incorporated user feedback to assist in the conveyance of fundamental concepts while minimizing confusion. In the future, we plan to continue improving the user experience through further user testing, and hope to distribute the web application as an educational tool.

Meetups
Nordic iGEM Conference
In June, DTU BioBuilders went to the Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) in Stockholm hosted by team Stockholm. During the weekend, DTU BioBuilders connected and shared their projects with the other Nordic teams. DTU BioBuilders presented their project at a mini-Jamboree, where the requirements set by iGEM Headquarters were in focus. The mini-Jamboree gave DTU BioBuilders the opportunity to get a feel of the big iGEM competition in Boston and refine their project.
Besides the mini-Jamboree and two workshops, Ethics and Speculative Design of Synthetic Biology, there was also time for barbeques and other social activities to get to know the other teams.
Human Practice Workshop
UNIK-Copenhagen hosted a Human Practice workshop in August where the DTU BioBuilders attended together with SDU-Denmark and Chalmers-Gothenburg. The workshop was very useful and a great success, and DTU BioBuilders were involved in patent reflections, public speaking, ethics, philosophy, and human practices in general.
The European iGEM Experience
In July, iGEM EVRY and iGEM IONIS hosted a big gathering in Paris for many of the European iGEM teams.
DTU BioBuilders attended this big gathering and presented and opposed their project to the other teams. It was a great occasion to share ideas and explore new possibilities about our project. Furthermore, the team had two interesting talks about synthetic biology, where they learned about challenges, risks and the economical aspect of synthetic biology.

Reason for microbead usage is that there is no compelling incentive for corporations to stop using them.  This article suggests the incorporation and usage of the term “Ecocylable” to refer to materials that are degradable in soil, wastewater etc. and which pass toxicity and bioaccumulation standards.
Government of Canada. (2016). Microbeads in Toiletries Regulations. 05 November 2016. Accessed from: http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2016/2016-11-05/html/reg2-eng.php .
From this archived government document, we learned that Canada has already passed legislation to phase out microbeads from toiletries by mid-2018. The period of review for this legislation had already lapsed by the time we began our search.
We corresponded with other iGEM teams in Canada through email.
interlude 1: GeekStarter workshop (June 11, 2017)
The GeekStarter MindFuel Workshop allowed our team to consult with experts experienced with iGEM and ask for their input on our project. We got specific advice in four areas of our project during the breakout sessions: how to design a wiki, how to model our experiments in an iterative way, how to brand ourselves, and how to go about contacting experts. We also had opportunities to speak to the other Alberta synthetic biology teams, including UrbanTundra high school, the University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge High School, and the University of Alberta.
Week 7: June 12 - June 16
On Monday: Sam, Helen, Lalit, and Alina went to Sir Winston Churchill High School, a local school with IB (International Baccalaureate) Biology classes, to host a lecture about synthetic biology followed by a guided DNA extraction experiment. At our weekly team meeting on Tuesday, we made an exhaustive list of different fundraising opportunities including crowdfunding, promotional events, and corporate sponsorships. We researched different crowdfunding websites, set up a crowdfunding page and began promoting it on team social media and to our personal networks.
Week 8: June 19 - June 23
This week, our team focused on fundraising. We began the process of applying to various corporate sponsorships.
The policy side of our team began to look into how to lobby for a more concrete space policy. We attempted to contact the Canadian Space Agency to get more defined answers about Canada’s space strategy, as we wanted"

As for any research project, we started by reading...and reading...and reading some more.  We determined that our project was feasible.  Modeling has been done of the SOS and phr pathways, using UV radiation to activate them.  Normally, however, the promoters of these pathways were linked to GFP or other fluorescent proteins.  As a real-time biosensor, fluorescence was not really an option.  We wanted people to be able to see the colors change as it happens--while they're still in the sun.  After figuring out which genes we wanted to use, we looked in the Registry--and found them!
For some background, lacZ has been used for blue/white screening of E. coli for decades.  Standard E. coli naturally make the lacZ protein (beta-galactosidase, or beta-gal), which reacts with X-gal, a structurally relative chemical to lactose (which is cleaved by beta-gal into monosaccharides).  However, when beta-gal cleaves X-gal, one of the chemical components formed is a bright blue pigment, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole.  Therefore, normal E. coli, when plated on X-gal with IPTG (an inducer of lacZ) turn blue.  If a lac- E. coli is transformed with a part containing either the alpha constituent of lacZ or the entire gene, those that transform successfully will turn blue, while the rest (which are still lac-) will be white.  This process can also be done in reverse, where the new gene will splice the coding region responsible for lacZ, making it ineffective.  Thus, the successful bacteria will be white (and everything else will be blue).  For this project, we are attaching a different promoter to the front of lacZ, as opposed to the normal operon.  Thus, lacZ will be transcribed at the same time as the system corresponding to the promoter is transcribed.  Therefore, as our promoter is activated, the E. coli will turn blue.
When DNA damage occurs, kinks and gaps are formed in the DNA strand.  Thus, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is formed when the cell attempts to transcribe the kinked DNA.  In particular, UV-B radiation forms thymine-thymine (cyclopyrimidine) dimers between adjacent thymines.  The cell will first activate two initial DNA repair systems. "
