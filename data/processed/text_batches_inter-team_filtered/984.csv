For Synthetic Biology in particular and scientific projects in general, we believe societal considerations should be upfront. Here we show how we went on and explored safety, responsibility, ethics and scientific relevance of our project.         Furthermore, we demonstrate how we integrated gained insights throughout the design and execution of our project.
Overview
Experts
Interview with Experts
We met with Auke Jan Ijspeert (Head of Biorobotics Laboratory, EPFL) and Jan Roelof van der Meer (Head of Department for Fundamental Microbiology, Université de Lausanne) to interview them about their project “Envirobot” ( biorob.epfl.ch/envirobot) , biosensors and their general application in robotics.
Keypoints of the Interview
“Envirobot” had the aim to develop an eel-like robot with built-in biosensors that can either go on"
Carnegie_Mellon,2014,Team:Carnegie Mellon#Talks_-_-_TEXT.html," went through two sessions having teachers be the students that are experimenting with Creature Feature. They went through all three phases of the lab, Construction-The Great Flood-Engineering for Survival, and were able to give us feedback on how this kit would do in a classroom setting. High school teachers were concerned about upping the level of the kit to include dominant and recessive traits, whereas middle school teachers were a lot more comfortable with the level the kit was already at. The AP Environmental teachers were very much interested in getting a copy of the NetLogo Environmental Simulation that Niteesh presented because it would help for their students to visualize an ecosystem over time when there is a basic food chain and when there is an external force that bottlenecks it. With this workshop, we were able to advertise the upcoming kits and really gain insight from those who would be teaching them.

YCC Chemistry Carnival Outreach
The Greater Pittsburgh Younger Chemists Committee puts together a chemistry carnival annually for a day of chemistry experiments and demonstrations and this year, the CMU iGEM outreach team offered to set up a booth with strawberry DNA extractions for the kids. This was one of the first times that we were able use the strawberry DNA extraction kits as a way to find out how long it takes for quick demo settings. With 50 visitors at the booth, the average time was under 5 minutes and all of the kids were extremely excited about their “cotton-candy” DNA. Some even took a sample of it home with them and one teacher from Altoona, PA timed the outreach team in their strawberry DNA extraction. Our fastest time was 2 minutes and 16 seconds between Courtney and Nicole, and this video was shown to the principle of Bishop Guilfoyle Catholic High School. The CMU iGEM outreach team will be sending out the kits for beta testing in late October for this school to give us back more feedback. This event also solidified the idea that our strawberry DNA extraction labs were ready for the production line and classroom kit lending library!

3 weeks were all we had when we saw the magic words ""Advancement Boston SDU-Denmark"" on the big screen at Lyon. With great pleasure, we discovered the Feedback page shortly after returning from Lyon, and realized our presentation could need some brushing up. We imagined and realized a whole new presentation concept based on our own wiki. Our Boston presentation can be seen online at iGEM's homepage. Furthermore we worked day and night on our NMR results, to confirm our first rubber results. One of our main goals was to invent a novel type of wiki and win the Best Wiki award, so we were very happy to see the feedback page and work on the categories where we received the lowest results. This seems to have worked pretty well, we won the Best Wiki award in Boston!
So, just a quick sum up, you are looking at the price winning"

Manufacturing
Wednesday, August 24th
Dave and Nel worked on manufacturing today. David had figure out a way to properly make our mice testing patches. The protocol is as follows:
        Procedure:
Prepare the adhesive laminates following Nelly’s procedure
Plug the iron in to preheat.
Look through the adhesive laminate under a light source and pick out and most even area. Sketch the 1 x 1 cm square on the liner at the center of the area
Trim the laminate to roughly 1.5 x 1.5 cm
Lay the laminate membrane-side up on the iron board, and the backing layer on top
Iron 1 side of the patch up to the sketch. To make the seal even and bubble free, when sealing, apply more pressure on the side of the iron that’s touching the line, then tilt the iron so that side of the iron lifts up slightly, then press it down again, after each time, move the iron away from the line to the edge of the patch. The seal should look clearer than the center. If not, then the iron is not hot enough, redo using a different side of the iron until it’s clear
Seal the other 3 edges. Now the patch should be stuck to the iron board, leave it there. Repeat the process for another 2 patches.
Remove the first patch from the iron board. Prevent peeling the patch off the liner by sliding a finger under the patch after you peel off 1 corner when you reach the liner.
Hold the patch diagonally, vertically, backing-side facing you. Bend it slightly so the backing folds towards you. The backing at the center (not sealed) should bend and separate from the membrane, creating a thin pocket running diagonally from the top corner to the bottom corner.
Fill the syringe with water, use the needle to poke a hole at the top corner of the patch, make sure the needle did not poke anywhere else and the needle is in deeper than half of the patch.
Inject the water slowly, keep a bend in the patch so we have a pocket, fill it from the bottom corner, tilt the needle and the patch to get the other 2 corners, then fill it nearly to the top corner. A good volume should be 0.06 - 0.08 mL
Remove the needle straight out, a drop of water may leak out, dry it lightly with paper towel, don’t push on it
Lay it on the iron board. Make sure there’s no water droplet visible. If there is, dry it"

Outreach, industry, and IP blogs for the iGEM community
When we started development of Neptune the question was raised:
How do other researchers and industries use microfluidics?
How much does the public know about microfluidics?
By answering these two questions we could tailor Neptune to be as useful as possible, by as many people as possible.
We could develop an accessible workflow.
To this end, we decided to visit several synthetic biology labs and companies to learn more about their use of microfluidics. We also participated in public outreach and education, using this as an opportunity to educate the public about synthetic biology, and to learn more about the public's view of microfluidics. Finally, we wrote several blogs on IP in synthetic biology, drawing from what we learned about the importance of accessibility in synthetic biology.
In this page we cover 3 sections to our Silver HP contributions:
We discuss our public outreach and education contributions.
We summarize our industry visits
We conclude by exploring our contribution to the iGEM community: A reference blog on IP in synthetic biology
Public and Educational Outreach
The goal of public engagement was twofold: firstly, we wanted to do our part in educating the public about synthetic biology, and about microfluidics! Secondly, we wanted to learn about what the public knew about microfluidics- are DIY microfluidics a common practice? Does the average person know what a microfluidic is? Our first outreach was the Building with Biology event at the Boston Museum of Science.
Building with Biology | 29 June 2016
In the Building with Biology event, our team participated as guest researchers, we worked alongside museum staff to present museum goers with synthetic biology activities. These activities serve to educate the people playing, and we also got to learn about what the public knew about in synthetic biology.
One such activity included solving problems using various genetic “building blocks,” each labeled with a specific function. These literal"

2. Tried the traditional lambda Red recombination and successfully inserted four testing devices into the genome, locus of LacI.
Experimental details [Expand]
Coupling CRISPR/Cas9 system with λ-Red recombineering
1. Plasmid construction
We designed a two-plasmid system applied for it. There was a low-copy plasmid pSTV29 for Cas9 and λ-Red expression from the arabinose-inducible promoter PBAD respectively and a high-copy plasmid pUC19 for sgRNA expression from a constitutive promoter J23119.
Fig.1 Double plasmids to meet different requirements for each element. Equip the high copy number plasmid pUC19 with sgRNA targeting site on genome and donor fragment with homologous arms. The low copy number plasmid are equipped with expression cassette of Cas9 protein and λ-Red recombinase
We mainly used Gibson assembly to construct these two plasmids. The pUC19 plasmid containing sgRNA and donor fragment was successfully constructed. Separately, we successfully constructed the lambda Red protein and Cas9 protein on pSTV29.
However, we didn’t finish the second plasmid construction due to the limit of time. Instead, we decided to employ the traditional lambda Red recombination system to carry out the integration process since we received the plasmid pKD46 from Dr. Bo Lv.
Lambda red recombination
For facile blue and white colony screening, the target site we chose is the 5 ’end of LacZ gene encoding the active site of β-galactosidase. At first, we used strain TOP10 as our host. To test the experiment conditions which is optimal for transformation, we did the pre-experiment and used the resistance Kana gene as the donor fragment to target the gene locus of LacZ. We have tried several times, but failed.
Considering that the complementary sequence between donor fragment and target site is one of the most important factors deciding the successful rate of recombination, we re-designed our experiment. The whole sequence of TOP10 is not open access and the specific sequence for LacZ has been modified and we couldn’t confirm the modified one. So we decided to replace the host to DH5α.
1. Transformed the plasmid pKD46 into host and made it competent cell after induced by L-arabinose
We transformed the pKD46 into competent cell DH5α, and added arabinose to induce the expression of recombinase. When the OD600 is about 0.6 which means"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html," common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins: CheW and CheA interact with receptor molecules to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals; CheY transmits those signals to the flagellar motors, CheZ controls their lifetime; CheR (methyltransferase) and CheB (methylesterase) regulate MCP methylation state.  Abbreviations: OM (outer membrane); PG (peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall); CM (cytoplasmic membrane)
As in many biological signaling systems, the signaling currency in the E. coli chemotaxis pathway is reversible protein phosphorylation (Fig. 5).  However, the principal signaling chemistry is a bit different in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  CheA is a kinase that uses ATP to autophosphorylate at a specific histidine residue.  Phospho-CheA molecules then serve as donors for autokinase reactions that transfer phosphoryl groups to specific aspartate residues in CheY and CheB.  Phospho-CheY enhances CW rotation of the flagellar motors; phospho-CheB has high MCP methylesterase activity.  The active forms of these response regulators are short-lived because they quickly lose their phosphoryl group through spontaneous self-hydrolysis. CheZ further enhances the dephosphorylation rate of phospho-CheY to ensure rapid locomotor responses to changes in the supply of signaling phosphoryl groups to CheY.
CheW couples the autophosphorylation activity of CheA molecules to chemoreceptor control.  Receptors, CheW, and CheA form stable ternary signaling complexes that modulate the influx of phosphoryl groups to the CheY and CheB proteins in response to chemoeffector stimuli.
Figure 3: Phosphorelay signaling.  The flagellar motors of E. coli spin CCW by default; the signaling pathway modulates the level of phospho-CheY, the signal for CW rotation.  Reactions and components that augment CW rotation are depicted in green; those that augment CCW rotation are depicted in red.
Chemoreceptor signaling states in E.coli
The signaling activities of chemoreceptors are described by a two-state model (Fig. 6).  Receptor complexes in the CW signaling state activate CheA, producing high levels of phospho-CheY.  Receptors in the CCW signaling state deactivate CheA, resulting in low levels of phospho-CheY.  Thus, the behavior of the flagellar motors reflects the relative proportion of receptor"

Tokyo_Tech,2016,Team:Tokyo Tech#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"1) by PCR, we obtained 198 Prhl mutants and obtained the Prhl mutants of which promoter activity was stronger than wild type Prhl( BBa_R0071) , and named it Prhl(Noticeable Mutant) ( BBa_K1949060) , hereafter referred to as Prhl(NM), which suited our goal.
2-3. Results
The SN ratio of Prhl(NM)( BBa_K1949060) was higher than that of Prhl(LR)( BBa_1529310) and Prhl(NM)( BBa_K1949060) did not crosstalk to C12 unlike Prhl(LR)( BBa_1529310) .
2-4. Discussion
Many iGEM teams used AHL and probably this tendency continues. When you use AHL, you will find that promoter strength is quite different depending on the type of AHL and it bothers you to design genetic circuits, for example, including Plux and Prhl. Prhl(NM) ( BBa_K1949060) has almost as same strong activity as Plux. Furthermore, Prhl(NM) ( BBa_K1949060) has higher specificity to C4 than Prhl(LR)( BBa_1529310) . Prhl(NM) ( BBa_K1949060) can be said that it expands the possibility of using various combination promoters depending on AHL.
3. Characterization of rhlR
3-1. ""Background”for our Characterization of rhlR
When we used two type of rhlR, one was LVA-tagged and the other was normal, we found that gap introduced with rhlR barely expressed but gfp introduced with rhlR-LVA expressed greatly. We decided to find this cause.
3-2. Summary of the experiment
Measure RFU of GFP of the E. coli containing (a) Pcon-rbs-rhlR-LVA (pSB6A1), Prhl(LR)-rbs-gfp (pSB3K3), (b) Pcon-rbs-rhlR (pSB6A1), Prhl(LR)-rbs-gfp (pSB3K3), (c) Pcon-rbs-rhlR-LVA (pSB6A1), Prhl(RL)-rbs-gfp (pSB3K3) or (d)Pcon-rbs-rhlR(pSB6A1), Prhl(RL)-rbs-gfp (pSB3K3). And we found that"

Collaborations With 2011 Utah State iGEM Team
We have developed a collaborative relationship with the 2011 Utah State University Team. They have generously supplied us with promoter construct for transgene expression in Synechocystis. We have had back and forth communications throughout the summer. Since Dr. Shintani has had past experience transforming Synechocystis, he was able to offer assistance to Dr. Miller of the Utah State Team on Synechocystis transformation protocols. See the e-mail correspondence below:

Dave:
I would be interested in info on another insertion vector.  As you are probably aware, while we have worked with E. coli and other bacteria previously, we have only  recently started trying to transform Synechocystis.  Do you have a standard protocol for transformation and selection of Synechocystis that works routinely?
Thanks,

Hi Charlie,
As a post-doc, I did some work with Synechocystis PCC6803. We were making KO mutants in targeted Vitamin E biosynthetic genes (Shintani and Dellapenna (1998) Science282: 2098-2100). As I remember it was not too difficult, but that’s looking back on it with PI-eyes. We used the protocol described in Williams JGK (1988) Methods in Enzymology 167: 766-778. While this worked well with the insertion of a single antibiotic resistance cassette, it may prove more difficult with a larger construct. We need to generate a KO in the ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase gene so we are going to insert one of our constructs"

The first aim of our modeling is to estimate AHL production rate κm in marine cells. The synthesis of AHLs by marine bacteria involves the transcription of certain genes when the secondary structure of RNA thermometers was melted and then output Lux I promotes AHL production by catalyzing the reaction of the two AHL precursor molecules, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and hexanoyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein).
The reaction can be summarized as,
Where S, C6, A and M are SAM, hexanoyl-ACP, 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) and the waste product, respectively.
In marine construct, output of Lux I occurs at a constant rate L0 as indicated in Figure 1 and decays at a rate of λL. Noted that λL was not the natural decay rate, the degradation of LuxI was accelerated by introducing LVA tail in marine cells.

The cloud-like icon stands for two substrates that produces the AHL, the wavy lines represent transcription of the protein and the “*” represent degradation.

ITESM_Mexico,2011,Team:ITESM Mexico#Assembly_-_-_TEXT.html," (PcyA) from synechocystis Second of two required phycocyanobilin biosynthetic genes. Usage and Biology: Converts biliverdin IXalpha (BV)(produced by Part:BBa_I15008) to phycocyanobilin (PCB), the immediate precursor of cyanobacterial phytochromes. Associates with Part:BBa_I15010 to transduce a light signal into a genetic response. Kanamycin resistant.
BBa_K225000: Green light receptor. Fusion protein of light responsive domains of CcaS from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and histidine kinase EnvZ. For the use as a green light activated actuator in E. coli. Usage and Biology: GlrN is the fusion protein of light responsive domains of CcaS and EnvZ designed by changing the histidine kinase region of CcaS to EnvZ domain of cph8 (BBa_I15010).
Requires phycocyanobilin biosynthetic genes (BBa_I15008 and BBa_I15009) for chromophore formation.
Must be used in E. coli deficient in natural EnvZ.
Expecting function (without experimental proof): Exposure to green light (535 nm) phosphorylate EnvZ histidin kinase domain. The activated EnvZ phosphorylates endogenous OmpR, a transcription factor which activates transcription from the OmpR positive promoter (BBa_R0083). Ampicillin resistant.
BBa_B0015: Double terminator consisting of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012. Ampicillin  and Kanamycin resistant.
BBa_R0083: Promoter (OmpR, positive) Positively regulated, OmpR-controlled promoter. This promoter is derived from the upstream region of ompC. Phosphorylated OmpR binds to the operator site and activates transcription. This is a truncated version of BBa_R0082. Usage and Biology: This promoter contains upstream regions of the ompC porin gene. The regulation of ompC is determined by the EnvZ-OmpR osmosensing machinery. EnvZ phosphorylates OmpR to OmpR-P. At high osmolarity, EnvZ is more active, creating more OmpR-P. OmpR-P then binds to the low-affinity OmpR operator sites upstream of ompC. Activation of ompC has been experimentally shown to occur with just the C1 OmpR binding region, provided that the C1 region is placed next to the"

Lethbridge Weekend Day 1
Went to a workshop about how to present . Received good advice. When not presenting ( but are part of the presentation ) look at the person who is currently presenting and stand at the side away from the presenter. If power point presentations are used stand to the left of the screen ( because English is read from left to right ) . Preparation is very important. If something in your presentation goes wrong , don't fret over it . Move on to the next topic . It is how you recover from the situation that is more important than the mistake that happened during the  presentation . Connect with you audience. If the audience is already present and your are setting up your presentation during that time , kindly inform your audience of your situation (if appropriate make irrelevant small talk ) .

Lethbridge Workshop Day 1
This morning we arrived in Lethbridge at about noon (after an exciting photo opportunity in Vulcan!).  After lunch, the workshop started with a presentation skills workshop.  We learned a lot of tips such as how to prepare yourself, how to deal with nerves, how to orient yourself to the screen and the audience, etc.  We split up into our teams and created a mini introduction to our project"

Figure6: The catabolic pathway for degradation of phenol and the organization of Dmp operon. (Powlowski J, Shingler V., 1994)
The transcription of this operon is regulated by the DmpR regulator element which binds phenol and activates the transcription of the phenol hydroxylase enzyme by allowing the fixation of the RNA polymerase (more information, see the section Sensors ).
For PCBs, two distinct classes of bacteria have now been identified as being able to degrade PCBs:
Aerobic bacteria which live in oxygenated environments
Anaerobic bacteria which live in oxygen free environments such as aquatic sediments.
They use different mechanisms, aerobes attack PCBs oxidatively, breaking open the carbon ring and destroying the compounds. Anaerobes, on the other hand, leave the biphenyl rings intact while removing the chlorines.
The evidence in the literature suggests that PCDD/F compounds are subject to biodegradation in the environment as part of the natural chlorine cycle.
Figure7: The catabolic pathway for degradation of biphenyl by aerobic bacteria and the organization of the bph gene cluster (Kensuke F., Hidehiko F., 2008) .
The transcription of this set of genes is regulated by bphR2 which binds PCBs and activates the transcription of pbhR1 gene (more information, see the section Sensors ).
For nitrites, the degradation pathways are very well known because they belong to the nitrite cycle. As for heavy metals, a lot of operons which allows the cell tolerance to these compounds exist and have promoters reacting specifically to the metal concentration.
However for this project, we chose to develop systems based on promoters presents in our bacteria strain Pseudovibrio denitrificans.
In this way, we used an RNA sequencing approach to detect promoters able to react to the pollutant presence (more information, see the section RNAseq ).
Our bacteria strain is known to live in sponge and may provide them a better tolerance to pollutants like heavy metals. The ability of the bacteria is currently study by the 'Molecules of defence and communication in the microbial ecosystems' team of the National museum of natural history of Paris (their web page here )
Futur : degradation?
Sensing constructions are very simple and easy to construct. In a larger framework we can imagine one day being able to clone all the enzymes of the degradation pathways of phenol and PCBs in our bacteria. In fact we can create more than a sensor system based on sponge: a complete filtrating system which can"

Overview
To better our project, we have done four bravo jobs as our human practice.
First, we shared the beauty of synthetic biology, a topic which we presented and promoted in front of our schoolmates and also to those in Taipei American School. Enthusiastically sharing our ideas, we met up with some of the iGEM teams in Taiwan and China, taking part in the conference and sharing knowledge.
Second, we cooperated with other team to combine different technique that would improve our project. We help NTU-Taida characterized their BioBrick devices.
Third, we determined to build up an easier way in doing experiments for those who are not that familiar with the basic experimental techniques. We have made some videos of doing experiments. They are the way we teach students how to conduct wet lab experiments.
Fourth, we tried to make our project a practical application to the environment. We had lots of interviews with experts concerned and beekeepers. More importantly, we have gone to bee farms and help the beekeepers to check if their bees were infected by Nosema ceranea. We also created primers to identified Nosema ceranea. This provides a fast and precise way to find out Nosema ceranea besides barely using microscope.
Our wish is to change the world in a tender way and make others soaked in the overwhelming astonishment of biological wonder.

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," and computer science. The activity called, ‘Design Your Own Pathway’ gave a series of scenarios we had given students with a library of BioBricks to create a certain pathway. Progressively each scenario was harder, more complicated and required the use of multiple BioBricks. The BioBricks that we had used were from the library and were real parts. Essentially this was to enable students to have a feel of how we have a ‘mix and match’ concept when it comes to synthetic biology. The activity had been set up as a relay race, where students in the same teams as the previous activity had to race each other to finish all scenarios. The activity and concept had been such a success that after the workshop teachers had asked to use our activity in their own classrooms.
Finally, we completed the presentation with a discussion of career paths that students could pursue that did not necessarily involve working in a lab. We wanted students to understand that the world of synthetic biology and biotechnology encompasses the involvement of individuals from multiple backgrounds and can penetrate into many different industries.
There was such an interest in our workshop that our prospects for the next one are aimed at more than 150 students. One thing’s for sure, mission accomplished and there’s definitely more to come!  Would you also like to have your own workshop at your high school or university?

Engineering Science Quest: July-August 2011
Founded in 1990, the Engineering Science Quest or ESQ is a not-for-profit program that operates with the goal of exposing children in the Kitchener-Waterloo region to the world of engineering, science and technology through engaging them in a variety of hands-on activities. Promotion is primarily done through workshops in-school but also have satellite programs which reach out to rural and Native communities as well.
This is not the first time that UW iGEM has been involved in ESQ and we are proud to say that our continued involvement has allowed us to develop a standard set of activities which we are pleased to present to kids ranging from Grades 3-6 with more than 100 students. Currently we are also developing ideas for older kids that are similar to our activities from the Outreach workshop we had in March for Grades 10-12 and for even younger kids from Grades 1-2. Through involvement with managers specifically for ESQ this year we were able to have continual workshops every week from July 11th- August 12th, 2011. This was done with the recruitment of volunteers"

Physics with Professor Lewin
On Friday, June 29, we joined the iGEM teams from MIT and Wellesley on the MIT campus and attended a lecture given by Professor Walter Lewin , who is a world renowned physics professor (emeritus) from MIT. A few lucky students from the iGEM teams were then interviewed after the lecture.
Following lunch with our fellow iGEM students, we toured the MIT iGEM lab. Unfortunately, not everyone was dressed appropriately for the full lab tour. Those with shorts or sandals had to sit out by the kitchen area while the others continued on the tour. Safety first!

On the fifth experiment, the clean and concentrate worked but still not very well. We tried one more time using only 10 uL water to elute and got sufficient concentrations for our Gibson reactions.
We tried many PCR reactions with the new templates but still saw multiple bands for each gene, so we decided to extract the correct bands from the gels and use those as our templates. We tried using larger reaction volumes in the gels to get more DNA from the gel extraction, but we didn’t get clear enough bands to properly extract the correct sized genes. We also tried amplifying the loxP-URA3-lox71 gene cassette with our existing primers, but the reaction didn’t work due to the difference in annealing temperatures between the forward and the reverse primer.
This was the week in which we discovered our collective error in the PCR protocol we had used up until this point. This was a lesson to us and the rest of the team about blindly following protocols without questioning them. Upon redoing our PCR experiment with the corrected protocol in a 10uL reaction, our gel showed bands indicating a successful linearization. We also went through the protocol for the creation of chemicompetent yeast cells in anticipation for our transformation into Y. lipolytica. Protocol was successful and yielded 2.5 mL of glycerol stock of our chemicompetent Y. lipolytica.
The glycerol stocks of E. coli were successfully streaked to verify viability. Contacted lab support for pH meter electrode issues.

This week, we began to think about our thesis again. Whew. A few of us began reorganizing the information we needed to write about to make the paper more clear. We also had a meeting at the end of the week about expectations for writing during the coming week.
After finding out about the IRB, we applied for exemption. We then found out that we would have to revise our questionnaires. Appropriate changes were made and the application was submitted again (this happens several more times in the next week or so).
Some of us considered different design and selectable marker options to test integration of genes into the yeast genome. We learned that one of our steps lacks a reliable selectable marker test, but that replica plating may provide sufficient levels of certainty.

WITS-CSIR_SA,2011,Team:WITS-CSIR SA#Project#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," as a function of the initial chemical concentration was determined.  A number of runs of the simulation tool under the same initial chemical concentration were performed.  The simulator output the number of toggled bacteria sampled every 2 seconds.  These data were then averaged to obtain a statistical mean of the particular experiment.  This process was repeated over a range of concentration values, and plotted as below:
As may be seen from the above figure, the initial chemical concentration does indeed have an effect on the rate at which bacteria successfully navigate to the attractant.  The chosen arbitrary reference concentration sees an almost 10 fold increase of the number of bacteria in the toggled state over the chosen 2 minutes of simulation time.  Even at half of the reference concentration, a six fold increase over pure random motion was obtained.  Concentration increases above 10 times the reference concentration had increasingly minimal impact on the chemotaxis of the bacteria.  This is due to the overall underlying stochastic nature of the movement and physical distance between where the bacteria are initially located and the chemoattractant.
Collaboration
The modelling software was discussed with the Imperial College team.  Specifically, the use of a non steady-state model was discussed and ultimately decided upon due to the team's implementation of the environment.  A non steady-state model is used since the chemoattractant is not replenished with time, and so will diffuse uniformly over the entire environment.
Shortcomings
The two-state model used to simulate the bacterial motion neglects the half-life and phosphorylation times of the signalling pathways.  The three-state model of [2] could be used to provide a more accurate model.  However, it is assumed that these times are negligible when compared to the time of flight of the bacteria.  Larger chemical networks consisting of three or four attractants (or the inclusion of repellents) are also not catered for.  As of yet, the variables in the simulator are also unitless.  More detailed investigation into the underlying model is needed to fully characterise them.

Energy and Electrons are Required for Carbon Fixation
For the Calvin cycle to proceed, energy in the form of ATP and electrons carried by NADPH are required. In photosynthesising organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these constituents are provided by photophosphorylation performed by the photosystem complex. When engineering E. coli to perform photophosphorylation, 13 genes for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll a and 17 genes for the biosynthesis of photosystem II need to be heterogeneously expressed. Several attempts have been made at expressing part of it, such as the psbA gene Efimov VA, Reverdatto SV, Beilinson BA, Fradkov AF, Chakhmakhcheva OG.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html,"encing result 336 of the sfGFP(Sp)     construct in pDR111+message (primer used: F-message     sequence).
Experiments
Experiment:
The functionality of these constructs was checked by integration    into the B. subtilis genome 168 trp+ and imaging under the microscope.
Integration into the genome of B. subtilis 168 trp+:
sfGFP(Sp) in pDR111 and pDR111+message was integrated into the B.    subtilis 168 trp+ genome. pDR111 is an integration plasmid which can be    integrated into the B. subtilis genome. By double cross-over it    replaces amyE gene, with desired insert, in this case insert is    Ppta-sfGFP(Sp)-3TER, which is located between amyE front    flanking region and amyE back flanking region.
Experiment set-up:
10 μl of sfGFP(Sp) in pDR111 and pDR111+message plasmids were    transformed into the B. subtilis 168 trp+ strain (see transformation protocol ). Selection was made on 150 μg/ml    spectinomycin LB agar plates.
Microscopy experiment set-up:
B. subtilis cells were grown overnight in 3 ml LB with 150 μg/ml    spectinomycin at 37°C and 220 rpm. On the next day microscopy slide was    prepared as explained in the following protocol . Cells    were imaged using phase contrast: filter POL 50% 1 s exposure, green    fuorescence: FITC, 0.8 s exposure, objective: Olympus 100X/1.40,    camera: CoolSNAP_HQ/HQ2-ICX285 and software: Resolve3D softWoRx-Acquire    version.
Figure 10. B. subtilis 168 trp+ cells with sfGFP     integrated into the amyE locus.
Conclusion:
Integration into the B. subtilis 168 trp+ strain of the plasmids    with the reporter sfGFP(Sp) was successful. Multiple colonies were    obtained on selection plates. B. subtilis cells were subsequently grown    and checked under the microscope to see if there is an expression of    GFP (see Figure 10). We could definitely see the GFP signal when    observing the cells under the microscope. This was big enough proof    that our plasmid construction followed by integration into the B.    subtilis genome was successful.

3. Besides, we made a quick flashing video with JSNU-China iGEM team, which is also an interesting part of our human practice.
3.Human Practices: iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addresed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities.
The moment we started our project, we have been well aware of the significance of human practice as it serves as medium to spread wonderful ideas to the public and also a great access for us to see some practical problems that can only be solved by pragmatic approaches.
In terms of our laws and regulations which have a lot to do with ethical issues, we have improved our awareness of latent risks of science and technology and people will have more legal consciousness about this, especially for developers. We promoted our project in middle school, high school and our college, where we were quite enjoying the process of inspiring the participants, answering questions and introducing our BIO-COMPASS2.0. Through our questionnaire analysis, more information about the opinions of the general public were gleaned, which presented useful data for us. Besides, we also did and posted MOOC, arranged meetups, held activities on Science Day, made flashing videos and so forth. What’s more, during communicating with some navigational companies, valuable advice were given and they are all good for our future development, more efficient work, discovering potential market and making breakthroughs. What’s fantastic about the process is that they had shown great interest in our project and intended to seek cooperation in the future.

They were on their way to some villages in the district to examine the progress of BICOs Trust Project. The Trust Project contains the performance of TT Surgeries and Mass Drug Administrations. In our interview Mr. Chinyanya and Mr. Masika told us a lot about the implementation of the SAFE strategy in Malawi, possible reasons for chlamydial infections of the eye and problems in the fight against trachoma, including cultural as well as technical reasons like the absence of affordable diagnostic methods.
Daniel C.:
[talking about our device]...In the middle is the negative control, it will slightly glow, even when you donˋt put anything there, only very little, but it is still somewhat measurable. Then you also have the positive control, where you put in the solution of only the molecule, so you can compare it. So you have no control, all control and in the third you can put the patient sample and its´  signal is somewhere in between and you can guess, does the person have trachoma, is this person infected?
David Chinyanya
When you say “trachoma”, do you mean the chlamydia or the stages?
Daniel C.:
I mean the Chlamydia infection, not the final stage. Because, as you were saying, you started with the clinical signs, but they didnˋt work. So now you also do PCR based tests. But in Ethiopia they still do only clinical signs, I think.
David Chinyanya:
What we do now in Malawi is the whole SAFE strategy. That´s what we are dealing with. As I said, because when we just started dealing with the patients that are coming to the hospital, we knew, that there are others in the community that are not assisted. All the reposing factors they are still there, all the transmitting agencies are still there in the community. So with the support from other organisations we are trying to manage now to do the whole SAFE strategy.

How are you going along in Malawi?

We are doing very well, because the first mass drug administration we did started in 2011 up to 2013, then we went back to the districts where we were"

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-lys_-_-_TEXT.html," motif would then be conjugated to a corresponding glycine sequence on the spider silk by Sortase. The addition of the LT mimics that of the 3A assembly. However, here the LT is attached to the lysostaphin sequence by means of a BamHI restriction site. The lysostaphin does not have a BamHI, which was therefore added by performing an overhang PCR. The lysostaphin and the linker tag sequence are then ligated into the pSB1C3 backbone.
Overhang PCR of Lys Strategy 1: First attempt [✔️]
Strategy 1 was done by performing an overhang PCR using VF2 as a forward primer and Lys-Rev as the reverse primer. The Lys-Rev primer has been designed to remove stop codons present on the original BioBrick part as well as add a BamHI site on the downstream end of the lysostaphin sequence. The product size of the overhang PCR of pSB1C3-T7-Lys is 922 bp and this is illustrated from the figure below.
Figure 11. Overhang PCR of Lys (Strategy 1). (1) Ladder (2) Lys sample 1 (3) Lys sample 2.
Digestion of Overhang PCR Product: First Attempt [✔️]
The PCR product was then subjected to a double digestion with EcoRI and BamHI. The digested overhang lys is 795 bp in size. This is more than 100 bp shorter than the undigested fragment which has a size of 922 bp. Thus, the difference between the digested and undigested fragments is noticeable on the gel. (A more detailed description can be found in the lysostaphin Lab Book week 8).
Ligation and Transformation of pSB1C3-T7-Lys-LT: First Attempt [❌]
In order to perform the ligation, the linker-tags and the pSB1C3 were also subjected to double digestions with the correct restriction enzymes, as summarized below.
Overhang Lys - EcoRI and BamHI
Linker-Tags - BamHI and PstI
pSB1C3 - EcoRI and PstI
The ligation was done with a insert:vector molar ratio of 10:1. We obtained transformed colonies in our first attempt and these colonies were picked and confirmed with a colony PCR using VF2 and VR primers. The amplified fragment is 1147 bp in size and this is shown in Figure 11.

where z is the output of device pET28, i.e., the value of GFP. Again the positive term is the producing rate of GFP but the negative term is of decomposition rate.
Finally, we link these 2 device to finalize the model of AND gate. The plot of the simulation result shows that our model approximately fittings the experimental data.
In this work, we successfully construct a new approaching of modeling for synthetic biology by applying the idea of this field which is about modulization. The modulized modeling functions which are using as bio-brick provide a novel method to academic society that allows circuit consturctors predict their experimental data. Furthermore, it gives us chance to develop the virtual laboratory so that dramatically reduces the laborious work in lab.

I’m a third grade medical student, what i believe in life is just trying and not to  get down so we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have been planning to specialize at neurogenetics so that i could make my dream happen, i’m glad to be the part of this organization and willing to meet other iGEMers.

Hopeless Case
Hi! I am second year medical student. Participating in iGEM is one of the greatest personal experiences I’ve ever had. The time I’ve spent during the lab works and other activities was very instructive for me in every sense.  Apart from science, music is an important part of my life. I've been playing the violin for 11 years in different orchestras.  I would like to thank our whole team for the fairy-tale summer and the great time we had together. And of course special thanks to our advisors and instructors for all their patience:)

It was nice for our feet not to be turned backwards. :P My life philosophy is being happy, always happy and positive. It is meaningless to be upset and sad; especially still you can make huge fires in laboratory. Everything may change with only one contamination, so let’s put our fingers into the petri dishes!

He helped shape our Human Practices by pointing out areas that needed policy change,  resulting in the development of a biocontainment policy proposal and a more  comprehensive safety guideline for Charlottesville Open Bio Labs.
Jason Shwartz
Dr. Jason Schwartz is an Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Management at Yale University. His research focuses on the translation of data into regulation and policy in medicine and public health. His expertise was very useful to our team in shaping the way that we thought about the role of public discussion in informing policy. He expressed that extension of the conversation about synthetic biology into the broader community would reverberate, causing elected officials to discuss and implement policy related to synthetic biology and biocontainment. He also talked about the importance of including scientists in the discussion on regulation policy. Like Dr. Nick Evans, he expressed the concern that a false sense of security is worse than not implementing a security method at all and, as a result, decreasing implementation. Biocontainment, in his view, must be part of a comprehensive biosecurity standard. This viewpoint, in addition to Dr. Todd Kuiken, inspired the creation of Open Bio Labs Biosafety Guidelines , a all-purpose and all-inclusive biosafety guideline for a narrow population with specific needs.   His thoughts on this subject also informed the public outreach activities that we conducted, including the Building with Biology event and pamphlet .
His perspectives on the current policy also helped us in refining our policy proposal. Due to the lack of progress made on the recommendations, he suggested, like other interviewees, that a standing body in government on synthetic biology should exist to continuously monitor and regulate the field. He also expressed that the government should be sensitive to the balance of risks and benefits in the regulation of the field. Dr. Schwartz’s insights helped inspire several deliverables, while confirming the need for better biocontainment."

Checked out galaxy , from SSB which contains: Prodigal, Assembly tools of all kinds, and gene annotation tools, now to check out the data!
Worked on genemark, produced files with two '>' fasta markers in the header. Regular expressions to the rescue!
Figured out the  SAPP pipeline pretty much, got genemark to work, making a  clustalo of 6 cry proteins as a test for the pipeline.
May
Week 7 (2nd)
Started to build the actual pipeline script in python! Got all cry files in the data directory using my script, though some didn’t get downloaded or weren’t available.
Implementing IDBA_UD, which does not work on reads that are too long.
Building ARFF files is a thing I should be able to do -> https://weka.wikispaces.com/Primer
So it turns out Cry1Ib5 and Cry1Fa3 are duplicates, there may be more in there! I had aligned all with group_cry.sh and put one of those allignments in a webbrowser based hmmsearch, which complained of a duplicate entry.
Week 8 (9th)
Renamed prot.py to known_protein_pipeline_v1.py going to translate all cry[0-9]+\_group.fasta files to .faa files and move them. Renamed thesis_pipeline_v1.py to sequence_data_pipeline_v1.py on the server. Working with  Pycharm is quite an improvement. Also made a flowchart of data-structure,
And experimented with Machine Learning in R, after finishing up the pipelines up to HMMs
Found the peptides package for R which can calculate all kinds of statistics about protein sequences, also made a table of features that is used by FFpred.

BBa_K1361000
Based on the concept that change of cell  motility by control of CheZ chemotaxis regulator could disturb pre-expressed  curli fiber structure, we assume that if the inducer occurs, in this case  acacia, CsgB protein will secrete into extracellular and act as nucleator to  recruit soluble CsgA monomer into amyloid fibres, and the transcription of CheZ  will be downgrade via cI-Plamda NOT gate. If induction condition disappears at  a certain point, suppression of CheZ will be discharged. As a result, cells  will be more moveable thus disturb or inhibit the establishment of curli  structure. And in our final device, the dynamic detection could achieve by  monitoring current change between two electrodes in the culture.
BBa_K1361001
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA and its nucleator CsgB, in which CsgA is constitutive  expression(a relatively weak promoter compared to BBa_K1361003) whereas CsgB is  under the control of T7 promotor. This part cannot functioning alone without  expression of CsgEFG genes in the same cell, for they coding the outer membrane  channel secrete system for CsgA and CsgB.
BBa_K1361002
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA and its nucleator CsgBtrunc, in which CsgA is constitutive  expression whereas CsgBtrunc is under the control of Pbad promotor. CsgBtrunc  is different from native CsgB for the deletion of C-terminal amino acid from  133 to 155 so that it cannot attach cell outer membrane. And CsgBtrunc itself  is highly aggregative in the culture. This part is designed for immediate  generation of large amount of curli fiber after adding the inducer.

Conclusion:
The transformation of qrnS1 (ciprofloxacin resistance cassette) in BBa_K823023 to E. coli Top10 was successful.
Validation
Experiment:
To test if the construct would make B. subtilis resistant to    ciprofloxacin, the construct qrnS1 in BBa_K823023 was transformed into the B.    subtilis 168 tpr+.
Experiments
Experiment:
13/10/16: The transformation to B. subtilis was performed according to the following protocol . Colonies were selected on LB agar    with 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol.
Figure 5. B. subtilis after transformation with     ciprofloxacin resistance cassette.
14/10/16: Colonies were streaked out on agar with starch to perform the    starch test, which verifies the integration in the amyE locus in the    genome of B. subtilis. Integration check: Starch test
Figure 6. Starch test. Colonies without a clear halo     are positive for integration.
Conclusion:
The integration of the ciprofloxacin resistance cassette was    successful.
As a first check on the functionality of the ciprofloxacin    resistance cassette, we grew B. subtilis colonies from the starch test    with ciprofloxacin. As a control they were also grown with    chloramphenicol, the resistance on the backbone of the integration    vector. Figure 7 shows the result for 3 different colonies (tubes    indicated with 1 - 3). The tubes marked with Cm is the control with    chloramphenicol, which shows growth for all three colonies. The tubes    marked with Cipro were grown with ciprofloxacin. Colonies 2 and 3 showed    growth, whereas colony 1 did not grow. Seems like the resistance    cassette is working. To further explore if the ciprofloxacin cassette    is functional in B. subtilis, a MIC value test was performed. See link .

Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place. We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ . The final result is the channel capacity."

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," the Evry Paris-Saclay Psicose Biosensor as the Detector Unit
Part BBa_K2205023 detailed above was designed using Benchling and ordered for synthesis through IDT. Using Benchling, virtual digestions and ligations were simulated resulting in the plasmid map detailed below.
Figure 4: BBa_K2205023 in PSB1C3
Implementation
The Psicose detector construct obtained by gBlock synthesis has been designed to include required overhangs for Gibson assembly into the linearized plasmid pSB1C3. The plasmid backbone was acquired by digestion of the part BBa_K2205015 with XbaI and SpeI, cutting out the original sfGFP construct. The Psicose detector construct was assembled into the plasmid backbone using the NEB Hi-Fi kit and transformed into DH5α E. coli cells . miniprepping . DNA samples were then sent off for sequencing to ensure that the constructs were correct. Sequencing data can be found on the Parts page .
Characterisation
A preliminary qualitative assay was carried out as an initial test for this construct. Co-cultures of Psicose detector, processor unit and sfGFP reporter ( BBa_K2205015 ) were inoculated and grown overnight in LB+chloramphenicol (12.5 ng/ul). The day after the cultures were diluted at OD600 0.1 and mixed together to obtain co-cultures with ratio 1:1:13 (detector:processor:reporter). The samples were supplemented with 33.22 mM Psicose to induce the expression of quorum sensing molecules and eventually achieve the reporter visualisation (Figures 8).

Conclusions and Future Work
The results demonstrate that further characterisation needs to be conducted in order to optimise the psicose detector variant in the Sensynova platform however, due to time constraints resulted from synthesis delays, we lacked the time to be able to do so. The preliminary experiments conducted for the framework customised as the psicose biosensor were conducted by following data resulted from the model of the framework customised as the IPTG sensor. In order for future characterisation of this part, the model should be modified in order to guide in vivo efforts"

Characterization
An Introduction to Characterization
Much of the synthetic biology community builds novel genetic constructs from novel DNA parts. The qualitative function of many commonly used parts is well known, but the quantitative behavior of most parts is not well documented. There have been recent pushes in the community to develop a standard for quantitative characterization of DNA parts, but there still exists no standard for doing so.
The part characterization problem is multi-dimensional - for one, it is rarely possible to have a single DNA part carry out an observable function without the assistance of other parts.  Additionally, it is not widely agreed how to acquire measurements and what conditions are best for characterizing function. There is a need to develop such a methodological standard so that DNA part information can be understood and applied by multiple groups.
Canton et. al 2008                          Ellis et. al 2009                                                               Beal et. al 2012
Recent work has been done to accomplish this goal. Some groups have worked towards setting a standard for measuring and sharing part characterization data (Canton et. al 2008) and others have used characterization data for model-guided design (Ellis et. al 2009). Other have explored the ability to get complete transfer curves for chemical induction of various promoters (Beal et. al 2012). However, characterization data is often collected and analyzed in different ways making it difficult to compare and re-use.
Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry is a technology for recording single-cell measurements of fluorescence. These measurements are taken by passing cells one-at-a-time through the path of a laser and recording the refracted light with a number of band-pass filters. This allows quantitative measurement of multiple fluorophores simultaneously at a single-cell resolution.
A more detailed description of the technology can"
Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Forensic Toolkit#FluID_-_-_TEXT.html," alteration of the protein structure of the two parts making them incompatible with each other. It is important to point out however that of the β-galactosidase assays that were done all of them have had controls that have failed to function, so it is impossible at this stage to definitively tell that the two separated parts of OBP2A aren’t interacting in vivo.
Figure 1 - Above, illustrates the calculated miller’s activity of each control/sample and suggest that the OBP2A subunits aren’t interacting. As can be gauged from the sample on the far right of the graph. This suggests that OBP2A has a lower interaction than the negative and regulatory controls.
Conclusion and Future Work
The next stage of experimentation we aim to do is to have repeated the beta-galactosidase assay, using more and better  controls to eliminate the current issues that the assay are  having with failed controls. Along with this we also aim to clone the two parts of OBP2A into the BTH vectors but in the opposite vectors to see if that has any effect on the interaction of the two parts of OBP2A. If this had shown considerable change in the level of interaction between the two parts of OBP2A then we would have to reconsider the use of bacterial two hybrid as the method for determining protein interaction.

Our RENBO Biobrick Experiments
BBa_K672000
Objectives:
1. Test the BioBrick operation to different substrates and temperatures, using KNO3  40 mM: a. Substrates:
LB
Minimal essential medium
Saline solution
Lunar land
b. Temperatures:
8°C
23°C
37°C
2. Characterize the expression of the promoters and determine the device operation.
3. Define the more efficient temperature and substrate for the operation of this device to survive at low temperatures and be able to measure nitrate.
Methodology:
We chose 4 temperatures:
• 5-10°C
• 10-20°C
• 20-30°C
• 37°C
These temperatures were selected so we could evaluate the response to cold shock in various ranges of our BioBrick. Since the lab equipments we had available couldn’t reach temperatures between 11-20°C this temperature was not used during the experience. Finally, the lab equipment allowed us to make the experiments in: 37°C, 23°C and 8°C.
We also chose 3 different Growth Media:
• Saline Solution
• Liquid LB
• Minimal Media
These growth medias where selected to evaluate the response of our BioBricks in different metabolic pathways.  According to the characterization made by Team Edinburgh 2009, the Pyear promoter (BBa_K216005) used by Bristol 2010, works best in minimal media and complex media with a nitrate concentration of 40mM. Using this reference, we added 40mM of KNO3 to every growth media in the different temperatures for Bristol 2010 - BBa_K381001 and UTP-Panama 2011 – BBa_K672000.
We prepared 9 15mL Falcon Tubes, these tubes contained:
• First 3 (one for each temperature): 10mL of Saline Solution + a colony of the BioBrick + 40mM of KNO3.
• Second 3 (one for each temperature): 10mL of Minimal"

Yale,2018,Team:Yale#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". Instead, they were planning on expressing the two key enzymes (fucO and aldA) from a high-copy plasmid. By increasing the copy number of these key enzymes, the E. coli would be overexpressing the starting genes of the EG metabolism pathway and increasing the flux through the pathway.
Afterwards, we then talked about the different types of modelling we had done. Using Flux Balance Analysis, we had modelled E. coli metabolism under restricted growth conditions with only EG (or EG metabolites) as sole carbon sources. This allowed us to identify key genes that would need to be up-regulate and down-regulated for optimal flux through the pathway.
On the other hand, the RHIT team had used more of a kinetic model to predict how feasible it was for the E. coli to grow off EG as a sole carbon source and estimated doubling times under those growth conditions. Although we initially had trouble understanding their model, we eventually were able to grasp the way they had set their model up to be as predictive as possible. We also found it incredibly encouraging that their model predicted a fairly reasonable doubling time for E. coli growing off of EG, which meant that using a synthetic biology approach to solving the problem of PET waste was feasible.
Lastly, we talked about obstacles that we had each been facing and potential ways we could help each other overcome the obstacles. One of our main obstacles was the procurement of suitable PET samples to use in our downstream enzymatic activity assays. Initially, our last resort was to use PET pellets or water bottles. Luckily, the RHIT team had managed to contact multiple plastic manufacturers in their region and had collected quite a large variety of PET samples to use, ranging from powdered PET, to high/low-crystallinity PET, to PET films, etc…They generously offered to let us use some of their samples in case we ever needed them as we progressed with our project.
One of the main obstacles that the RHIT team was facing was challenges with secretion and challenges with cloning. With regards to secretion, they were initially trying to use a pelB secretion tag but were unable to achieve efficient secretion of PETase and MHETase. Since we had actually spent quite a lot of time testing various secretion systems as part of our Objective #1, we advised for them to try the yebF secretion tag, which worked extremely well for us and was relatively simple to use since the secretion system is native to E. coli. With regards to cloning, the RHIT team seemed to be having trouble getting their plasmids to transfect successfully into competent cells. We completely understood their frustration and"

Patients
The end-users, the patients, should have the most comfortable and easy experience using our patch for their wounds. Since it is a gel-like structure, treatment will be painless and continuous, reducing stress and effort to get the treatment. Placement of the patch can take place at home and replacement should be done less often compared to band aid. This not only reduces stress, inconvenience and pain as we learned from the Maasstad burn wound center , but fewer actions will also reduce costs. As developers of the patch it is also our task to make it chemically safe. The chemicals secreted by the bacteria in the patch are harmless to humans and have no known side-effects, but the chemicals used to produce the gel are very toxic on their own. To reduce the risk of these compounds, our gel is washed several times after synthesizing to remove those chemicals. However the possibility is also there to replace them with less toxic chemicals. Overall, patient safety seems to be guaranteed. The issues of patient safety and chemical toxicity are discussed under safe-by-design .
Scientists/iGEM
We, the scientists working on the wound healing patch, have the main responsibility to make the product as safe as possible for every stakeholder. The safety aspect for us or other scientists working on this patch is again safely handling the chemicals used. This means taking the necessary safety precautions like wearing gloves or work in a fumehood etc. Decreasing toxicity of the chemicals by replacing them with less dangerous compounds will also greatly help with safely working on this patch.
Physicians
Physicians have the general responsibility to get people the best treatment possible. Our wound healing patch helps physicians provide the best treatment, since it our patch is specific for long lasting, infected wounds. The specificity of the bacteria that are killed by the patch has the advantage of reducing chances of developing resistances among a lot of other bacteria on the skin. Resistant bacteria are already a problem in infected wounds, as emphasized to us by the medical doctors we interacted with. Another advantage of the patch for physicians is the fact that it can be freeze-dried and thus stored effectively for a long time and is ready off-the-shelf. This makes prescriptions and"

Furthermore, some other advice also benefited us greatly. Dr. Hua Zhao told us that the clinical blood uric acid concentration lowering methods were very limited. At present, there are only three kinds of drugs allowed to be listed in China: allopurinol, benzyl bromide, and Malone. Therefore, it is very valuable to have other treatment methods, which can make the means of clinical uric acid lowering therapy more diverse. Dr. Yi Zhao advised us to pay attention to the coordination between the scientific significance and feasibility of the project, and suggested that we should focus on our intestinal part. In addition, as for the part of our animal experiments, he reminded us that the animal model of gout was different from that of hyperuricemia, and we must clearly consider to choose the correct model, besides the positive control group should be set up in animal experiments. We will integrate Dr. Zhao’s advice into the part of animal experiments, making the design more scientific and reasonable.
The interviews with the six doctors made us learn a lot. They let us realize that our subject was really meet the clinical needs, rather than indulged in empty talk, which brought the rich clinical background to the subject. We also got a lot of improvements on our project, we humbly absorbed and integrated them into the subject. Thank a lot to the doctors!

Integrated HP with Patients
Questionnaire for Patients with Hyperuricemia
As a therapeutic project, we believe that the patient's situation and their opinions on us are very important. Because our project ultimately serves the patients. Their needs are met and their pain is relieved even eliminated, which is the gold standard to evaluate our project. Therefore, we designed a questionnaire for patients with hyperuricemia, to investigate the patient's true situation and their views on the treatment of hyperuricemia.
This questionnaire included three parts, which were “basic information”, “basic living and treatment condition” and “views and opinions on new drugs or therapies”. “Basic information” included participants' age, sex, and blood uric acid concentration; “The basic living and treatment condition” included the degree of understanding for the harm of hyperuricemia, the degree of paying attention to hyperuricemia in daily life, whether on a diet, the feelings after the diet, reasons for the diet, whether use of drugs to control blood uric acid concentration,"

This is the picture taken after the second discussion.
Since all of our team members didn’t have experience in that area. We had to consult with someone familiar with this process.
In China, algae bloom is a common problem appears in lake and river. Part of the improving method is to salve the algae and concentrate its biomass for further usage. This involves cell-water separation.
Thus, we contact an expert in that area, Prof. Shengbin He from the School of Environmental Science & Engineering in our university. In our conversation, he motioned several ways of separation including sedimentation, flotation, centrifuging and membrane filtration. However,only sedimentation and flotation might satisfy our goal.We took the idea back home and did some further studies on those two method, especially.
Dissolved air flotation
Dissolved air flotation is one of the flotation methods that is frequently use in algae removal for the water supply. Based on our research, this is a developed system that has already applied in the Dian Lake and Lake Taihu in China with the maximum scale of 10000 m^3/d (Mingming et al, 2011).Related patents have been applied, such as 200810058076.4 (Chinese potent) and the removal percentage is up to 95% (Mingming et al, 2011).  Air dissolved flotation make the use of the selective adsorption of impurities at the gas/liquid or gas/solid interfaces of rising bubbles. The adsorbed impurities, which can be in soluble or insoluble form, are carried to the top of the bubble separation reactor, where they can be removed from the aqueous system (Wang et al,2005).
This is an efficient and relatively cheap methods that fits our goal. However"

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html," that we will hopefully process all in parallel. - Different assembly methods? - Rao: forget fancy PCR things, including Gibson assembly. o Need a simple control to test the PUF. GFP is a 2 week control experiment to test PUF levels. o The modular Lac I/Z system is worth pursuing, but it should be done in parallel with the GFP experiment. - The terminators are small, they are going to be hard to cut out of a gel. How will we tackle small segment assembly? o 3A assembly is made so that we don’t have to do gel purification. Therefore we will be fine on the promoters, RBS, and terminators. The hard part is the PUF sites o A possibility is to biobrick PUF by itself so that we can simply order primers and such for it. o Other option: ignore the existing biobrick BBa_Q04121 and simply put the RBS and PUF binding site on the forward primer for the reporter so it’s all together to begin with. The reverse primer would have both the terminators.  Constraint – RBS must be no more than 10 base pairs away from the start ATG. The PUF binding site will be better suited to before the RBS  Also, we can expand the biobrick with the addition of each primer, by adding aroud 40 bp everytime Biobricks - PUF is too small to add on its own. Would need to put PUF with the RBS or something. - Ideal biobrick: RBS, PUF, and Lac I reporter all together - It’s too small to biobrick the PUF binding site o Really makes a problem with creating a PUF toolkit Final Plan - PUF binding site with Lac Z - Mutated PUF binding site with Lac Z - PUF binding site with Lac I - Mutated PUF binding site with Lac I - PUF binding site with YFP - Mutated PUF binding site with YFP - PUF+PIN - Mutated PUF + PIN - The RBS and PUF binding sites will be in the promoter for the varying gene. That simplifies putting that tiny sequence into E. Coli Remaining questions - How extensively should things be characterized? o Worry about it when we get there. - Should we link PUF to another protein domain on top of the endonuclease? o Don’t worry about it, we need to basics first. o We have 3 strains of PUF: Wild type PUF (just PUF), PUF with endonuc"

It will seek to include members from a cross-disciplinary background in order to broaden the scope and reach of the projects being developed. It will foster the creation of biotech start-ups and research groups from undergrad students. With the implementation of DETECT (‘Detección de Estudiantes con Talento’ - Detection of Talented Students) as a social community program, SyBRE will spread the knowledge of synthetic biology (starting from basic biology and chemistry) through gifted children in local schools.
Regarding iGEM, SyBRE’s founding will allow to plan ahead and coordinate future participations so that preparations are done in time and lab work can begin as soon as the January-May semester ends (or sooner if possible). Sponsorship seeking and overall funding will be better handled as an official student group since it has more legal venues to procure resources both inside and outside the Campus. SyBRE will also allow the development of long-term relationships with sponsors by keeping the same ‘face’ through the years, irrespective of the current team composition.
The final goal of SyBRE is to procure a physical place where its members can nurture academic and business projects related to synthetic biology without having to depend entirely on other departments and to review the policies and controls of the grant of access to laboratories and the use of equipment. Several issues arose during the past months and most of them could have been prevented or better handled.
Another challenge to tackle is to change the cultural biases that prevent the full utilization of the laboratories due to territorial feuds, bureaucracy, whimsical baroque formalities, the ‘nobility’ of the PhD (a grave issue in high context, high power distance, patriarchal societies like ours), etc. We know that modifying hard-wired behavior is difficult, but it must be at least tried. Science and initiative should not be hampered by self-defeating practices.
Thankfully, there's always people (administrators and faculty) which go out of their way to try to help motivated students achieve their dreams. They work against the statu quo to mobilize resources and find spaces to provide undergraduates with the necessary tools for the iGEM experience and research ventures. Some of these people are in our Attribution page and we are deeply grateful to them.
There are some excellent students in our Campus. With the right stimulus they can be moved to do great things. SyBRE is our way of helping them and ourselves bring those things to reality, knowing that the effort will last, that future generations will benefit from the advances made by the previous ones and, little by little, create something"

Sensing
The expression of human sweet taste receptor in yeast
In the sensing part, the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) T1R2 and T1R3 were heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae due to its ability to regulate a wide range of cellular processes such as the senses of taste and smell. Moreover, we constructed a mRFP-based assay to achieve proper detection of sweetness responses.
So we had to achieve two goals:
1. To express T1R2 and T1R3 in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
2. Construct a response signal circuit to confirm that our receptors can detect the sweeteners.
Results:
1. Synthesized the gene of human receptors T1R2 and T1R3
2. Expressed the heterologous GPCR in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
3. The engineered yeast with T1R2 and T1R3 can sense the sweeteners.
Details of the results:
1. The gene synthesis of T1R2 and T1R3
GPCR sequences are extracted from NCBI’s NR database. The sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3 (ID: 83756 and 80834) responds to diverse stimuli associated with the human sense of sweet taste, such as sucrose, d-tryptophan and aspartame. In reliable expression in Saccharomyces Cerevisiaei, we finished the codon optimization and reverse transcription of protein sequences into DNA sequences on the website http://54.235.254.95/gd/. The sequences of our receptors were established into the parts BBa_K2368003 and BBa_K2368004.
We synthesized the human receptor genes T1R2 and T1R3 using building block which based on overlapping-extension PCR. The PCR result was showed as Fig.9.
Fig. 9 The PCR result of synthetic genes T1R2 (2520 bp) and T1R3 (1989 bp).
We used the synthetic genes T1R2, T1R3 to construct the gene circuits for receptors expression. The galactose-induced promoter,  PGal1/PGal10was used to express the T1R2,T1R3. We cloned the circuits (BBa_236800"

Emission and excitation wavelength of mRFP are 607 and 584 nm respectively. Error bars show the standard error among three technical replicates.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed a toggle switch that could coordinate mites sensing, BeeT's toxin production and light sensing with responsiveness. Although we have not tested the whole toggle switch system, we supposed that this system could work as expected as we described above since our guanine and vitamin B12 riboswitches and hybrid promoters are both functional.

7.27 Bacteria Growth Curve After Dilution
I) Purpose
Determine the growth curve of bacteria after dilution. This information will be used to estimate the amount of bacterial growth during incubation in mutagenesis experiments.
II) Expected Outcome
A sigmoidal growth curve for each dilution.
The bigger the initial dilution factor, the longer it takes for bacteria to reach its growth plateau.
III) Reagants Used
E. Coli BL21 overnight from 5.26; LB stock; uracil solution (2.5mg/mL); adenine solution (5mg/mL)
IV) Actual Procedure
1. Bacteria preparation
3mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight was prepared on 7.26. Its OD600 was measured before any dilution (used 2mL).
Three test tubes were labeled 1:50, 1:100, and 1:500 respectively. These ratios indicate the intended dilution ratios for these test tubes. To each of these three test tubes, 10mL of LB was then added. Each was also supplemented with 40uL of adenine and 80uL of uracil to mimic incubation during mutagenesis
To the 1:50, 1:100, and 1:500 test tubes, 200uL, 100uL, and 20uL of BL21 liquid culture overnight was then added.
2. Measurements using spectrophotometer

Introduction
Discovery of GANs
Goals
Introducton
The computational content we present in these software sections are directly responsible for the motivation and creation of CAT-Seq!
Just as the iGEM year has started and our Team was formed, we readily acknowledged the main “big picture” problem we want to solve in synthetic biology - the difficulty of creating novel, synthetic parts. In particular we were interest in synthetic catalytic biomolecules.
Catalytic biomolecules are a cleaner and greener substitute to chemical catalyzers used all over the world. The catalytic biomolecules offer an enormous 17 orders of magnitude chemical reaction acceleration as well as excellent stereo-, chemo- and regio-selectivity in aqueous environments. Yet, one of the main drawbacks of using enzymes is that for many important chemical reactions, efficient enzymes have not yet been discovered or engineered.
That said, identifying enzyme amino acid sequence with the required novel or optimized reaction is a challenging task because the sequence space is incomprehensibly large.
The discovery of Generative Adversarial Networks
While exploring the possible ways of solving the previously described problem we have stumbled upon an article describing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). As we were not familiar with these relatively new neural networks at that time, we have studied the examples of what it has already achieved. The main idea of GANs is that it can learn the patterns of a given data input in order to generate examples as if they were from a given dataset. For example, if shown enough cat images, it will not start to generate an exact, specific cat image from the dataset, but it will learn how a cat should look in general. That results in a GAN that may produce cat images which do not have analogs in the dataset. A completely new cat!
We have also found articles that describe how GANs were used to generate novel anti-cancer drug molecules"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Ribosense#DesignProcess_-_-_TEXT.html," lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

iGEM Profile
Eleanor Amidei is a recent graduate of ALHS and is heading to UC Berkeley in the spring studying whatever undecided students study -- possibly molecular cell biology or maybe political science, but leaning towards public health. Most nights, after hours spent in the lab, you can find Eleanor in the weight room at ALHS working out and contemplating the myriad of reasons she decided to forgo sleep the night before (thanks, Netflix), only to give into the temptation again. While sometimes wishing she were already in school, iGEM has been an invaluable educational experience.
Sabrina Chu aka 'greatest driver on earth' is a recent graduate from Abraham Lincoln High School who is attending UC Davis as a freshman in the fall. She plans to major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. She also plans on minoring in accounting and is very excited to finally attend college. She gained much of her wetlab experience during high school in her Biotechnology class at Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco. Because of her many hours using the FACS machine, she is also known as the ""Flow Master.""
Shuaixin He will be in her third year at Peking University. She majors in Life Sciences and is interested in observing and thinking about biological phenomena at microcosmic level. She was a lab manager for the 2013 Peking iGEM team and this is her second time participating in iGEM. In this year's project, she managed the strain construction and characterization of positive & negative feedback.  She has really enjoyed a pleasant time with S. cerevisiae as well as her fellow teammates.

HebrewU,2018,Team:HebrewU#Global aspects_-_-_TEXT.html," team, we were able to learn more about dioxin pollution in Estonia and the Baltic Sea. Estonian regulations are in line with those found in the EU. Though dioxin emissions in Estonia were lower than expected (when measured in 2003), there were still moderate pollution rates. It was estimated that large amount of pollutants comes with air masses from the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland . Dioxins enter the Baltic Sea as air fallout when transported from land-based sources which could be attributed to chemical and forest industries [especially in Russia where use of chlorine gas in these industries is still common practice].
Estonian regulations (EU)
Estonia pollution study
Baltic Sea Pollution study
Regulation in Australia
Australian regulation are also based on the limits that were accepted at the time of Stockholm convention (TEQ value below 0.1 ng). The Australian government announced a four-year National Dioxins Program back in 2001 to reduce dioxins and dioxin-like substances in the environment.
The studies [from Australia] show that the levels of dioxins in food, people and the environment are generally low when compared with levels internationally. They also showed that the risks to human health and the environment are low. Although there were only a small number of samples analyzed, these studies provided the largest survey of dioxin levels taken in Australia to date.

Global Aspects
Dioxins are mainly by-products of industrial processes, including waste incineration, but can also result from natural processes,"
UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," of minimal risk. Opinions about synthetic biology seem unlikely to cause those kinds of danger, but that doesn’t mean that you should not be mindful about the questions which your survey asks. Special procedures if you do want to ask a question that could put the participant in harm’s way if their participation were revealed can mean: 1) that you must either avoid collecting any personally identifiable information (or information, which in aggregate, is personally identifying) or 2) take measures to obscure personally identifying information within your database. That means that you must not include names or specific identifiers like pictures of the subjects or detailed descriptions that would allow someone to reasonably guess who the participant was. Random numbers can help keep a participants’ responses together. Our survey did not collect identifying information, nor did our questions pose a threat if the contents of the responses were released, so we heartily met the criteria for minimal risk.
Next, you must specify that your selection of participants is equitable for your study. This means, for instance, you cannot select or exclude participants on the basis of race is your study is not asking about race in any way. This is one of many countermeasures that evidence the history of unethical practice, as mentioned in the first section of this document regarding Tuskegee experiments. Equitable selection is separate from randomization of participants, which is a topic we will address in making for more effective research conclusions, but is not an IRB exemption requirement.
After, there is a requirement to responsibly store data if personally identifiable data is collected. This can include assigning random numbers to the participant’s responses and not publishing the raw data with personally identifiable information in tact (even if it is part of an unsolicited response).
Finally, your consent process must disclose 1) that the activities involve research, 2) the procedures to be performed, 3) that participation is voluntary, and 4) the name and contact information for the investigator. In our case, we did not have to obtain signatures from participants, since it is exempt work (so unlike the above linked Stanford Prison Experiment, we have no signed consent forms and were not required to get them.) UC Davis’s Research Office explains that, “consent can be verbal, but you must provide the information to participants through an information sheet or written script.” [16] We conducted our survey verbally and through written responses.
This how our verbal consent disclosure script looked, with numbers matching the aforementioned standards:

Gladly, the curve of xylose-consuming strain goes gradually up along with cultivating hours, and reach the plateau at around 90 hours, which is consist with the xylose consuming curve, indicating that our strain does produce ethanol on the basis of xylose, thus realizes our design and proves the concept of basic fermentation part.

The enzyme LacZ, bFMO and gusA can react with X-gal, tryptophan and Rose-gluc, respectively. The products of these enzymes can form insoluble precipitates and color the plates. We also used enzymes to test our system under a more complexed situation, to prove our concepts.
Figure 3. The compositions of four plasmids we constructed, the actuators in pJFR4 could be replaced by chromoproteins and enzymes.
Six plasmids compose the whole system, pJFR1 (BBa_K2598049), pJFR2 (BBa_K2598050), pJFR3(BBa_K2598051), pJFR4(BBa_K2598053), pJFR5(BBa_K2598052) and pJFR6(BBa_K2598061). The ‘sensor array’ module and the core fragment was integrated into pJFR1. The ‘circuits’ and ‘resource allocator’ were integrated into pJFR2 and pJFR3. And the ‘actuators’ containing fluorescence proteins, chormoproteins and enzymes were integrated into pJFR4, pJFR5 and pJFR6, respectively. We transformed four plasmids into our E.coli and finished our artwork.(For more information, see PARTS ）.
The actuators we chose were three kinds of color protein: fluorescent protein, chromoprotein and enzyme which can produce colorful products. The fluorescent proteins mRFP(BBa_K2598065), GFP(BBa_K2598063), BFP(BBa_K2598064) were chosen to test our system and achieve our final results because fluorescent reporters can be measured easily by ELIASA (microplate reader) and flow cytometry and the expression period is much shorter than those of chromoprotein and enzyme. What’s more, we use chormoproteins amilGFP (BBa_K2598055), amilCP (BBa_K2598057) and eforred (BBa_K2598056) to prove our concept.

We documented and submitted 52 standard BioBrick                                         parts .
 Part improvements
We improved the BioBricks BBa_K737005 and BBa_K737017 , deposited by team OUC-China in 2012, coding for the        GvpC protein. This protein is one of two proteins that compose protein gas vesicles, which were used in our project to enhance the sensitivity of mammalian        cells to mechanical stimuli. We improved the part by adding a FLAG tag, which allowed us to analyze the expression of the part form the cells via western blot and       to observe the subcellular localization of the protein by confocal microscopy. We further characterized the part by expressing it in mammalian cells together with        GvpA, showing that these proteins substantially increase the cell sensitivity to ultrasound. This part also plays a central role in our Mechanosensing collection.
We also improved BBa_K157010 , a transmembrane domain used by 2008 iGEM Freiburg team. We used this domain as        an anchor to which we attached the TagRFP protein on the N-terminal side and the ER retention signal on the C-terminal side. By western blots and confocal fluorescent       microcopy we were able to show that this part can not only be used for plasma membrane localization but can also be retained in the ER with the simple addition of a       4-amino-acid retention signal KKMP. Upon induced proteolytic cleavage of the retention signal by inducible split protease, the protein was translocated to the trans        GA and the plasma membrane, where TagRFP was cleaved by furin and secreted into the medium."
Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," their interaction and decrease the time taken for intermediates to move between them. Knowing this, a system that brings enzymes close together should be able to speed up a reaction in vitro.
By attaching Sup35’s prion domain to different associated proteins and then inducing aggregation, this goal can be accomplished. It has been established that it is possible to attach prion domains to proteins while retaining the functions of those proteins in aggregates, so the addition of the tag should not be a problem. Additionally, production of these tagged proteins can be performed E. coli, and the subsequent extraction of the proteins and induction of aggregation should be relatively simple.
There are a few existing techniques that one could use to bring proteins close together for this purpose, but this method has several advantages over them.
One group has proposed bringing enzymes together by anchoring them to the surface of a fat micelle. However, such a micelle could not be gathered from a solution easily and reused; the Sup35 domain aggregates can be centrifuged out of solution, which is a simple process that should allow them to be reused.
Another potential solution is using an engineered scaffold protein to latch onto the different enzymes in a system. One downside of this solution are that it requires that one make the enzymes in the system compatible with the scaffold by tagging them. While this is required in our solution as well, the tags are all the same and so the process of adding them is less complex. Additionally, one does not need to make a separate protein to serve as a scaffold. Another downside is, as with the last solution, that reusing the enzymes on a scaffold protein may be difficult. A third downside is that one is limited in how many enzymes can be added to the scaffold. With the Sup35 tag based system, any number of proteins can be tagged and added to the aggregate.
In summary, our solution is feasible, and due to its versatility and the reusability is better than existing solutions. One specific example of a way this system could be used would be in conjunction with Guelph iGEM’s 2017 project; the project is based on a pair of enzymes that can be used to remove calcium oxalate from brewing containers. Because the enzymes work together, bringing them onto the same aggregate may help them work together and speed up the removal process.
There are more secondary applications that have been brainstormed based on consultations and interviews from experts we have contacted as well as other research papers read thoroughly.
