Q Fever
Q fever is a zoonotic disease which is caused by Coxiella burnetii, a pathogen which usually resides in cattle and ticks and can be transmitted to humans through aerosols and raw animal products. The high susceptibility of humans for the pathogen was recognized by both the Soviet Union and the United States, who devised to use the organism as a biological weapon [1] . The high infectivity also resulted in numerous transient Q fever outbreaks in animals and humans within the European Union. Concerns were raised, however, in the European Union as the Netherlands was hit with the largest outbreak ever recorded with 4,026 human cases notified between 2007 and 2010 [2] .
The most important source of Q fever appears to be goats and sheep. The primary symptom of affected goats and sheep is abortion and reduced fertility. This abortion results in the release of over a billion C. burnetii bacteria per gram of placenta, providing a major risk for public health. Such abortions were first observed in the Netherlands in 2005 at two dairy goat herds. From 2005 till 2007, fifteen Q fever abortions were diagnosed. Q fever had, however, spread through the Netherlands more"

Project
I Why we design this project?
    The relationships between populations and individuals are very complex. For gregarious animals like ants, there exists an ant society, in which a clear division of labor can be seen. Despite of it, how the society is organized is still a mystery. For animals so simple as ants, the interactions between individuals still involve lots of genes. Similarly, for us human, how our society works is also a very complicated problem. Though difficult to study, the knowledge of the organization of societies is really precious as it directs our further research into behaviors and more importantly, gives us more angles to view history and instructs us to make the present society better.
    As all of these systems are too complicated and uncontrollable, it is hard for us to study these systems directly to understand the nature of these relationships. To achieve this goal, this year we decided to use our knowledge of synthetic biology to construct a simple system which can be used to simulate many kinds of relationships between individuals and populations. Through this system, we can simplify the complex natural system so we can get a better understanding of these relationships.
    What's more, we found that it will be much easier to consider effects of some factors (Like the initial number of each populations and spatial factors) on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---E.coli War ( Game Overview ) to satisfy our needs.
    Despite of the research values of our system, we found that as it is very simple"

We drew some interesting conclusions from all of the 544 questionnaires. There are three main conclusions:
1. Water pollution is much serious and of concern: 97.06 % respondents think water pollution is widespread (Fig1) and 88.24% of them care about the impact of water pollution on fish, holding that it is urgent and need to be resolved(Fig2). At the same time, as we asked their opinion about the study on the contaminated water and fish,only 0.74% think it’s meaningless and others all consider it to be important to health, environment and manufacture(Fig3). These results show that it is high time to put efforts on these worrying problems which is the goal and meaning of our project.
As we asked people’s opinion on introducing the gene which encodes the protein (or polypeptide) into the microorganism in order to produce the protein (or polypeptide) that can remove heavy metal. Although 66.18% think it’s feasible and encourage us to have a try(Fig4), 90.62% show their concerns to a certain extent(Fig5). So it’s possible for us to promote our device to the public. Meanwhile, since there are still many people who are unfamiliar with biological treatment, it’simportant for us to spread related knowledge to the public.
3. There are 67.83% of the respondents haven’t heard about iGEM before our questionnaire(Fig6). So we still have much work to do to promote the concepts of iGEM, making public learn more about it.
Public Education
We devised some interesting and educational activities. In May 2016, our team paid a visit to the Lanzhou University Affiliated Elementary School. Considering the significant role of microorganism in iGEM, We made a presentation about microorganism.

Safety Proposal
1. Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose: a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
The main purpose of our project is to regulate some of the kinetic properties of E. coli, which is not much concerned with the toxicity of the bacteria. However, it is never too overreacting to keep a warning bell in mind. Just in case our experiments may bring about uneasiness of safety, we have taken measures to make sure people inside the laboratory and in the outside world don’t get hurt. Several rules are established for everyone to stick to such as protective gears are required while performing experiments, and poisonous and reactive reagents should be used in special areas. We are using separate and distant spaces to perform experiments and study. Also before the whole project started we had a specific and detailed safety training for both USTC and USTC Software team members since we are using the same laboratory.
Ethidium bromide, an intercalating agent used as a nucleic acid fluorescent stain, will be and only be applied in electrophoretic procedures during our whole project. Anyone performing the procedure is asked to be wearing nitrile gloves all the time and no other thing is allowed to be done in the same area. The used agarose gels are carefully collected and thrown away after experiments.
Ultraviolet light are used during sterilization and decontamination of culture medium as well as visualizing the stained DNA in the electrophoretic gels. We are making rules against direct exposition to UV radiation such as special safety lenses would be used and the machine we use to visualize electrophoretic gels is UV-blocking.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
Since the strains we use in the whole study is not related to the genes of plants, animals or human and no pathogenic or toxic genes are being used during experiments, it is not likely that our materials or products will threaten the safety and health of the general public. Nevertheless the regulations of Genetically Engineered Organisms (GMOs) made by relevant departments of P. R. China will be followed.
c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
For the safety of the environment, we managed to classify all the experimental waste due to the environmental demands of the institute to prevent unwanted genes, if"
Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#team:amsterdam#collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Fumarase proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from fumarate. This impairs the efficiency of the TCA-cycle and the production of amino acids; since some amino acids are formed from TCA-cycle intermediates (Waegeman et al. , 2011) (Fig 1a). Team Amsterdam faced a similar problem and aimed  to incorporate a glyoxylate shunt into Synechocystis to increase fumarate production.  The glyoxylate shunt is composed of two enzymes, which are Malate Synthase and Isocitrate Lyase. They form a shortcut in the TCA-cycle (Fig. 1b).  In this way, the glyoxylate shunt restores some of the flux through part of the TCA-cycle, which should lead to a more efficient TCA-cycle. This is predicted to be beneficial for the cell in terms of fitness, as modelled by iGEM team Amsterdam.  For E.coli, a similar approach could be adopted, since E.coli can express the glyoxylate shunt genes to produce malate from isocitrate via glyoxylate. Thereby, in the process of producing malate, also succinate is formed. Because the cell can produce FADH2 by converting succinate to fumarate, the formed succinate will go to fumarate. In this way we are able to gain fitness and fumarate production, by having the glyoxylate shunt active.
Figure 1. The TCA-cycle with and without glyoxylate shunt. 1a). Fumarate is produced in a growth coupled way as a side product of arginine production. By knocking out fumarase, it cannot be degraded to malate. This way Fumarate accumulates. The TCA-cycle however is ‘broken’.1b). By expressing Malate Synthaese (MS) and Isocytrate Lyase (ICL), we can partly fix the ‘broken’ cycle. Now Isocitrate is made into both glyoxylate from which malate is synthesized and into succinate, which can be converted into fumarate. This way we have a better functioning cycle and more fumarate production thanks to the glyoxylate shunt.
However, when we look at the E. Coli physiology, the glyoxylate shunt genes are already present, but repressed by a repressor encoded by the iclR gene"

NTHU_Formosa,2018,Team:NTHU Formosa#Education01_-_-_TEXT.html," bio-industry is less popular than semiconductor industry.
It was quite disappointed at first when very few students showed their interest in biology. However, as we vigorously presenting our project with passion, the fact that biologists can create plenty of fun experiments in labs attracted groups of people to gather around. Our audiences on this day were not limited to students but parents and any relatives that came along, all of whom contributed to a survey we collected. With rising interest and curiosity in synthetic biology and iGEM, many questions were raised (the most frequently asked questions are listed below) and, as a result, we successfully promoted iGEM, synthetic biology and gave publicity of BioWatcher and idea. While we collected public views toward BioWatcher, we hope, in this way, to raise awareness of both public and individual health condition and appeal to them the importance of early diagnosis and early treatment.
1.    What’s the significance of our project?
**Soluble ligand-receptor interaction The existing known ligand-receptor interactions, such as notch signaling pathway, is only applicable on insoluble ligands. With our design on reporter cell, the receptors can detect both soluble and insoluble ligands.
**Wide application Before this system can be used in human, it can be applied widely in lab experiment animal models, such as zebrafish. The autonomous report system will be a convenient tool for scientists in qualitative measurements.
**Customized detector The detection module on the reporter cell is nanobody, functional antibody variable domain fragment. The programmable nanobodies on the reporter cells can be customized into detecting specific ligands. The range of application of this autonomous reporting system is simultaneously growing with the expansion of nanobody library. Reference: Pieter Deschaght, Ana Paula Vintém, Marc Logghe,Miguel Conde et al. Large Diversity of Functional Nanobodies from a Camelid Immune Library Revealed by an Alternative Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Data(2017)
**Non-invasiveness To increase convenience in blood test for all users, we establish a non-invasive biofactor measurement system with the help of autonomous reporter cells and bioluminescence-detecting smartwatches. In this case, the blood test can be taken more frequently and easily at home, which will increase health awareness and transform the catchphrase-- “early diagnosis early treatment” into live.
**Bioluminescence >>drug delivery The induced pathway can be interchangeable. At the moment, BioWatcher is designed to output autonomous bioluminescence signal. The system can be altered into therapeutic application when the bioluminescence signal"
SF_Bay_Area_DIYBio,2015,Team:SF Bay Area DIYBio#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," 29133: final enzyme produces shinorine and porphyra-334
We identified 7 other homologous genes from known shinorine producing cyanobacteria
Directed Evolution
UV resistance is an ideal target for Directed evolution:
- Introduce mutations
- Select for UV resistance
- Repeat!
In principle, we can rely on the UV exposure to introduce mutations, and select for the phenotype we want to optimize. In practice, we use error-prone Rolling Circle Amplification to introduce mutations just in the engineered plasmid carrying the shinorine biosynthesis genes.
In Rolling Circle Amplification, a phage polymerase is used to copy a circular piece of DNA. The polymerase is so processive that it will displace the previously copied strand when it circles around the plasmid, resulting in linear strand containing many copies of the plasmid. By changing some of the salts present in the reaction, we can cause the polymerase to become far more error-prone, incorporating single-base errors at random locations.
Error-prone Rolling Circle Amplification is a highly effective and convenient alternative to doing error-prone PCR to amplify a stretch of DNA while introducing mutations. One of its main benefits is that the reaction happens at a single temperature, so no temperature cycling is needed!
If we go directly from transformation to growing in liquid medium, and then do the selection in liquid medium, we may never actually need to grow isolates during each round of Directed Evolution. This could in theory lead to a greatly simplified protocol:
UV Kill Curve experiments
In order to do the Directed Evolution experiments, we first need to figure out how much UV light we expose our E. coli cells to. During the selection phase, we want to kill most, but not all cells, so as to impose a strong selective pressure for improved UV resistance.
So we first generated a ""Kill Curve"" for our E. coli cells, counting how many cells are left alive after exposure to different doses of UV. We simple expose a liquid E. coli culture in a very shallow Petri dish to UV light in our home-made UV exposure box, and take out samples every couple of minutes.
From these samples we then create a dilution series, diluting 1:10 down to a dilution of 1:10^-5^, and spot drops of these dilutions on agar plates.
Finaly, we count the colonies, at whichever dilution factor yields a countable number of colonies. Knowing the dilution factor, we can then work back to how many colony forming units were left in the liquid culture exposed to UV light."

SLiCE Ex vivo DNA assembly
Introduction
We developed a DNA assembly system purely based on parts homology, which only uses E. coli lysate to carry out the reaction. Our work builds on the previous research on lysate based assembly methods, in the particular SLiCE and Ex vivo . The concept is very similar to that of a Gibson method: the parts to be assembled contain an overlapping homology region, which allows homologous recombination to occur. While the Gibson assembly utilises an expensive piece of kit, containing a 3' to 5' exonuclease, a DNA polymerase to fill the gaps and a ligase to seal the nick. The Ex vivo, as we like to call it ""E.G., or E. coli gratiae"" only uses E. coli lysate to carry out this reaction. The lysate in fact does contain all the cellular machinery necessary to recognise a homology and to repair DNA. This process if facilitated when the lysate contains three lambda proteins, which can be easily expressed in the strains used to produce it. In addition to normal lysate, this system was tested using a lysate of cells expressing lamda proteins. These are the same protein that allow Lambda Red Recombineering Knock-Outs, i.e. Gam, Exo and Beta, which respectively protect linear DNA from RecBCD nuclease activity, cleave DNA 3' to 5' and promote annealing of complementary single strands.
We decided to test the efficacy of SLiCE for the assembly of parts only based on a short flanking homology. This homology is roughly equivalent to that of the biobrick prefix and suffix. This means that a two part assembly, of the insert - such as a gblock - into the standard pSB1C3 vector would only require one Seamless Ligation step. This avoids the standard (and costly!) digestion/ligation steps that usually are required for the biobrick assembly.
We tested this approach by ligating the standard J04450 RFP generator to pSB1C3 using 22bp and 21bp of homology (biobrick prefix and suffix :) ) and successfully achieved pink, ligated colonies.

BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Wetlab#BetaGalactosidaseAssays_-_-_TEXT.html," stop the reaction by adding 0.5mL of 1M Na2CO3 and vortexing briefly. Note the time at which each reaction was stopped, and record the total incubation time. Also add Na2CO3 to the ""no lysate"" control.
Measure and record A420 and A550 of each reaction mixture, using the ""no lysate"" control to set ""zero"" at each wavelength.
Calculate specific β-galactosidase activity (Miller units) according to the equation:
(A420 gives a value for o-nitrophenol concentration; A550 gives a value for cell debris scattering (the procedure of the β-Galactosidase assay requires cells to be broken apart); 0.1 is the volume of cell lysate used in the assay, and; A600 gives the cell density before lysis).
Our results
In total there were 6 runs made of the procedure made, some more successful than others. Attempt 2 was stopped after letting the 30°C incubation run for an extra hour and still not observing colour change. Attempts 4 and 5 both achieved bad data that was not used in the final characterisation of PyeaR by our team. Attempt 6 produced reproducible data but it wasn't quite what we were hoping to show. These are our results for the various repeats of the assay.

2.3 The measurement of tissues harvested indicates the function of KRAS siRNA on the tumor treatment
Subsequently, mice were sacrificed for tumor harvest after in vivo imaging. All the tumors were measured for length, volumes and weight. Small pieces from every tumor was cut independently and fixed by paraformaldehyde to prepare for histopathological examination.

2.4 Pathological section to observe tumor cells
After measurement of tumors, HE staining was conducted to verify the function of iRGD-exosomal siRNA. HE staining enabled better visualization of tissue structure and cell morphology, which can be used for morphological observation of normal and diseased tissue. The detection result showed that tumor cell necrosis rate in experimental group was much higher than control group. In other words, iRGD exosomes KRAS siRNA can effectively induce tumor cell necrosis and suppress cell proliferation

One of our collaborators, the Bielefeld iGEM team , graciously sent us two laccases to use on our Sporobeads.
We wanted to demonstrate the formation of GFP-expressing spores in our cells, so we decided to try time-lapse microscopy. Our first round of time-lapse failed, as the cells spontaneously lysed after 10 hours. We were baffled by this reaction. Well, time to do some research.

Improving BBa_K1384000
In order to fulfill a gold medal requirement we successfully improved the design of Biobrick BBa_K1384000 . BBa_K1384000 was developed by the 2014 UCLA iGEM to be used in Iterative Capped Assembly. Early in our project, we attempted to use BBa_K1384000 to carry out ICA, but encountered difficulties due to non-specific ligation. For preliminary tests, we ligated pairs of monomers together to determine the efficacy of the old sticky ends.
Fig. 1 Ligation test using monomer pairs. A represents AB, B is BC, and C is CA. The presence of laddering bands indicates non-specific binding, showing that this Biobrick is unsuitable for use in ICA.
The expected result of this test is a single band corresponding to the ligated 2-mer product. However, the ladder of bands indicates that the sticky ends bind non-specifically. We believe this result is due to several factors: the GC content of the sticky end is 50-75% (2-3 out of 4 bases); there is only one base pair difference between the sticky ends, which does not confer sufficient distinction between each sticky end. The high GC content is due to the sticky ends encoding Alanine, whose codons are GCN. The high similarity between the sticky ends is due to poor design.
This summer, we redesigned and expanded the original part to become our Spider Silk ICA Part collection ( here and here )
We redesigned the sticky ends to overcome the two obstacles outlined above. Firstly, we decreased the GC content of the sticky by encoding alanine instead of valine. Alanine is coded for by GTN, which lowers the inherent GC content. We chose valine as a substitute for alanine due to structural similarity, so it would not interfere with the spider silk protein secondary structure. Secondly, we redesigned the sticky ends such that there was at least a two base pair difference between any two of the three sticky ends. Our final NEW sticky ends are:

Assembly of the constitutive promoters with LovTAP Mr. gene sequence
Experimental Procedure
25-26 August 2010.
1. Prepare the ligation mixture taking into account the quantity of the DNA insert -LovTAP- and the receiver DNA -plasmids harboring the promoters-.
2. Incubate the sample at 16°C overnight.
3. Transform the cells. Click here for the protocol.
4. Culture the cells in the proper selective medium.
5. Incubate the petri dishes at 37°C overnight.
6. Re-culture the resultant colonies in the proper selective medium; incubate them at 37°C overnight.
7. Analyze the colonies with Colony PCR to confirm that they contain the correct ligation
Primers:  Forward (5'->3'): Preffix primer.  Reverse:(5'->3'): Suffix primer.
8.  Use SalI restriction enzyme, in order to confirm LovTAP ligations, because there is a recognition site for that enzyme inside LovTAP coding region, approximately at the middle of the gene. The SalI recognition site is not present in RFP gene nor in plasmid J61002. So that cutting with this enzyme, LovTAP ligations will be confirmed as true positives (the insert is LovTAP and not RFP gene).
LovTAP ligations with promoters were correctly performed.

Stuttgart,2018,Team:Stuttgart#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"nolipid and nisin is described [3] so that the approach of using these two molecules together to generate a surface coating looks promising. Different ratios between these molecules need to be tested to get the desired results.
Our biobased coating (figure 1) contains a chitosan scaffold (black) linked to the antimicrobial peptide nisin (green) and the glycolipid rhamnolipid (red). Our aim is the connection of the scaffold to the rhamnolipid by using chemical linkage (with divinyladipate as a linker, grey) or an enzymatically driven linkage. We also aim to link nisin enzymatically.
Figure 1: The Anti Germ Coating (TAGC) visualized in black: chitosan backbone, red: rhamnolipid, grey: divinyladipate linker and green: nisin.
The scaffold polymer - chitosan
Chitosan is a polymeric product of deacetylated chitin. Different types of chitosan can be distinguished by degree and pattern of acetylation as well as the polymer length. It also results in different chemical and physical properties. Short to midrange chitosan with low degrees of acetylation has strong antimicrobial properties [2] . Therefore, it has properties forming a functional base for TAGC.
Antimicrobial substances - rhamnolipid and nisin
Rhamnolipids are a class of glycolipids normally produced by the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They consist of a glycosyl head group with one or two rhamnose groups and a fatty acid tail (e.g. hydroxydecanoic acid). They act as antimicrobial substances with possible synergistic effects as a combination of mono- and di-rhamnolipids [4] .
Nisin is an antibiotic normally produced by Lactococcus lactis and shows antimicrobial properties towards gram-positive bacteria. It inhibits cell wall formation and generates transient pores to disrupt the cell membrane.
Where can TAGC be imagined?
TAGC has many applications in public places, healthcare and industry. Thus, it is able to make a significant improvement in daily life.
Public:
Handles and railings in public places are constantly in contact with many different germs present on human skin.
Public toilettes are one of the places with the largest number of germs. A coating which could reduce the number of the germs would result in an improvement of hygienic conditions.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," slightly stronger than the pTet promoter (Figure 1). According to literature1, the T7 promoter should be about three times as strong as the phlF promoter.
Glasgow iGEM 2015
How fast is the signal? This question comes down to the time it takes for each of the signal molecules to degrade. The TetR Design and the T7 Design rely on the degradation of TetR to begin TLP expression. The Antisense Design relies on the degradation of an antisense RNA molecule to begin TLP expression.
TetR degrades in ~40 minutes when fitted with an LVA tag.2
Antisense RNA usually degrades in ~8 minutes.3
How toxic is fusaric acid?
The numbers varied, but we found that fusaric acid has a strong impact on the cell. Fusaric acid inhibits growth of Bacillus Subtilis by 60% at a concentration of 200 ug/ml.4 Future work of our group includes investigating the effects of fusaric acid on our chasse organism.
How much fusaric acid are the cells exposed to?
The phlF promoter begins responding at a concentration of 46 ug/ml5. Our cells may therefore need to be exposed to a significant inhibitory concentration before responding to fusaric acid.
Based on this literature information, each design is given the following review:
TetR Design: This design performs worst in terms of the rate of TLP production as it expresses TLP under the weakest promoter. This design does not have a quick response time to fusaric acid, as TLP will only be expressed once TetR degrades after forty minutes.
Antisense Design: This design expresses TLP under a promoter that is three times weaker that the T7 promoter. However, its response time to fusaric acid is dramatically faster. After about eight minutes, the antisense RNA will degrade, allowing the TLP transcript to be translated.
T7 Design: This design expresses TLP under a significantly stronger promoter than the other designs. However, it likely has the slowest response time, as TLP production only begins once TetR degrades and T7 expresses. Furthermore, leaky expression is a big concern with this design. All the designs have the potential for leaky expression, but leaky TetR repression in this design would lead to T7 polymerase expression, and fundamentally turn on the entire expression system.
After our investigation, we conclude that the Antisense Design is “best.”

Fluorescein (dissolved in PBS) with whole blood,
Fluorescein (dissolved in PBS) with serum.
Blanks are obtained by mixing 25 µL of whole blood/serum with 25 µL of PBS / NaCl / distilled water. Each concentration was tested in triplicate. The emitted fluorescence was measured using the plate reader Chameleon (Multilabel reader flat Chameleon - Hidex, No. 2,060,003 series SCIENCETEC) on 3 different times t = 0 min t = 10 min and t = 20 min in order to observe the kinetic of fluorescence.

A calibration range consisting of 4 samples of fluorescein with increasing concentrations (10-3, 10-2, 10-1 and 1 mM) was prepared in distilled water. Blank corresponds to a solution of distilled water only. The solutions were placed into spectrophotometer 1 mL cuves and the emitted fluorescence was visualized using a smartphone with a combination of two filters. The first filter which has the transmitted wavelength corresponding to the maximum emission of fluorescein (512 nm), is positioned on the lens of the camera. The second filter, which has the transmitted wavelength corresponding to the absorption maximum of fluorescein (494 nm), is fixed on the flash. The picture is then taken under different conditions: combination of two filters, the filter on the single flash, the filter on the lens only and without any filter.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

TUESDAY, MAY 31
Lists of supplies needed for various assays were assembled, and an assessment of necessary ordering was made, thus finalizing the functional assays to run for both nanowire and phosphorus genes. Additionally, brainstorming for an Experiment (crowd-funding for scientific research) campaign was completed.
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 1
Background research continued, and some ideas were tossed around concerning the official project theme for this year (more to come on that later). A meeting with Drs. Rickus and Solomon led to recommendations to practice with both the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the process of electroporation for genome integration to prepare for performing these procedures later. Project write-ups for the Experiment campaign were completed, as was an application for a grant from SYNENERGENE for advanced human practices.
THURSDAY, JUNE 2
The Experiment online crowdfunding platform was submitted for approval in the morning, and an order for both competent cells and primers was placed. Background research was again the main focus, and most team members concentrated their efforts on learning the ins and outs of both Shewe (Shewanella oneidensis) and tiny moon phosphorus-eaters (Microlunatus phosphovorus).
FRIDAY, JUNE 3
This week’s conclusion was easily one of its most exciting moments, as the team took a field trip to visit Drs. Chi-hua Huang and Ashley Hammac of the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Lab, who generously donated both their time and expertise to answer questions and allow the team to tour the facility. Analytical labs, rain-producing machines for the purpose of studying erosion patterns, bioreactors, and anaerobic growth chambers were among the cutting-edge technologies the team observed. Thank you, Dr. Huang and Dr. Hammac!
Word was received later in the afternoon that the Experiment proposal had been approved; the campaign launches June 9!

MONDAY, JUNE 6
Monday morning got rolling with the attendance of ABE PhD student Dr. Andi Hodaj’s thesis defense regarding two-stage ditches as a tool to reduce nutrient loads. A two-stage ditch is a variation of a traditional agricultural ditch in which the banks are dredged to create floodplains, dissipating the energy of high-flow water and increasing interaction time between vegetation and water. Purdue’s two-stage ditch utilized in Dr. Hodaj’s was established in 2012 and drains 660 acres; it may be a possible implementation point for the project’s biological method.

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND EDUCATION
SUMMARY
Through public engagement and education both within and outside of our school, we sought to ensure that our project is ethical, responsible, and beneficial to our community. In a bioethics roundtable discussion, we examined our project through different perspectives; this helped us think about some of the possible unintentional consequences (e.g. increased alcoholism) and determine how to carry out our project responsibly. Through our marketing plan, we considered the health food regulations as well as safety and labeling requirements needed to ensure that our product would be created, tested, and marketed responsibly. Our examination of current alcohol labeling regulations and policy brief also sought to encourage the Taiwanese government to develop better health warning labeling practices. This hopefully will promote more responsible drinking habits in a country where almost half the population is ALDH2 deficient and susceptible to increased cancer risks. Finally, through our talks in health classes and class meetings at our high school, we encouraged students to be more conscientious of the health risks associated with ALDH2 deficiency as they approach Taiwan’s legal drinking age of eighteen.

PROJECT-SPECIFIC BIOETHICS
BIOETHICS ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION
In February, we hosted a Bioethics Roundtable, where we invited students and teachers to discuss the social, ethical, and medical aspects of our project. Hoping to generate discussion and new perspectives, we developed a set of questions, assigned different roles to participants, and asked for opinions from the respective views of each assigned role.
An example:
“Should ALDH2 testing be a free test service for people? In what form would you want ALDH2 testing to be available? Kit? Hospital testings? Who should pay for the test?”
The designated roles for this question included Government Official, College Student, Hospital Administrator, Employer, and Alcohol Manufacturer.
There was no apparent preference for home-kits versus hospital tests, but a strong preference for tests to be covered by the government through the National"

Japanese Website
In addition to this Team Wiki website, we opened another website in Japanese . iGEM is the world largest competition in synthetic biology in which nine other teams from Japan also participate. But if you look beyond the iGEM community, it is not widely known in Japan. Even some of our team members had never heard about it when they decided to join it. This website written in our local language will PR iGEM widely in Japan. People in Japan will be interested in iGEM and more broadly in synthetic biology.

Can you read the text without zooming?
Can you navigate without pushing wrong buttons?
If you don't have a website compatible with mobile devices, you may be missing out on the chance to spread buzz about your team’s activities. Mobile phone screen sizes are relatively small so browsing websites designed for large monitors on smartphones involves a lot of zooming in and out, panning, and shuffling around. When people look at regular websites on mobile devices such as iPhones and Androids, normal websites do not show up correctly. We frequently see this happening on Wiki pages of iGEM teams. Elaborate colorful website filled with interesting information and activities are so compressed that they are illegible. What a pity! Therefore we designed our website separately for mobile devices to make the best use of the small screen. It is friendly to your thumb and eyes. URL is the same for PCs and smartphones. Our Wiki page automatically chooses and offers the optimum interface by identifying whether your device is a PC or a smartphone. Adapting a website for mobile users allows for easier reading, longer time on the site and more repeat visits - all of which are important to get the message across.

Motivation
The availability of biopharmaceuticals has been steadily growing in recent years. Furthermore, due to expiring patents, it is expected that biosimilar agents will flood the markets.  All pharmaceuticals - including our BoNTC shuttle mechanism- have to face one major challange, compared to small molecule drugs: the triggering of the humoral immune responses. [] . The production of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) by plasma cells and the resulting presence of the ADAs in the circulation can cause unwanted side effects. Additionally, the antibodies reduce the efficacy of the treatment, by specifically binding and neutralizing its function or by reducing the availability of the biopharmaceutical in the targeted area [] [] . Moreover, an unwanted triggering of the immune response is always a great risk for the patient. In the worst case scenario the treatment can even be life threatening by causing an anaphylactic shock as response to the foreign protein [] . Another big problem often arises in replacement therapies, when the immune system triggers a cross-reactive immune response to the endogenous protein like thrombopoietin or erythropoietin while treating the patient with its recombinant counterpart [] [] .  Hence, there's clearly a demand for deimmunization of biopharmaceuticals. Decreased immunogenicity of biopharmaceuticals is very likely to result in a safer and more effective treatment. Therefore we decided to engineer a software tool to solve this problem.
MHC Molecules
The major histocompatibility complex, in humans also called human leucocyte antigen (HLA), is encoded on chromosome six, containing separate gene clusters for the different MHC molecule types [] . The MHC molecules can be divided into two classes, the MHC class I molecules and the MHC class II molecules. Both molecules present short"

Failed to load tracking. JS is probably not enabled
Background
To maximize the specificity in targeting Yersinia enterocolitica, we wanted to design a construct consisting of a membrane protein complex that would bind to the surface of the pathogen. This could be done by fusing an anchor protein with the colicin Fy that aimed at the membrane of Y. enterocolitica. This complex would be expressed on the surface of our probiotic, making it adhere to its target.
System design
We made two constructs, using a synthesized gene coding for pgsA. In the first one we fused pgsA with colicin Fy and added a promoter aswell as a RBS called B0034. In the other, BFP was put instead of colicin Fy to test the expression of pgsA.
Result
Mutagenesis of B0034-BFP into RFC25 was successful, verified by sequencing. All other constructs were not successful. Mainly because we had trouble with the RFC25-assemblies. The removal of TACTAG was also not successful.

Supporters of an open source system for Synthetic Biology claim that innovation can be sped up, thus making the benefits of the field available more quickly. Proponents of patenting believe that commercializing synthetic biology products is impossible in an open source environment (Rerimassie & Stemerding, 2014).
Biolink: risks and ethical issues
As we described above, risks can arise when utilizing our Biolinker and printing a biofilm. To reduce the risks, Biolink users should be aware of some safety aspects. First of all, the preparation of the bioink must follow a protocol, just as any other step in the lab. A protocol ensures personal and environmental safety. If preparations are done in a ML1 environment, we think there should not be significant risks. Any actions done without respecting ML1, are not control. In our project the bioink is printed with a DIY printer made out of K’NEX. Since the material is in contact with microbial material it is important to  only use the printer in a laboratory environment and not as toys for your kids anymore. After printing the biofilm, there is the risk of spreading microorganisms. In our project, we are working with a safe strain of E.coli. As an additional safety feature  the nanowire formation only starts after induction with Rhamnose. The absence of Rhamnose prevents undesirable biofilm formation.
Another aspect, more related to biosecurity, is the fact that we publish a manual on how to engineer our organism and how to build our printer in an open source system. Although this is related to the DIY mentality, we only provide information on how to print with our safe bacteria. During the RIVM/Rathenau Institute debate we found out that policy makers would not have problems with allowing this technology in an open source system.
Besides risks, ethical issues such as ‘unnaturalness’ (like the Ecover case) or ‘playing for god’ are hard to tackle. To understand the actual feeling and opinion of the public, we developed a Biolink policy and practice tool to make the issues related to an iGEM project more concrete. Based on the outcomes of the tool, communication about the project can become more concise and helpful.

flavors
Flavors are perhaps to most interactive parts of the iGarden project.  We currently have 2 flavors inserted into plants that are currently growing, with options and ideas for an additional three.
miraculin
Miraculin is a 'flavor inverting' protein, found naturally in the fruit of the plant Synsepalum dulcificum. Not sweet by itself, miraculin binds to taste receptors on the tongue, possibly altering the structure of the receptors and causing traditionally 'sour' flavors to be received as 'sweet'.
We have obtained, synthesized and BioBricked the DNA sequence of miraculin. This has allowed us to work with it in the usual BioBrick fashion, facilitating insertion into the agrobacterium expression vector.
Preliminary tests in E. Coli have been positive, with our YFP-tagged proteins showing definite expression
brazzein
Brazzein is a sweet-tasting protein that is found in the Western African fruit, the Oubli. The protein consists of a 54 amino acid sequence.  It is sweeter than sugar and is used as an alternative low calorie sweetener.
We have obtained, synthesized and BioBricked the DNA sequence of brazzein.  We were then able to flank this sequence with a plant specific promoter and terminator and insert this construct into the agrobacterium expression vector.
Preliminary tests in E. Coli have been positive, with our YFP-tagged proteins showing definite expression and a Western Blot also showing successful expression of brazzein.
valencene
We originally tried to extract RNA from Valencia oranges and then make a cDNA library.  We then used PCR to amplify the Valencene sequence.  Valencene is a gene that codes for a molecule that gives Valencia oranges their citrus flavor and aroma.
Unfortunately, after three attempts, we were not able to obtain a viable cDNA library.  We then tried to extract genomic DNA.  However, none of our PCR tries worked from the genomic DNA. "

6-4 Consideration of Safety
After playing cards with the students, we were able to have a talk with the school principal and vice principal. They appreciated us for creating cards and teaching the students about synthetic biology in a simple and approachable way.
It was their first time to learn about synthetic biology in detail, so the principals were impressed of the possibility of this field. However, they had doubts about the safety using genetically engineered creatures. Since those creatures do not exist in nature, we do not know what will happen when they are released into the wild. If something happens, it might take a long time to get the previous nature back. Many people have this fear of genetic engineering, and this leads to the bad image of synthetic biology. Based on these doubts, we explained to them the scientists’ measurements for safety. When we make a discovery, for example “iPS cells”, we consider if it is okay to use them for human or nature on a long-term basis. Just like inventing a new medicine, we have to test them on animals for more than ten years, and when the safety is secured, we decide to use them on human.
By discussing with the principals, we were able to know the public mind toward synthetic biology. We feel this image is due to the ignorance of this field. If we can get more people informed of the reality of synthetic biology, maybe we can change the general opinion. We will continue interacting with a variety of people so that more and more people can learn about synthetic biology.

Using sfGFP-SpyCatcher
Verification - Using SpyCatcher-CotA
Conclusion
Project

I. Overview
Fig1.1: CsgA-SpyTag
CsgA is a amyloid protein which is a dominant component of the biofilms of E. coli. We fused a functional peptide domain SpyTag with gene CsgA (previous part: BBa_K1583000), forming CsgA-SpyTag (Improved Part: BBa_K2684006). By utilizing the steady isopeptide bond combination ability of the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system , it is possible to fix different SpyChatcher-fusing proteins, like enzymes or receptors, to the biofilm to introduce a variety of artificial functions.
(Team: Peking, 2016)
Fig1.2: SpyTag and SpyCatcher System
II. Verification - Using sfGFP-SpyCatcher
We used sfGFP-SpyCatcher as indicator to test whether the addition of SpyTag peptide could confer the artificial functions to the biofilm, such as covalent immobilization of SpyCatcher-fusion proteins.
Protocol for SpyTag-SpyCatcher system verification
We tested our improved part BBa_K2684006 and the previous part BBa_K1583000 with the same protein expression system settings (E. coli BL21, pET28a vector, and the same induction and expression protocol).
The decrease of florescence of the supernatant indicates the immobilization of sfGFP-SpyCatcher, and there’s a significant difference between the two groups.
III. Verification - Using SpyCatcher-CotA
The immobilization of SpyCatcher-CotA fusion protein to the CsgA-SpyTag biofilm was tested, and a commercial laccase activity assay kits was used to measure the laccase activity.
Protocol for Biofilm x Laccase
The difference between our improved part and the previous part is significant.  Thus, we proved that SpyCatcher-CotA can be attached to the biofilm containing functional peptide SpyTag.
IV. Conclusion
To conclude, we introduce a new ability to the previous CsgA part, which is capturing all fusion protein with SpyCatcher domain, by fusing SpyTag peptide to CsgA coding sequence. We verified the protein immobilization function of our improved part using"

They gave us a great opportunity to present our project, meet other iGEM teams, hear about their projects and collaborate. We got to socialize with other iGEM teams and see their approaches in tackling problems regarding all aspects of the project (e.g. fundraising, wet lab, research, etc.). All teams seemed to have had similar difficulties, so it was nice to know we weren’t alone. In the end we learned how iGEM projects are done in different countries, got acquainted with the cultures of Sweden and France, did sightseeing, experienced a Swedish Gasque and even paid a visit to aunt Mona Lisa!
At NiC, we got a chance to practice our project presentation skills by taking part in the Mini Jamboree. It was the first time we presented our project for an audience of that size, and we placed in the top 4. The winners, team Copenhagen, got the honor of hosting the NiC next year. In the two great workshops that followed, we got to ponder some questions on bioethics, and imagined what the world would look like in a future where everything is based on synthetic biology.
The judges, who were ex-iGEMers themselves, shared their experiences with us about the current state of biotechnology in Sweden. The conference overall had a very warm setting and thanks to it we made some good friends. One of these friendships later led to a collaboration, which we will present below.
The Paris conference gave us a chance to prepare our first poster and take part in a lively poster session with more than twenty teams from all over Europe. There was an interesting panel discussion about biosecurity and the challenges and risks in synthetic biology.
These conferences also gave us a chance to meet iGEM officials – Vinoo Selvarajah and Randy Rettberg who gave us good advice which we will take into account in selecting next year’s Aalto-Helsinki team. They advised us to “select your project and start as soon as possible so that you have enough time to get something done”.

The first thing we needed to do was to biobrick the promoter from pUC57amp-cI.  We PCR'd biobrick restriction sites onto the lac/ara-1 promoter along with the RBS.  We then cloned the lac/ara-1 promoter into pSB1C3 backbone.  We extracted the promoter from pSB1C3 with EcoRI and SpeI cut sites, and a GFP reporter E0240 with XbaI and PstI and the backbone was prepared with EcoRI and PstI as per the protocol for characterizing promoter activity on the biobrick website.  At time of writing we are currently cloning the lac/ara-1 GFP construct for characterization.
Collaboration with the association WAX Science
The Gender Study was realized in collaboration with the association WAX Science (http://wax-science.fr/). WAX Science is a French Association that promotes science without stereotypes. The iGEM team Paris Bettencourt and WAX Science worked together on what was the best way to treat the subject of  mixity and diversity in iGEM and in Synthetic Biology. .
The collaboration started with the definition of the project and continued throughout its realization, from the statistics to the analysis of the results
Tips for a successful collaboration
Important for the success of our cooperation was to regularly see each other on Skype. It is way easier to talk in person than to communicate by mail as misunderstandings and questions could be solved directly. We used Asana.com to set up tasks for each team that completed until the next week. Setting up those weekly tasks was a good idea as we were not overwhelmed by a lot of work but having those small tasks we could process them in time. Also the splitting up of work, as we did for example for the Wikis, was very helpful and part of the success to reach our goal in time.
For future collaborations, setting up weekly tasks and skyping every week worked well for us! Also important is that both teams have the same idea of the aim of the collaboration as well as how to achieve it. With the Calgary Team 2013 we found a great partner that fit to what we imagined!

Lethbridge_HS,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Results of July 6 Recultured Biofilms, Degradation of July 7 Biofilms and Preparation of New Biofilms for Further Testing
Objective: Determine if yesterday’s recultured biofilms were successful. In addition continue to degrade biofilms using the household cleaners brought into lab for testing and see if we can successfully reculture the biofilms created yesterday.
Results: Reculturing of the July 6 Biofilms
We were successful in reculturing the biofilms to varying extents based on the overnight cultures of the degraded RFP biofilms. Based on reference of the biofilm that had been cultured before the cleaners were added, the Truly is the most red in colour. Both bleach and Tilex had a more clear appearncec similar to LB.
PHOTO
Procedure: Degrading the July 7 Biofilms
The biofilms created yesterday successfully grew. To degrade the biofilms, Tilex, Truly and Fantastic cleaner solutions were used that had previously been created. The solutions of biofilms were disposed of in the biohazard waste and the microtiter plates placed in water. They were vigoursly shaken to dry and 300 μL of respective cleaning solution added to each well. Since three plates of biofilms were created, each cleaning solution received its on plate. 15 mins after the solutions was added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing the July 7 Biofilms
To culture the biofilms from yesterday, 300 μL of LB media was added to one well for one of microtiter plate that had been degraded with cleaner. The media was then pipette up and down to mix with any remnants of the biofilms. The media was then pipetted back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
Process was repeated for the remaining two plates that used different cleaners.
Note: Before cultures were degraded using the different cleaners, Kieran had taken a sample of the biofilms and prepared a 5 mL tube of LB to culture the biofilm that would be ensured to grow.
Cultures were left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Procedure: New Biofilms
New biofilms were created for July 9 testing. Same protocol used as June 30. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with "
SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", so we joined in The Sixth Asian Conference on Precision Agriculture as volunteers.
Part  II:    Investigation
We hoped our human practice work can influence more ordinary people. So, above all, we should realize other people's opinions to transgenic food. Because of that,we made a questionnaire about GMO.
The datas we’ve obtained in questionnaire sre showing below:
The respondents' proportion of men and women are approximately balanced. The number of age groups which between 18 and 25 is the majority. What's more, the respondents have a Bachelor degree or higher degree.
The main content
Question 4: Do you know what is Genetically modification (gm)?
Analysis of the Q4: 4/5 of the respondents have a certain understanding for ""GM technology""，1/5 respondents don’t understand this technology or even don’t know. This suggests that the ""GM technology"" was received by the majority of respondents.
Question 6:Will you eat gm food?
Analysis: About a third of the people can accept genetically modified (gm) food. 17% of people determined not to eat genetically modified food. Suggest that the public acceptance for genetically modified foods is improving.
Question 11: Is genetically modified products (gm) beneficial or harmful in your opinion?
Analysis: Most people had skeptical attitudes to genetically modification (gm). For respondents, genetically modification is an emerging technology. The public don’t understand enough about genetically modified crops, so they cannot hold a certain attitude to it.
Question 12 :Will you use gm products (non-food)?
Question13: Have you ever heard of skin care product that contains astaxanthin?
Question 14: Will you choose skin care product or health food contains astaxanthin (gm) ？
If new genetically modified foods were put into market, about half of people can fully accept. While the acceptance of gm products (non-food) is even higher. However, our public do not know much about astaxanthin product at present, So we should Enlarge the propaganda.
Part  III:   Spread knowledge to our society
1.  Writing GMO handbook
writing GMO handbook After participating in several lectures and talks, we learnt a lot. So we wrote a handbook about genetically modified organism (GMO) as a summary, which contains our answers to many questions. We can use this as educational and popularizational material. The list below is content of our handbook.

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology, there are still some important ethical aspects that have to be considered, and we are continuously aware of the power of technology and the responsibility that goes along with it.
We are not the only part involved. We consider two other skilled professions: The professional researcher and the doctor.
Flux of medical personnel and academic brainpower
There is a flux of competent doctors from rural areas. They move into the city where there is work and money to be made. Money to feed their families. This makes staying in a rural clinic a hard sell. What would the incentive to do so for a newly educated doctor from Ghana? Further, if inferior means of treatment, i.e no proper medical equipment or antivenom is present, would the cost of staying with his relatives in a rural city, inviting a harder life, be worth the lives he could potentially safe? How much hardship should he endure and would he be willing to accept until he, too takes the journey to an established medical practice in the city?
This means that the rural clinics are lacking competent medical personnel. The staff  effectively consists of nurses that often lack the preliminary knowledge about venom treatment [1] .
Furthermore, when speaking to a post-doctoral fellow working within the field of bioinformatics and comparative venomics, we sensed an expressed frustration with searching funding of research related to snake venoms as it seems to be an uphill battle. That his family suffered in the process and that he never really had time-off. He missed being able to work a nine to five and have time off, when the clock five pm. When asked about if he felt he had a duty to work, he expressed that he had responsibilities to his family as well and also felt that he had served his duty, his “conscription”.
We should utilize the motivation of students enrolling into their education of these incentives. Solving and contributing to a better world. Both the doctor and the post-doc. raises important issues. The issue of financing.
Money, Money, Money
Who will fund this?
During public engagement activities we have been put to task by the question: “Who will fund this?”
The question is justified as it is glaringly apparent that the countries, nations, societies, tribes, families and the affected individuals have little to no funds to pay for such treatment. The countries have a very challenged health budget.
For this issue to be addressed properly and our solution to be feasible, some sort of financial backing is vital.

I plan to learn a new language, volunteer in as many countries as possible and make some new friends. The final very important thing you should know about me is: I like chocolate and I like peanut butter, but I hate it when the two are combined!

Hi I am Katherine. In the fall I will be entering my third year in biochemistry at the U of L. This is my first year in iGEM and I am really excited to be part of the team! My goal in life is to create mini monopolies from coffee shops that will eventually turn into a centralized giant monopoly that will take over the world. To assist me in this I will have to create fire-breathing dragons. Oh I also enjoy snowboarding and the sun.
Dominic Mudiayi
I was born in the D.R.Congo and I am a currently a third year student at the University of Lethbridge majoring in Biology. This is my first year with the U of L iGEM team, and so far my experiences have been exhilirating. I am in awe of the infinite possibilities in the emerging field of Synthetic biology and I am looking forward to an action packed year in lab!  Aside from school commitments, iGEM and a deep fascination for translation factors (namely EF-Tu), I thoroughly enjoy playing a quick game of chess and numerous sports; I am an avid long jumper on the University of Lethbridge Track and Field team.

Jun 20th~Jul 1st,
After having a meeting with our instructors and got an overview of the basics of synthetic biology. We did a survey of previous iGEM teams that got the Best Experimental Measurements award and read many papers. Base on the condition of our college and our expectation, we decided our project and create a schedule. Then we did some experiment technologies trainings, such as making gel, gel electrophoresis.

1.The construction of single enzyme carries.
To facilitate the overexpression of target genes, the four genes LinA, LinB, DhaA, and HheC were optimized, synthesized and cloned into the vector of PUC51 by Gene script Corporation. The resulting vector S1 contains gene fragments of LinA and LinB, while vector S2 contains gene fragments of DhaA and HheC.(Fig.1) After digestion using Xbal and Xhol, the four genes were cloned into a modified pBAD expression vector pOHC_00, respectively, resulting in the following four vectors, POHC_01 (LinA), POHC_02 (LinB), POHC_03 (DhaA), POHC_04 (HheC). E. coli strain DH5α was used as a host cell. (Fig.2) The isolated positive colonies were further confirmed by restriction digestion analysis.(Fig.3) Agarose gel showed cloning confirmation of the four target genes in pOHC plamid. Successful plasmid construction was confirmed by sequence analysis (Invitrogen).

Синтетическая биология является молодой наукой. В отличие от классической генной инженерии, в синтетической биологии важную роль играет научно-инженерный подход. Подобно тому как самолет собирается из готовых деталей и узлов конструкции, в синтетической биологии используются простейшие генетические блоки для конструирования новых комплексных систем с заданными функциями.  iGEM собирает эти генетические элементы в единую базу данных, об'ем которой за последние годы уже превысил 1000 элементов. Эти конструкционные блоки предоставляются в распоряжение всем участникам конкурса.
Команды участников работают над своими проектами в течение летних каникул. В начале ноября в Бостоне результаты работ будут представлены в финале конкурса iGEM, где лучшие работы будут награждены многочисленными призами в различных номинациях. Изначально конкурс был инициирован желанием использовать пустующие в летний период лаборатории университетов, а также дать студентам возможность начать работу в самостоятельных научных проектах на ранних этапах учебы в университете.

PCR of omega+zif268 with overhangs
We performed a PCR to take out our omega subunit plus zif268. We used the following recipe:
10 ul KAPA readymix
0.75 ul of hindIII (primer)
0.75 ul of wF+plLacO (primer)
1.2 ul template
12.3 ul water
The first steps of the PCR involved heating at 95* (for 5 minutes) and 98* (for 20 seconds). Annealing temperature was 56*. Extension time was 30 seconds.
The product of the PCR should be 709 bps. It includes the omega subunit, zif268, as well as overlap sequences homologous to the selection plasmid.  We ran an e-gel to ensure that our desired product was present:
Gel purification of PCR product
We had to gel purify our PCR product in preparation for isothermal assembly, using our protocol for gel purification .  The result from running the gel can be seen below - we cut out the bands at 709 bp, the expected size of our product.
In the final step of the purification process, we eluted our DNA in buffer EB. We used the nanodrop spectophotometer to determine the concentration of DNA present.
The concentration was 54.3 ng/ul.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," possible to dramatically resolve the problem of overnight incubation. Because an initial sample from a patient is usually contaminated and has only a small concentration of the wanted bacteria, it is often impossible to detect any antibiotic-resistance without purification and amplification through overnight incubation. But because species-specific quorum sensing involves biochemical that are highly specific, and the quorum sensing chemicals are not affected as much by the contamination, the method utilizing quorum sensing might be applied with relatively less purification processes. Also, because some quorum sensing mechanisms have built in positive feedback, with the right engineering, the mechanism could work with only a little amplification process.
More innovative detection methods such as quantitative PCR(qPCR) or microarrays, and advanced molecular detection (AMD) are based on accumulated previous data and, thus, render very accurate results, but they require complicated procedures and heavy equipment. On the other hand, this quorum sensing-based detection method will provide benefits to patients with handy procedure and quicker detection results. We believe quicker and easy detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will lead to better containment of such dangerous bacterial strains.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project#Chemotaxis#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"otaxis pathway in single cell is very important, as it will help us to determine, with certain numbers of chemoreceptors, the threshold of chemoattractant concentration where the bacterium is able to detect and the saturation level of chemoattractant where the all the receptors on the bacterium are occupies.  A it is believed that the auxin should be kept at a very close region around the root (0.25 cm [4]), therefore it is very important to obtain the number of chemoreceptors needed on individual bacterium that enables the it to stay close to the plant root/seed from modeling.
In addition, modeling of chemotaxis of bacteria population is also valuable for us to capture the overview of movement of bacteria around the plant root; therefore it can potentially inform our project about how and where we can place our bacteria.  Under experiment condition, the chemoattractant diffuses all the time from the source. However, in real soil, the root produces malate all the time, therefore we assume that the distribution of chemoattractant outside the root is steady and time-independent. Hence, the modeling of bacteria population chemotaxis will be built with different patterns of chemoattractant distributions.
Chemotaxis Pathway
The chemotaxis pathway in E.Coli is demonstrated in Figure 1. MCPs form stable ternary complexes with the CheA and CheW proteins to generate signals that control the direction of rotation of the flagellar motors [5].  The signaling currency is in the form of phosphoryl groups (p), made available to the CheY and CheB effector proteins through autophosphorylation of CheA[1].CheY-p initiates flagellar responses by interacting with the motor to enance the probability of ‘run’ [1]. CheB-p is part of a sensory adaptation circuit that terminates motor responses [1]. MCP complexes have two alternative CheA autokinase activity; When the receptor is not occupied by chemoattractant, the receptor stimulates CheA activity [1]. The overall flux of phosphoryl groups to inhibited and stimulated states. Changes in attractant concentration shift this distribution, triggering a flagellar response [1]. The ensuing changes in CheB phosphorylation state alter its methylesterase activity, producing a net change in MCP methylation state that cancels the stimulus signal [1]. Therefore, studying of methylation level, phosphorylation level of CheB and CheY are important to understand chemotaxis of single cell.

amilGFP with LVA degradation tag is a new BioBrick part of our design. This BioBrick part will be used as a good reporter for its strong yellow color, fluorescence, and short lifetime, which enables intuitive understanding and real-time measurement of gene expression at the same time.
LVA degradation tag
C-termini of almost all the proteins in the clock device (luxI, tetR, aiiA, mCherry, and amilGFP) have LVA degradation tag for rapid degradation [2]. Rapid degradation of components of feedback loops may cause rapid change of gene expression, which  keeps “clock hand” small. Reporter genes should have short half-lives to visualize real-time changes of gene expression. LuxR has no degradation tag, since clock device needs constant expression of LuxR.
UV reset device
Feedback loops of genetic circuit are not sufficient to generate one directional movement of mCherry “clock hand” along an E. coli circle. If you had only feedback loops, after adding AHL at one point of the circle to start the Clock, you will get two-way movement, which will soon disappear by collision of two “clock hands”.
To turn this two-way movement to one-way, we need to make some part of a circle unresponsive before starting the clock. UV reset device was included in the clock device for this purpose. UV reset device contains UV sensor (UV-susceptible cI repressor and the phage lambda PR promoter and suppressors (Fig. 15). )
Figure 15
UV reset device makes the “unresponsive period” in response to exposure to UV. The detailed mechanism is as follows (Fig. 16)
0, cI repressors are constitutively expressed.
1, UV induces cleavage (inactivation) of cI repressor.
2, phage lambda PR promoter is derepressed.
3, suppressors are expressed, which makes unresponsive period.
Figure 16 UV reset device. UV induces suppressors to make unresponsive state.
UV treatment induces unresponsive period and AHL generate clock hand. One-way movement is generated when UV treatment was next to the point of AHL induction when you start the clock (Fig. 17).

STE12 system is original in yeast genome and in our construct we have a positive feedback which can start up the STE12 production and later binding with our promoter to start our enzyme secretion.
After constructs build, we put plasmids in yeast cell and using alpha factor to start the enzyme secretion. This medium will be sent into our paper making process and proved it has the ability to deink.

Figure 3 is we using different medium to replace chemical agent in deinking process. This is the paper product after pressing and scanning. From left to right is PBS, Non-induced medium, induced medium.
Proof of concept
To proof our concept we first built up three construct and transform constructs into yeast. After that, we use alpha factor to induce the enzyme secretion. This medium will be sent into our paper making process. We use the manufacturing process but replace chemical agent with our medium. What we see is a dramatic difference from our medium and control. The gray scale of PBS only is 235 and noninduce medium is 237. However, when induced medium put into our process the gray scale turns to 243. Gray scale is from 0-255, as the number goes up it means the whiter the paper is. You can see figure 2, paper which use our enzyme to deink is whiter than other sample.
Future work
This year we didn’t finish our project by using light to trigger our system. Instead, we using alpha factor to start the enzyme secretion. In future, we will finish this section of experiment. Furthermore, we want to develop an eco-friendly ink which fit to our device and make deinking more easily. Nevertheless, we want to grow the seed in public’s mind that saving nature is worth costing. That is why we are doing promotion and education."

Using this feedback, they tailored Next-Vivo towards education-related use by the general public. For example, one high school teacher suggested an experiment with more tangible results. Lethbridge iGEM took his advice when designing their education kit. When transcription and transformation occur correctly during the experiment, students can see fluorescence and smell a wintergreen scent. Later, when the project was in development, students suggested ways to make the experiment clearer, such as captions for graphics.

Ethics on clinical trial of MSCs therapy
After we carried out an interview with doctors and patients, we found out there were some ethic issues between researchers and patients.
To our surprise, we found that some doctors were worried that on hearing the very term ‘Experiment’, patients might choose to get treated elsewhere, and some thought that there was not enough time to explain details to patients. So, some investigators may shorten the consent form or deliberately omit some ‘offensive’ parts that might deter patients from agreeing to participate.
However, though written consent forms are used to document the consent, the process of informed consent is more important than a subject’s signature on the form.
Therefore, we hold the view that investigators must take particular care to be sure that anyone they ask to consider taking part in research is given the fullest possible information, presented in terms and a form that they can understand. This must include any information about possible benefits and risks; evidence that a research ethics committee has given approval; and advice that they can withdraw at any time. They should also ensure that participants have the opportunity to read and consider the research information leaflet and allow them sufficient time to reflect on the implications of participating in the study. Moreover, researchers cannot put pressure on anyone to take part in research.
For clearer understanding, we then turned to Professor Zhang , the head of Biological Treatment Center of The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, for more information.
Specifically, when it turns to the clinical trail of MSCs therapy, according to professor Zhang, researchers must concern three essential principles. First of all, the whole cell therapy industry must be self-discipline. Secondary, we researchers are obliged to offer as much as information about clinical trial to patients and let them choose their preferred treatment by themselves. Last but not least, the whole treatment should be well regulated by related government department, such as CFDA.
In conclusion, no matter what clinical trial we are carrying out, three principles should be received great concern: autonomy, beneficence and justice , not"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and"

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2017,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"afety Sharing (11 AUG 2017)
DIYBio HK shared with us their safety protocol, biosafety practice in their lab as well as the recent situation and regulations on genetically modified organisms in Hong Kong. We gain precious inspirations from the talk on biosafety and we realized that regulations in Hong Kong need to be improved. Meeting with all other local iGEM teams, we had nice communications on difficulties we are facing respectively and gave each other suggestions.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

In the  preferences menu, you can set a number of options that affect various core  Clotho components.  Many of these  options are used to specify the default locations for files used by other  connections, but a few are used to change the behavior of these connections; we  will come back to these later.  Now,  look under the ""Look and Feel Settings"" and select 'Office Blue 2007'  from the Default Skin drop down menu - this sets it as teh default skin that  Clotho will load up with.  Now hit the ""Apply Changes"" button at the bottom of the Preferences window, and  select 'Yes' when it asks if you want to overwrite the old preferences  file.  (You can also change the skin  just for this session at any time in the Options menu of the main toolbar,  under ""Set Skin"").  You should  be looking at the main toolbar again, with a new look and feel.

Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#PROJECT#biosynthesis#violacein_-_-_TEXT.html," makes the violacein pigment a very good candidate for further research and industrial production. In addition to potential medical applications, violacein is also used as a natural purple dye.
Violacein biosynthetic pathway
Genes for violacein biosynthesis (scheme below) are arranged in an operon consisting of vioA, vioB, vioC, vioD and vioE. VioA is an FAD dependent L-tryptophan oxidase, which generates an IPA imine. The latter is a substrate for VioB, a hemoprotein oxidase, which converts the IPA imine into a dimer. VioE is a key enzyme in the violacein biosynthetic pathway that acts by converting the IPA imine dimer to intermediates, which can be taken over by VioD and VioC. VioD and VioC are FAD dependent monooxygenases that hydroxylate these compounds to form violacein and deoxyviolacein. The genes coding for the five enzymes of the violacein biosynthetic pathway have already been succesfully expressed in E.Coli. In E.Coli an additional side reaction occurs, producing a green pigment called deoxychromoviridans, which is produced before the action of VioD and VioC.  We aimed to link all violacein biosynthetic enzymes into an arranged pathway assembled along the program DNA with the goal to increase the yield of the desired product.
The violacein biosynthetic pathway (Balibar and Walsh, 2006). Enzyme-catalysed biosynthetic transformation of tryptophan into violacein is shown. The purple line indicates the desired biosynthetic flux, which we aimed to achieve by introduction of a DNA program into the cells that produce chimeric biosynthetic enzymes linked to different zinc fingers. This reaction pathway should favor violacein synthesis over the side reaction leading to deoxychromoviridans.
Design of a DNA-guided biosynthetic pathway
We designed five fusion proteins by combining different zinc fingers and appropriate violacein biosynthetic enzymes. Since we wanted to create an in vivo system for violacein production, we expressed them in E. coli. Our goal was to show improvement of violacein biosynthesis by DNA program (scaffold) for which we predicted it would increase the proximity of fusion proteins and arrange their order according to the biosynthetic order of reactions. To demonstrate the significance of corect order of biosynthetic"

Project description
While low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism.
In terms of fat storage, conversion of carbohydrates or protein into fat uses ten times more calories of energy than simply storing fat in a fat cell. This brought us attention to one method of burning calories - increase energy expenditure by converting fat into glucose. However, mammals cannot convert fatty acids into carbohydrate due to lack of glyoxylate enzymes, while plants and bacteria can. We envision to introduce glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells and create an artificial futile cycle.
While the consequence of introducing nonnative cycle unknown, Dean et al. at UCLA recently has introduced glyoxylate shunt into mammalian liver cell to investigate fatty acid metabolism (2009). They observed that although fatty acids could not be converted into glucose in normal mammalian cells, human hepatocytes expressing the glyoxylate shunt have increased fatty acid oxidation and mice expressing the shunt were resistance to diet-induced obesity.
In addition to introducing a constitutive glyoxylate shunt, our team plans to elaborate the UCLA study by introducing inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. This inducible system prevents the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while greater fatty acid uptake at high circulating concentrations can be facilitated. Fatty acids uptake will be quantified to compare the activities in wild type cells and cells expressing constitutive and inducible glyoxylate shunt.
We believe the introduction of an inducible glyoxylate shunt will serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cell that increases energy expenditure responding to high circulating fatty acid levels. This will help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers.
