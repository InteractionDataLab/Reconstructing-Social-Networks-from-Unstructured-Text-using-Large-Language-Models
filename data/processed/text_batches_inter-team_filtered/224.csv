Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," that Cerberus brought them some competitiveness regarding the price of their products which means that the cost of this new technology should be competitive regarding the one it replaces. Alternatively, the use of state-of-the-art approaches and/or innovation issued from Cerberus could be an asset for the manufacturer that could accept higher cost to label its products “issued from biotechnology”.
iGEM Toulouse
This is us! For sure, developing our business will be a terrific opportunity with lot to learn in term of management and hopefully, with nice incomes. In term of autonomy, we will clearly be dependant on our clients (the manufacturers) and our sub-contracters (see the Entrepreneurship part ).
Environment
Ecological consequences are maybe the most difficult to predict. Our Cerberus platform is a protein , which should not be problematic, but for the unnatural amino acid AzF. Here, the molecule is of too recent a use to know what to expect. The same questioning occurs for the functions associated with Cerberus, especially the inorganic ones. We can suppose that if there should be a problem, they will be related to the scale of use/production of Cerberus. As a rupture technology, there could also be the impact of removing the previous technology. Less pollutant or less toxic approaches could be beneficial to the environment.
Recycling
Sustainability is a much though-for feature. Ideally, Cerberus should be recollected from used goods to be reincorporated in new one. This could prove to be complex (or easy), depending on the strength of association and accessibility in the fabrics. Besides, this could require complex steps incompatible with the recycling interest.
Experts
If we think of Cerberus as a technology to create new materials, its usefulness goes beyond functionalised cellulose. Therefore, Cerberus can also be of interest in the scientific field to develop new applications. This incidentally raises the question of accessibility. If Cerberus is accessible to all (as any biobrick from the iGEM registry), some of its application could be protected by patents, especially if this is the heart of our business. This could create conflicts and will require professional lawyer to define the boundaries of what is public or not. Another aspect is that such effort as Cerberus could democratize the use of biotechnology-sourced products with the general public and facilitate the acceptation of other products.
Media
Cerberus could be of interest for the media and so participate to biotechnology acceptation. This could make people curious or eager about what future biotechnology could bring them. In the downside,"

Desertification
Soil erosion and desertification are world-wide problems. They lead to loss of arable land, economic hardship and environmental degradation. Our project focuses on tackling these serious problems by engineering bacteria to enhance plant root growth. We are planning to implement our bacteria into a seed coat to aid re-vegetation of land at risk of erosion. Trees and plants help hold down the soil and prevent soil erosion which leads to desertification
Desertification is the degradation of drylands which include arid, semi-arid and sub-humid areas. Drylands make up roughly 40 percent of the Earth’s land and are home to some two billion people, most of which live in developing countries. Dryland soil sustains a fragile ecosystem adapted to infrequent precipitation and dramatic temperature changes. Over-exploitation of dryland for cultivation and feedstock purposes renders the soil unproductive, forcing migration of communities in search of fertile land, leaving the unproductive land bare and vulnerable to erosive forces. A lack of food supply in many developing countries forces constant cultivation of land for short-term gain as well as deforestation to provide arable land.
Case studies
Desertification
Mouse over the map to read about the impact of desertification in different areas.
Downstream Effects
Soil erosion affects the climate and biodiversity and often leads to irreversible desertification (Figure 1). Roots increase the stability of soil and prevent erosion[7]. In addition, trees provide cover and protect nearby fauna and flora. In areas prone to soil erosion, this is especially important as rainfall tends to be rare but when it does occur, it is often very intense and easily leads to topsoil being washed away.
Roots are also important carbon sinks. Increasing root biomass is therefore very likely to improve the carbon budget of the plants we are seeding ( Dr Alexandru Milcu, oral communication ).

Biotalks: we want to show people how science is used by successful undergraduate students.
In our campus, we have some friends that went to Mitacs for a summer and made great investigation projects. Mitacs is a national, not-for-profit organization that has designed and delivered research programs in Canada for 19 years. Here, students spend 12 weeks of their summer working with a Ph.D. in the lab helping them develop a project. We want to give a space for 4 students from our college that attended to Mitcas to present what they did and how they achieved their goals on 12 weeks.
As well, we wanted to include projects from other universities, therefore, we looked for 2 students from the Autonomous University of Chihuahua that had great projects related to Biotechnology Engineering.
The objective with these biotalks is that each participant presents their work in order to inspire the community to approach to science.
iGEM Presentation: here, we will be able to talk about synthetic biology and how we used it to get to our final project proposal. We want people to discover new things and that they understand what is behind this new technology.
Lunchtime: we invite the meal, Tec-Chihuahua and SAIBT cooperated and we will be giving free tacos for our attendees.
Conference 2: for our second conference, we decided to bring the Ph.D. Gerardo Armando Aguado Santacruz, biofertilizer expert from Celaya, Guanajuato, Mexico that has plenty of experience working with genetic manipulation. Some of the skills and expertise he has are cell culture, environment, plant physiology, soil fertility, crop production, plant molecular biology, among many others.
Closure: we will thank everyone that was present in our event and we will make the invitation to the networking area in order to create relationships between experts and alumni.

Since SFLS team and us both used the S30 cell-free system in our projects, so we assisted each other on different aspects. Our team helped SFLS team to validate the viability of gene expression in S30 cell-free system. Here is a link to their collaboration page: https://2016.igem.org/Team:Shenzhen_SFLS/Collaborations
Here is an abstract from SFLS team:
Team BGIC China>>Us
Team BGIC China were working on a programmable and open-source Next Generation Bio-Chip (NGBC) which allows user with knowledge in synthetic biology to easily re-program and re-construct it in order to make new bio-chips with different functions. They based their NGBC on E. coli S30 Extract System for Circular DNA(Promega), the same with ours. They also utilized enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ) as one of their reporter gene. So they helped us to test whether S30 system was qualified as a platform for translation of enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ). Here is their result.
The blue liquid in the small eppendorf is the S30 system with gene circuit coding enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ) and its substrates, X-gal, after hours of reaction.
It qualitatively proved that our S30 cell-free system works well.
Fig.1 Test result in S30 cell-free system
We also tested this with a different reporter gene, luciferase. Check our results in the “Proof of Concept” section of our wiki.

While the waste produced from the cultures will be a fraction of the global output, it is necessary to preserve limited resources. By measuring cultures with our diagnostic technology, scientists will incur fewer errors from solely human observation, resulting in the production of less biohazardous waste. Often in lab, trials are repeated due to calculation errors or imprecise readings. Our computer simulation will also improve accuracy and reduce the time in the lab analyzing the cultures or repeating trials. With the information stored online, sharing data will be more feasible and thus promote a global education and awareness of the Violacein Pathway.
Is this commercially feasible?
Once commercialized,this system will be able to be downloaded onto computers for easy access. Licenses have the potential to be sold online or instore. By selling our product online, we would increase the overall net profit as less money is spent on the assets required to manufacture the software via CD. By allowing online downloads, we would also reduce carbon emissions that would be produced in the manufacturing and delivery of the product to consumers.
What is the effect of an increased electrical output?
Laboratories consume on average between thirty and one hundred kilowatt hours of electricity per square foot. However, if our system averages 100 kW of power for one hour, it will only consume 0.1 kWh per day (""Managing Energy Costs in Laboratories""). Taking into consideration the other devices used in synthetic biology labs, our diagnostic technology is an energy efficient option. It is also important to consider the amount of resources used to create the cultures, such as electricity for the laboratory, microwave, and other devices necessary to produce L-tryptophan. If our system reduces the need for repeated trials, it is the most cost effective and eco-friendly approach on the market.
How much would it cost to produce?
Not only is our system orders of magnitude cheaper than most commercial bioreactors, taking into account it may cost $0.10 per kWh, it would cost the laboratory $3.65 annually (""Managing Costs in Laboratories""). Considering most lab equipment and electrical bills, this is not only energy efficient but a cost effective solution to repeating trials.
Would this take the position of workers in the lab?
This would not affect the labor required in the lab, but would potentially save time for each worker. Fewer trials would be repeated, but not to the extent that someone would be laid-off. This is assuming that the initial analysis of cultures is mostly accurate.

Figure 1. Rendering of bacteria connected to DNA arms through zinc fingers expressed superficially.
Figure 2 shows relative free energy against arm length. As expected, the longer the arms, the lower is the free energy, and thus the higher is the bonding probability.
Figure 2.Effect of arm length on free energy for a constant zinc finger surface distribution.
Figure 3 shows relative free energy against arm length, where the distribution of zinc fingers is randomized. We notice that the distribution of the zinc fingers plays a very important role in the binding as shown in the figure where the distribution is varied randomly, but the trend is more and less the same as when the distribution is assumed to be deterministic.

I.4) Conclusion
The bead approximation and thermodynamic information theoretical framework we proposed effectively captures the challenge of modeling binding probability where different DNA strands compete in binding with a multitude of zinc fingers. The model takes into account the geometry and charge magnitude distribution on the bacteria and the DNA strands.

Figure 7.  These  curves compare fusion proteins’ performance with normal cutinase in different concentration. We can see that the fusion protein Cut1-sJanus-m perform  much better when concentration are over 1mg/ml.
We also conduct our experiments in different pH by using different Tris-HCl. Just as picture shows, the activity of our fusion protein doesn’t change a lot in different pH which is similar with Thc_Cut1.
Figure 8. These two proteins are stable when pH changes, especially when pH is between 6.0 and 9.0. And the concentration of Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut1-sJanus-m are 0.2mg/ml.
We drew a curve about detect time and compared it with Thc_Cut1, we can see the hydrolysis rate rose sharply after 5h,while Thc_Cut1 still in the low level. Which represent our Janus works well!
And our fusion protein does improve a lot!
Figure 9. We detect absorbance of liquid every 3h, red line refers to our fusion protein, and the blue line is former enzyme. The performance of cutinase are highly improved when fuse to the sJanus-m.
Figure 10 &11. The picture shows 5mg/ml enzyme have react with one piece of plastic（3*3*0.25mm）for 3h, before and after centrifugation. We can see clearly in the pic. After 3hs the tube of Thc_Cut1-sJanus-m had much more sediment than Thc_Cut1.
Conclusion
What we solved?
1.   We successfully expressed cutinase (Fsc, Cut1) in E.coli.
2.   We structured fusion protein connecting Cut1 with sJanus-m, and expressed it successfully in E.coli, which has extraordinary performance as our data shows.
3.   We successfully find out optimal conditions (pH, temperature, concentration) of PET hydrolysis by cutinase(Cut1,FsC). 
4.   We use different mix method to verify our Janus (sJanus&inJanus) can promote hydrolysis rate. And we confirmed the best way is incubating PET with Janus before hydrolysis.
5.   We found out after incubation, sJanus usually performed better than inJanus. 
What we unsolved?

An overview of the OSH evolution cycle. In a viral license system, the license is the same in each cycle.
The advantages of OSH:
The core values reflect the power of collaboration in troubleshooting and improving designs.
Improvements are shared to all users of the hardware, and it can remain freely available forever.
Scientific experiments have different requirements in terms of software and hardware. OSH can address the need for low-volume production of equipment that can be tailored to specific protocols [2].
The OSH revolution extends much further than scientific hardware, and is fully compatible with a commercial business plan. Universally, it has the potential for “market expansion, innovation, acceleration, educational enhancement and medical care improvement” [2].
OSH is “free as in free speech, not free beer” or more formally Libre rather than Gratis [3]. For example, the Arduino microcontroller*  designs are freely available online but the foundation also sells them for a profit for funding. Arduino is registered as a trademark too, which protects the brand from cheap, low-quality replicas [4].
* According to arduino.cc “Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software”.  In our project, we use Arduinos to control servo motors and LEDs within the microscope.

Copyleft or Viral Licenses
The Copyleft logo. The term was coined by Richard Stallman.
The phenomenon of OSH is in its infancy, and as a result there are only a handful of potential options when choosing an appropriate license. Many of these are Copyleft or ‘viral’ licenses. The principles of Copyleft were developed in the context of Open-Source Software (OSS). A well-established example of a Copyleft OSS licenses is the GNU GPL ,"

E. coli that glows in adequacy of NO3- - at a glance
A. E. coli engineered with BBa_K381001 functions as a nitrate biosensor. High concentrations of NO3- activates the promoter PyeaR and increases the expression of GFP.
B. The nitrate sensing promoter BBa_K381001 can detect a gradient of NO3- concentrations and its activities were reported in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU).
Nitrate is an essential nutrient which plays multiple roles in plant growth and reproduction.
This biosensor BBa_K381001 monitors NO3- concentration.
Activity of NO3- sensing promoter ( BBa_K216005 ) was re-characterized to further investigate on the behavior of it.
An effort to make iGEM a better community
Nitrate is an essential nutrient which plays multiple roles in plant growth and reproduction. For example, it provides nitrogen that plants need for producing amino acids and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Also, it is a component of chlorophyll and is therefore essential for photosynthesis.
PyeaR is first characterized and BioBricked by Edinburgh 2009 iGEM team and then further characterized by BCCS-Bristol 2010 iGEM team. To provide more characterization data on such a devices, we further characterize this promoter.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) detects environmental nitrate by the yeaR-yoaG operon. According to Figure 1, PyeaR (Lin, et al., 2007) is regulated by the Nar two-component regulatory system (Nohno et al., 1989; Li et al., 198"

Why co-cultures suit space exploration better than monocultures.
Bioproduction generally offers a much needed method of production in space that could lower the requirements to spacecraft cargo, both in terms of diversity and volume, allowing for longer and more elaborate space mission. Basically, the more you can produce in space from extraterrestrial resources, the less you have to bring with you. For instance, bioproduction and synthetic biology could be used to produce fuel, medicine, plastic, food and nutritional supplements from very scarce or simple resources like sunlight and CO2. However, bioproduction comes with a cost, modern production facilities utilizing monocultures often require large and costly equipments which are simply impractical to bring along with you in space. Furthermore, one would have to bring several bioreactors to allow for continuous production.
 
By utilizing two organisms instead of one, we envision that astronauts can use a single bioreactor to produce a plethora of useful end products, either in parallel or one after the other. The ultimate goal being to reduce the amount of tools a space pioneer would need to bring along with him or her to facilitate biological based production, and, at the same time, enabling space pioneers to produce any goods needed, when needed. We envision, a cartridge-based system where astronauts use a closed system of containers with the described compartments inside (Fig. 4), the compartments are made switchable to allow for easy extraction and change of manufacturer-strain.
----------”Cartridges”-----------
Figure 4: Closed system of two compartments for co-culturing in space.
 
Providing a feedstock for bacillus - Making of the provider strain.
In principle, our co-culture design (fig. 3) relies on there being a “provider”, and a “manufacturer” that thrives in the feedstock/environment supplemented by biproducts of the provider’s metabolic activity. We utilized Synechococcus of the cyanobacteria phylum as a provider, because of its photosynthetic ability and tendency to accumulate sucrose in its intracellular environment in response to osmotic stress (REF 1).
 
However, the bacteria lacks a way to export the sucrose to the surrounding media. To fully utilize the accumulated sucrose we therefore relied on previous research in rerouting metabolic carbon fluxes to the extracellular space. This work was done by Daniel Ducat at Harvard Medical school in the lab of Pamela Silver where PCC7942 was transformed with  the cscB sucrose/proton symporter from E.coli (REF 2). To accelerate our mission we utilized"

Sometimes they need an assistant to do the practical work and so they do not need to provide replacements. They always need intensive advices before choosing a module.”
iGEM Marburg 2018: ”Are there special features that must be taken into account during the application procedure for students with visual impairment?""
Dr. Brandis Heep: “The application procedure is the same but in our experience the students get in touch with us before they start as a student at the faculty of biology. We talk about their disability and the possibilities we can offer. This gives us the opportunity for individual arrangements. For example, the lecturer can give them the PowerPoint slides, so they can follow the lecture on their laptops.”
The fact, that some students with visual impairment successfully completed their biology studies has strengthen our motivation to bring science closer to pupils of the Blista School. In a conversation with a student of the Blista School, he told us that he sometimes thinks about breaking up the high school diploma because he thought there was no way for him to study biology. He told us that he is very interested in science and especially in microbiology. However, after we told him about our conversation with Dr. Brandis-Heep and he had worked with us in the lab for one day, he gained new courage, that graduating and finding a job in this field is possible for him. It made us very happy that we were able to show people new ways to realize their dream.
We are very thankful that Dr. Brandis-Heep gave us the opportunity to ask these questions and supported us with our human practices project.
Interview with our PI Gert Bange
For several years, our PI Prof. Dr. Gert Bange mentors the iGEM Teams of Marburg. In Marburg, he is known as one of the pioneers in including students with visual impairment in scientific research. We used the opportunity to talk to him and could benefit from his experience in cooperation with visually impaired students. He told us, that he had visual impaired students working on their own project in his department. We had many questions to ask about daily lab situations.
One of our questions was, if this student was focused on doing bioinformatics or if he also did practical work in the lab. Prof. Dr. Gert Bange said that he was performing practical experiments like everyone else in his lab. We told him that some people are precarious if visual impaired students are able to work in a laboratory where they are confronted with many chemicals and different sources of"

Tijdens onze brainstormsessie zijn een hele stapels ideëen naar voren gekomen, sommige zijn niet verder gekomen dan een idee en andere hadden al een hele vorm.  Hieronder zijn zo de vier ideëen die we het meest interessant vonden neergezet plus alle informatie die we daarbij hadden gevonden of konden vinden en de ideëen erover. Daaronder hebben we de ideëen neergezet die minder interessant waren of waar we niet echt veel verder mee kwamen, maar misschien heeft iemand anders hier een idee voor. Alle ideëen zijn natuurlijk vrij aanpasbaar, als een idee van ons ervoor zorgt dat je een ander idee krijgt is dat natuurlijk alleen maar mooi ☺
Meest interessante ideëen
Bacterie sensor Deze bacterie zou een aantal dingen kunnen meten zoals bijvoorbeeld suikerconcentratie en insulineconcentratie. Het doel is dan om deze informatie via een soort ‘thuisbasis’ door te kunnen sturen naar een pc of laptop. Op deze manier kan je continue meten wat de concentratie is in plaats van een momentopname met de huidige sensoren. Andere mogelijkheden zijn om deze informatie tijdelijk op te slaan in"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Detection_-_-_TEXT.html,"in can both be separated by liquid chromatography, which separates molecules in a liquid mobile phase, as they pass over a solid stationary media in a column. Molecules bind to or elute off the column based on their differing physical properties; including electronegativity, polarity, hydrophobicity, or size. Different detection methods (eg. mass spectroscopy, fluorescence detection, UV/Visible light spectroscopy) can then be coupled to the HPLC, to analyze the compounds that were separated from the original solution. The reversed phase liquid chromatography column, used in our method has a non-polar stationary phase, and polar mobile phase, which causes polar molecules to elute before non-polar compounds. Initial preparative steps removed large contaminants from the sample, such as the cell membranes or organelles, which can clog and damage the columns.
As there are many different metabolites produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, it is important to have an idea of the chemical properties and mass of the target compound. Tyrocidine is an amphiphilic, cyclic peptide naturally produced by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) in Bacillus brevis, with antimicrobial properties against gram-positive bacteria [1]. It functions by disrupting cell membranes, which explains its broad efficacy, but it has been shown to have hemolytic activity [2], making it unsuitable for intravenous use. Tyrocidine has been reported in the literature to have 5 main forms with the general peptide sequence of …D-Phe1/Tyr1 – Pro2 – Phe3/Trp3/Tyr3 – D-Phe4/D-Trp4/D-Tyr4­ – Asn5 – Gln6/Asp6 – Val8 – Orn9 – Leu10… [3]

Micro-compartment
A Nano-Bioreactor inside a Bacterial Cell
The inner structure of bacteria could be quite complicated, despite its small size. The organization of the bacterial cell is a crucial element in the function of biosynthetic and metabolic pathways. It has been documented that bacteria can also have compartmentalization, known as bacterial microcompartments (MCP).
Bacterial MCP, unlike the lipid vesicular organelles of eukaryotes, are formed by proteins, enclosing enzymes and cofactors for carbon fixation or various forms of fermentative metabolism. A prominent example of bacterial microcompartment is the caryboxysome, which packages the enzyme ribulose bis-phosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCo) by forming polyhedral bodies with a diameter of 80-140 nm. Similar microcompartments build from related shell-forming proteins, the eut and pdu organelles, also package enzymes involved in metabolic reactions.
EUT Microcompartment
Both recombinant Salmonella enterica ethanolamine utilization (Eut) and propanediol utilization (Pdu) bacterial MCPs can be expressed heterologously in E.coli, with and without the associated interior enzymes. Noticing Team from the University of Minnesota in 2010 successfully cloned the Eut shell protein genes: EutS, M, N, L, K from Salmonella enterica LT2 and expressed in E. coli. We chose to work based on their contribution and utilize the Eut MCP biobrick they submitted ( BBa_K311004 ).
Localizing PPK1 into MCP
It had been demonstrated that signal sequences at the N-terminus of MCP associated enzymes are capable of causing their compartmental"

Human Practices
Synthetic Biology is a field that combines concepts and methods from a variety of scientific areas. This inherent inter-departmental attitude is what drives the innovation in synbio research. As a diverse group of students (with backgrounds in everything from physics to biology to computer science) this idea was central to our work as a team this summer. It was therefore important that we shared the concepts of synthetic biology with the greater Boston community to gather ideas from many different scientific perspectives and to share the spirit of collaboration with our neighbors.
We decided to reach out to our community with a basic two-week synthetic biology class and by collaborating with other iGEM teams to help them in their projects. Our goals for the class were not just to teach the basic laboratory techniques to those who wanted to learn, but to emphasize the diversity of the field, and the problems and possibilities that exist within synbio today. The most important part of the class, however, was to encourage excitement and new ideas about synthetic biology in as many different people as possible not necessarily associated with biology or engineering.
We posted materials to the official stellar site , but our daily plan and protocols were organized on our openwetware page .
Splash 2011
To expand outreach of synthetic biology to secondary and middle school students, we are holding a class in the coming month introducing young students to the wide range of possibilities of synthetic biology. Our class will be focused on very basic circuit designs to illustrate how building more complex circuits can lead to higher-level behavior and function. Here's a link to our class description: Splash! 2011 .
The Class
In an effort to introduce our fellow Bostonians to the world of synthetic biology, we wrote the curriculum and taught a two-week class for any person from any background with interest in getting their feet wet in basic synthetic biology. Thanks to generous donations from EMD-Millipore and New England Biolabs and support from the Chemical Engineering, Biological Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Departments at MIT, we were able to budget twelve students to each have their own mini synthetic biology projects. The Knight Lab at MIT was kind enough to let us use their labspace. We had a number of applications for the class, and accepted a wide array of students including"

Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

0. Overview
We have two major contributions for our entrepreneurship section. First, we have written a business plan. In this plan, we assess the prospects of a firm using our biotINK bioprinting technology . To gain in-depth industry insights we interviewed experts and possible collaboration partners.
The second contribution is our Supporting Entrepreneurship study. In this study we identify factors that enable iGEM teams to found a new company. We derived the driving factors from several interviews and conducted a large-scale online survey among former and this year’s iGEM participants. The interviews enabled us to understand the causal relationships and we applied a statistical model to analyze the survey results. Both helps us to understand and quantify what differentiates teams that founded a start-up from non-founders. We merged our findings and developed a set of advices on how the iGEM community can improve the transfer from promising projects to viable ventures.
During our project, we pursued a twofold strategy that incorporates both approaches mentioned above. On the one hand, from the beginning of our wet lab work we aimed on getting a prototype to work. With a functioning prototype for the Giant Jamboree, we successfully proved our concept of our 3D-tissue printing method. We put a main emphasis on developing a working prototype to be able to discuss the potential of a new venture with investors after the iGEM competition. Together with the comprehensive business plan that we present below we have a working technology as well as a viable business model. Both will help us to determine the viability of our project in a competitive industry environment.

Alexia Gendron is a simple 12th grader who spends her spare time perfecting recipes and playing piano. She enjoys reading, volunteering, good soup, Italian, and having insightful conversations. Although born in Calgary, Alberta, she was brought up in French, and attended a francophone school until her 10th grade. This has given her exposure to French-Canadian culture and taught her where to find it even if she finds herself a few provinces away from its origin. For five years she took karate and developed quite a fondness for martial arts. Despite having had to stop karate this year, she plans on starting to practice judo as soon as possible. After discovering Ronda Rousey, she found the very first person ever to move her so strongly, and she considers Rousey to be an inspiration. Right now, Alexia is focusing on the present, and is trying to enjoy her final year of high school before she graduates. Although she plans on attending university next year, she has yet to figure out exactly what she wants to study. She has always loved to learn all there is to learn and do all there is to do; she hopes to travel the world someday, meet fantastical people, and have a great collection of jaw-dropping stories to tell.

Early on we encountered some trouble with basic cloning procedures, like mistakes in primer design, suboptimal ligation protocols and poorly chosen E. coli strains. When team Oslo approached us for help with the cloning of two constructs, which they had some problems with and didn’t have the time to redo, we were happy to help. The idea was that we’d receive a PCR-product of the parts, do the cloning of the parts into the shipping vector and then send that off to the parts-registry, as well as back to them for characterization.  Unfortunately customes held up the shipping for so long that sending the parts back for characterization was out of the question. Also the primers used to amplify the part before restriction and ligation were constructed without keeping in mind, that the terminal restriction sites of both the BioBrick-prefix and BioBrick-suffix have to have at least 1 additional nucleotide at either sides for any activity of the restriction enzymes. That is true for all engineered PstI and EcoRI enzymes from NEB and Thermo Scientific. Thus the usual protocol would  not work.
We attempted cloning using the XbaI- and SpeI-sites. That had the obvious disadvantage of possibly recombining the wrong way around or the vector religating without an insert, since XbaI and SpeI share the same overhang (namely CTAG). However, if either of these unfortunate outcomes was to occur, the plasmid could not be digested with XbaI and SpeI anymore. That opened up an easy way to check for the correct insertion. This cloning was done and 16"

      To some extent, original repressilator can                                     exhibit a                                     wide range of dynamical features                                     but often with lower accuracy, especially obvious unsynchrony and phase drift. In                                     2016,                                     researchers modified the original one and rebuilt a triple reporter repressilator                                     without repressor degradation (E.coli proteaseΔclpXP strains) and with titration                                     sponge.                                     It was reported that cells could display macroscopic, population-scale oscillations                                     and                                     shew a typical 14 generation cyclic period without cell–cell communication. In other                                     words they can synchronize automatically in a liquid culture and maintain it after                                     proper (1mM) iPTG induction, which provides a theoretically feasible design to                                     combine the oscillating network with melatonin synthesis via TetR controlled promoter of key                                     enzyme COMT. Thus, in this part, we design a lot of experiments to verify the                                     repressilator basic properties in different conditions and try to acquire a more                                     precise                                     and regular oscillating pattern as the origin of the periodic signal.

Our survey was translated into 5 different languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese and German as we believed that this would help us reach a broader range of people and therefore provide us with more significant data.
Knowing the public perception in a novel  and sometimes controversial field such as synthetic biology will allow us to tackle some of the ethical questions and concerns raised by society in order to maintain the public legitimacy and support.
UCL Ethics
We have been working closely with UCL Ethics to make sure our project met the requirements set by our university regarding the safeguarding of rights, safety, dignity and well-being of research participants. All our interviews and video assays were approved by the UCL Chair of the Departamental Ethics Comitee. Previous to the interview the participants were informed about the nature of the research, the format of the questions they will be asked, their content, their rights, and how we would treat the information they provided us. Moreover, we distributed Information sheets and Consent forms to all participants to ensure that they provided fully consent before participating in the interviews.
Safety
Besides working on an effective biocontainment mechanism for our genetically modified probiotic strains we wanted to make sure that our team followed all the safety procedures and requirements in order to minimise any potential risks that our bacteria could represent to the environment and human-health.
Our team has strictly followed the safety guidelines set by iGEM as well as UCL Biochemical Engineering department. Before conducting any work in the lab all the team members received a Safety training by the UCL Biochemical Engineering Dept Biosafety Officer Dr Brian O’Sullivan. We have also checked that all the materials, probiotic and cell lines used fell into the iGEM White list as well as elaborate risk assessments for all the bacterial strains and hazardous materials used. We decided to Check in for approval both of the mammalian cell lines we worked with as they were classified as Risk 2 microorganisms. The Cell lines included:
Caco-2 Cell line from Human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells

The iGEM-Team Bielefeld aims at the assembly, production and immobilization of S-layer fusion proteins for the detection of BPA by a coupled enzymatic reaction. S-layers from five different organisms are employed. The provision of various S-layers with different geometries offers the possibility for the scientific community to create functional nanobiotechnological surfaces with simple and standardized methods, quasi do it yourself nanobiotechnology . First, different fusion proteins with fluorescent proteins and a luciferase are created. The functionality and efficiency of the immobilization to various materials such as silicon dioxide or cellulose is then characterized by measuring the fluorescence and luminescence, respectively.
Bisphenol A degradation
In 2005, Sasaki et al. isolated a soil bacterium from the Sphingomonas genus which is able to degrade the environmental poison bisphenol A (BPA) with a unique rate and efficiency compared to other BPA degrading organisms. This strain was called Sphingomonas bisphenolicum AO1 and is able to completely decompose 120 mg BPA L-1 in about 6 hours. Three genes which are responsible for the first step of the effective BPA degradation by S. bisphenolicum AO1 were identified: a cytochrome P450 (bisdB), a ferredoxin (bisdA) and a ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR) ( Sasaki et al., 2005b ). The bisdAB genes from S. bisphenolicum AO1 were isolated, transformed into and expressed in E. coli and enabled this bacterium to degrade BPA, too ( Sasaki et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, the BisdAB proteins from S. bisphenolicum AO1 were able to degrade BPA in a cell free system in which spinach reductase was added ( Sasaki et al., 2005b ). Therefore, we assume that the BisdAB proteins also work in a cell free system together with the ferredoxin-NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase from E. coli. The suggested reaction mechanism of the first BPA degradation step is shown in the project overview image above and in the animated picture of Figure 2.

These cells were plated out on agar plates with the correct AntiBiotic and grown overnight (37°C). From these, a 5ml liquid culture supplied with AB was prepared and also grown overnight at 37°C. Subsequently 1:100th was transfered to a new liquid culture containing AB and tyrosine (5mg/L or 50 mg/L) for the first 3 enzymes(Sam8, Sam5 and ComT, ), Ferulic acid (5mg/L or 50mg/L) for the second 2 enzymes (ech and fcs, ) And vanillin (5mg/L or 50 mg/L) to determine the degradation or transformation of vanillin by E.Coli. After certain time intervals ranging between 30 minutes and many hours samples (1-5ml) were taken and centrifuged at 13000RPM for 1 minute. The supernatant was then transfered to a new tube and placed in -20°C until it was ready for analysis. Analysis was done on HPLC (High pressure liquid chromatography) using a standard LB culture for blanco and the measurements from the experiments.

Project design
Our project design process started with literature search to find relevant information about the state-of-the-art strategy to engineer mavalonate pathway for sesquiterpene biosynthesis in E. coli.  The team then had brainstorming sessions to go over various ideas about how to implement the strategy in our project. Next, we moved on to detailed experimental design, where we also outlined goals that we wanted to ultimately accomplish.
Literature survey and brainstorming:
The 7-epi-sesquithujene is a natural sesquiterpene. Its biosynthesis as an efficient attractant of Emerald Ash Borer initially appeared to be no easy task. The team came across a research paper on the production of another sesquiterpene, amorphadiene (amorpha-4,11-diene), which is a precursor to the potent antimalarial drug artemisinin, through the engineering of the mevalonate pathway in E. coli (Martin et. al, 2003). The mevalonate pathway is native to S. cerevisiae, but not to E. coli. A second paper published by the same research group further examined the optimization of the mevalonate pathway in E. coli in order to increase the production of amorphadiene (Anthony et. al, 2009).  The first paper used a a two-plasmid system, where one plasmid supports the expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes and the second plasmid supports the expression of enzymes for the biosynthesis of FPP (farnesyl pyrophosphate) from mevalonate and its conversion to amorphadiene.  The second paper used a different two-plasmid system, which showed improve production of amorphadiene.  In this paper, the first plasmid encodes all the enzymes that are required for the biosynthesis  of FPP (Addgene, 100167), while the second plasmid (Addgene 100169) encodes the ADS (amorphadiene synthase) and mevalonate kinase, which was identified as the rate-limiting enzyme. The team decided to moved forward with the design in the second paper.  We obtained plasmid "

(d) The introduction of DMOAP andLiquid                                     crystal molecule.
We designed a liquid crystal cell as the observation carrier.First, we modify the slides so that                         they can induce vertical alignment of the liquid crystals, making the initial state of the                         optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell black; at the same time, we modify the slides so that                         they can be attached to the target protein; Then we add the sample to be tested and the antibody                         to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides are assembled, and then the liquid                         crystal is added. We can observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell under the                         microscope to judge the β2 of the detected sample. - MG concentration.
The surface of a plain glass slide substrate was decorated with the mixed self-assembled                         monolayers of N, N-dimethyl-N-octadecyl(3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilyl chloride (DMOAP) and                         (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTES) with both long and short alkane thiols (Fig. 7). DMOAP                         is used to induce vertical uniform orientation of liquid crystal molecules. The amino group in                         APTES reacts with an aldehyde group in GA to immobilize β2-MG as a functional molecule. When a                         certain concentration of β2-MG nanobody solution and different concentrations of the β2-MG                         antigen solution to be tested are sequentially added, the β-2-Microglobulin (β2-MG) immobilized                         on the slide is competitively combined with the β2-MG to be tested. The limited reaction site on                         the nanobody, after the substrate-bound β2-MG specifically binds to the β2-MG nanobody, the                         nanobody molecule has a certain spatial stereo structure and molecular size effect, which can                         disturb the orientation of the liquid crystal 5CB molecule. It is arranged in an oblique or                         nearly parallel manner. As the concentration of β2-MG to be measured in the sample changes, the                         amount of the nanobody bound to the substrate also changes, thereby changing the color and                         brightness of the liquid crystal film (Fig. 8) to achieve β2 - Specific detection of MG.

What makes iGEM special in comparison to other student programs and practical courses?
A huge difference is that students have the chance to work on their own. Moreover, they have the chance to develop a project on their own and work on it till the end of the competition. Furthermore the students can get in touch with local companies and learn how to ask for financial supports for their project. Especially in Aachen, the topic is chosen by the students hence the students have the chance to integrate project ideas, in which they are really interested. Students have the chance to learn everything on their own and make special experiences, which they could not get from other student initiatives or other practical courses. These differences make iGEM clearly a unique experience.
How do You evaluate the complexity of the iGEM competition (financial support, organisation, and public relations)?
Again very positive. Students have the chance to integrate their different interests and talents into the competition and into the project. Moreover it is great that students can work several months together on the same topic and work with students who are interested in very different subjects. Additionally, this is a good practice for their professional life.
Attracting funds and raising public awareness for the project is central to iGEM. Without the initiative of the students the presence of iGEM in Aachen and the special iGEM spirit would not be the same. The RWTH Aachen University and the FZJ support the iGEM team every year. The supporters of the iGEM team think that the “Bottom up” strategy, i.e., students first, fits best to Aachen. Because the students have the chance to develop their OWN project, obviously with support from the experts and institutes.
What do You think about this year’s iGEM team Aachen and its project ideas?
Super, you can talk about the topic with many different people, who are unfamiliar with synthetic biology and biotechnology. Everybody uses liquid washing detergents because of the absence of dusts and allergenic substances. Moreover, it is possible to explain the environmental problem caused by boric acid to the public and still present a very interesting topic in the field of synthetic biology. Photocaging is still a very new and innovative strategy to work with. So it is possible to break down the topic of synthetic biology into a problematic aspect of our daily life.

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Conference_-_-_TEXT.html," The format is that every group should put forward their creative idea and primary plan. Afterwards, some best students will be selected according to their academic performance.
In the aspect of team training, we assume that the practical training should be very important for us to improve the practice of Molecular Biology. The detailed steps are listed below:
The best students will be re-arranged into a variety of groups. In the first round, every group will learn the theory of experiments about Molecular Biology. After the first round, every group will exchange the learning and training with any other group round by round.
In the second round, the students will be asked to practice a certain experiment and observe the results, which will enable them to fully know if they are good at the experiments.
In the third round, the official team members will choose the most creative final project which also embrace the strongest executive ability. After that, they will do the brainstorming for the package and fulfill the design of experiment. In the end, they will invite the professors to vote and decide whether the projects can be executed.
The more important is the Corporatization (team management idea) from the professor Chen Wenliang, which is of a great creativity. He considers iGEM team as a corporation. For example, the Experiment Group plays a role as the Research and Development Department and offer the technical backup for ideas, while the Human Practice Group work as the Marketing Department. They communicate with the stakeholders about our own project. During the promotion and communication, they can strengthen the cooperation with colleagues in the industry and social communities. Also, they can accumulate adequate and diversified feedbacks so that the Experiment Group can polish our products.
In a word, a well-developed system of talent education is the key to a great team and project. Firstly, the course will offer students the opportunity to learn. Secondly, the standard of performance evaluation will show the academic qualities of team members as objectively as possible. Additionally, the round-by-round experiment training will improve efficiency. What’s more, the team will improve the management by putting Corporatization into practice and lay a solid foundation for the project.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.
Offering equipment and reagent

Introduction
This collection consists of all the parts made from the site-directed mutation in the protein modification of PETase. They share the same module and have the same function. The only tiny difference among them is the sequence as well as the enzyme activity of their expression products. All the genes have been codon optimized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Events_-_-_TEXT.html," » tab: we drew a map of the campus so that every team could know where to go and where to visit « that project I wanted to see » ! The building plans were a bit hard to get access to, but it was eventually worth it, as everyone had a clear understanding of the event’s organization.
The “Events” tab included a timeline of the Saturday events, with the time and location of each event. It was designed so that everyone could have access to the crucial informations quickly, and know where to be at the right time.
It also featured three levels of details, the first one being the previously evoked timeline: clicking on a particular event led to more informations about it, such as a description of the conference’s topic. Then, in the case of a conference, clicking on a speaker’s portrait would lead to the speaker’s biography, so that everyone would know easily who the speakers were.
This tab was designed for the lunch break: we have been scouting the place where the event was organized at in order to find all possible places to eat, and listed them in a special tab.
All of them were sorted by price range, and featured a link to the restaurant’s website or phone number.We included a few French restaurants, and tried to make everyone happy with their meal ! We even found a gluten-free restaurant, just in case.We also tried to get iGEMers a discount if they showed the app to the restaurant’s managers, but this wasn’t possible.
Morning presentation
On Friday, we prepared the event. While some members from both teams were helping the arriving students at their hotel, the others were preparing everything on the site.
On Saturday, we welcomed people with our banner !
In total, over 30 teams attended our event, scattered around 11 different countries. More than 170 iGEMers were present !
To answer this massive amount of people, we planned differents rooms according to the countries with the most teams coming
In the morning, students arrived and met us in the entrance hall. After receiving a badge displaying their name, team and country of origin they could go downstairs and start installing their stand while enjoying a nice breakfast provided by Paul, one of our sponsors. Paul provided us a wide selection of French cakes and breads that everyone could enjoy. The idea was to make foreign students discover French culture step by step !
It is with pleasure that we could see during the morning all the projects being presented with passion, exchanges between students and teams, partnerships being forged, friendships getting created … As said by Madeleine Premm, member of the LMU-Munich"

Outreach
Der var så dejligt ude på landet; det var sommer, kornet stod gult, havren grøn, høet var rejst i stakke nede i de grønne enge, og der gik storken på sine lange, røde ben og snakkede ægyptisk, for det sprog havde han lært af sin moder. Rundt om ager og eng var der store skove, og midt i skovene dybe søer; jo, der var rigtignok dejligt derude på landet! Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.  Endelig knagede det ene æg efter det andet: “pip! pip!” sagde det, alle æggeblommerne var blevet levende og stak hovedet ud.  “Rap! rap!” sagde hun, og så rappede de sig alt hvad de kunne, og så til alle sider under de grønne blade, og moderen lod dem se så meget de ville, for det grønne er godt for øjnene.  “Hvor dog verden er stor!” sagde alle ungerne; thi de havde nu rigtignok ganske anderledes plads, end da de lå inde i ægget.

Bronze Medal Requirements Registered the team, had a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree. Successfully completed and submitted the iGEM 2012 Judging form. Created and shared a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki. Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree. Submitted DNA for and entered information detailing 15 new standard BioBrick Parts in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Silver Medal Requirements Demonstrated that 14 new BioBrick Parts of our own design and construction works as expected and entered this information on the part's 'Main Page' section of the Registry Part Number(s): BBa_K804000 , BBa_K804001 , BBa_K804002 , BBa_K804003 , BBa_K804004 , BBa_K804005 , BBa_K804006 , BBa_K804007 , BBa_K804008 , BBa_K804009 , BBa_K804010 , BBa_K804011 , BBa_K804012 , BBa_K804013
Gold Medal RequirementsCriteria 1: Improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry. We standardized ECFP and EYFP fluorescent protein BioBricks by putting them under the same constitutive promoters and plasmid. Thereby, we have improved the fluorescent markers by making them into three more usable parts that can be used as a new tool kit for future iGEM teams. Part Number(s): BBa_K804000 , BBa_K804001 Criteria 2: Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system. We helped the University of Calgary team troubleshoot the rhamnose promoter that they were having trouble with and proved that it was not functional through careful experiments. Our two teams also distributed the work of making BioBricks of the DSZ"

WHAT'S UP? 07/07/15
We have biobricks!
This morning we had the sequence data back from some of our mini-preps and the sequences showed that we have successfully cloned 4 of our inserts into the pSB-1C3 shipping vector.
The sequence data was interesting to analyse; from the 8 samples we sent, 1 was the wrong insert all together (the sequence aligned with LsrGFP and not Lsr Holin, indicating some haphazard gel loading), Dispersin B with DspA secretion tag has a 2964P->T point mutation and another was completely missing the insert. For the latter two of these, we're sequencing different mini-prep samples tomorrow. For another of the samples, only the forawrd read was successful and so we've asked them to repeat the reverse read. The other 4 were successful and the biobricks are safe in the freezer.
The project is progressing well. We can now find our way around the lab pretty well and are getting used to the different protocols. There are still gBlocks that are proving particularly stubborn to PCR and so we're trying a gradient PCR tomorrow. We've got some of our inserts into expression vectors, which are also going for sequencing. We're considering different functional assays to use and work for interlab is well underway. Furthermore, Leon has taken it upon himself to rate our clothes out of 10 every day. Currently, Leon is on 1,111 and Lychee has evened out at 0 (after the -5).
A few of us are heading up to the John Radcliffe Hosptial this week to speak to more nurses and we're skyping the Delft iGEM team on Thursday to discuss modelling collaboration. Shout out to two of our team members, Silas and Henry, who both got firsts in their Part I exams. Until tomorrow!

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#Collaborative Report_-_-_TEXT.html," is good, anti-intellectualism is developing in some parts of the world, hampering the development of science. In the US, there is an increasing group who mistrust experts [27]. Despite the urgency of global warming and the general unequivocal consensus by the scientific community that global warming is man-made, public scepticism is one of the factors delaying the much needed development of more environmentally sustainable technologies [28].
To counter this slowdown, education of the general public is necessary. In order to communicate with them and debate sensitive topics, scientists need to popularize their work. Popular science is closely linked to the scientific process, and is part of researchers’ missions [29]. It represents a bridge between scientific literature and popular knowledge. Meaningful citizen participation in deliberations regarding synthetic biology requires familiarity with general concepts in the science of this particular developing field. In other words, scientists should taken it upon their personal mission to increase the public’s “scientific literacy”.
A recent study examined perspectives of Millennials regarding GMOs, specifically GM foods [30]. Being a very large generational group, their perspectives are expected to have a major impact on acceptance of GMOs. Overall, Millennials have somewhat unfavorable views toward GM foods. In an attempt to understand that attitude toward synthetic biology, we made our own survey, which we distributed to a large public. It was answered by 381 persons, whom were mostly Millennials studying at university, from Canada and Europe. We asked respondents how they feel about GMOs and most of them seemed to feel safe about them, depending of the use that is made of them.
After that, we asked them a few more precise questions about GMOs on the market:
Would you trust a product synthesized by a genetically modified organism (GMO)?
Did you know that several products (cosmetics, food, drugs, etc.) are already produced by GMOs or are GMOs themselves?
If these products were labeled as GMOs, would you still buy them?
In your opinion, would it be necessary to specify the origin (chemical or biological) of adrenaline sold in pharmacies?
Considering that adrenaline is a drug and not a food product, does the fact that it comes from a GMO make it any different for you?
For each answer given to the previous question, we analysed the answers for the 5 following questions. Charts 1 to 3 (see annex), which represent the majority of respondents (88%), show the same results: these people would trust a product synthesized by a GMO and if these products were labeled as GMOs, they would still by them. However, they do not consider biologically synthesized drugs a different issue"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.
This Is The Story
We are strategically located in Guadalajara, the second most populated city in Mexico and responsible of 7% of national gross domestic product. Our goal in the long term is to fulfil the Mexican demand of medium and high purity chitosan and to become the first Mexican exporter of high purity chitosan. We want to create dream jobs for young Mexican engineers and export our biotechnology worldwide.
Biophrame Technologies is a biotech company and manufacturer specialized in the production of Chitosan.
