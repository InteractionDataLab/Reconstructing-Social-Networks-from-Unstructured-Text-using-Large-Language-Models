What's more
Gold-integrated
More than engagement ( Click here to see our engagement project ) ,we integrated supporting research in our human practice. To know common pesticide contamination and public biosecurity awareness, we sent three kinds of customized questionnaires to different people. The questionnaires made us know the TCP，which is harmful. Subsequently, we learned about the presence of a large number of TCP by detecting soil from soil survey. We know that we cannot solve the problems well which related to human development only by research. With the help of experts’ power, we can make it more professional and more in-depth. Therefore, we have built a ‘Global League of Professors’ to guide our projects. So we contacted with experts from several countries and universities all over the world about plants or environment by emails, videos and face to face interview, More importantly, our project has been widely concerned in the academic community with the help of their contacts and resources.
Diversity survey
☁ Questionnaire for industrial and agricultural producers
We interviewed the main potential producers of pollution sources: factories and farmland, and sent them some questionnaires to try to understand whether there could be TCP residues in plant waste and pesticides. After the investigation, we talked to them, listened to their views on soil pollution, and taught farmers some basic ways to prevent excessive use of land and prevent pollution.
Analysis: We found from this questionnaire that peasants use the most pesticides as insecticide.

☁ Questionnaire for local residents
Ordinary local residents are the most vulnerable population to soil pollution. Their living conditions and their attitudes are a matter of great concern to us. Before we identified the project theme, we investigated the environmental concerns of the public and collected their opinions towards synthetic biology. Combined with the work that iGEM had done a few years ago, we found that soil contamination was a widespread problem that had not yet be well addressed.
Analysis: We found from this questionnaire that there is no correct understanding of biosafety.

Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," .7kb insert for pC13AT colony 1 and a .3kb insert for pC13AT colony 2. The bands for pC13AU were inconclusive. We will miniprep the potential pC13AT colony 1 and send for sequencing once the miniprep kit arrives. We digested our plasmid pAh13G with SphI in order to create linear DNA for fungal transformation. We attempted to transform this into what G. lucidum protoplasts we had generated, but the electroporation lead to arcing. Arching most likely resulted from the sodium citrate in the cell solution which we were instructed to use by the literature. Nevertheless, we plated the cells on hygromycin cym agar.
Cloning of PtrpC and GFP appears to be going well. Our initial attempt at protoplasting and transforming G. lucidum does not appear to have been successful.

We spun down the pC13BX and pC13CJ cultures and put them in the fridge to be miniprepped. We also ligated T7 with mRFP, PtrpC with GFP, and PtrpC with mRFP since restriction cocktail digests looked good from the gel yesterday. We then electroporated the ligations and plated them. The plates were left overnight in the incubator. We created another culture of G. lucidum this time in an effort to obtain solid pieces at the top of the media instead of mycelium floating throughout.
We continued cloning of T7 with mRFP, PtrpC with GFP, and PtrpC with mRFP.

We ran a PCR to append homologous regions to G. lucidum PgpdA for Gibson assembly with pC13F that succeeded as verified by a gel screen, but we accidentally used a RNA binding tube during purification and lost all the DNA. Needless to say, that mistake won’t happen again. Luckily, when we ran the same PCR again it was successful. We ran a colony PCR from the grown cultures of pC13BX and pC13CJ to visualize the insert using Q5. We got a positive insert for pC13BX. So this will be miniprepped and sent for sequencing once the miniprep kit is in. Unfortunately, no colonies appeared on the potential pAK13AO plate. We also decided to transform RBS (pA13CZ)"
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," a thermostatic water bath and a pump to simulate the working conditions.
The room temperature was around 24 ℃. The pump was set at 63 rpm. We set the temperature of the water bath at 34 ℃, 38 ℃ and 42 ℃. At each temperature, we cultivated the yeast in our prototype for 1 hour, and then extracted the yeast for fluorescence testing. The prototype was washed thoroughly before adding new yeast to it and used for the test of another temperature.
We chose 36 ℃ as the test point. Other conditions were set as same as the points on the standard curve.
We took five photoes of each temperature through the fluorescence microscope. the photos are showed below.
Using the quantitating method we introduce in our Proof of Concept section, we get the figure below, showing the standard curve and the test point.
The data of the points above is showed below.

Apparently, there is a negative correlation between the intensity and the temperature just like we have showed in our modeling section. So we can conclude that the prototype of the BTI can work well in the simulated working conditions.

NEFU_China,2016,Team:NEFU China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," Spytag-tagged protein in the bacterial lysate and they can be simply co-purified by a magnet. Due to covalent linkage, stringent washing can be used to achieve high purity of the recombinant protein that is subsequently released by cleavage of a designated protease.
Overall, our novel approach for protein purification is reliable and highly specific. It provides a better solution to reach high protein purity and quality by remedying many drawbacks of currently used methods.
Design
Magnetic bacteria Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium. It produces a unique organelle known as Magnetosome using iron and other metal ions. Magnetosome consists of uniform nano-sized magnetic particles (50 to 100 nm) arranged as chains in cytoplasm and embraced by a stable lipid bilayer membrane, and exhibits strong ferrimagnetism.
Fig.2 Transmission electron microscope image of (A) AMB-1 and (B) Magnetosome
Magnetosome has been used in various biomedical applications because it is easy to handle and can be used to separate target molecules from reaction mixes. Several proteins are identified to tightly bind to the membrane of Magnetosome, such as MagA, Mms16, and Mms13. Among them, Mms13 has the highest affinity to the magnetic core, and its anchoring efficiency is also better than other Mms proteins. Thus, a protein of interest can be expressed on the Magnetosome when fused with Mms13. The magnetic particles can be easily extracted and purified from bacterial lysate of AMB-1 transformant using a magnet.
Fig.3 Proteins on the Magnetosome’s membrane and AMB-1 modification by transformed with Mms13 protein.
Choosing an appropriate tag is crucial for detecting and purifying a recombinant protein. However, the interaction of tags with corresponding ligands is typically reversible and mostly has low affinity. Streptococcus pyogenes fibro-nectin-binding protein FbaB contains a domain with a spontaneous isopeptide bond between Lys31 and Asp117. This domain can be splitted into two fragments: the small one (13 amino acids) is named as Spytag, while the big one (116 amino acids) is Spycatcher. When they meet together, the two parts can specifically associate and spontaneously form an isopeptide bond. The reaction can take place in diverse conditions, even in relatively extreme pH and temperatures.

Because we did not get any VV from either of our gel extractions we will try another PCR and gel extraction on it tomorrow
Friday, 9/16
●
Checked plates from transformation of the 8 chromoproteins with His-tags and no colony growth was seen. Because they were plated last night they were put back into the incubator to see if any growth would occur with more incubation time
○
Because of no growth we went through over our primers again and realized that we reverse complimented the forward primer instead of the reverse primer and this is why nothing was working and our gels were only showing weak bands where our chromoproteins should be
○
We then reverse complimented the correct primers and re ordered. On Monday we will be able to hopefully complete the PCR, gel extraction, Gibson, and transformation and see colonies on our plates on Tuesday.

TU-Eindhoven,2013,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html," a bacterial infection. SawyerOxInfR. G. Sawyer, M. D. Spengler, R. B. Adams, T. L. Pruett, The peritoneal environment during infection: the effect of mono-microbial and poly-microbial bacteria on pO2 and pH. Ann Surg 213, 253-260 (1991)
Inspired by this type of research, we propose two main applications which follow the same idea of targeting a specific region and delivering a compound to it:
1
Tumor imaging based on the sensing of a hypoxic environment.
2
Bacterial tracking in bacterial infection research in animals.
First Application: Tumor Imaging
The idea is to generate the CEST MRI contrast agent on site within the tumor region, facilitating tumor localization in this manner. Considering that the contrast agent will be generated only if the bacteria sense a hypoxic environment, it can be said that using our contrast agent would allow physicians to identify tumors in an accurate way.
appIFigure Graphic Diagram of the Tumor Imaging Application.
How?
presents a graphic description of the process that would be followed by using the CEST MRI contrast agent to image tumors in humans.
1
A bacterial concentrated solution is injected into the patient.
2
The bacteria in the solution travel through the bloodstream without alerting the immune system.
3
They accumulate in the tumor region due to their ability of sensing hypoxic environments. The anaerobic conditions activate the CEST proteins production. Once the CEST proteins have been produced, the CEST MRI can be taken and analyzed.
4
The bacteria can be disabled and killed by means of activating the kill switch. The switch is enabled by the systemic administration of the prodrug Ganciclovir which induces apoptosis only in the cells that contain the HSV-Thymidine Kinase, in this case the bacteria producing CEST proteins.
Further changes to the current chassis
In order to use our device for this application the current chassis must include two crucial components that enable the bacteria to travel through the bloodstream without raising an alert in the immune system and die when the kill switch is activated.
1
The alteration of its outer surface by exchanging the carbohydrate chains commonly found on it into a carbohydrate layer instead. This alteration will prevent innate and adaptive immune responses, allowing the bacteria to freely travel to the tumor region without being engulfed by phagocytic cells. This solution to the immune system’s response was based on the solutions implemented by the Berkeley iGEM team in 2007 and the research of Dr. J. Christopher Anderson, an assistant professor of bioengineering at the"

Synthetic Biology Turkey meetings 1.0 of iGEM      Turkey teams were organized by Association of Synthetic Biology and      METU-Ankara Team on September 10, 2011 and we were also invited to the      meeting organization, we were glad to be a part of this meeting. The      organization’s aim was to arrange meeting with all Turkey iGEM team members      and researchers and related companies in order to discuss Synthetic biology      in Turkey and the iGEM competition potential on ongoing studies. In this      meeting, all iGEM teams and Bio- entrepreneurship company owners presented      their presentations and some foreign academics talked about synthetic      biology giving some helpful advice to listeners via teleconference system.      It was very informative and enjoyable for us. We presented a successful      presentation which was about our project and played our Canwas Town Game      with other iGEM Turkey teams. Also one of the important news informants of      Turkey which is Anadolu Agency came to this meeting and talked with Turkish      teams’ members and took some photos.

Module PHI
PHI
PHI is basically the pipette. PHI controls 3 pipette actions, Aspirate, Dispense and Clean. It consists of three motors whose functions are as follow
Motor 1 (3-way Toggle switch)
This motor controls the flow of the air. If you look at it from the side when the switch is visible:
When the switch is to the left, there is a direct flow from the pipet head to the air. This makes it possible to use the second motor (motor B) to attempt to aspirate without aspirating any liquid, and enabling it to blow extra air out.
When the switch is in the middle, there is no connection.
When the switch is to the right, the pressure built up in the air tank is released into the pipette head.
Motor 2 (Aspirate or Dispense Liquid)
This motor is connected to a piston, so it can aspirate and dispense liquid.
Motor 3 (Clean Pipette)
This motor is connected to compressors compressing air in the air tank. It runs for seven seconds once the air is released.
PHI module in action
This video shows Phi running by itself.
Current Functionality and Limitations
BioBrick-A-Bot V1.0 is only a proof-of-principle prototype.  In its current implementation, it is not user-friendly enough to be used by a standard molecular biologist directly. In our current program, both ALPHA and PHI provides a set of primitive functions that can be called by a driver program. ALPHA has a command that allows the pipette head to move to any location and tell PHI to do an action. PHI has primitive functions for ASPIRATING, DISPENSING and CLEANING. In Version 1.0, we still need a programmer to write a driver program and hence it is not usable by a molecular biologist.
In the planned version 2.0, we will build a nice GUI where a molecular biologist can specify what they want to do, without the need of having a programmer to write the driver program. The cost of a typical commercial liquid handling system is about $10,000. The hardware cost of this project is only about $700. We have developed the primitive functions to show that the robot works. The rest of the work is software based, and will not increase the cost of the robot, if we provide it to the user community in the form of open-sourced"

1 Model for Chemical Diffusion
2 Model for Worms Locomotion
3 Model for Neuron Network
4 Model for Genetic Probability
Modeling is usually used to make sense of the experimental discovery in traditional biological studies. In this synthetic biology project, we believe that carefully carried out modeling will be critical for the experimental design and data analysis at different stages of the project. We hope to demonstrate that the modeling is especially helpful to finalize the microfluidics chip design, and determine the distribution of the C. elegans (Caenorhabditis elegans) in microfliudics, as well as the transfection of the MiniMos in our experiment.
Model for Chemical Diffusion
The diffusion process of chemicals in the PDMS chips is simulated in our model. 2 steps are included:
• The process to form a linear concentration gradient
• The chemical diffusion through the PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) layer
Total time consumption of the 2 processes is calculated, based on the Einstein and Brownian movement equation t=\frac{w^{2}}{2D}
and Fick’s second law (\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}
). The calculation results are used to guide our experiment design.

Model for Worms Locomotion
This model describes the locomotion of worms in the Gaussian Plate. It is applied in the experiment to demonstrate whether the genetic insertions undermine the functions of AWA and AWB neurons.  If the neurons are not affected, worms will be attracted by diacetyl and repelled by 2-nonanone. Without adding these odorants, the distribution of"

BBF RFC 89:
The minimum information for a qualified BioBrick
1. Purpose
  Since the information of many existing BioBricks is incomplete, thus the usage of the BioBricks will be affected. It is necessary to standardize the minimum information required for a qualified BioBrick. Furthermore this standardization will reduce the time to locate and find a BioBrick. So it is essential to create a default template of storing the information of BioBricks.
2. Relation to other BBF RFCs
  This BBF RFC is intended to replace the following standards:
  BBF RFC52: Documentation of BioBrick parts
3. Copyright Notice
  Copyright (C) The BioBricks Foundation (2012). All Rights Reserved.
4. Minimum information for a BioBrick
  To build a qualified BioBrick, the following information MUST be included:
      -       Name of the BioBrick
      -       Fundamental type of the BioBrick
      -       General description of the BioBrick
      -       Status of the BioBrick
      -       Categories that the BioBrick falls in
      -       Author and contact information
      -       Sequence and sequence length
      -       Creation date
    4.1 Name of the BioBrick
  A BioBrick MUST contain a valid name. A name example: BBa_I14050. To see how to name a part, please refer to http://partsregistry.org/Basic_Biobrick,_example_1

Safety Q&A | Human Practice
Q: Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
A: Biology research may raise safety issues to some extent, since the utility and study of plasmids and bacteria may lead to potential risks. However, we believe that the bio-safety in our laboratory can be guaranteed during the research process, for our attaching great importance upon this issue. We act under the principle of the experiment and the regulation of our university.
Moreover, we make guidelines for our laboratory in the usage of devices, the preservation of the bacteria and the dealing of waste, in order to keep us behaving properly and thus keep off the safety issues. Additionally, our project ideas only focus on the sequence of the gene, and are unlikely to produce new and unexpected substance. With all measures above followed, the risk can be decreased to the minimum.
Q: Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
A: No. As far as we are concerned, with the regulation and restriction followed, and the operation of the innocuous genes only, none of the new BioBrick parts or devices we made this year raise safety issues.
Q: Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
A:  Yes. Our project is supported and financed by Department of Automation with the help of Department of Life Sciences. Professors and supervisors keep in contact with our team, evaluate the procedure and give us necessary advices during our work, and safety is required to be concerned as the prior issue. What’s more, laboratory assistants participate in the research and thus lead the teammates to conduct in a right way.
Q:  Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Standardization contributes to the bio-safety. With a proper standard on BioBricks, the utility of parts and devices and the synthesis of new ones will"

Figure 4. Part BBa_K1189008 . To enable the construction of β-lactamase with Golden Gate Assembly we removed a BsaI cut site.
Figure 5. Part BBa_K1189031 . This construct works as the mobile detector in our biosensor. TALE A is linked to β-lactamase and if the stx2 gene is present in the strip, our mobile is retained on the strip so β-lactamase can give a colour output in the presence of a substrate.
Results
As a preliminary test to confirm proper protein expression, we tested purified β-lactamase with benzylpenicillin, a substrate that gives a colourimetric and a pH output. First, we wanted to demonstrate that our bacteria carrying the ampR gene was expressing functional β-lactamase. BBa_K1189007 . In order to do so, we performed an ampicillin survival assay using E. coli transformed with a plasmid encoding the ampR gene. This assay would involve culturing the bacteria and then exposing them to ampcillin, and survival was then measured by OD. This then allowed us to determine whether the β-lactamase was produced and whether it is functional. Only the bacteria producing functional β-lactamase enzymes were able to survive in the presence of ampicillin resulting in an increase in OD. Whereas bacteria lacking the abililty to produce functional β-lactamase enzyme were unable to survive, seen by a decrease in OD. (Figure 6). Therefore, we are able to produce functional β-lactamase enzyme (Figure 6).
Figure 6. Absorbance values at 600nm for each tube at four different time points: 0, 30, 60 and 120min. The cultures that expressed β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189007 ) showed higher absorbance levels, showing that the cells were able to grow in the presence of ampicillin.
After confirming protein expresison, we wanted to demonstrate that we can also purify our proteins. Figure 7 demonstrates that we were able to purify both our β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189007 ) and our TALE-A-β-lactamase protein ( BBa_K1189031 ) ("
HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," k_9k_{-9}[Cre])(k_{-8}k_{-9}+k_9k_{-9}[Cre])}\\ &<1 \end{aligned} \end{equation}
Under the condition that the $Cre\cdot lox$ is much more easy to get a Cre monomer rather than lose a Cre monomer, this proportion approximately equals to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, because \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} r_c(2Cre\cdot lox)&=\frac{k_8k_9\cdot [lox]\cdot [Cre]^2}{k_{-8}k_{-9}+k_9k_{-9}\cdot [Cre]} &\approx\frac{k_8\cdot [lox]\cdot [Cre]}{k_{-9}} \end{aligned} \end{equation}
Hence, $r_c($$2Cre\cdot loxP)$$\cdot r_c($$2Cre\cdot lox72)$$< r_c($$2Cre\cdot lox66)$$\cdot r_c($$2Cre\cdot lox71)$, which means the synapsis between lox66 and lox71 is easy to form.
This explanation is based on the kinetic model proposed in 1998. However, the real system may have additional processes. We introduce another explanation using a principle called kinetic proofreading that is widely employed to achieve high precision in diverse molecular recognition systems. Inspired by the DNA binding process described in available researches (Tlusty et al., 2004; Alon, 2007), we infer that the recombinase protein Cre undergoes a modification after binding to the half of lox site, and then it can recruit other proteins Cre to bind to another half of lox site. Such a modification can help the mutant lox site like lox66 and lox71 easily jump to the next state but prevent the incorrect binding of the double mutant lox site like lox72. This modification makes the second binding event more likely to happen and the corresponding dissociation event less likely to happen.

T7 expression backbone
Aggregating gas vesicles using SpyCatcher-SpyTag binding involves protein overexpression, and no system is better for protein expression than E. coli BL21 (DE3) as its lon and ompT protease deficiency yields a huge amount of protein.
BL21 (DE3) is a lysogenic strain that has the T7 RNA polymerase gene integrated into its genome under the lac operon; adding IPTG induces expression of T7 RNA polymerase, which recognizes the T7 promoter sequence. Any gene inserted downstream of the T7 promoter can thus be expressed.
Using BBa_K525998 (T7 promoter+RBS) and BBa_K731721 (T7 terminator), we have designed a T7 expression backbone that can be used to assemble and express fusion proteins easily.
Choice of BioBricks
BBa_K525998 (T7 promoter+RBS) was chosen as the strong RBS B0034 used allows for maximal protein expression. BBa_K731721 (T7 terminator) was chosen instead of the standard B0015 double terminator as its in vivo termination efficiency is greater, as characterized by BBa_K731700 .
Our First Modification — BBa_K2319001 (HindIII+ATG+AgeI scar)
A HindIII restriction site, a start codon and an AgeI restriction site ( BBa_K2319001 ) are added immediately downstream of the T7 promoter+RBS. A number of design considerations motivated the choice of these restriction sites. The HindIII site (A\AGCTT) — sandwiched between the RBS and the start codon — has a sequence very similar to the optimal sequence predicted by the sequence logo of E. coli ribosome binding sites. In fact, the HindIII sequence is closer to the optimal sequence than the typical 5'-TACTAG-3' mixed SpeI-XbaI restriction site formed by BioBrick assembly, improving the initial ribosome-mRNA binding and thereby increasing the rate of translation.

Abstract
As Synthetic Biology field is on the rise, iGEM also grows up and number of parts in parts registry increase with submission of more complex constructs each year. Our first milestone was to perform more efficient standardization on parts entry due to facing some difficulty while running our algorithms on the parts registry. We also used Software Requirements Specification, Software Design Description and Quality Plan approaches to define requirements for each part and building blocks, risks and design art elements of the designed software program.
Next, we have used graph theoretic modeling to visualize relations between parts and to standardize representation of the parts as much as possible. It will help us when we try to find input-output relations between either biobrick parts or constructs. By this way, our program BIOGUIDE will act as a guide for searhing biobricks and will provide alternative pathway choices to users for construction of the most reliable devices with respect to given inputs and expected outputs.
Team
METU Turkey Software is an interdisciplinary team of 7 students and     4 advisors from various backgrounds such as Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics,     Computer Engineering and Computer Education and Instructional Technology.

SJTU-software,2018,Team:SJTU-software#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," more practical needs. For these user demands, we will seek existing projects or develop more softwares, making our tool box more integrated.
Contribution
The aim of our project has always been designing and developing useful programs for Synthetic Biology and iGEM community. Comparative analysis of biological network is very useful and indicative in synthetic biology and other related studies. Specially, it enables people to handle unknown organisms starting from known ones with alike networks. However, most current tools are only for a specific problem or application, and the existing algorithm is inefficient. In order to solve these problems, we launch METLAB, a general purpose alignment software.
Metlab is a suite of synthetic biology aided tools and mainly functions as BLAST for networks. Besides network alignment, users may visualize networks, compare and draw metabolites and design their wet-lab experiments.
Combining various commonly-used functions into the toolkit, our project will definitely come in handy to people studying synthetic biology and related fields.

Tec-Monterrey,2015,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," science development. However... students and researchers always confront many different problems that reduce the rate of progress.  The question is: why? What is still holding us back? Since 2010, Tec-Monterrey has been analyzing the situation and has identified the main problem: customs.
We share a border with the United States, our main provider of imported material, so in theory, we shouldn’t have a problem. Unfortunately, the reality is totally the opposite.
Customs
When we want to import material directly from a provider, everything goes well until the moment it arrives at customs. Custom brokers don’t know the protocol to follow when they receive our material, for the simple reason that there is nothing written about it.
Continuing work from past years, we decided to read the current legislation, and with the help of the lawyers Donato Cardenas, Ph.D and Eloisa Fernandez, we were able to come to a consensus: the main problem with customs is the lack of proper categorization. Donato and Eloisa helped us see that most of the material used in our line of research such as DNA, enzymes and others, that is imported to Mexico, falls under a generic category which causes important setbacks. We got in touch with the office of Customs Regulation and Normativity located in Mexico City and are currently working on a way to be able to report the material we will receive, so that customs' brokers can know exactly what’s being received.
With this open dialogue, we hope to be able to help establish guidelines and provide the information needed so that when the material is received in customs, the brokers know exactly what it is and therefore will be able to continue the process without any setbacks. We are also in the process of receiving an appointment with the Secretary of Health of our state so that we can establish an agreement that facilitates the process of importation.
Surveys
To learn more about this problem, we wanted to analyze if other teams have had the same problems with customs as we have. To achieve this, with the help of other iGEM teams, we recollected information via surveys to understand the general situation of customs and the difficulties they have had with receiving material ordered from abroad. The survey can be found here.
After analyzing responses obtained from the survey, we were able to see clear tendencies. 83% of teams have ordered material abroad. When asked if they had any trouble with receiving their materials through customs, 100% of the Latin American teams answered yes, when only 21.4% of teams from other parts of the world answered the same. This shows that there is a clear difference between"

Microfluidics
Microfluidics is a powerful tool in synthetic biology with a wide range of applications such as transcription factors - DNA interactions and screening aptamers. Microfluidics chips consist of micron-sized channels where volumes on the scale of micro-liters flow can interact.
The use of microfluidics has many advantages including high sensitivity, reducing costs and increasing throughput.
These microfluidics chips are made of polymeric organosilicion compounds such as PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) and contain integrated mechanical systems (sandwiches, necks, buttons, …) allowing a great modularity in experiments.
Since we are working with proteins and DNA aptamers, it was necessary to use small reagent volumes in order to minimize the cost of our experiments but also to measure with high precision the affinity between the protein and the aptamers. Initially, our plan was to go with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to test the aptamers but we couldn't afford our local Biacore SPR machine. Furthermore, microfluidics could also be a viable implementation for our diagnostic test. 1
How does it work?
A MITOMI (Mechanically Induced Trapping of Molecular Interactions) 768 chip is a simple double layer microfluidic device composed of inter-connected channels and chambers 2 . The device is composed of two layers, referred to as the control and the flow, which are separated by a thin layer of PDMS. The so-called control layer allows the opening or closing of the flow channels by pressurizing the control channels using an incompressible fluid such as water. Under the control layer, the so-called"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved"

Nevada,2012,Team:Nevada#human practice_-_-_TEXT.html," Rice Survey, we wanted to expand this project to be more of a two-way conversation. We plan to hold a series of public forums for members of our community to discuss their opinions on GMOs, starting with a group of young biochemistry students.
The University of Nevada offers an introductory course (BCH 110) for all biochemistry majors in order to familiarize freshman interested in the field with some of the opportunities, developments, and controversies involved in molecular biology. This class includes discussion-based ""breakout"" sections, which are led by upperclassmen biochemistry students (several of which are iGEM team members this year!).
The BCH 110 students previously participated in our GM Rice survey, so we were interested in talking to them about why they responded the way they did and how they personally felt about the GMO controversy. Overall, a majority of the students expressed an open-minded attitude toward GM foods. When we asked them why they thought many other people around the world viewed GM foods more negatively than they did, the students told us that their own attitudes were largely influenced by their personal education and interest in synthetic biology, and that the same things could change other people's minds as well.
Some quotes from the students about GM controversies:
""If people were more educated about what GM was, they wouldn’t be bothered by the idea of eating GM foods""
""When people feel like they don’t have control over something, they feel uneasy about it.""
""I think getting people to eat more GMOs would be like anything new. Couldn't we just have more news coverage about what it is?""
""I just don't see the point in having to label GMOs because I don't think we need to be afraid of them. It will cost a lot of money to do so, and taxpayers shouldn’t pay for that.""
""The fear is the fear of not knowing, not a fear of the food itself. People just don’t have enough knowledge about it.""
The Effects of GMO Food Labels
During the open forum with biochemistry students, we also conducted an experiment on the effects of one of the most hot-button issues in synthetic biology today, the labeling of GM foods. Before beginning discussion, students were told to help themselves to some cookies on the front table. Although they all actually came from the same bag, half of the cookies were labeled ""Contains Genetically Modified Ingredients"" and the other half were labeled ""Non-Genetically Modified.""
Surprisingly (and a bit comically), the students actually chose to eat more of the ""GM"" cookies, and more quickly.

Interviews with professors from College of Civil Engineering
This year our project is about concrete self-healing. So we think it is pretty essential to seek advice from the professionals. In order to do this we did interviews with 3 professors of College of Civil Engineering from Shenzhen University.
We put the answers of three professors together and summarized them as follow:
Professor XIANFENG WANG:
Main research area: Self-healing concrete material. Durability of civil engineering materials. Etc.
Member of JSCE; RILEM; IALCCE.
ProfessorYAOCHENG WANG:
Main research area: Durability of civil engineering materials.  Etc.
Professor NINGXU HAN:
Main research area: Civil engineering structures.  Durability of civil engineering materials. Etc.
Editorial member of ICE Journal of Forensic Engineering; Member of RILEM;
The key questions involves all of the following:
Q1: On which public construction do you think the cracks happens the most.
A1: Bridges and tunnels. You cannot find a single bridge or tunnel without any cracks.                                             Cracks happen all the times. When it comes to tunnel, the cracks will cause leak which is really annoying.
Q2: What kind of mature techniques can be used to fix the cracks of concrete nowadays?
A2:  Grouting method is the one. Using high pressure to pump the Inorganic cement or other kind of adhesive into the cracks and wait for it to become solid so the cracks can be blocked. But it won’t be a onetime thing you might have to do over constantly.
Q3: We’ve read about Hendrik Jonkers from Technische Universiteit Delft has already invented a type of bio-concrete. Some says our project is so similar to his, What do you think of this.
A3: Actually he is my friend and what you are doing is actually a very different thing. First, Hendrik’s bio-concrete is not self-healing like yours. His bio-concrete needs to be brushed on. Second he didn’t use the technique of microcapsule to protect his bacterium but you do. And actually I think he will be very interested in your project because you use synthetic biology to promote your bacterium in a certain way. I mean who wouldn’t want that？

Prof. em. Dr. Kathryn Nixdorff
Joint Committee of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the German Research Foundation (DFG) for the Handling of Security-relevant Research ▾
The number of steadily growing reports of work involving dual-use research of concern (DURC) in the scientific literature have generated much controversy and debate in the scientific community and in the general public. The nature of the debates about the potential biosecurity risks involved in such research points out the need for carrying out life sciences work in a responsible manner. Several surveys over the past ten years have clearly documented that the majority of scientists involved in modern life sciences work do not devote a great deal of active consideration to questions of biosecurity, mainly because they have little awareness of possible dual-use implications of their work. The CeBiTec Group Bielefeld is a refreshing exception. For example, through research carried out in connection with their iGEM-Projects over the past several years CeBiTec Teams have dealt extensively with the issues surrounding biosecurity-relevant research in the life sciences and related fields. In carrying out dual-use biosecurity risk assessments of their projects, they have demonstrated that they are indeed working responsibly as young scientists. However, they have not stopped there. Members of the iGEM Team 2018, along with volunteers from the biotechnologische Studierendeninitiative (btS) are also at present actively engaging in projects to raise awareness among those studying and working in the life sciences and related fields about dual-use biosecurity issues of concern. In particular, the group is exploring how best to integrate these issues into the curriculum at universities. It is clear to most experts in the biosecurity community that creating a culture of responsibility among those working in biosecurity-relevant research areas through education about dual-use issues is one of the most effective ways of mitigating risks that may be involved in this work. I am extremely impressed to see that young academics have taken the initiative themselves to promote awareness-raising from the bottom up. This should set an example for all young academics; the CeBiTec Bielefeld Group are to be heartily commended!

Life sciences findings can be misused – even when they were determined in good faith. VBIO therefore do not take dual-use problems or biorisks lightly."

Prof. Dr. M. Mall
Prof. Marcus A. Mall is the head of the pediatric pulmonology and allergology unit of the university  medical center in Heidelberg and head of the Heidelberg cystic fibrosis centre (since 2009) and  became head of the department of translational pulmonology translational lung research centre  (TLRC) in 2012. He studied and got his medical doctor at the University of Freiburg.
Prof. Mall gave us good advice for our cystic fibrosis project. He liked our idea of using ribozymes to  medicate cystic fibrosis. He told us about the problems in medicating cystic fibrosis with classical  pharmacological approaches. A low efficiency in repairing the deficient RNA would have benefits  compared to classical methods. We asked about how much RNA we need to repair to get a  therapeutic effect. If 1-3% of repaired RNA a therapeutic effect can be seen and with 5-10% of  repaired RNA nearly all symptoms of cystic fibrosis would be gone. We also talked about the  application of a future cystic fibrosis medication. The best application would be oral or subcutaneous  so that the ribozymes can be taken up in the blood and can cure the complete body. Unfortunately in  an oral or subcutaneous application the RNA would be degraded very fast. Another application would  be the direct inhalation of the ribozymes in liposomes, which could address the lung cells, but would  not help against symptoms in other organs, like the liver. We also talked about testing our ribozymes  with an CF lung cell line, in which we could measure the ion flow at the Mall laboratory."

Procedure
Freezing
Label (strain, date, medium) on cryovials, do at least 3 vials /strain.
E. coli (26% glycerol is higher than normal E. coli cryo-preservation protocols, this concentration allows easy scraping of top without thawing out entire tube according to Dr. Callahan)
dispense 0.4mL 80% sterile glycerol stock into cryovial
add 0.8mL E. coli culture grown overnight in TB medium, so final glycerol concentration in vial is ~26%
perform quick freeze (prevent water-molecules to organize and form large crystals and rupture membrane) by immediately putting cryotube into eppendorf rack holes prefilled and -80C prechilled w/ 70% ethanol. Place rack in -80C for freezing.
after freezing is complete in -80C, transfer vials to final cryoboxes at -80C
Record cryopreserved bacteria addition in -80C Deep Freezer Inventory.
Thawing
Record cryopreserved bacteria removal in -80C Deep Freezer Inventory.
Use one of the following thawing methods:
General Bacteria: Waterbath Method
Thaw quickly in 37C water bath.
Cells are immediately pelleted by centrifugation of the cryovial, and the supernatant is discarded. One ml of fresh growth medium is placed into the vial to resuspend the pellet.
Dispense contents on media agar plate or in liquid media.

Michigan,2018,Team:MichiganState#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," soaking was used instead of addition to soil to address concerns about transfer between plants and the spraying of transformed bacteria. We observed these plants each week for 1-5 weeks post inoculation, and took micrographs using confocal microscopy.
Goal 7: Engineer a circuit to regulate expression as a response to abscisic acid
Plants produce abscisic acid in response to drought conditions, and this molecule leads to a dimerization of two proteins. We aimed to use this interaction to regulate expression of ACC deaminase in bacteria. We did not get to developing this circuit due to time constraints. We hypothesize that this regulation can reduce impacts on normal plant physiology in the absence of drought conditions.
Goal 8: Demonstrate plant growth promotion in a model grass
This was our ultimate project goal, which we may have achieved if plants germinated in the early trials and our transformation techniques were developed earlier. Our plan was to use the inoculation technique in Goal 6, apply stresses to the plants, and measure characters of the plants after a growth period of 8 weeks. This would allow us to measure yield, biomass, and ethylene pathway genes and metabolites. Evidence for plant growth promotion will increment from sterile environment in growth chamber, to non-sterile in growth chamber, to field trials."

Additionally, we analyzed 4 micrographs of each sample (n=4) with the software ImageJ
All the different treatments presented significant differences, except (B2+ & protease K) and (B2+). Remarkable is the difference between (B2+ / SN B3+) and (B2+ / NS B3-). Also, the direct application of protease K over the samples decreased even more the fluorescence. However, the low fluorescence of B2+ is very weird. We will have to repeat this experiment, but at least the major part of the results makes is what we expected.

Next, we diluted the culture four-fold into chilled formalin (1X PBS, 4% formaldehyde, 1.5% methanol). We used flow cytometry (Aminis ImageStream MKII) to run a sample and detected fluorescence using an excitation laser wavelength of 488nm at 200mW, as well as SSC at 1.5mW. After acquiring data from 20'000 cells in all channels, we performed analysis on the IDEAS Application v.6 software. For Figure 1 and 2, the protocol above was modified such that the cultures after induction were incubated for 9hr instead of 6hr. This protocol is based off in-house protocols created by previous Waterloo iGEM members and revised over the years by advisors and experienced users.
Figure 1. Preliminary Exploratory Comparison of RFP Expression with (a) and without (b) a Complete sgRNA-dCas9 pair
Figure 2. Comparison of (a) RFP with an sgRNA-dCas9 pair and (b) RFP with only dCas9 and no sgRNA
We began our experiments by first checking if our strains from last year were still viable. In Figure 1 (a) we show that the strain with an RFP and a dCas9 leads to expression of RFP, but in Figure 1 (b) we show that the strain with RFP and the complete dCas9-sgRNA pair resulted in repression of RFP fluorescence based on the spike in frequency of cells that have almost zero RFP fluorescence. With this raw data, we were confident moving on with the part characterization and decided to extend the induction time by 3hr in an attempt to get better expression and thus more robust data. Figure 2 provides similar information to Figure 1 where we see the complete sgRNA-dCas9 pair repressing RFP fluorescence. In Figure 2 (b), we see intensities up to 2000 intensity units, but in Figure (a) we see that virtually all cells show less than 500 intensity units - an approximately four-fold repression ability. Finally in Figure 3, we see that for (b) there is very little RFP fluorescence, but in (a) there is essentially no RFP fluorescence as well. This is indicative of IPTG having strong control over the expression of RFP in the E. coli cells. In summary, we demonstrate this part's ability to give dCas9 the specificity to target"

Thermocycler
Ice Bucket
-20°C Fridge
Procedure
Set up the reaction on ice using the reaction component table above.
Incubate samples at 50°C in a thermocycler for 15 minutes for 2-3 fragment assembly or 60 minutes for 4-6 fragment assembly.
Note: Reaction times less than 15 minutes are generally not recommended. Extended incubation times (up to 4 hours) have been shown to improve assembly efficiencies in some cases. Do not incubate the reaction overnight.
Following incubation, store samples on ice or at –20°C for subsequent transformation.
Transform competent E. coli cells with 2μL of the assembly reaction, following the transformation protocol. To ensure you’ve made the correct plasmid, screen by restriction digest.
Note: NEB recommends using NEB 5-α Competent E. coli (High Efficiency, NEB #C2987). If the assembled products are larger than 10 kb, NEB recommends using NEB 10-β Competent E. coli (High Efficiency, NEB #C3019) or NEB 10-β Electrocompetent E. coli (NEB #C3020). If the assembled genes contain repetitive sequences, NEB Stable Competent E. coli (NEB #C3040) should be used.
Leaving the lab
Prior to leaving the lab, you should:
Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
Wipe down your workspace.
Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly stored in the fridge.

Enterprise Visit
“Bring our project to life” is always our final goal. Therefore, we visited                                  China Steel Corporation, which is the largest steel maker in Taiwan, to gain the                                 truth opinions from                                 our future potential users. In addition,                                 we also visit the An-nan campus of NCKU to see the progress from research to                                 practice, including the cost calculation, evaluation and benefit analysis, etc.
Visit An-nan Campus of NCKU
We visited a microalgae farm, which provided us with a wealth of knowledge                                         about the considerations needed to design a bioreactor. With the advices given,                                         we modified our bioreactor design for practical application in industry.

As a part of iGEMers, our team wishes to bridge the gap                                                 between laboratories and                                                 industry. In order to obtain more information about CO2 biofixation, we visited microalgae cultivation demonstration plant in                                                 An-Nan Campus of National Cheng-Kung University. The microalgae                                                 cultivation                                                 demonstration is a project managed by Professor Jo-Shu                                                 Chang, an expert in biofixation of CO2 from industry using                                                 marine                                                 algae. We toured their microalgae                                                 cultivation systems, and were impressed by their idea of converting                                                 microalgae into functional                                                 products. This inspired us to synthesis commercial products from                                                 CO2 in                                                 modified E. coli. They also                                                 provided us with a wealth of knowledge about the considerations needed                                                 to                                                 design a bioreactor for                                                 utilization of CO2 and evaluated cost effectiveness of our                                                 project.                                                 CO2 concentration in flue gas                                                 can be as high as 20~30%, thus it is necessary for us to lower the                                                 CO2 concentration level before                                                 entering bioreactor to increase carbon fixation efficiency. With the                                                 advices given, we modified our                                                 bioreactor design for practical application in industry.

Helping Another iGEM Team
Team:Newcastle have helped other iGEM teams. The first completed instance of assisting another team was with Team:UQ-Australia .
UQ-Australia
Team:Newcastle helped UQ-Australia with their modelling. UQ-Australia had previously been focusing on the Wet Lab Biology of their project, which is Bioprecipitation and Biofiltration. The model files which were written in the Matlab software environment are based on their Mercury Vacuum Project.
We prepared the model to sense Mercury and run the simulations with a quick tutorial on modelling.
Files
We sent UQ-Australia the following files.

NEU-China Visit their wiki
The cooperation with Northeastern University has begun since the summer vocation. We helped them complete a receptor and Working as a very kind and helpful team, they asked helping us in verifying one fuctional protein expression.
We helped NEU-China construct an olfactory receptor Rho-OR1A1.  The 64th base pair from the initiation codon of OR1A1 contains an illegal enzyme site (EcoRI), which didn't meet up RFC10 standard. So we designed the primer with synonymous codon and successfully mutated the GAA to GAG.(Figure 1.)
Figure 1. standardized Rho-OR1A1.
In our project, we need various functional vectors for dsRNA production，but the gene sequence complementarity will cause secondary structure, which is impossible to synthsize gene for one time. The task of constructing vectors is heavy.
So NEU-China students helped us construct a hpRNA producing vector ecrL, which speeded up our vectors construction progress. (Figure 2.)
Figure 2. PstI, EcoRI double enzyme digestion.
Really appreciate their support.
BIT-China Visit their wiki
After we meet up through vedio conference with BIT-China, We exchanged ideas and confirmed our collaboration relationship.
In the light of helping each other, we assisted them to build a new type of promoter.      At the same time, they helped us verify one functional protein expression.(Figure 1.)
BIT-China project requires mRFP to characterize the size of the sweetness. Different sweeteners have different gradients of sweetness, they need to get mutations of the inducible promoter Pfus and change its strength.
Figure 1. Mutant gene Pfus.
So we helped them  build a mutant gene of Pfus to make their project more responsive.
In our project,  pectinase and celluse play an important role in  downstream circuits and we want to combine functional dsRNA with these two proteins and let them work together, which will make great sense to our subsequent appllication"

CK is constructed by transforming BBa_K819010, a CheZ generator constructed by iGEM12_Peking, into CL1, and 01-CK, 06-CK and 17-CK are constructed by replacing the promoter of BBa_K819010 with J23101, J23106 and J23117 respectively.
The CheZ coding sequence of fused fragment is amplified from MG1655 (Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, HZAU), and the GFP coding sequence is from BBa_E0040.The termination codon of CheZ and the initiation codon of GFP are all deleted to construct fusion protein, and two fragment are linked with each other using a 18bp linker coding for 6 flexible amino acids.
2.2 Culture Condition
Unless otherwise stated, the Luria Broth, containing 0.5%yeast extraction(from OXIOD),1%NaCL and 1% tryptone(from OXIOD), were used during this project. A single frozen glycerol stock was used throughout this study for each bacterial strain. For each experiment, cells were transferred from corresponding frozen glycerol stock into LB containing appropriate concentration of antibody (chloramphenicol 250 microgram per ml), and cultured at 37 centigrade and 180 rpm until the OD600 reached between 0.5 and 1.0. Then according its OD600 dilute the culture till its OD600 becomes 0.01, then culture in the regular condition for about half an hour or more till its OD600 is about 0.2~0.3.
2.3 Measurement of Swarming Ability in Semi-Solid Agar
For preparation of semisolid plate for swarming assay, add 0.5g agar(from Vetec) into Conical flask containing 200ml LB to construct 0.25% agar semisolid plate. In a common sense, 200ml LB and 0.5g agar are added into a 500ml Conical flask then the flask is sealed to autoclave under 121 centigrade for 20min. The plates for swarming assay are prepared as follow. Using microwave oven to heat semi-solid plate for about 3 min, till it’s completely melting. Wait for about 20 min to let the broth cool down to about 60 centigrade. Pour the melting semi-solid agar into sterilized plate in super-clean bench and dry it for at least 1.5 hours. Then inoculate 3 micro liter of prepared culture on"

A weekend to awaken to the final product statements by transforming the discussions with the Heidelberg-crew to visual concepts.
August 30th
A week full of work began – but it was hard to get it started after the meeting with the Heidelberg-crew the week before. With this reached milestone our internal deadlines were gone. But as Prof. Ursula Damm wants to present some of our products on a conference called „life 3.0. and the future of evolution“ in Berlin on the 17th we have to hurry up anyway.
August 31st
We had an interview with a guy from “BioTech TV” who wanted to get an overview about our project. Asking – of course – why we as artists and designers take part in a competition about synthetic biology. Well"

Collaboration with iGEM Teams
As a team we thought that it was very important to work together with other teams, since iGEM is an effort to build a registry of parts together, as well as a competition.  We respectfully disagree with teams who work on their wiki behind the scenes and then upload it days before the deadline.  We think that collaboration is fostered if all teams can see how each other are progressing and ask for help from an appropriate team.  As it happened, our openness allowed Mexico to ask us for some of our constructs and fostered an extensive collaboration.
Teams
Sheffield iGEM
The Sheffield team needed an additional sample of pSB1C3, we were able to send them a stab.
 
UNAM Genomics Mexico
At the beginning of the Summer we established a collaboration with the team from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.  When they had problems measuring any light output we sent them our constructs, which gave them more success.  We also shared protocols for best measurement techniques.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Selection#SplitBetaLactamaseHitchHiker_-_-_TEXT.html," Evobody and the target protein each forming a translational fusion with one half of the split-protein, respectively. It is important to design the split-protein in a way that each half by itself is not functional. As proposed in literature, we dissected the beta-lactamase between Gly196 and Leu198, deleting 197. This site is supposed to be across from the active site of the enzyme while dividing it into fragments of similar size (Galarneau et al. 2002). In case of successful binding between an Evobody and the target protein, the two halves of the beta-lactamase should be sterically close enough to restore its functionality, thus granting ampicillin resistance to the host bacterium.
Hitchhiker-System
Same as the split-protein system, the hitchhiker-system is used to study protein-protein interactions. But instead of splitting the protein itself the TEM beta-lactamase without any natural export signal is fused to one binding protein while a signal peptide for the Tat (Twin-Arginine Translocation) pathway is fused to the other protein. In case of successful binding between the two proteins, the beta-lactamase is exported via the Tat pathway into the periplasm where it provides a functional antibiotic resistance. The Tat hitchhiker selection also enacts as a control for the protein folding, as only correctly folded proteins are exported (Waraho, DeLisa 2009).
Alongside the secretory pathway (Sec pathway), The twin-arginine translocation pathway (Tat pathway) is used in E. coli to export proteins through the membrane. In contrast to the Sec pathway, only folded proteins are exported via the Tat pathway. The name of the Tat pathway is due to the twin-arginine leader motif (S/TRRXFLK) of the signal peptide. Responsible for the translocation in E. coli are four cytoplasmic membrane proteins: TatA, TatB, TatC and TatE, where TatE appears to be homologous to TatA (Natale et al. 2008). However, the exact functionality has not been completely researched yet.  The signal peptide used for the hitchhiker export originates from pre-trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase (TorA). This enzyme is known to be exported by the Tat translocase in E. coli. While this signal is fused to the Evobody, a TEM-1 beta-lactamase with a deleted natural secretion signal is fused to the target protein. If the Evobody"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," no one else has explored before. Our iGEM project is an ideal example of this type of project. Focusing on the human practice component, I wanted to combine what I have learned as a mock trial competitor, debater, and future scientist to explore the feasibility and any potential obstacles that our project might encounter in the real world. When I don’t have my pipette at hand, glasses on, and juggling between school and humanitarian advocacy campaigns, I volunteer, do martial arts, and coach aspiring ninjas in my city.

Hello! My name is Rai and I am a current third year student at the University of Calgary. I am majoring in Biomedical Sciences and minoring in Health and Society. This is my first time being a part of iGEM and I can truly say that it has been a memorable summer. I have learned a lot, made great new friends, and have broken all of my previous records of caffeine intake and sleep deprivation. I have also learned that I am not a fan of parafilming. My response to most things either giggling or threatening to pipette stab. I really enjoy dancing, especially salsa, Bollywood movies, eating spicy food, the colour red, and I have always wanted a tiger cub for a pet.
Roberta Menezes
I have just graduated from University of Southampton, UK, with a BSc (Hons) in Biomedical Sciences. I love spending my summers volunteering in different labs around the world. I have done this previously at the University of Zaragoza, Spain, helping research on atherosclerosis, and at the Evandro Chagas Institute, a centre for tropical disease, in Brazil. It is my first time taking part in iGEM and it has been an amazing experience being involved in the wet lab part of the project. Not only have I experienced the world of synthetic biology, but I have also made many great friends. Some of my hobbies outside of the lab include, painting, dancing, and eating good food!

Tsinghua-A,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," half repeat showing similarity to only the first 20 amino acids of a full repeat. To reduce the risk of recombination events between the 17.5 highly homologous repeat sequences which is mentioned in the hypothesis part, we codon-optimized AvrBs3 applying the codon usage.
In a single Golden Gate cloning reaction, cloning efficiency is significantly reduced for assembly of 17 repeat modules. Therefore, we split the assembly in two successive steps. In the first cloning step, 10 repeats were assembled in one vector (K1311000, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311000:Design ). The preassembly vectors confer spectinomycin resistance and encode a lacZ-α fragment for blue/white selection. On both sides of the lacZ-α fragment a type IIS recognition sequence, BsaI, was positioned. Similarly, 11~17 repeats and NG-last-repeat were respectively ligated and inserted into another vector (K1311001, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311001:Design ). After preassembly of the 10 and 7 and last repeats using BsaI, the intermediate blocks were released via Esp3I and cloned into the final assembly vector (modified pTAL1) (K1311002, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311002:Design ). As is explained in the backbone part, we constructed a backbone with constitutive promoter which can express under normal condition, and another with a tetracycline-induced promoter, which is expressed with tet. Modified pTAL1 confers AmpR, and allows plasmid replication in E.coli. The vector pTAL1 also contains all elements of the final TALE expression construct, including TALE N’ and C’ arms, replication origin, etc., but a lacZ-α in between the left and right arms.
During the construction of wild-type control plasmid, we used the modified modules provided by our lab. In order to confirm our hypothesis, the designer TALEs were oligo-synthesized according to the results given by optimizing algorithm. We reserved the fusion sites for golden gate reaction, and broke each repeats into 2 parts. After annealing in PCR amplifier, the linear sequence of the repeats can be added to the golden gate reaction and be ligated with the primary vector and continue further ligation to accomplish the final construction.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". This made it so >500nM enzyme is needed to see enzyme activity in assays.  In order to be used to detect relevant levels of TCS in wastewater the enzyme must have measurable activity at concentrations lower than the concentrations of triclosan in wastewater ( up to 9nM).  Therefore, we have begun to explore the use of enzyme engineering to enhance activity on trans-2-pentenal!

Fortunately a crystal structure for the P. falciparum FabI enzyme had already been determined[28]. We used the computational tool Foldit (See 1 ,
2,
3 ) to design 28 mutants. We hypothesized the trans-2-pentenal would occupy a highly similar structural space as triclosan. Analysis of triclosan bound to NADH in the active site revealed that the phenyl ring of triclosan lined up face to face with the ring of NADH forming a pi-stacking interaction. We hypothesized that if we could increase the pi-stacking interaction by mutating residues around the triclosan-NADH site to be aromatic residues, we might be able to increase the enzyme’s activity on trans-2-pentenal.
Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory . The sequence verified mutant genes were cloned into our expression strain of E. coli and protein produced and purified as described in our Notebook [LINK]. From this initial round of 28 mutants, 23 expressed as soluble protein. Of the solubly expressed designs 4 of the designs had no effect on function, and 19 decreased activity.   However, one of the enzymes resulted in 1.5x increase in activity against the non-natural trans-2-pentenal substrate.
We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens. While the enzyme activity needs to be improved ~100-fold in order to achieve levels of activity observed on the native substrate, this is well within reach of enzyme engineering efforts based on previous successes [30][31][32] Sources:

In the lab we used an EPOCH spectrophotometer to run our assays. At a price tag of ~$10,000 this device is definitely out of the budget range of a high school teacher, so we looked for a more appropriately priced alternative.

Colony PCR on more transformants containing pSB1C3 with NisB and NisRK was repeated, using VF2 (BBa_G00100) and VR (BBa_G00101). This time, a  correct insert size wasbfound for a NisRK transformant.
Because there was still no correct insert size found for a NisB  transformant, the remaining NisB colonies were tested for a correct insert size. No positive transformants were found.
 
8 - 14 September
 
A PCR was done on all the genes that contained illegal restriction sites: NisI, NisT, NisP and NisFEG. This should generate multiple PCR fragments for each gene, that will be assembled again using Gibson assembly. The PCR was split into two seperate reactions because of the large differences between the size of the different fragments. Fragments were sorted on < 750 kb and > 750 kb. Experiment not continued because of time limits.
 
14 - 21 September
 
Because of the constant low concentrations of the plasmid pSB1C3 with the new BioBricks, it was decided to transform the isolated pSB1C3 with the new BioBricks (NisA, NisC, NisRK, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs)) again in Escherichia coli DH5α.  The pSB1C3 plasmids containing the new BioBricks were again isolated. For each transformation, two seperate cultures were grown in LB with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A miniprep was done on the cultures and the insert size was checked with colony PCR with VF2 (BBa_G00100) and VR (BBa_G00101)  primers and the a restriction analysis was done using EcoRI and PstI. Cultures that showed a correct insert size were sent for sequencing.
 
22 - 28 September
 
SEQUENCING RESULTS
 
A PCR was done to generate fragments for assembling genes that had illegal restriction sites. Every fragment was succesfully amplified. The fragments were purified using the GeneJET PCR clean up kit. were not fully clean, so only the fragments for the combined BioBrick of NisF, NisE and NisG was made using Gibson assembly. The transformants that contained pSB1C3 with NisFEG were tested using colony PCR. No positive transformants were found.

Introduction
In last week's lab session, we had received some BBa_J33206 + pSB1A2 DNA in it's original form by Chris French (the person who submitted the BioBrick to the Parts Registry) as well as both PCR and Sequencing primers. Whilst we used the sequencing primers to determine the sequence of the midi-prepped BBa_J33206 DNA derived from the Parts Registry, we also attempted to transform some DH5-alpha E. coli bacteria with the original BBa_J33206 BioBrick sent to us.
In today's lab session, the plates on which the transformed cells were placed will be examined for colonies; if colonies should be present then they will be used to inoculate LB media in preparation for mini-preps.
Observations
Both of the LB+amp plates (one with 200ul of transformants and one with 500ul of transformants - left photograph and right photograph respectively) used to grow the transformant DH5-alpha E. coli cells were covered in hundreds of colonies - almost like a lawn of bacteria could be seen on the plates. This suggests that the transformation rate was very high; this is expected considering we were sent pure DNA. The only thing to note was that the 500ul plate seemed to contain dense, large round colonies in addition to the E. coli cells; this may be contamination.
Procedure
In light of these observations, a total of 6 tubes of 5ml LB solution were innoculated with the transformed E. coli cells. The first three tubes"

Figure 1: Irradiation at probe for sun light, room light and a 200 W bulb. The vertical, dotted lines indicate the borders between UV, visible light and IR.
For our project we needed to quantify the irradiance of different light sources, like sun light, room light, various bulbs, LEDs and a UV transilluminator. We discretized the irradiance spectra of these sources and converted the energy flux [J m-2 s-1 nm-1] to the photons flux Nλ [mol m-2 s-1 nm-1].
For sun light we used the reference irradiation ASTMG173, which is the irradiation averaged over all US states over one year at an inclined plane at 37° tilt towards the equator. For artificial light sources we assumed reasonable distances to our probe and perpendicular irradiation. Room light was defined as 30 % of natural sun light and considers UV absorption of window glass. The specifications, references and assumptions of the light sources used can be found on our parameter page .
Figure 1 shows a comparison of the spectra of sun light, room light and the standard General Electric 200 W bulb.
We were aware, that light can be polarized, directed and non-coherent, but these characteristics were not relevant for our approximation.
Photoconversion cross section
Figure 2: Photoconversion cross sections calculated for various receptors. ""-a/d"" indicate activation and deactivation of a receptor.
To compute the fraction of the photon flux which in fact triggers an event we used the photoconversion cross section. This is a measure of the probability of such an event and is derived from Beer-Lambert law .
The photoconversion cross section [m2 mol-1] at wavelength λ, is defined as σλ = 2.303 ελ Φλ, where ε [m2 mol-1] is the molar extinction coefficient and Φ is the quantum yield, i.e. the fractions photons actually inducing a receptor activation after being absorbed.
Figure 2 shows the results of this computation for activation (-a) and deactivaton (-b) of all receptors.
Since for most of the receptors only absorption spectra and extinction coefficients at absorption peak wavelengths were available, we assumed the extinction coefficient at each wavelength would be proportional to absorption. Furthermore we assumed the quantum yield would be independent of wavelength. More details are available on our parameter page .
Reaction rate constants
The first order reaction rate constants [s-1] for our ODE model can be computed as integral over all events at all wavelengths, i.e. the integral of the product"

We found out, that the AdhA from L. Lactis is the best alcohol dehydrogenase in literature ( Atsumi et al., 2010 ). We wanted to increase the production of isobutanol by cloning the adhA gene downstream of our producing pathway. By Gibson we designed a new part ( BBa_K1465301 ) which contains the coding sequence of the adhA gene from L. Lactis and is combined with the RBS BBa_B0034 . Afterwards we did several BioBrick assemblies for combining the parts BBa_K731500 , BBa_K1465302 and BBa_K1465302 . You can find a schematic illustration of our created BioBrick BBa_K1465307 in Figure 2B.

Experiment Procedure:
Add nitrate to the cell suspension.
The positive control will be...
The negative control will be no nitrate in the suspension.
Used a narK E. coli mutant which does not transport nitrate  across the membrane.  Adding  octylglucoside to the cell suspension increased
membrane permeability for  NO3.  When it was transported into the  cell it was reduced to NO2.  Adding N3  caused decreased NO3 and
thus nitrate reductase activity.
Nitrate uptake was sensed with nitrate ion selective  electrodes.

Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmids are maintained by high concentrations of antibiotics like chloramphenicol and kanamycin in our case, thus they will disappear and be degraded in the absent of antibiotics if there’s horizontal gene transfer concern. In addition, we always killed all the materials including bacteria by standard autoclave procedure before letting them leave the lab, so it won’t cause any risk to environment quality.
D. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
Our bacteria will only be alive in production process, it will be killed right away after placing it on the test strip. A Blood Alcohol Meter will not contain any live bacteria we produced. And the genes on the plasmid vector maintained by antibiotics are supposed not to be present for a long time in a normal environment. Moreover, the gene encodes an oxidoreductase enzyme used by the methylotrophic yeast in nature. The gene products are not harmful to human and the environment."

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Isobutanol#Isobutanol_-_-_TEXT.html," table 3 you can find a list of the span of applications and how much isobutanol is applied for the various uses in the United States.
Table 3: Industrial applications of isobutanol and their required amounts ( INCHEM, 2004 ; Bizzari, 2002 )

As the table shows there are three big markets for isobutanol in the United States. The largest one is the production of zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDP). ZDDP is an additive for lube oils, greases and hydraulic fluids, which work as anti-wear and corrosion inhibitors.
The conversion of isobutanol to isobutyl acetate is the second largest market. Applications of isobutyl acetate are for example coating, adhesives, or cosmetic/personal care solve ( DOW ).
The use of isobutanol as a solvent is the third largest market. It is mainly used for surface coatings and adhesives. Hence it is used as a latent solvent in surface coatings or even as a processing solvent in the production of e.g. pesticides and pharmaceuticals.( INCHEM, 2004 ) These tables show the importance of isobutanol for industrial use and large amounts are needed all over the world.
We thought about different additional applications of isobutanol during our lively policy and practices discussion. You can find our suggestions here

At each single conjugation event, with the expression relaxase, the corresponding tandem oriT pair is lost with the rolling-circle replication. Sequential conjugation and deletion of the different oriT pairs can be achieved by fine control of relaxase expression. To report the ending of tandem conjugation process, a reporter gene is attached after the last oriT pair, and hence expresses after all conjugation events happened.The resulting tandem signaling conjugation process will allow them to develop networks of bacteria capable of sequentially assembling tasks.
The riboregulator system was incorporated in Into their circuit to provide  an interface for interaction between their conjugation system and general genetic devices  to realize the goal of assembly line. According to the data that they measured, they concluded that  the open ratios of Key1 -Lock1 and Key 2-Lock1, the open ratio of key1-Lock1 was 3.3 times higher than  Key2-Lock1.

Violacein Pigments
Background Design Characterisation Reference
Background
Violacein Biosynthesis
The Violacein pigment is produced from L-tryptophan via a pathway involving five enzymes, VioA-E. This forms a purple colour which remains within the individual cell colonies. This synthesis pathway is shown below:
From August et al (2000).
The vioE is used in the step just after the vioB for the 1-2 shift of the indole ring. Sánchez et. al (2006)
Further, as module 5 is Aqua, expressing the genes under different promoters will allow us to produce at least two different colours. Sanchez suggests that removing vioD can produce a dark blue, while removing vio C produces a dark green. Our actual results showed that the ABDE construct produced a dark green pigment while the ABCE produced light green.
Vio Operon
Our VioA-E genes are from Chromobacterium voilaceum ATCC 12472 in the pPSX vio+ plasmid. This was kindly provided by John Pemberton; Department of Microbiology and parasitology, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. (Sarovich & Pemberton (2007) Plasmid 57:306-313)
pPSX sequence ID FJ422118
vio gene cluster complete cds AB032799 and AF172851.
We aim to successfully express violacein in E. coli, to synthesize the violacein operon as a biobrick, and to manipulate the operon to produce the other two pigments.

COLLABORATION
During the summer time, we helped a new high school iGEM team, SKLBC-GDSYZX, with their project. We invited members of SKLBC-GDSYZX to our laboratory for a three-day experimental training to help them gain a better understanding of synthetic biology. We completed a part for their project. In addition, we tested the software they designed and provide them with feedbacks to improve it. At the meantime, we received suggestions about our project from Dr. Zhang Simin, one of the instructors of SKLBC-GDSYZX.
The Collaborations track of team SKLBC-GDSYZX can be found as follows:

Meetup    2015 July 14th
During the day, members of three software teams, i.e. SKLBC-China, SYSU-Software and SKLBC-GDSYZX, and three laboratory teams, i.e. SCUT, SCUT-China and our team, gathered in the conference room of our institute. We discussed and exchanged thoughts about the relationships and interactions between the “wet” and “dry” work of synthetic biology. At this meet-up, we also shared our previous experience attending iGEM with two new teams, SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX.
Experiment train   2015 August 7th- 9th
Team SKLBC-GDSYZX’s project was to develop an online panel app, with which iGEMers can easily paint their gene circuits. As we know, a good product must meet the needs of customers. However, as a new high school team, members of SKLBC-GDSYZX were not familiar with the iGEMers’ demand when designing the app. In order to help them to get a better understanding of synthetic biology, we organized a series of basic genetic circuit constructing experiments during August 7th- 9th.

Competition
In this day and age the amount of data generated is as important as having good algorithms that employ it. While our competitors might use the best screening assays now available, our invention will allow to move from thousands of mutants in a day to millions of mutants in an hour. A change of this scale matters - large amount of data will allow our AI to evolve into new horizons, including the swift generation of novel enzymatic reactions and multiple enzyme metabolic route optimization.
Risks
The greatest risk we face is a technical one. As our company will be built around cutting edge technology and innovation, every research and development milestone we may miss might be crucial. That said, we have a clear strategy on how we will mitigate this risk in a consistent way – goal oriented development. By focusing on the end goal rather then specific paths leading to it, we can be more flexible on how we will reach it. That means that we can make sure we reach milestones in time by changing the particular approach along the way, and also having multiple parallel approaches to each objective.
Marketing
We believe that presenting our system in the iGEM competition and delivering it to scientists all over the world as an open-source system will help us to make a first strong step and impression. Later, our plan is to build a company network by participating in startup competitions, trade shows and conferences such as JP Morgan or BIO international, which may be an excellent environment to meet potential business partners and customers.
Furthermore, we are planning to prepare educational videos for students, open-source computational tools for scientist and blog articles for general public on various life science topics.
SWOT analysis
1. Strengths
We use and have patented a state of the art system CAT-Seq which allows to precisely screen billions of catalytic biomolecule variants and record their sequence to activity relationship. It is a completely new speed scale of data acquisition.
Together with CAT-Seq system we are utilizing what we believe are the next generation neural networks - Generative Adversarial Networks. Yet, to be accurate they require an enormous amount of sequence to activity data for each sequence, which only the CAT-Seq can provide.
Strong team consisting of people with years of experience in the fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology.
2. Weaknesses

Mo gave us relevant advice when we were choosing small molecules that our receptors can target. We originally had selected VEGF and d-dimer to target cancer, which Prof. Mo thought was feasible. He introduced that the significance of d-dimer in postoperative diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer had been reported in the literaturE. He also believed that the application of this molecule in tumor targeting and treatment would be a new and meaningful idea by linking two closely related diseases, cardiovascular diseases and tumors, toether.

It was a great honor to have a breakfast meeting with Prof. Roman Jerala. As an expert in the field of synthetic biology, he has led the Slovenian team to participate in iGEM for many years and has achieved remarkable results. We talked about our project design and details of protein design in our experiment. He thought that our two-chain system can be improved and simplified into one system. Inspired by this, we evaluated the possibility of a flexible linker and its cutting of another chain. Prof. Roman Jerala provided a unique view for our project which improved the STEP system's protein structures and gene expressions.
Dr. Jiaxue Wu Principal Investigator, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering    School of life sciences, Fudan University
How to reduce the background noise? We ran into many problems when testing our STEP system on 293T cells and Hela cells. For example, during the process of testing the activation of the STEP system, we found that the response of the system contained a lot of system noise. Wu, a researcher in the National Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering who specializes in the field of cells, suggested us to solve the problem of system noise by reducing the transfection concentration of the whole two chains in the system. He thought that we hadn't constructed enough cell membranes which were capable of accommodating the artificial receptors. Moreover, if the number of plasmids transfected into the cell was large enough to express two strands, it was less likely for some of the artificial receptors to be located on the cell membrane. Because of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) on the transcription factor we had designed, the expression of the downstream gene circuit was directly activated. Therefore, it is possible to solve this problem by reducing the amount of transfection.

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2015,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," With these magnetosomes inside them, they are able to align passively to the earth’s magnetic field so as to swim along geomagnetic field lines. This behaviour is called magnetotaxis and is beneficial to their survival by aiding them to reach regions of optimal oxygen concentrations at minimal energy cost [4].
Azotobacter vinelandii - What and Why?
Although magnetotactic bacteria produces magnetosomes, these bacteria are notorious for the difficulty to cultivate owing to their micro-aerophilic nature. Elaborate growth techniques are required, and they are difficult to grow on the surface of agar plates, introducing problems in mutant screening [5].
The lack of effective methods of DNA transfer in these microorganisms is a challenge too. Luckily, the situation is improving due to better technologies recently and some of the genes from M. magnetotacticum were confirmed functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, a common lab bacteria strain. This shows that the transcriptional and translational elements of the two microorganisms are compatible. With such good news, a number of previous iGEM teams including Kyoto-2014, OCU-China-2013, Washington-2011 and UNIK_Copenhagen-2013 have been working with transferring the magnetosome-related genes to E. coli. Some exciting results about the formation of magnetosome membrane in E. coli (by the Kyoto-2014 team) has been reported, however, never the whole magnetosome.

We wonder why magnetosomes seem so hard to be formed in E. coli. And then, we come up with a hypothesis - the formation of magnetosome requires a micro-aerobic or anaerobic environment as the magnetotatic bacteria are all living micro-aerobically.
Therefore, we chose a new bacteria to work on our magnetosome project - Azotobacter vinelandii.
A. vinelandii is gram-negative diazotroph (nitrogen-fixing microorganism). It is a soil bacterium related to the Pseudomonas genus that fixes nitrogen under aerobic conditions while having enzymatic mechanisms protecting its oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from oxidative damage. This finding shows that A. vinelandii could be an excellent host for the production and characterization of oxygen-sensitive proteins or organelles in our case [6].
With the biggest advantage of using Azotobacter that it being an aerobe providing an intracellular anaerobic environment, we can grow it easily in normal lab conditions without expensive equipments, while fulfilling the formation criteria for magnetosome.  Besides, most parts in registry are compatible"
