Colony PCR
Colony PCR was done to verify propagation of pACYC1Duet-1_Lin-Tn5 after transformation from 28-06-2018. This plasmid contains the Lin-Tn5 or Tn5-Lin insert, which can be checked with primers 029 and 030. There are two ways for colony PCR. The first one is picking a colony and directly resuspending the cells in PCR mixture. The second one is resuspending the colony in MilliQ, heating the suspension, centrifugation the broken cell pieces and taking the supernantant for PCR. In orde to test the efficiency of both methods, I tested both simultaneously. 22 colony PCR were performed by picking the colony and direct resuspension in the PCR mixture, while 20 colonies were picked and heated prior to pipetting the DNA into the PCR mixture.

Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and  extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus  improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and  applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status  becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the  topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could  further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that  examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of  restrictive legal protections.

Design
Our project is to make a new biological mosquito killer to kill mosquitoes in an environmental friendly way. There are mainly two active components in our product: protein Cry11Aa and recombinant Aedes aegypti densoviruses. We mixed them together to make effective and environmental friendly mosquito killer. Our product shows a high specificity for mosquitoes as a host. It is relatively stable in the environment and have the potential to spread and persist in mosquito populations.
How do they work?
Cry proteins
Protein Cry11Aa is produced as protoxins that are solubilized in the mosquito midgut lumen due to its characteristic pH and reducing conditions. The soluble protoxins are then activated by midgut proteases to release the toxin fragment. The Cry toxic fragment binds to specific receptors located in the microvilli of the apical membrane of midgut epithelial cells. Oligomerization of the toxin that follows leads to membrane insertion, pore formation and cell lysis [1].
BmK IT1
BmK IT1 is an excitatory insect-specific toxin from Buthus martensii Karsch, and  it is an insect-selective single-chain neurotoxic polypeptide that is composed of 88 amino acid residues cross-linked by four disulfide bridges. It has been shown to affect insect neuronal sodium conductance by binding to excitable sodium channels [2].
Adedes aegypti densoviruses
Adedes aegypti densoviruses are small, autonomous, non-enveloped DNA viruses with small single-stranded DNA genomes. These viruses are pathogenic to their hosts, they replicate in the nuclei of cells of mosquitoes and cause characteristic histopathological signs, which include hypertrophied, densely stained nuclei [3].
Protein design
Our project is consist of two parts: the protein part and the virus part.
This is an overview of our protein part . First of all, we extracted genome of Bt.i, and then use PCR to amplify the target gene Cry11Aa. These target sequences were then assembled into the expression vector pEASY-Blunt and then transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3)."

Science journey with stamps
Time:2017.7.9
Place: The hall in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum
Remember that we cooperated with Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum (ZJSTM) to build a Community Lab in 2015( 2015ZJUwiki )? Today, it has become a part of the AST(art, science, and technology) space! This year, we cooperated with Hangzhou Foreign Languages School and Hangzhou No.2 High School iGEM team as well as AST space, and held the activity in a greater arena and lager scale. As we hoped, a lot of children signed up and participated in this mysterious journey, and as they said,learned a lot in this activity.
Stamp by step
We hold the activity as a “garden party”, that meant the children could join us at any time during the activity. All you need to do was to sign up and get a card for collecting stamps, and choose the items you like. When you finished one mission under our instruction, we would stamp on the card, which could be used to win awards later.
During the activity, curious children surrounded every table and of course, every team member. They did the missions carefully, watched us stamping on their cards happily, and went to next station curiously.
Stamp by stamp, step by step, our science journey started!
Learning while doing
We along with the high school iGEM team prepared seven items for the garden party, including drawing with fluorescent protein,”flying on whiteboard” , crystal glue and so on. Through the items, participants could learn rudimentary knowledge of synthetic biology, and improve their abilities in STEM.
The most popular item was drawing with fluorescent protein.
Firstly,we transferred the plasmids (BBa_J06702, BBa_E0240, BBa_K592012, BBa_K1491005, BBa_E1010,BBa_592011) gotten from the kit plate in to E.coli DH5α. Then we prepared these pl"

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ON to TetR-ON.
The core elements of this epigenetic memory are the two mutually regulated promoters (see Figure 1), each designed as a constitutive promoter flanking an indipendent operator site. In this way, the promoter transcriptional strength and the repressor binding affinity can be independently fixed. Mathematical model analysis and computer simulations were used to obtain a rational design of the regulated promoters. By the model we found the analytic relationships to quote the regulated promoter in terms of transcriptional strength and sensitivity to the repressor and we established such a relevant circuit properties as the bistability and the dynamical response to inputs .
Figure 2. Range of bistability for the genetic Flip-Flop
As shown in Figure 2, the coexistence of two stable equilibria (LacI-ON and TerR-ON) is guaranteed for
and
model parameters greater than 3 in a large range of values (bistability range). To have a good robustness we fixed
and
equal to 10. For this value the circuit is sufficently distant from the bifurcation lines to avoid random memory switching but it is possible to set (or to reset) the memory with proper UV and IPTG stimulations .
Since the Registry lacks promoters with the K-parameter equal to 10, we decided to introduce operator site parts in order to build regulated promoter with the fixed transcriptional strenght and repression sensitivity. Thus, we synthesized four libraries of operator sequences, respectively for LacI , TetR , cI and LexA repressor proteins ( see details ). In each library, there are three sequences each with a different repressor binding affinity to the repressor protein. We isolated each operator with the intention to clone them into BioBrick standard assembly plasmids.
We assessed the functionality of independent operators by assembling one circuit (Figure 3, closed-loop configuration) where the constitutive promoter BBa_J23118 and LacI operator 2 were auto-regulated by the LacI repressor. GFP was used as the reporter. An identical construct without the LacI operator site was used as the negative control (Figure 3, open-loop configuration).

BsaI enzyme finally arrived. So the constructions of BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +linker+Kcoil and BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE B +linker+Kcoil in Golden Gate reaction were performed. The ligation reactions were run on the gel and expected bands were observed. However, the transformation was unsuccessful because of the new competent cells.
The PCR products of TALE A and TALE B without the Kozak sequence were run on a 1% gel and contained a lot of non specific amplification.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
The 5 TALE B target sequences were sequence verified and are good.
We repeated PCR of TALE A and TALE B without the Kozak sequence and it worked (figure 18), so the PCR products were ligated with BBa_J04500 and successfully transformed. Subsequent colony PCR showed some positive results (figures 19 and 20).

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Secretion_-_-_TEXT.html,"1C3-phaCAB only. However, there is very little difference between the two groups at 24 hours (Figure 3). Therefore it can be inferred that PHB secretion with Phasin-HlyA increased only after at least 24 hours of incubation and that Phasin-HlyA Tag was successful in increasing secretion of PHB by E. coli. The production of ""secreted"" PHB in control cells may not be PHB that was actually secreted, but instead it may be PHB that was released into the media as a result of cell death and lysis, which is a normal part of the E. coli life-cycle. More details on our experimental results can be found on our Results page!
Figure 3: Experimental results of secretion assay. (-) is used to denote negative control, pSB1C3-PhaCAB and (pSB1C3-Phasin) is used to denote PHB-secreting strains, pSB1C3-PhaCAB-Phasin-HlyA Tag. There is a 40 % increase in the amount of PHB secreted by (pSB1C3-Phasin) compared to (-) after 48 hours.
SDS-PAGE to identify production of Phasin-HlyA
To confirm protein expression we carried out SDS-Page of E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA Tag. BL21(DE3) transformed with an empty pSB1C3 vector was used as a control. Both E. coli were incubated to an OD550 between 0.4-0.8 then induced with IPTG. IPTG is necessary to induce the expression of T7 RNA polymerase in BL21(DE3) so that our Phasin-HlyA-Tag could be transcribed by the T7 polymerase. The culture was then separated into soluble and insoluble fractions, as well as supernatant, which we hoped would contain the Phasin protein. Initial SDS-Page experiments (Figure 4) showed too many protein bands to be able to see a band for Phasin-HlyA Tag (27 kDa), therefore we prepared anti-FLAG resin and incubated the sample fractions with it in to separate our Phasin protein from the other proteins that were present. After incubation with the resin, the sample fraction was run on an SDS-PAGE gel, the results of which can be seen in Figure 4. All lanes of the gel appeared empty, even samples from our pSB1C3"

Talk to Dementia patients- Weinberg-Rauhes Haus
Since the age of 14 I have been regularly exposed to the beautiful and perilous aspects of growing old and taking care of the elderly. I started out by occasionally helping out in a dementia home in Hamburg with a family friend who works with therapy dogs for the elderly. Then right after graduating high school I worked in Alzheimer’s research at Roche for 9 months and through that I got to meet a lot of people very passionate about this, whilst also getting a good insight into the pharma side of things.
It has been two years since my work at Roche and I’ve spent my other summers either working in"
EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"                       sequence (let-7d-5p, two mismatches only) was proved to be significantly lower, as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Left: Real-time fluorescent measurements of specificity RCA reaction by means of SYBR Green I. Concentrations are referred to the reagents before being put in the RCA solution. Measurements were done with                           1 nM of let-7a-5p and let-7d-5p, with the concentration of probe in all samples being 1 μM. All the values are blank-subtracted. Right: Fluorescence intensity for the two different miRNAs at 120-min time point.
Cas12a assay for detection
Nonetheless, as Qiu et al., 2018 pointed out, the sensitivity of SYBR Green I is too limited for detecting circulating miRNA concentration (which ranges from fM levels                       to pM level), due to its high background and unstable output. Despite the positive results, therefore, the amplification step alone is not sufficient and highlights the need of a secondary-stage mechanism to increase miRNA detection                       sensitivity, in our case the Cas12a detection system.
After amplification, the RCA products were tested with the Cas12a detection assay: each RCA product was placed in solution with the Cas12a/gRNA complex and the fluorescence-quenched substrate DNase Alert, as explained in the Protocols.
From our assay, we expected to obtain a fluorescent signal from DNase Alert proportional to the concentration of the amplicon (i.e. to the concentration of miRNA in the original sample).
More specifically, due to the fact that the PAM sequence was only present in the amplicon of the probe, and not in the probe itself (more details in “Detailed Design”), we did not expect activation in control samples containing all                       the RCA reagents but no miRNA.
On the contrary, results showed activation also for samples where the RCA product contained no miRNA (i.e. no amplicon either), and moreover the activation was proved to be comparable to the samples containing miRNA, with no difference                       among different concentrations of miRNA (Figure 5).

This was symptomatic of a potential saturation of the detection system and led"
Genspace,2016,Team:Genspace#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"ests on 7/18/16
Counted colonies on plates from the desiccation experiment conducted on 7/19/16
Transformation was done after the ligation
Results: Ligated parts of the digests and continued with the 3A Assembly. The transformation steps went well and the plates will be inspected tomorrow. The colonies from the desiccation experiment was pretty consistent with the first.
Week 5: July 24 - July 30
7/25/16:
Objective: Troubleshooting issues with GFP and RFP transformation
The plates did not come out the way we wanted it to be. So therefore an investigation of what we did for the past week was listed
Day 1: Transforming E.coli - positive control worked therefore the transformation should work
Day 2: Colony selection and Colony PCR - might have selected wrong colonies to work with
Day 3: PCR clean ups - found foreign DNA inside samples after the cleanup was done
Day4: Transformation using legations - possibly wrong backbone/ not enough backbone or possible error with ligation
Used old plates and re selected colonies for Colony PCR
Results: The transformation from yesterday did not turn out the way it's suppose to be. Therefore we came up possible errors that may occurred during different days. As a result we re conducted the experiment from Colony selection hoping that it would work this time.
7/26/16:
Objective: Continuing to troubleshoot
PCR cleanup the RFP and GFP
Made 0.7% agarose gel for viewing the base pairs of the plasmid mini preps
Gel results weren’t great, most likely due to using incorrect pipette size
Plasmid mini prep of the GFP and RFP
Qubit readings of the RFP and GFP after the plasmid mini prep
Digested upstream (RFP), downstream (GFP), and backbone (pSB1A3)
Results: Everyone on the team ended up redoing all the steps from past week. We are hoping that we can identify the problem through this rerun.
7/27/16:
Objective: Finishing troubleshooting
Worked with remaining components of 3A assembly (ligation + transformation)
Produced 0.7% agarose gel to see results of digest
Replicated linearized plasmid backbones using PCR
Began collaborating with Stony Brook University
Results: Last day of troubleshooting our mistakes. Hope everything will turn out the way we wanted tomorrow. The plates will be viewed tomorrow as well.

Collaboration with Team SDSZ China
A member from Team SDSZ China, approached us in April and mentioned the possibility of
consulting with us about iGEM competition. We agreed with alacrity, knowing the difficulty of
setting up a high-school team without assistance, to meet with her.
Several days later, we met with her on the campus of Tsinghua University and discussed wide-ranging matters
from how to participate in the iGEM competition to how to search for literature, including using PubMed
to search for Synthetic Biology papers. She was especially uncertain about the usage, creation and
delivery of BioBricks, and asked a lot of great questions, such as “how to define a ‘new’ BioBrick
eligible for earning a bronze or silver medal” and “how to deliver a newly created BioBrick to the
iGEM headquarter”. We were not only impressed by her familiarity with the competition, but also started
to appreciate the role of BioBricks in standardizing the use of plasmids for synthetic biology – it should
be educated to every researcher in the Synthetic Biology field because it permits convenient plasmid
sharing and inter-laboratory communication.
Reciprocally, we also benefited from their team. We were enlightened by their project – developing a cheap
penicillin detection method for people within relatively underdeveloped areas, and glad to find out
that the influence of iGEM has permeated into high schools and spurred the participation of high school
students in the iGEM competition. We were edified both by their intricate idea of fusing GFP with
penicillin binding protein and therefore creating a visual assay for evaluating the efficacy of penicillin
detection, and by its potentially far-reaching application for consumers with below-average income. What
did we learn? When designing a project, especially on topics that are entangled with practical and
industrial purposes, we should not only take into account how to make the idea fancier, but should also
heed the practicality of the project – is it valuable for the non-academic community? Can it be easily
understood by laymen and applied in daily lives? In addition, they also provided insightful advice on
how to improve our Wiki, such as the"

To induce the quorum sensing module of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae into BaKillus, two different parts had to be transferred to B. subtilis: First, the two component system  AgrCA of S. aureus or ComDE of S. pneumoniae need to be established for B. subtilis to sense and respond to the quorum sensing molecules of the specific pathogen. As a second step, the QS-activated promoters (PQS) need to be transformed into B. subtilis to trigger the expression of our killing factors.

Selecting natural standard promoters
Once we had the metagenomic DNA extraction performed by our robot, we wanted to clone a library of fragments coming from this DNA in the pAcGFP1-1 plasmid             (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). This plasmid contains a GFP protein placed downstream the MCS, so if a promoter sequence is inserted in the polylinker, the             expression of the fluorescent protein is triggered and thus fluorescent transformants can be easily detected.
We digested both the plasmid and the metagenomic DNA with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamHI and then purified the resulting fragments (Figure 2).
Figure "
UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#Inclusivity_-_-_TEXT.html,"? There are many ways, but different things work differently for different groups of people. So, we encourage everyone to do their own research and build a model that will work best for their team. But here are a few ideas [5]:
Listen - it is important when making a safe space that everyone feels heard. This means that groups should talk openly about their concerns without having these concerns questioned or addressed in that moment. That can look like one on one check ins (done hopefully by a PI), or conversation circles, these are times just to listen.
Make your group diverse - It is very hard to have a safe space when people might not feel represented, as a lack of representation may lead to them feeling isolated, or like there is a lack of empathy. By making a group diverse you make all people feel as though they have a place in this community.
Make this a goal and make change - Any group can say they are diverse or inclusive. We must work together towards actual change. This means that we must remove our blindfold to those things which might be holding our group back, and fight for improvement.
Reevaluate - Once you have created a safe space your work is not over. You must work to continue and develop it.
Start the conversation
Having a conversation seems simple (and it is) but it’s very important because the best way to find out what the issues are and to start to address them is to talk. Every team should try to sit down and talk honestly and openly about inclusivity on their team. They should be able to do this in a safe space where individuals won't be attacked for their opinions but listened to so that their team can grow and become more inclusive, because no team is perfect. These conversations can take place in an open conversation, through an online forum, or through check ins- but they should happen. Don’t be afraid to address problems of inclusivity head on!
Actively try to make your space more diverse
It is important to make your group more diverse. This does not just look like having a diverse group in terms of faculty, or having a few token people of colour or queer folks. What making a diverse group looks like is breaking down the barriers that may prohibit particular groups of people from entering iGEM. We recognize that having a diverse group should not forced but should be natural. However, in order to break down status quo diversity should be strived for actively.
Examine How You Build Your Team
Research by the American National Academy of Science has shown that diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams on problem-solving tasks. [1]The creation of homogeneous teams is thus"

The samples were incubated for 3.5 hours in the incubator 37 °C, followed by PCR cleanup. The enzymes were heat inactivated for 10 minutes 80 °C.
PCR clean-up
PCR clean-up is according to the protocol for all the restricted framgents. Elution was done in two times 15uL Milli-Q.
High Fidelity PCR
To amplify dxCas9 (~4207bp), high fidelity PCR was done using the fusionbb as template DNA and fw_bb_dxcas9 and rv_bb_dxcas9_2 as forward and reverse primers respectively. 6 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol.
The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 2:30 and an annealing temperature of 63 °C. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 12 °C.
DNA Gel Electrophoresis
The different PCR products from PACYCduet-fusionfs (21/9) were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 3μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.

Conclusion
The LACE system provides a straightforward and robust optogenetic method to regulate the expression of endogenous genes using the CRISPR/tCas9 system. When co-transfected with gRNAs into E.coli that are stimulated with blue light, LACE produces a high level of transcriptional activation, in some cases, comparable to those observed with tCas9-VP64.

Description
What is Parkinson's Disease?
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra in the brain. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter and important messenger between two brain regions, the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum, is necessary for controlled movements. Shortages of dopamine cause communication between the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum to become ineffective and, as a result, basic movement becomes impaired. The greater the loss of dopamine, the worse the movement-related symptoms. This is why many individuals afflicted with PD express symptoms of shaking, rigidity, slowness in movement, impaired balance, and difficulty in walking, among other things. As symptoms get worse, essential actions such as chewing, talking, or even swallowing may become difficult for an individual. Dementia, loss of sense of smell, and cognitive impairment are also apparent in the most advanced stages of PD.
What are the current Treatments?
While it is well known that a lack of dopamine causes the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s, it is unclear why PD develops and why dopamine-producing cells in the brain begin to deteriorate. Despite this, there are a number of established treatments that aid individuals in overcoming PD. However, these treatments, as with all treatments, have theirs own cons:
The most common and effective treatment for severe cases of PD is levodopa (L-DOPA) therapy. Levodopa therapy increases dopamine levels by introducing dopamine’s chemical precursor, L-DOPA, into the bloodstream, often achieved using an oral capsule. Once in the bloodstream L-DOPA can diffuse through the blood-brain barrier and be converted to dopamine by L-DOPA decarboxylase in the brain.
Despite its efficacy, the prescription of L-DOPA therapy is often offset because after the “honeymoon” phase, in which certain symptoms of PD are significantly reduced, the effectiveness of L-DOPA wears off over time, leading to ‘DOPA resistant’ motor symptoms. Furthermore, with oral capsules, additional side effects can result from fluctuating concentrations of L-DOPA in the bloodstream throughout the day before peak dosage and after peak dosage due to the “wearing off effect.” These symptoms include bradykinesia, sl"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

- cI: cI  has a half-life 40 minutes (Arkin, Ross, McAdams 1998). In another study, done  in E. coli, cI is reported to have a  half-life of 10 hours (Parsell, Silber & Sauer 1990), the amino acid  sequence reported in that study is the same as the cI from the biopart we are  using. In another study (Andersen et al 1998), they determined the effect of  the LVA tail on a GFP. They designed constructions with different LVA tails  attached to a mutant GFP with a half-life greater than one day. The addition of  the LVA tail decreased the half-life to 40 minutes, which would equal to ~1/36  of the half-life of the wild type.
- LuxR:  On Manefield et al. (2002), although a half-life isn’t directly measured there  are some experiments in E. coli which  suggest that LuxR half-life is greater than 45 minutes and lower than 90  minutes (figure 2ª). On the Imperial College’s iGEM webpage they defined it as  60 minutes.
- RcnA:  Some important facts about RcnA that could help us calculate its half-life:
It  has a length of 274 residues with 6 transmembrane domains, a mass of 32 kDa and  a zone very rich in histidines (17 histidines, 3 aspartatates and 3 glutamates in  a region of 26 amino acids). Source: Rodrigue, Effantin & Mandrand-Berthelot (2005).  On page 1076 of the Lehninger there is a  table, modified from Bachmair, Finley & Varshavsky (1986), which relates proteins  half-life with its amino terminal residue.
PROMOTER EFFICIENCY:
- Pm  (promoter repressed by cI): In Reinitz y Vaisnys (1990), they reported that the  Gibbs free energy of the binding of E. coli’s polymerase to the promoter is -12.5kcal  mol-1. They also reminded us that an association constant k, can formally be  translated to Gibbs free energy through the following equation: k = exp(ΔG/RT), "

Project Pneumosensor Abstract
Figure 1. Pneumosensor Overview Diagram
Quorem-sensing peptide CSP produced by S. pneumoniae is detected by the Detection Module; the response regulator ComE links the Detection Module to the σx Promoters Module which ultimately drives the expression of GFP.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths every year mostly in developing countries where vaccination      is unaffordable (World Health Organization, 2014). Current methods used for diagnosis of pneumococcal diseases include X-ray imaging of chest, PCR assay using blood and Gram stain using sputum (Muench, D. F., 2014). They require sophisticated equipments, help from physicians or laboratory settings, all of which are limited to people in third world countries. To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, we are engineering an E. coli ""Pneumosensor"", that will      work inside as an in vitro diagnostic device. Such a device should provide diagnosis result in absence of laboratories, medical equipments or doctors, making it more accessible for the people. Through this cheaper and easier diagnosis method, people can prepare themselves better against the      transmission and adversity of S. pneumoniae.
Pneumosensor has a rewired comCDE signal transduction pathway native to S. pneumoniae that detects     autoinducer molecules released specifically by S. pneumoniae. Upon detection of Streptococcus pneumonia, Pneumosensor will produce a fluorescence signal. Apart from that, Pneumosensor is also equipped with a new promoter, Com-Box promoter, for the specific and tight regulation of target gene expression in E. coli.

Nitroreductase activity assay: Overnight liquid cultures of nitroreductase strains were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 mins to pellet the cells. The cells were then resuspended in 250 ul PBS and 1 ul DTT to ensure that cellular proteins are not oxidized. The solution was sonicated 6* (10 s sonication+20 s rest). The supernatant was separated from the pellet by centrifugation and used for the NADH-dependent nitroreductase activity assay.
To assess background activity NADH (5 ul) and bacterial supernatant (5 ul) were added to 0.8 ml PBS and mixed. OD340 was measured for 1 minute. DNBA(5 ul) was added to the same cuvette to start the reaction and change in OD340 was monitored for 1 minute. DMSO(5 ul) was used a control (DNBA is dissolved in DMSO)

Assembling and Basic Components
We proposed a new approach named gut remediation to reduce bio-accumulated heavy metals in fish by gut microbiota. We designed polypeptides which can bind to heavy metals such as divalent mercury and copper, especially divalent mercury. Then a novel gene named Metal Catcher was designed based on the polypeptide with GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) and N-terminal region of INP ( Ice Nucleation Protein).
There are three crucial components, INP, GFP, and Metal Catcher. INP (Ice Nucleation Protein) is an extrinsic membrane protein of E.coli and acts as an anchor. GFP acts as a reporter while metal catcher can bind heavy-metal ions. This is how we assemble the crucial elements.

Experiments
Construction of the Surface Display System
The peptide sequence of the metal catcher (MC) was referred to from the literature. The peptide was named IC (Cys- lys- Cys- lys- Cys- lys- Cys). The gene sequence, encoding IC sequences, was reversely translated from the amino acid sequence of IC sequences and optimized for E. coli codon usage. The N-terminal region of the ice nucleation protein (INP-N) gene was synthesized and inserted in plasmid pUC19 by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). The GFP gene was provided by our laboratory. The INP-N-GFP-MC fusion was constructed as follows. the INP-N fragment was PCR amplified from plasmid pUC19 using the primers INP-F1 and INP-R. The GFP-MC fragment was amplified with a reverse primer GFP-CR3, including gene sequence encoding IC sequences and GFP-F. INP-N-GFP-MC was fused by overlap PCR. The amplified fragment (INP-N-GFP-MC fusion) was digested with Ecor I and Xho I, and cloned into pET23b. Cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 100 mg ampicillin per L at 37°C.

      We choose                                         questionnaire                                         survey as our investigating method, because to know about subjective issues like                                         sleeping quality and mental state etc., the best way is to directly listen to                                         the                                         people and ask them about their feeling. In this survey, we designed two                                         different                                         questionnaires for different targeting groups: one is for the vast public with                                         normal day/night schedule, while the other is for the groups who are requested                                         to go for night shifts – from the first questionnaire we expect to know the general                                         situation, while through the second questionnaire we could learn more about the                                         living, sleeping and demand of the people with reversed night/light-rest/work                                         periods.
      Sleeping is obviously a universal activity;                                         so for the first questionnaire aiming at                                         the common individuals, we distributed the questionnaire via the Internet and                                         encouraged people to forward our questionnaire through the social network to                                         reach                                         as much population as possible – largely, we regard the respondents are chosen                                         by                                         random sampling. For the second questionnaire, we randomly choose the                                         individuals                                         from groups that would have night shifts as our interviewee, for instance the                                         servicemen who would go for night watch and the flight attendance as well as                                         doctors                                         and nurses who would work at night occasionally by their schedule. After careful                                         assessment, we regard our samples could represent the general condition and view                                         of                                         the public as well as those of the groups with night shifts.
1.2 Results
      For Questionnaire 1, 442 questionnaires are                                         retrieved and for Questionnaire 2, 77                                         questionnaires are retrieved (for gender, age and job distribution of the                                         respondents, see Supplementary Materials).

      Surprisingly, 93% of the respondents admit                                         that they have been troubled by                                         problems related to sleep. Among the commonly reported problems, “Find it                                         difficult to fall asleep”, “Be weaken up easily” and “Feel hot” rank the first                                         three, where the first two might resulted from shift or disorder in circadian                                         rhythm.

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," that this concept cannot presently be applied is that synthetic biology is strongly reliant on collaborative construction. Patenting biological parts or processes will not motivate a group of scientists to pursue their research, but cause them to weigh the opportunity costs between their groundbreaking research and the hefty payments they would make to patent holders.
In the case of Venter’s claim, organizations such as the ETC group believe that Venter’s group is eyeing on a profit making opportunity. Hope Shands of the ETC group states, “The fledgling synthetic biology industry keeps talking about how they’re going to fix climate change – but these sweeping patent claims reveal that the companies are much more focused on securing profits than on human needs” (ETC Group, 2007). The multi-purpose use of a biological methodology would not only give Venter ownership to a scientific methodology, but to a range of applications that could be possible in the chemical, medicinal or environmental industries. Venter reported to Business Week, “If we made an organism that produced fuel that could be the first billion- or trillion-dollar organism. We would definitely patent that whole process” (ETC Group,2007). Many would dispute that this financial and market acquisition would only de-motivate other synthetic biology scientists and facilities to halt their research. But from looking at it from Venter’s perspective, wouldn’t anyone want to reap the rewards on a project that took 15 years and 40 million dollars to reach its success?
Patenting Artificial Life: Is synthetic biology a man-made industry?
As previously noted, synthetic biology encapsulates the field of biotechnology, software and computing. The current patent laws that have been put in place have generally been applicable to all industries individually. However, the field of synthetic biology is an amalgamation of two fields that have faced years of controversial debate in terms of granting or approving patents. The concern lied in the fact that patents related to inventions in biotechnology or software could be broad or narrow, but extensive enough to “hold-up” the concept of innovation and invention (Rai and Boyle, 2007 ).
Synthetic biology is being renowned as a stream towards the development of artificial life, which for some raises social, ethical and legal concerns. Patent Act 101 states that any subject matter that is found in nature is not deemed as patentable. However, if the product found in nature is modified or transformed to something that is novel and non-obvious, it holds credibility in attaining a patent. Looking at the synthetic cell created by Venter’s team, it is difficult to denote the “man-made” material in his composition. His cell includes"

Safety issues in our project.
Probability:
Could there be an unplanned event or series of events involving your project, resulting in death, injury, occupational illness, damage to equipment or property, or damage to the environment?.
Yes. Hydrogen production in great amounts poses a risk to the investigators and the equipment. Accidental plasmid release poses a risk to public health.
How likely is that going to happen?.
Hydrogen production will be limited to bacteria in petri dishes or flasks with one liter capacity or less. This makes the production of great amounts of hydrogen very improbable.
As of accidental plasmid release, our work is bound to the appropriate safety measures, which makes the release very improbable.
Does your project require the exposure or release of the engineered organism to people or the environment (e.g. as medicine, for bioremediation)?.
Not in this stage. It may will in further applications.
Hazard:
Could your device, when working properly, represent a hazard to people or the environment?.
No. However it will require the proper hydrogen handling devices in further applications.
Is your engineered organism infectious?.
It is known to infect neither humans nor other animals. It does infect the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris roots, forming specialized structures known as nodules, in order to enter the symbiotic stage.
Does it produce a toxic product?.
No. However hydrogen handling requires specialized techniques which, as of July 15, we are investigating.
Does it interfere with human physiology or the environment?.
Our bacteria don’t interfere with human physiology.
Rhizobial organisms participate in the nitrogen cycle performing nitrogen fixation. Experiments evaluating the release to the environment of genetically modified Rhizobia inoculants have been carried out. Most studies revealed that the number of Rhizobial organisms dropped rapidly after application to soil or seeds but then numbers stabilized for months or years (3).
What would happen if one or several bioparts change their function or stop working as intended (e.g. through mutation)?.
The hydrogen production pathway is composed of a hydrogenase, two hydrogenase maturases and a pyruvate-Ferredoxin OxidoReductase (PFOR). None of these proteins are expected to change their function through mutation. If any of them stops working at all (either by a missense or a nonsense mutation) they will only shut down hydrogen production. Proteins would still be produced, consuming resources and decreasing the organism’s fitness. Competition with other bacteria would"

Invertase assay
I Background
    RafD, which is primitively from the raffinose operon of E. coli, can express a β-fructofuranosidase. It can hydrolyze raffinose into fructose and meliose, and sucrose into glucose and fructose. HlyA is a secretory protein in bacteria, which can be secreted through the recognition of its signal sequence at the C terminal by a transporter constructed by HlyB, HlyD and TolC. This part is designed to produce a secretory invertase, which can hydrolyze sucrose in the medium to feed the bacteria without invertase.
Tips: BBa_K2250003 just contains RafD and HlyA signal peptide!
II Experimental design
    As demonstrated in the genetic circuit, RafD is ligated to the signal peptide of HlyA. The plasmid can also express HlyB and HlyD, which is controlled by PBAD to tune the secretion process of RafD. Besides, TolC originally exists in the genome of E. coli. Thus, the RafD enzyme is able to be transported to the medium and hydrolyze the sucrose outside the cells.
    To test the function of this part, we constructed two kinds of E. coli, one with this part BBa_K2250003 and a transport system (We call it ""Peasant"" to distinguish it with farmer, which also has parts that can sense AHLs.), and the other with a constitutive expression"

Hello! We're the Manhattan College iGEM Team!
We are undergrads with different backgrounds, but one common interest in the field of synthetic biology. We spent our summer working on making biological fuel cells more efficient at producing energy with the use of E. coli. Basically, we're making a BACTERY!
How to Produce Lots of
Electricity Using a Biological Fuel Cell?
Presented by Manhattan iGEM
Combining Biological Cells with Electricity
Our case is using Glucose Oxidase
Glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid, by utilizing molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor with simultaneous production of hydrogen peroxide.
Introduction
Synthetic biology utilizes concepts in engineering and mathematical modeling to design ways in which to genetically manipulate biological system in order to alter or create unique physiological pathways.  DNA serves as the functional units in the architecture of improved blueprints of existing organisms.
An enzymatic biofuel cell is a type of biochemical cell that uses catalysts, specifically enzymes, to oxidize its fuel, in this case, glucose.  In this project glucose oxidase from aspergillus niger is required at the anode, which is the cell in which oxidation occurs. The enzyme makes 24 electrons

It belongs to the Cellulose Binding Modul family 3 (pfam00942/cl03026) and is part of a very large cellulose binding protein with four other carbohydrate binding moduls and a lot of docking interfaces for the proteins in its amino acid sequence (Figure 7).
The Binding Assay
Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein in action
To measure the capacity and strength of the bonding between the cellulose binding domains and different types of cellulose many different assays have been made. One of the simplest and most often used is the fusion of the CBD to a reporter-protein, especially green or red fluorescent protein (GFP/RFP) is very common. The place of the CBD is measured through the fluorescence of the fused GFP and quantification can easily been done.
Protocol :
Harvest the E coli-cells producing the fusion-protein of CBD and GFP and centifuge 10 minutes at top speed.
Re-suspend the cell-pellet in 50 mM Tris-HCl-Buffer (pH 8.0).
Break down cells via sonication.
Centrifuge at top speed for 20 minutes to get rid of the cell-debris.
Take the supernatant and measure the emission at 511 nm (excitation at 501 nm) (<partinfo>E0040</partinfo>)
Mix a definite volume of lysate with a definite volume or mass of e.g. crystalline cellulose (CC) or reactivated amorphous cellulose (RAC)

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"The results can be affected by the copy number of plasmid and the replicon’s intensity, especially for the red light TCS.     2、Maybe this is because the LED intensity was not strong enough. Also, we used LB medium and it absorbed light of different wavelength, making light attenuate too much and could not activate TCS effectively.     3、The antibiotics we used may affect the system’s expression.
Future plan
    1、Decrease the leak level. In the light-induced system, the reporter gene’s leak will affect our measurement. What’s more, it may even lead to unexpected errors for users to read the information. In order to avoid such errors, we have several alternative plans:Use a new light-induced system - we have already found a system using blue light. Keep balance between every components by changing the intensity of rbs. Keep balance between every components by changing the copy number of plasmid and the replicon’s intensity.     2、Future measurement of the red light system after inserting NOT gate.     3、Mix bacteria of the green light and red light system together, and measure their response towards light.     4、Analyze the response curve, to find the optimum light intensity.     5、Replace LB medium as M9 medium and compare their results.     6、Explore the optimum quantity of antibiotics.
Notes
    1.When constructing plasmid, with the existence of double terminator, it is prone to appear disorder when using overlap PCR to join two segments together. Using seamless connection to construct plasmid is also prone to appear deletions of segments, and we can consider to use the method of enzyme-digestion and enzyme-connection.     2.When measuring the fluorescence expression of bacteria after co-transformation, the results are affected by medium. Thus, we recommend to centrifuge first, then use PBS buffer solution to clear the remaining medium. These two steps can be repeated by 2 times in order to preclude the effects caused by medium.

Overview
    We simplified the three-plasmid AND gate system based on our reference by constructing all the segments in one plasmid. And we tested it in E.coli MG1655.

U of L scientists win entrepreneur challenge
By Peggy Revell on June 6, 2013. MEDICINE HAT NEWS
A biotech company started by a group of scientists from the University of Lethbridge came out on tops in the ninth annual Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge.
“It’s been a really exciting experience,” said Isaac Ward, who alongside Harland Brandon, Erin Kelly and Mackenzie Coatham have established Synbiologica a small biotech company based out of Lethbridge that is developing a method of rapid hormone detection.
Ward and Brandon represented Synbiologica Wednesday at the Medicine Hat Lodge for the CEC, competing in the portion of the competition for tech businesses. Competing against MathFileFolderGames.com and PlentyFull Services, they presented their business plans, took questions from judges, and were ultimately named the winner.
“It’s really about supporting local grown entrepreneurs,” said Geoff Rougeau, business analyst/project co-ordinator with Community Futures Lethbridge Region about the annual competition that will wrap up June 12 with judging for those in the general category taking place in Lethbridge. Participants come east to west in southern Alberta, all the way north to Camrose.
The competition starts with eight weeks of free training for interested small businesses, provided through Community Futures throughout southern Alberta including the chance to meet with accountants, lawyers and other resources, Rogeau explained. Participants then have a month to finalize and submit a business plan, and these submissions are whittled down to three finalists for the general and brand new tech business category.
As scientists, Ward said the opportunity to participate in the program to learn about business is “beyond beneficial.”
“Business training isn’t in our course load,” said Ward, thanking all the advisors, Community Futures and everyone who helped them along their way"
Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," very interesting and saw a lot of potential for future development and wanted to be a part of it.
What was your responsability during this project?
I did experimental work with the wetlab team, and was in charge of the finance and sourcing for sponsorships for the project. I also helped with conducting human practice interviews and running outreach events.
What did you learn from this experience?
I learned that the development of new ideas and projects are not easy, and we should always press on in spite of challenges and obstacles to achieve our intended objectives. From iGEM I have taken away the experience of having to scour through research papers for ideas and testing these ideas, and coming closer in contact with the research and development world. Lastly, I found out more about synthetic biology, what it is about and what I can do with it in future.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
This experience has given me exposure about what I can expect from a research and development career and a balanced perspective on what I should pursue in future.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
Biomedical equipment and technologies that involve microbes.
Team ULaval
Karelle Rehault
Why did you take part in iGEM?
I was interested in joining the team because I wanted to gain the experience to work in a big team on a motivating project with my pairs.
What was your responsability during this project?
I was responsible for the chemical analysis of our project with the HPLC. I was also part of the human practices: I conducted a survey on the ethical, economical and environmental repercussions of our project, I made an interview with a philosophy student and I collaborated with other teams.
What did you learn from this experience?
I learned about working with a big group of students (we were about 15 students in our team) and it taught me that organisation and motivation are the most important ingredients to achieve our goals. It was the first year our team participated to the competition and we learned a lot from our mistakes. Hopefully, our mistakes won’t be repeated next year and we will submit a much better project.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
I would definitely not make a great manager and writing papers is not my thing… Maybe it is because it was our first year participating to the competition, but I realised scientific research is very much harder than I thought.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
I studied biotechnologies for three years in college and I was passionate about it. After that, I studied in"

Depending on which region is excised, one random coding region settles next to the promoter and starts to be expressed. For a chassis containing four different operons, the mother cells differentiates in four different daughter cells, each of them expressing one operon.
Even if the chassis is not completely filled, it still works: the number of different daughter cells is always equal to the number of inserted cassettes, and the probability of each is adjusted accordingly.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/6/65/PB_brainbow.png
How to induce the differentiation?
There are different ways the CRE recombinase can be induced.
Chemical
A chemical would be one of the most predictable, efficient way to differentiate the cells. However, it requires to have access to this chemical, and to open the reactor which can be impractical for community labs with low resources to maintain sterility. It is nevertheless the solution of choice for funded factories. Carbohydrates such as glucose, arabinose or lactose seem to be the best options since they are not toxic.
Heat
On the other hand, heat does not require to open the bioreactor, so it's ideal when sterile conditions are not easy to obtain. Numerous heat-sensitive promoters exist, such as the Heat-Shock Promoter that is present in the registry (
BBa_K338001
).
The problem of leakiness
Most of the promoters from living organisms are leaky, i.e. they still lead to a small amount of transcription even in the absence of inducer. In our case, it means that the CRE recombinase will be expressed from time to time in some cells and it could result in the differentiation of some of them. If their number is low, it should not have any consequence as the differentiated cells are very unlikely to take over, but leakiness may be an obstacle if it affects a large proportion of the cells.
The perfect expression level
We could try to differentiate all the cells as quickly as possible, or let the cells differentiate slowly in a prograssive manner. Provided the differentiated cells grow significantly slower than the mother cell, the strategy that generates the largest amount of vitamins is not obvious.
To answer this question, we created a mathematical and computational model of the situation. Given the growth rate of the mother cells and the daughter cells, it is possible to calculate the optimal differentiation rate, and chose the strength of the promoter accordingly.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," there are some disadvantages:
(1) The problem of structural instability of plasmids cannot be solved. After the target gene loses its function, the resistant gene can still be expressed smoothly, which leads to that the bacteria screened by the resistant environment are not thoroughly.
(2) The application of this method is restricted. It could be used in the laboratory, but there would be a huge cost due to the using of antibiotics in industry;
(3) Those bacteria with resistant genes will metabolize antibiotics, so the concentration of antibiotics in the culture would gradually reduce, which is not conducive to long-term experiments.
(4) Adding antibiotics to the culture is exactly adding selection pressure, so a large part of energy is use to fight against those survival pressure, which leads to relatively low expression of target genes in engineered bacteria.
To sum up, the use of antibiotics in the construction, screening and application of engineered bacteria can NOT be avoided, and there are also many problems. In this summer, BNU-china are devoted to explore a novel method to fight against plasmids loss in the environment without antibiotics, and hope that our efforts could finally change the world.

Outreach strategy
The IOD band presents a new approach to diagnostics and diagnostic engineering. So at Team Czech Republic we addressed engineers and medical experts to discuss the application and the novel engineering approach. In addition, Czech Republic teamed up with Chalmers Gothenburg to conduct a multinational survey on the public perception of Synthetic Biology.
Engineering
Since a lot of ideas behind IODs were built on the fundamentals of classical engineering, we wanted to present the concept of our project (from an engineering point-of-view) to young engineers and receive their feedback. We presented our project and synthetic biology in general at a lecture of the Introduction to Cybernetics class led by Prof. Ing. Miloš Schlegel CSc. After giving a 30-minute lecture on synthetic biology, we introduced our project. The response was surprisingly positive. Not only we were asked several to-the-point questions, but some of the students even showed a deeper interest in synthetic biology and individually contacted us after the talk.
Medicine
In order to get a professional opinion on our project and to learn more about cancer and CTCs, we conducted an interview with two cancer specialists, Mgr. Pavel Pitule, Ph.D. and Mgr. Pavel Ostašov, Ph.D. The interview took place at the Biomedical Center of Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen. After introducing our project idea we discussed some particularly interesting points. This interview was not only helpful and enriching but also led to an agreement to collaborate with the Laboratory of Tumor Biology in the near future.
Key outputs
Most engineers are eager to see the immediate reaction of the system. Following the lectures such as the one for young engineers, we designed IODs as a fast diagnostic test. Also, the preliminary process is quick thanks to the clone-free preparation of required IODs.
Questions we received during the lecture from students and teachers concerning current cancer diagnostics, their price, and efficiency were afterwards discussed with cancer specialists in the interview .

Specifically, we told them about how we were struggling with protein purification process using column chromatography and in response, the members of the Tokyo Tech and Gifu team suggested that we could incorporate Histidine tag into our construct so that A1AT proteins would be secreted with Histidine attached and afterwards run it in a nickel lined column to purify the His-tagged proteins. By incorporating this suggestion, the protein purification process became more precise, smoother, and faster allowing us to get a result in our fluorescent analysis of purified proteins that showed His tag construct was our best construct in secretion of proteins. Because we got this advice and because we went to this meetup, we were able to create a construct that worked the best amongst the two other ones that we tested.

During the summer portion of our lab work, we participated in a Skype call with the Pakistan high school iGEM team, known as LACAS Biobots. We explained our projects to each other, took virtual lab tours, and got to know another HS team and the different ways in which various teams work.
Tokyo Tech Meetup
August 8, 2018
During the summer, iGEM teams from across Japan attended a meetup held by Tokyo Tech University. KAIT, Bochan lab, Gifu University, Tokyo Tech, and ASIJ. Our team presented, along with the other teams, the progress we have made throughout the year. After each presentation, we had a QnA where many good suggestions were made, which everybody followed up on after all the presentations over snacks. Our team received a helpful suggestion from the Tokyo Tech and Gifu team about the use of a histidine tag to simplify and speed up the protein purification process, also making a more accurate result.

The most commonly used two means, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, were developed only after World War II.
Chemotherapy is to use cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer cells, and inhibit the growth of tumor cells. To some extent, chemotherapy is of certain specificity, but it still terribly influences normal cells;
Now there are some drugs for chemotherapy with less side effects.
● In 2004 after the listing of the molecular targeted drugs iressa (also known as  Gefitnib), situation has been greatly changed.
Targeting drugs have a lot of advantages:
Firstly, targeted drugs can be taken orally, removing troublesomeness of hospitalization, providing more convenience;
Secondly, the side effects are relatively small;
Thirdly, it concerned with genes associated with the disease, offering efficacy for specific populations.
● Most of our chemotherapy drugs perform by intravenous infusion, so patients need to be hospitalized. Yet lots of molecular targeted drugs are kinase inhibitors of small molecules, which can be made into oral dosage, providing patients with great convenience. Also, compared to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, molecular targeted drugs with more specifically design, cause far less side effects. Life quality during treatment can be greatly improved from the patient's perspective.
● An important significance of molecular targeted drugs is that, in the past, most drugs are searched and then acquired by human from the nature, but the molecular targeted drugs is a re-creation of human with certain purposes, thus a great revolutionary breakthrough.
● The emergence of targeted drugs allow the basic research apply into clinical cases, leading a revolution in the field of oncology.
● Now, for those who can take targeted drugs, that is patients with sensitive mutations, we can practice molecular targeted drugs combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy at the same time, enabling patients to survive up to three years --- such a survival period is pretty remarkable. (In fact, clinically 2 to 3 months of survival extension could be viewed as miracle.) The emergence of molecular targeted drugs, combined with a reasonable quantity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has promoted a huge progress compared to a dozen years ago.
● One or two decades ago, doctors would have thought it irrelevant to his treatment if they heard about a mutation in a patient's genetic site. With the emergence of targeted drugs, the clinical treatment of tumors upswing to a molecular level.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest TargetingTest_-_-_TEXT.html," protein CheY. The phosphorylated CheY (CheY-p) binds the flagella and causes the cell to tumble in place, essentially remaining immotile. The phosphatase CheZ dephosphorylates CheY, causing CheY to unbind to the flagella, resulting in directed movement of the cell [1] . More factors are involved in the full chemotactic pathway of E. coli, although they are not of importance for our project.
Using Chemotaxis to track down a pathogen
Due to the complexity of the chemotactic pathway of E. coli, controlling the steering of this chemotactic car was not an option. Instead, we decided to manipulate the breaks, so that our bacteria would stop moving once close enough to the pathogen and deliver a deadly dose of bacteriocin.
To achieve this stop-and-kill mechanism, focus was laid on the protein CheZ. As mentioned above, the bacteria cannot move straight in the absence of CheZ, but tumbles in place instead, so by stopping the production of CheZ we essentially get immotile bacteria. Then, by producing CheZ under controlled manners, the bacteria would ideally become motile again but on our terms. The production of CheZ would be controlled by a system based on the quorum sensing (see the Sensing system) of our pathogen, designed by the Sensing group. The result would be low production of CheZ when close to the pathogen and high production when far away from it.
System design
The ultimate design of our system was the CheZ gene combined with our regulatory Sensing system. However, merging systems is quite a big first step so we decided to divide our work in stages where the final stage was CheZ and the Sensing system combined.
Stage 1
As our goal was to restore motility by inserting CheZ we obviously needed a cheZ-knockout strain of E. coli. We speculated whether we could create such a strain ourselves using various gene-deletion methods but this would require a lot of work on its own. Instead, we received two cheZ-knockout strains and one motile “wildtype” strain as a kind gift by Prof. Parkinson (see Acknowledgements). The two cheZ-knockout strains were called RP1616 and UU2685 and the wildtype RP437. Note that we could not use the standard E. coli lab strain DH5-alpha for our experiments, since it is lacking flagella [3] .

Further, the constructs were put under control of a pTet promoter to make them inducable by aTc.  After induction of protein expression in cell culure and stopping the translation with Chloramphenicol, the reaction rate of degradation for the different tags was measured (Figure 1).

Characterization of Fluorescent Reporters:
Fluorescent proteins have become ubiquitous tools for studying cellular processes, and are frequently used to visualize the dynamics of synthetic networks in cells. To be particularly effective for these applications, fluorescent proteins must feature fast maturation and degradation rates, and these rates must be well-characterized and documented. The 2011 VT iGEM team has worked to find and characterize fluorescent proteins and degradation tags that more quickly degrade them.  Here, we present chemical and mathematical models based on two parameters, maturation and degradation rates, which will hopefully contribute to more quantitative characterization and usage of fluorescent reporters in the future, and will inform future efforts in parts characterization. In conducting our experimentation, we tested different fluorescent proteins with degradation tags in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using automated fluorescent microscopy techniques, and then worked to determine a comprehensive, accurate mathematical basis for fluorescent protein characterization.
Our team consists of 10 undergraduates from Virginia Tech, UNC Chapel Hill, James Madison University, The University of Maryland, Bluefield State College, and The College of William & Mary.  We would like to thank Dr. Jean Peccoud and the Synthetic Biology Group at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute for lab space, financial support, and guidance.

WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#Uganda_-_-_TEXT.html," organization among farmers to allow them to better information and resources. James has found that farmers are more successful when they don’t have to worry about accessing expensive equipment such as backpack sprayers. He also noted that tight knit communities are more likely to have better access to healthcare and farming supplies due to pooled economic resources. He believes that such organizations would be critical for the successful adoption of our device.
Using his experience in the area and work with local farmers, James recommended that we power our device with a solar panel and make sure farmers can receive the detection result themselves. He clarified that farmers would recognize a green light as a positive signal and a red light as an alert for something wrong with their crops. James also recommended that we distinguish which crops can be affected by the fungus that is present rather than simply detect the presence of the fungus. This was because farmers often intercrop and have a tendency to spray all their crops even though only one is affected. The farmers need a method to target the crops that were susceptible to the fungus. It would also allow them to conserve fungicide and reduce the amount of time needed to spray their crops.
Local Farmers
In Uganda, we were able to meet with 13 community health workers
Meeting with Mr. Kyirongero
who operate small to medium size farms in the area. They were selected by an NGO, UDHA (Udanda Development and Health Association), to represent best practices in their community. In addition,
Enoch holding fungicide
we were also able to speak with Mr Sefatia Kyirongero, 109 year-old farmer and his family.
Through conversations with them, we learned that major issues the farmers face include a lack of technical education or support for dealing with pests and disease, lack of financial resources, and climate change. Fungal infections majorly affect farmers across Uganda. Most small or subsistence farmers don’t have access to fungicide and reliable technical support due to their location and cost, worsening the effects of the fungus. They estimate that fungal infections decrease their yield by 50-70%, sometimes even destroying the entire crop.
For those who are able to access it, fungicide can increase their seasonal yield by 40-50% in the presence of a fungal infection. Our device would improve the effectiveness of fungicide application, saving time and money for the farmers while increasing yield.

Hi! My name is Ziqi Zhao, a high school senior student at BNDS. I mainly participated in the wet                         lab, helped with human practice, and I’ll be responsible for a part of the presentation. I’m                         very excited to be in our iGEM team because I’m interested in synthetic biology and planning to                         take biological engineering for my college major. When I’m not working in the lab, I find                         happiness in music and performing arts. No kidding. A biology student who sings well.

My name is Yinting Huang, a team member of BNDS_China. I took part in the project research                         section and help our team to narrow down the topics. Furthermore, in the wet lab, I engaged in                         the modeling of the AMP and quorum quenching proteins. Last but not least, I am one of the                         designers and planners in the team and in charge of designing the bookmarks, the turntable,                         team uniforms and human practice activities.

I am prospective to learn applied mathematics in the undergraduate stage, and I am engaged to                         extensively utilize the modeling knowledge and programming skills. I have learned some                         algorithm and function about data analysis originally in class, but I never had the chance to                         apply them practically. My experience is sparse and all knowledge is literally understood. iGEM                         2018 gave me a great chance to incorporate math with other natural science and broaden my                         horizon of knowledge comprehension. I took charge of visualization and data analysis,                         discovering the density function and variation tendency. Throughout the process, I recognize                         how worthy and useful the mathematics is. I am willing to devote myself to the future                         researches.

Safety Aspect
The GerminationSTOP was put into place for the simple technical reason that the fusion proteins would lose their functions if the spore were to become a vegetative cell. But the GerminationSTOP also ensures that our Sporobeads are no longer able to germinate into viable cells.
In order to get a professional statement about the safety aspects of our project and how realistic it would be to release our spores into the environment, we invited the Commissioner for Bio-Safety in Bavaria to speak with us. In a two hour discussion, we explained the details of our projects and asked the Commissioner all of the ""what ifs"" on our minds.

Antibiotic Resistance
How antibiotics target bacteria and how the bacteria resist these mechanisms.
Click the arrow above for more information.
Antibiotic definition:
Antibiotics literally mean “agents against life.” Thus they are compounds which inhibit the growth of (bacteriostatic) or kill bacteria (bactericidal) under appropriate concentrations. Some are produced naturally by various organisms while others are produced synthetically in the laboratory. Ideally an antibiotic causes minor, if any, side effects to humans and animals, has a broad spectrum of activity which will be effective against many kinds of bacteria, and bioavailability to effectively reach and act in the area of bacterial infection.[1]
Cell membrane differences:
Bacteria are commonly classified according to the structure of their cell membranes: gram-positive, gram-negative, acid-fast, and mycoplasma. Most bacteria fall into either the gram-positive or gram-negative category.[2]
For a gram-positive bacterium, the interior of the cell is surrounded by a typical phospholipid bilayer. Outside this cell membrane is a thick layer of peptidoglycan, or murein, which is a polymer of sugars and amino acids. This murein covering is responsible for giving structure and shape to the bacterium, gives resilience to osmotic pressures, and provides an effective defense mechanism against antibiotics or other harmful chemicals. Techoic acids are other polymers which adhere to the outside surface of the murein layer of gram-positive bacteria. Some bacteria also have an outer capsule encompassing the whole cell.[2]
The structure of the gram-negative cell membrane is more complex. Rather than simply constructing the thick murein layer typical of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria utilize a thin layer of murein surrounded by another outer membrane. The interior of the cell is surrounded by the typical phospholipid, inner membrane. A relatively thin layer of murein lies outside the inner membrane and a unique outer membrane envelopes the murein. The resulting space between the two membranes is called the periplasm, or periplasmic space. The fluid of the periplasm contains a variety of proteins. Many of these proteins are binding proteins or enzymes for metabolism. Some gram negative bacteria also have β–lactamases to inhibit antibiotics in"

After setting up the first PCR, we realised we had     made a mistake (Touchdown 1). A second touchdown (Touchdown 2) was set up and     run soon after with the corrections. We managed to get bands for all four     promotes. These were cut from the gel, gel extracted, cut with EP (and ES for     ALDH2), ligated and transformed into competent E coli.
Touchdown 1 cycle conditions were as follows:
Initial denaturation at 980C for 30 seconds then     10 cycles with 980C for 10 seconds, 620C for 30 seconds     (annealing) and 720C for 1 minute 10 seconds, and annealing     temperature decreasing by 10C for each cycle. Second amplification     cycle was 20 cycles of 980C for 30 seconds, 520C for 10     seconds (annealing) and 720C for 1 minute 10 seconds. Final     extension was at 720C for 10 minutes and then PCR was held at 40C.     NOTE: In the second cycle (20 cycles) denaturation time at 980C     should have been 10 seconds and annealing time should have been 30 seconds.     This correction was included in Touchdown 2. Additionally, DNA template     concentration was increased in Touchdown 2, by increasing the volume from 1µL per reaction to 5 µL per reaction
RESULTS: Spurious bands were     obtained in the touchdown 1, but ALDH1A1 and ALDH2 were amplified.  Touchdown 2 gave good results for ALDH2.     For ALDH 1A3 and number of bands were seen. A faint band was observed at the     expected size and this is the band which was cut from the gel. ALDH1A1 from gel     1, ALDH2 from gel 2 and ALDH3A1 from gel 2 were also cut from the gel and gel     purified. Extracted DNA was run on a gel to verify the gel extraction process.  Gel extracted DNA was digested with EP     and ALDH2 was restricted with ES. The backbone was restricted with EP and ES aswell. Restriction digests were saved till the next day.

The origin represents the end of the DT injection and is the time at which the running buffer of specific pH has started flowing over the sensorchip, RU, resonance untis. This figure shows a representative ecperiment (see Materials and Methods).
Based on the graphs above, one can infer that:
In smaller pH (more acidic), the rates of dissociation is faster; nevertheless, once the pH is below 5.3, there will be no change in the rate since the intoxicated cells have already broken (lysis).
In the human epithelial tissues, the intoxicated cells will not be destroyed although the pH is 5.3 as the environment temperature is close to 370C.
For research insight, the recommended temperature for testing binding rates is 25°C with range of pH between 5.6-5.9.
Can’t be mathematically modelled since the data is not sufficient for accurate modelling. The decision is made by engineering rule of thumb, in which data less than 5, is not reliable enough to be modelled into linear or non-linear regression, since the potential deviation is large.

Best new BioBrick part (natural and engineered): BBa_K1139021
Fig. 5-1-1. Design of phage DNA for inducible phage release pSB3K3 backbone is required for maintenance of the DNA without inducer.
M13 is a non-litic phage that infects only F+ strains of E. coli, which does not kill the host cell. This BioBrick part is extracted from M13mp18 phage vector by PCR. It includes 11 ORFs, M13 origin, a packaging sequence and lac promoter. The promoter upstream of g2p (gene 2 protein) is altered to lux promoter. A phage particle is formed only when the host cell receives AHL signal (3OC6HSL, C6) because G2p (gene 2 protein) is an endonuclease which is needed for a plasmid to be replicated by M13 origin, and to be packaged into the phage particle. As a reporter, GFP is inserted downstream of the lac promoter.
Best new BioBrick part (natural): BBa_K1139020
We confirmed that M13 phage genes and M13 origin worked properly with pSB origin, using a plaque forming assay.  One is replacement of the promoter for upstream of g2p with a constitutive promoter, PlacIq ( BBa_I14032 ).  The other is accommodation of pSB3K3 backbone. Even though the plasmid has two different types of replication origins, M13 origin and pSB3 origin, this plasmid ( BBa_K1139020 , Fig. 5-1-2) formed plaque.  In contrast, construction intermediates without a promoter for g2p coding sequence (Promoterless-M13 + Plac, Promoterless-M13 + Plac-GFP BBa_K1139022 , Fig. 5-1-3) could not form plaque.

To the buffer we added 50 µl Substrate p-NPB (2 mM in 0.8% Triton and 400 mM NaCl) and finally 100 µl of the enzyme (11 µM) to start the reaction. The reaction was followed with a spectrophotometer at 405 nm for 1 hour every 15 seconds with the reaction mixture being shaken before every read. The experiment was performed threefold and the mean value was then plotted (see figure 6) against the pH-value of the buffer.
Figure 6: Reaction of EreB with p-NPB in different pH buffers (left) and negative control without the enzyme (right)
Result: From pH 4.5 to 6.5 there was no enzyme activity because the enzyme degraded, which was clearly visible as a dreary solution. The small absorption can be traced back to the degraded enzyme, so the conclusion is that EreB is unstable in alcaline surroundings. This is also the reason why cytoplasmatic localized enzyme works in our transformed moss , because the Knop medium in which P. patens is grown has a pH of 5.8. Since natural aquatic environment is generally on the alcalic side the degradation of antibiotics with EreB can only be realized intracellular. P-NPB in contrast seems to be very stable at low pH as there is no absorption measured in the negative control. With increasing pH the substrate increasingly degrades by itself while the enzyme's activity is also increasing. These two factors lead to a rapidly growing conversion of p-NPB. In a nutshell EreB works optimally in an acidic environment.
Ionic strength optimum
A serial dilution of NaCl starting with 1.5 M was prepared (50 µl) and another 100 µl of p-NPB (2 mM in 0.8 % Triton) were added before the reaction was started with 50 µl of the enzyme (11 µM). The reaction was followed with a spectrophotometer at 405 nm for 1 hour every 20 seconds with the reaction mixture being shaken before every read. The experiment was performed threefold and the mean value was then plotted (see figure 7) against the varying salt concentrations.

Thursday, 6/27: Today, Heather and I finally made the decision that we were going to use Google App Engine to host our website. We had been considering this for a very long time, aware that it would make certain features easier (ie: having a datastore), but might also make others more difficult (ie: how would javascript work with GAE when its core language is Python?). In the end, we decided to go for it, deciding that the benefits were greater. The rest of the day was then spent researching our options and how to utilize GAE to our maximum benefit.
Friday, 6/28: Today we were given the day off to bond with the BU igem team in Boston. We converged at the MFA, and spent a lovely morning admiring all of the different exhibitions being displayed. To me, the special Samurai exhibit was a personal favorite, and it was fascinating to look at all of the intricacies in their armor, weaponry, history, etc. Then, after a lunch break at Qdoba, we headed off to the Gardner Museum for another round of awe. The feel and environment was completely different, but it was just as exhilarating and fascinating. Finally, to end the day, a couple of us headed to Trident Cafe on Newbury Street for an exciting night of trivia. It was a tiring but wonderful day off from work!
Week 6: July 1 - July 5
Monday, 7/1: What a jam-packed day today was! In the morning, Heather and I met our two interns for the next couple of weeks - Artemis and Neoreet"

Dr. Paula Turkon
Dr. Paula Turkon has a complex hydroponic setup on the other side of Ithaca, on South Hill at Ithaca College. She thought that teaching students about sustainability through the installation and upkeep of a hydroponic system at the university would not only be a valuable learning experience in sustainability but also provide an introduction into a growing practice for more controlled food production. She explained to us how here set-up worked, and how Ithaca College’s cafeteria actively used the herbs produced hydroponically in meals for students. To monitor the hydroponic s a variety of factors are checked, including pH, water quality, and conductivity. However, oxidative stress is not taken into account, meaning OxyPonics would be a novel implementation.
When asked about struggles of hydroponic farming, Dr. Turkon mentioned that cost is one of the biggest issues and causes of failure for hydroponic farms. She said if our product could increase profit margins, it would help the hydroponic industry grow. Since OxyPonics would increase plant yield, we believe there is tangible need for our product. Additionally, OyxPonics would need to priced affordably. We addressed this issue by instead of creating an entirely new hydroponic set-up, creating components such as a rail system and dialysis rings that could be adapted and and installed into existing hydroponic set-ups.
Next, a point Dr. Turkon made clear is that personally she did not have much of a technical background and many she knew in the hydroponic industry were the same. Our team worked hard to make OxyPonics utilization intuitive and easy. The user interface additionally features data in visual form so that it is easy to grasp, and overall data analysis that one can interact with quite naturally.

Dr. Miguel A. Pineros
Dr. Miguel Pineros, a professor at the School of Integrative Plant Science at Cornell, was enthusiastic about our project and approach. As we toured his greenhouse experiments where he had his own hydroponic set-ups, he excitedly told us that “most of where interesting science happens is at the interface of different sciences,” referring to how we were combining synthetic biology with plant sciences - two fields which typically do not interact in academia. Dr. Pineros area of expertise is in abiotic stresses and ROS production. He suggested we study root biology in hydroponics and measure the"

Hoping to start wet work on Monday!
Pigments
Duncan has orange and brown bacteria we can start to work with.  The melanin gene has been sequenced, has a restriction site we would need to remove to submit it to the registry.
We have the genes for violacein! However there seem to be several internal restriction sites within the plasmid that would need to be removed.
Contacted the authors of a paper to get the genes for pyocyanin biosynthesis.  Two of them have forbidden restriciton sites, so we'll need to figure out how to remove them.
Inputs
Explored the idea of using common repressor / inducer systems - arabinose, lac repressor, and tet repressor - to control pigment production
Scourged the registry for lots of different inducible promoters
Population Control
Crispian proposed a growth control dependency pathway that would make the growth of each type of bacterium (red colour-producing, blue colour-producing, yellow colour-producing, for example) dependent on one other using HSLs
Friday
Found where to get PCA, pyocyanin precursor
Did an inventory of supplies
Familiarized ourselves with protocols and planned for next week's wet work
Thinking about a team logo
Current plans for the wet work involve starting transformation of the bacteria in order to view the pigment colours and intensities. For this we will need to create competent cells and then use Duncan's plasmids to transform the violet and brown and the biobrick registary parts to transform the red and orange.

A model for this simple system shown above can then be written, keeping the assumptions in mind. To start with, we can consider the two variables that are of importance to us in determining the level of gene expression. These are the mRNA and protein levels (since the DNA levels in a cell are assumed to be constant, they are not of interest).
Therefore, let us write the differential equation for mRNA first -
mRNA is produced from DNA, and degraded spontaneously. Therefore, at any instant of time, the rate of change of mRNA can be written as -
Note, that here, we have not written the reaction where mRNA is being converted to protein,  since mRNA is not actually being consumed there or being produced. 1 molecule of mRNA simply produces 1 molecule of protein (assumption).
Further, it has to be noted that the [DNA] and [mRNA] terms appear in the equation since in writing the model, we assume that mass action kinetics are valid, ie, the rate of the reaction is equal to the rate constant times the concentration of the reactant, raised to a power equal to the number of molecules of the reactant.
Now, we know that the DNA concentration remains constant and does not change over time. Therefore, the [DNA] term can be included in the constant itself, to give
Now, the dynamics of the protein can be similarly written as
And that is it! We’ve just written down our first model, for a gene being expressed from a constitutive promoter. Now that we have our model, we can simulate these and find out the dynamics.
Simulation basically means solving the differential equations to get the variation of the component (mRNA, protein"

Figure 22: Activity assay of each purified fraction of the cultivation with ECOL. Samples were re-buffered into H2O and the protein amount in each fraction has been adjusted. The measurements were done using the standard activity assay protocol over night. The first number indicates the percentage of used elution buffer, whereas the second number stands for the fraction number of this elution.
Since Regionals: ECOL activity depending on different ABTS concentrations
To calculate the activity in Units mg-1, measurements had to be done under substrate saturation. With this the comparison of Units mg-1 with other laccase activities and the literature is possible. To find the optimal substrate saturation ABTS concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 8 mM were applied in an experimental setup containing Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) and temperature conditions of 25 °C. For measurements with 0.1 mM to 5 mM ABTS, 616 ng BHAL laccase were used (see Fig. 23). For measurements with 5 mM to 8 mM ABTS only 308 ng BHAL laccase were applied (see Fig. 24). The amount of oxidized ABTS increased according to the increase of ABTS concentration. To make sure that the substrate saturation is given, 9 mM ABTS have been used in further tests.
Figure 23: Activity assay to determine the substrate saturation with ABTS as a substrate. Measurements were done with 616 ng ECOL laccase in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) at 25 °C. ABTS concentrations ranged from 0.1 mM to 5 mM.

Educational Events
Synthetic Biology Informational
The biggest educational event that our iGEM team organized this year was our Synthetic Biology Informational. We advertized all around campus through every source that we could think of, including flyers in all the buildings, a bulletin in the electronic student newsletter, an ad in the campus newspaper, advertisements through the campus radio station, a banner in the student union building, and chalk on the sidewalks all over campus. Our goals were to increase exposure of iGEM - both our iGEM team and iGEM as a worldwide organization - to the campus community and educate S&T's students and faculty about synthetic biology and its applications.
We prepared and presented a prezi for the Informational. It included an overview of synthetic biology via 2010 EPF Lausanne's video (it was one of our favorites), a history of synthetic biology, how iGEM fits into the synthetic biology picture, examples of awesome iGEM projects from different disciplines, and information about our team, including our project considerations for iGEM 2011.
When explaining how synthetic biology works, we used a lego analogy and physical demonstration with lego genes. At the end of the event, everyone got to take home their own lego gene. Overall, we had a great turn-out, increased awareness of iGEM, and had positive responses from both student and faculty attendees.
PRO Days
PRO is a one-day preview, registration, and orientation program designed for first year students about to enter Missouri S&T. One of the activities for students and parents is an organization fair to familiarize the students with extracurricular opportunities on campus. For the PRO organization fair, our iGEM team created a poster explaining the different aspects of iGEM as a whole and our team. We also created and handed out recruitment brochures explaining in detail why it is so awesome to be a part of iGEM. We attended every spring PRO day and talked to students and parents about why we think synthetic biology is so important and how synthetic biology research can be applied across many disciplines. This not only served as a great recruitment tool for our"
Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," control of floral induction and germination. Despite this, this protein was found to be useful as a tool for Plant Synthetic Biology. As a photosensor protein, is able to change its conformation to the active form when receiving red photons (660 nm). Once in an activated state, it will be able to interact specifically with the transcription factor PIF6 (Khanna, 2004). Bounded complex allows expression of the desired coding sequence under control of operator site Etr8 (an E-responsive operator motif) and minimal promoter (minCMV).
In order to allow any protein expression, PIF6 is fused to a DNA-binding domain (E), which binds to the operator site (Etr8) in the construction we intend to express. Equally, PhyB is linked to a nuclear location sequence (NLS) and an activator domain (VP64), that has the ability to act as a strong transcriptional activator of a gene. This ON state can up-regulate the transcription of the next element of the circuit sparking off the signaling pathway. Likewise, absorption of a far-red photon (740 nm) converts PhyB into the inactive form, leading to dissociation from PIF6 and turning the circuit in an OFF state. (Ni, Tepperman & Quail, 1999). Once genetic pathway is inactivated, gene transcription returns to its basal expression. Plants can produce wanted transcripts in proper time, avoiding continuously even unnecessary expression (i.e. decreasing cell-burden effects).
Figure 1: Graphic design of human-plant circuit. a)  The transcriptional factor, PIF6, is fused to a DNA-binding domain (E) and PhyB is fused to the activator domain (VP64) and a nuclear location sequence (NLS). Both genetic expressions are controlled by plant strong promoters. b) When irradiated with 660nm light, PhyB changes its conformation and this complex is recruited to PIF6 at the promoter site. The polymerase III will recognize the activation domain and the transcription will begin. Only upon absorption of a far-red photon the interaction between PhyB and PIF6 is terminated, resulting in a shut-off of gene expression.
We proposed using Flowering Locus T (FT) because of its ability of inducing flowering process when it is activated. This protein is constitutively expressed in plant cotyledons and leaves, and it involves a remarkable and conservable role in plants. In response to inductive long days Flowering Locus T protein (i.e. phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein) acts in the"

Duke,2013,Team:Duke#Modeling#2 1_-_-_TEXT.html," and strong binding was demonstrated by plotting the fold change in Pbound for 5 Binding sites for the following cases:
5 Strong Binding, 0 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, strong)5
4 Strong Binding, 1 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, strong)4 * (Freg, weak)
3 Strong Binding, 2 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, strong)3 * (Freg, weak)2

1 Strong Binding, 4 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, strong) * (Freg, weak)4
0 Strong Binding, 5 Weak Binding : Freg, total = (Freg, weak)5
The result of having different combinations of strong and weak binding for a promoter with 5 binding site is plotted below. Plots on the left have more strong binding sites (Black = 5 Strong, 0 Weak), and plots on the right have more weak binding sites (Pink = 0 Strong, 5 Weak).
Figure 7. Graph of Fold Change in Pbound vs. Combination of Weak (10nM) and Strong (0.1nM) Binding
Again, when a hill function was fitted onto these data points using ""cftool"" command on MATLAB, the apparent Hill coefficient were determined and labeled next to each plot. As shown, the apparent Hill coefficient is lowest when the degree of unbalanced binding strengths is greatest, and is higher at both ends where the binding strengths at the five binding sites are equal.
An important conclusion that can be drawn from this result is that balanced repressor binding strengths among the battery of repressor binding sites is crucial for increasing cooperativity. Also, even though the dissociation constant of weak repressors was hundred times highers than that of strong repressors, the difference in apparent Hill coefficients were relatively small.
Now that we have demonstrated the effect of number of binding sites and binding strengths on cooperativity using a thermodynamic model, we now move on to characterizing the effect of several parameters on the stability of a system using a Kinetic Model .
