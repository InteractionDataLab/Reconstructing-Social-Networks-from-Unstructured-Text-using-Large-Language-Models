Interdisciplinarity
Introduction
Interdisciplinarity can be loosely defined as the merging of different components from more than one discipline                 (area of study) [1-2]. It is different from “multidisciplinary”, where people from different disciplines                 work for the same goal, but do not communicate or exchange ideas.
Interdisciplinarity is believed to facilitate creative breakthroughs and provide new perspectives [1]. For example,                 drug discovery has benefitted from both chemistry and biology, by integrating knowledge from both areas [3].
We also discovered interdisciplinarity in SMORE. Our cell sorter is a fusion of biology, engineering and design,                 made by our biologist and product designer. This made us think: how important is interdiciplinarity in synthetic                 biology? Can we make synthetic biology more interdisciplinary, to facilitate creativity and innovation?
Our human practices start by exploring interdisciplinarity in synthetic biology. We conducted a skill exchange                 survey to find out the challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration. To study the interdisciplinary status                 of synthetic biology, we asked if more diverse teams perform better in iGEM? The results of both were thought-provoking,                 leading to our work in accessibility.
Skill Exchange Survey
We began our investigation into interdisciplinarity with a simple question: how beneficial and difficult is it                 to work with someone from another background? In a skill exchange survey administered to our team and our                 iGEM collaborators, we developed a series of questions targeted to members involved in a “skill exchange”.                 We defined “skill exchange” as an event where one member taught another in an area previously untrained for                 the latter. For example, one of our biologist brought our product designer into the lab for training in basic                 protocols, including miniprep and agarose gel electrophoresis.
Overall, trainees were surprisingly positive about the learning experience. While they would often appear uneasy                 when approaching with unfamiliar work, they often reported the communication with the trainer was straightforward,                 and the trainer’s expectations were reasonable.
Particularly, a well-defined protocol has been identified to greatly help the trainee. The protocol provides                 clear and"

This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Parameter KM4 is relevant to both KM1 and KM3, however accurate function depicting the relationship is unknown. We estimate the quantity of KM4 by multiplying KM1 and KM3. Noting LA1 and LA2 have already been expressed, we have:
Then we have trouble in expressing protein PluxI and PlasI. Since concentration of protein is the integrals of its mRNA, we assume that it is proportional to concentration of mRNA in a previous time. Thus we have a DDE function:
Equations concerning environmental AHLs remain unchanged.
The original ODEs can be transformed to a much simple DDEs by above deductions.

Stability analysis
In a nonlinear system, proper value ranges of the parameters are vital for producing a periodic oscillating solution. It’s not difficult to find the nonlinear part in our model, thus, we sought to analyze the sensitivity of Hill parameters and thoroughly reveal the internal relationship between Hill parameters and the system’s robustness. For simplicity, here we denoteKM1/ρ1 , KM4/ρ2 and kTL2,kTL4 by km1,km2and β1, β2 respectively. Without loss of generality, we determined to search the affection to the system’s robustness caused by the fluctuation of binary parameter (km2,β2). After observing distinct oscillation mode (we choose two types of concentration of AHLs in environment as our observed object) and its phase trajectory, we depicted the bifurcation of our system.
Set basic parameters as follows:
ka=0,kb=0,μ=10min-1,γ=2.3min-1,β1=30nm/min,km1=1,n1=n2=2,p=0.2,arab=20,t1=t2=0,τ1=6,τ2=10.
We changed the binary parameter (β2，km2) and got the result below.

DETECT
Biotechnology for Talented Kids
Talented children are generally well supported in developed countries. Special programs are set in place to find them amongst the general student population and then give them an education suited to their capabilities. Sadly, that is not the case in developing nations such as Mexico.
The first national efforts towards helping gifted children began a few years ago with a ‘speed’ program that let students advance one school year after passing a competence test. As usual in this country, that solution is near-sighted and mostly useless. What talented kids need is an education that advances continuously at their speed of learning and which takes advantage of their innate curiosity and love of knowledge, not a simple ‘one –year ahead’ pass to be redeemed just once at your nearest school (One coupon per person. Subject to restrictions.).
Other efforts towards encouraging children with higher capabilities to endure the mire of normal education have been set up by the government and civil association: Math Olympics (and, more recently, Physics Olympics too). There are three problems with this strategy. First, it is an event –discrete, limited and circumscribed to no more than a few days a year-, it is not an on-going development program nurturing students’ talents. Second, it selects students who are already good at math and simply polishes them through competition –no room for capable kids who want to learn advanced mathematics. And last, as it is limited in time and reach, it is also limited in scope: why just math (or physics)? Why are the other areas of learning left behind when dealing with talented children? Is it because of the myth that only savant-like mathematical prowess is indicative of a brilliant mind? It is a horrendous waste of human resources to channel all gifted students to fit preconceived notions of what ‘geniuses’ are.
Having all of these issues in mind, and having suffered personally the lack of options available to a young student eager to learn concepts beyond the limited school curricula, we set out to offer a solution. Through SyBRE (the student group we founded) we’ve developed a community service called DETECT (Spanish acronym for ‘Detection of Talented Students’). DETECT is a program aimed to detect gifted children and bring them to the Biology and Chemistry areas. Starting this October, we’ll be visiting local schools and applying a battery of IQ tests to students from all basic grades. After selecting the"
UB_Indonesia,2014,Team:UB Indonesia_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM TEAM is on progress in developing C3P (Cervical Cancer Care Program) as the theme to give solutions for cervical cancer cases. Starting from creating a rapid test tool using HPV DNA which is integrated with the software, creating a high antioxidant tea for preventing efforts, and creating a kit for selecting potential anti-cancer herbs.
We try to make an idea to build a new prototype for early detection to cervical cancer, especially caused by HPV 18 and HPV 16. We construct a new specific TALEs that can bind to our target sequences and we called it TALE 1 and TALE 2. In order to make sure the presence of DNA  from HPV 16 and 18, we need reporter which connect to detector.  Fluorescent protein usually used as reporter gene to study about gene expression. It will be connected to detector using linker. When the HPV DNA is bind to detector, blue colour will appear in the second strip. The Intensity of colour will be detected in our software and we can determined the risk level of cervical cancer disease. Dark blue colour show that the amount of  DNA  from HPV 16 and 18 is high and indicate the patient get severe cervical cancer.
Beside that, we try to take the advantage of tea plant. Tea plant (Camelia sinensis) has catechin compounds that contains antioxidants.  Catechin family that most effective used as antioxidant is Epigallocathecin gallate (EGCG).  Based on research in vitro or in silico, EGCG is able to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells because stop over-expression between L1 HPV 16- EGFR (Epithel Growth Factor Receptor) bond but there are few of EGCG content in tea plant. Based on these problems, we would to over- expression EGCG by knockdown non-compound EGCG gene, so hopefully the content of EGCG on tea are more prominent.
CHS (Cancer Herbal Screening) is a kit which contains of hela cells as cervical cancer cells and it was designed to screening the plants that have compund potentially for cervical cancer therapy. Herbs that potentially as a therapy of cervical cancer in the kit are marked by the absence of green color, while the negative results are marked by the emergence of green in the kit. The kit is expected to provide convenience to the researchers in the field of cervical cancer and cervical cancer effects can be mitigated with natural compound that not a lot of side effects.

Dispense cells into pre-chilled tubes
Freeze cells in a dry ice / ethanol bath and store at -80 degrees indefinitely
Thoughts on improvements
""Methods in Yeast Genetics"" book (Amberg05) suggests growth the SOB + 300 mM NaCl
They also control pH at 7.5, which may be a major issue
Centrifuging in flat bottom centrifuge tubes may make pellet resuspension easier and less damaging
Length of time on ice prior to transformation may make a big difference
The Hanahan protocol specifies dry pure DMSO, while Inoue says it doesn't make a difference.  Let's see.
Warm plates for growing cells after transformation are claimed to be 2x to 4x more efficient.

Data
To establish recombination strategies as a robust and reliable technology, characterisation and definitive information                 of the enzymes are important. In particular, experimental verification of orthogonality between recombinases                 is crucial when using multiple recombinases in parallel. However, sequence and experimental data were scattered                 between online sources, hindering research effort. SMORE compiles and share the information of recombinases                 to promote the use of recombinases.
We have encountered the following issues when researching the four recombinases: Dre, Scre, Vcre and Vika (Table                 2). For Dre and Vika, sequence discrepancies exist between sources and experimental verification was limited.                 For Scre and Vcre, we realized they were not commercially available and the information was buried in supplementary                 material that has limited access. Moreover, the online sources were different from our sequences.
The study of orthogonality of recombinases by Weinberg et al. [12] was a pleasant surprise. However, the study was                 limited in mammalian cells. Orthogonality varies between chassis and a comprehensive study is yet to be seen                 in E. coli.
By providing our definitive sequences in Biobricks supported by experimental data, SMORE improves the accessibility                 of a recombinase strategy.
Please proceed to our Parts page for more information.

I finished my Bachelors in biotechnology and now I am almost done with my second semester of my Masters program in Nanobiophysics at the TU Dresden. Studying in Dresden has given me an insight as to how fascinating science research and technology can be and the unbelievable rate at which it is progressing. I look forward to involving myself in research in the field of molecular biology inclined towards regenerative therapies and molecular motors. The iGEM competition is very exciting to me with its main theme revolving around novel genetically engineered organisms; the best part is that we can design our own biological system, based on our idea, which is limited only by our creativity. Apart from iGEM, I enjoy playing KHO-KHO (Indian game), travelling, music and playing video games.
Adithya Nagarakodige Ananth
aka 'Adi', from Bangalore, India. I am a master student of Nanobiophysics at TU Dresden. By education a Biotechnology engineer and by professional experience a metabolome researcher.  Being an engineer iGEM gives me a perfect blend of systematically engineering the biological assembly the way we build any machines. I consider this opportunity as the first step to be a part of the synthetic biology community. In future, I would like to be a researcher in nanobioscience . I am a reader, admirer of creativity and beauty. I am funny, witty, and sarcastic. There are very less things which do not interest me. I love cooking,traveling, pinch of yoga and lots of sports though not good at many.

Using Flux Balance Analysis we describe the relationship between the metabolism of E. coli and the osmotic pressure of sugar water. From this we can predict how different thresholds of minimal cell-water tolerance will affect the relationship between the survival time and the maximum ATP available for survival (Figure 12). Our model predicts an infinite survival time beyond 90 minutes. We’ve proven in the lab that E. coli can survive at least 24 hours in sugar concentrations that are similar to sugar water for bees. Taking the model into account, we assume that E. coli will survive indefinitely in sugar water. This is taken into account in the beehave model.
Figure 12. The relationship between the maximum ATP available for survival for an E. coli in a sugar-water environment and the theoretical survival time, given a constant water efflux over this time and a starting volume of 2.8e-13 grams. The various coloured lines indicate water tolerance thresholds for the E. coli
We modelled the behavior in beehave mainly because we are interested in how BeeT can best be applied given certain assumptions . If no functional BeeT is applied to the hive, the bee population dynamics will follow the trend as shown in Figure 13a. In other words, the bee colony will collapse after four to five years. If functional but not 100% effective BeeT is applied, the bee population will shrink, and reach an equilibrium with the mite population. (Figure 13b) If effective BeeT is applied to the hive, the mite population dies (Figure 13c).
Figure 13. The honey bee population is shown in blue and the Varroa mite population in red. A: Colony rapidly declines when no BeeT is present. Starting population is 20 Varroa B: Colony barely survives Varroa mite infestation. Shows Varroa mite in red and worker bee population in blue. Starting population is 20 Varroa. C: Colony thrives regardless of Varroa mite infestation. Starting population is 20 Varroa mites. D: Colony thrives regardless of heavy Varroa mite infestation. Starting population is 10.000 Varroa mites.
Furthermore, beehave predicted the most effective time and method to apply BeeT. As the results in Table 1 show, it is more effective to give BeeT-containing sugar water in spring rather than in autumn. Secondly, the model showed that application of BeeT is even more effective using a Lactobacillus species as chassis"

Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Results PR_-_-_TEXT.html," modified in silico to enhance its binding ability to VEGF ligand in our modelling. In protein expression and interaction section, we hope to mutate wildtype VEGF-scFv according to modification provided by dry lab and monitor its binding process with VEGF through a thermodynamic method known as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) developed by Adrian Velazquez-Campoy and Ernesto Freire in 2006 [8].
1. Plasmid construction
VEGF-scFv and VEGF-scFv’ were cloned into pGEX expression vector. VEGF sequence was synthesized by Sangon Biotech on a pET28a expression vector.
2. Protein expression and purification

M: marker; L: lysate; SM: sediment; SN: supernate; FT: flow-through; numbers: eluting concentration of imidazole (in mM)
3. ITC
The titration curve shown in Figure 11 is isothermal titration of VEGF and wild-type VEGF-scFv, of which concentrations are 90uM, 15uM respectively. However, there is no significant exotherm in the titration curve, since fluctuations may be related to the influx of the solution and the background noise of the instrument.
Figure 11. Isothermal titration of VEGF and VEGF-scFv
Figure 12. Isothermal titration of VEGF and VEGF-scFv’
The titration curve shown in Figure 12 is isothermal titration of VEGF and mutation VEGF-scFv (named VEGF-scFv’), of which concentrations are 90uM, 15uM respectively. It can be seen that there is a significant exothermic phenomenon when the first two drops of VEGF are instilled, indicating that VEGF is completely bound to VEGF-scFv', which is superior to wild type. However, subsequent data has no obvious meaning.
Because the ITC experiment requires a higher protein concentration and buffer composition. The preliminary analyses lead to unsatisfactory results are as follows. "

Summary: We validated the promoter function by a fluorescence detection assay utilizing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused construct to BBa_I14034 promoter part.
This construct is produced by combining BBa_114034 promoter part and a GFP coding sequence. This plasmid contains ColE origin and CamR resistance.
Protocol
Liquid cultures
Pick colonies from plate
Multiple controls
Overnight in the 37 incubator
Liquid cultures of already grown liquid cultures
100 uL of grown liquid cultures into 5 mL of media + CamR
Incubate cultures for another 4-6 hours
Spin down cultures
3000 rpm for 5 minutes
Resuspend in 1x Buffer
4 mL of 1x PBS
Pipette or vortex to resuspend cells
Plate reading
Take 100 uL of the resuspended cells
Load into a 96 well transparent plate
Measure absorbance and fluorescence with GFP assay (excitation: 495 nm, emission: 509 nm)
Three negative control constructs containing different promoter sequences were used and compared in this assay: 1) T7 promoter (Invitrogen, USA), 2) pCP25 (BBa_K1509003) and 3) pPA3 promoter (BBa_K2458000). These three promoter do not contain GFP coding sequence.
For the fluorescence detection, we used a plate reader Infinite M200pro (TECAN Trading, Switzerland) which is equipped at the Ellington lab in UT Austin.
Because the part’s description stated that part BBa_I14034 is designed as a constitutive promoter, we did not add Isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as a inducer for gene expression.
The plate reader measured the absorbance and fluorescence of each cell containing the BBa_I14034::GFP construct and non-GFP construct. Value of fluorescence was divided by cell density (absorbance) and the final result was shown as a graph in Figure 1 (below). The graph in figure 2 (below) shows a close-view of the fluorescence measured of the GFP driven by the control promoters.

Monday Christian ran the INP+YFP, GFP, and OMPA from last week’s PCR and found that only GFP had a band. Re-did PCR from Friday but modified the protocol. 1 µl of DMSO was added to OMPA and YFP+INP and PCR was run using PHUSION protocol/setting. Jon continued work on general project research and itinerary design. Tuesday Christian ran the DNA from Monday on a gel to confirm the correct band sizes. Christian then did PCR purification of the 3 genes and digested with DPN1 enzyme overnight. Jon continued work on general project research and itinerary design.
Wednesday Christian did PCR purification again on the 3 genes after the DPN1 digestion to remove the enzyme and further concentrate the samples. He ran them on a gel again to confirm the correct identity. He then did a Gibson assembly (YFP+INP alone, and GFP with OMPA) and transformed into cells. Jon continued work on general project research and itinerary design. Thursday Christian did a colony check on the GFP + OMPA and the YFP + INP (x9 colonies). Pseudomonas endolysin genes came in and Christian transformed it into TOP 10 Cells.

Part 1: BACKBONE
We have cut the backbone out of pTALEN (v2) NG with Ngo MIV and AfiII and purified the corresponding 2234bp band from a gel. Since both enzymes produce 5’ overhangs, they were compatible with overhangs produced by BsaI digestion. This backbone contains a SV 40 polyadenylation signal, an ampicillin resistance gene and an origin of replication.
Part2: CMV promoter
At first, we tried to use the CMV promotor that was included in the 2012 distribution kit. Part BBa_J52034 was submitted to the registry by Team Slovenia in 2006 and has been on the distribution kit since then (although sequencing was inconsistent every year). After numerous attempts to use this part, we sequenced it and found out that it was not a CMV promotor, but a part of the lacI gene. Reading the part’s review, we noticed that Team Munich 2010 had already pointed out that it was a lacI fragment. Interestingly, Team DTU Denmark was able to induce fluorescent protein expression with this bacterial gene fragment- magic. Since no other mammalian promoter was available on this year’s distribution kit, we designed the following primers and amplified the CMV promoter from the vector pPhi-Yellow-C:
GTTACCGGTCTCGTTAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGATAGTAATCAATTACGGGGTC
CTAGAGGTCTCGCTGCCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTAGATCTGACGGTTCACTAAAC
After amplifying the CMV promoter with these primers, the promoter is not only flanked by the iGEM prefix and suffix, but also by distal BsaI restriction sites. This way, we were able to directly assemble the PCR product with the other MammoBrick parts.
Part 3: PuroORF
We replaced the hygromycin resistance gene in pTALEN (v2) NG for two reasons: Firstly, it contained multiple iGEM restriction sites and secondly, selection via hygromycin takes much longer than selection with puromycin. Since we also didn’t find a puromycin ORF without illegal restriction sites, we decided to make silent mutations in the PuroORF to remove these sites and get it synthesized, flanked by BsaI restriction sites and appropriate overlaps for subsequent Golden Gate cloning.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Supporting Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," Differences Between Founders and non-Founders
To further understand the enabling factors in biotech entrepreneurship, independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare population differences between Founders and non-Founders. More specifically, research was done to understand population differences in the degree of 1) entrepreneurship consulting, 2) advising and 3) cluster support. These variables were chosen because of their significance in the previous regressions and the emphasis the interviewees put on these factors. Understanding differences in Founder and non-Founder characteristics provides further insight into enabling factors in biotech.
1. T-Test Entrepreneurship Consulting
The first t-test examined if having more (or any) entrepreneurship consulting was significant in founding a startup from iGEM. Having access to Entrepreneurship consulting proves yet again to be a very influential variable in business creation. There was a significant difference between the Founders (M = 4.07, SD = 2.21) and non-Founder (M = 1.74, SD = 1.33), conditions; t(138) = -5.56 and p = 0.00. This data completely rejects the null hypothesis and suggests Founders are much different than non-Founders in either having access to and/or effectively using entrepreneurship consulting to found.
2. T-Test: Advising
There was a significant difference between Founders having enough advising (M = 5.53, SD = 1.51) and non-Founders having enough advising (M = 4.74, SD = .146), conditions; t(138) = -1.67, p = 0.097. In line with entrepreneurship consulting, having enough advising is significantly more apparent in the Founder population than non-Founder population. This means enough advising (in academia, science, business creation, etc.) enables iGEM teams to found businesses.
3. T-Test: Cluster Support
There was a significant difference between the Founder cluster support (M = 3.61, SD = .55) and the non-Founder cluster support (M = 2.77, SD = .146) conditions; t(138) = -1.71, p = 0.089. This implies Founders had greater support from their region and/or industry members regarding their iGEM projects, leading to startup founding success.
Summary and Discussion of T-Tests
The t-tests represent differences in Founder and non-Founder population resources that could partially explain why some teams founded and others did not. The Founders had clear advantages in entrepreneurship consulting, general advising and cluster"

We have enabled the community to stand upon the shoulders of a SBiDer-sized giant.
Gary Le
Gary is a second year undergraduate at UC San Diego born in Milpitas, California with a strong interest in biological studies and medicine. Prior to involvement with the UCSD Software team, he had little exposure to web application development. Aiding the team in building the SBiDer web tool has given him a greater understanding of synthetic biology, and he is motivated to continue pursuing study in the new field.
Human Biology, Business, 2017
I started aboard the UCSD Software iGEM team after hearing about a project for undergraduates centering around the relatively new field of synthetic biology. The subject was one I had no practical experience with but was one that I had been avidly following since I had first heard of the term ""synthetic"" being applied to a field of biology. With no knowledge of how to program in any language and with only an introductory knowledge into genetic circuitry, I decided to apply for a chance to help in the endeavor. At first, I was both intimidated by the scope of the project planned and the skills set of my future team members and mentors, but I grew more excited and impressed the more skill I had begun to learn and concepts I started to understand. My skill set expanded rapidly in the oncoming months to include ways of analyzing problems algorithmically and constructing methods to approach a solution above the various programming languages I learned.
These skills were implemented with equal rapidity as I worked to create a user interface for the manually-curated network of synthetic genetic devices. The weeks passed before I had realized, and I felt overwhelmed at times by the material I needed to not only learn but master in order to create a viable component to the SBiDer project. However, with guidance from the graduate students and practice, I was able to implement the front-end application that was capable of rendering a visual network of the database information that could dynamically be altered and manipulated to allow users to explore connections of the database through a graphic interface. I additionally spent time learning from other team members about the nature of the genetic circuits to improve my biological foundation as well as how to manipulate and represent data in order to begin constructing a way to aid in creating models of the circuit behavior.
Like all goals worth pursuing, working with the UCSD iGEM team required many hours of difficult work and challenges to be solved. The result , however, improved my own personal ability and produced a project with"

As a step toward this goal, we first sought to demonstrate that viral particles could be produced when a helper plasmid missing gene VIII is complemented by a copy of gene VIII constitutively expressed on a separate construct; we chose to place gene VIII on the messaging phagemid.
1. Constructs
1a. Experimental constructs
To test the complementation of gene VIII, we used E. coli βDH10B strain containing the messaging phagemid and helper plasmid as a sender population, and we used E. coli JM109 strain containing a constitutively expressed GFP expression cassette (BBa_I20260) in pSB3K3 (Kanamycin-resistant) as a receiver population. The senders, E. coli βDH10B, require diaminopimelic acid (DAP) as supplement for growth in LB media. The receivers, E. coli JM109 are F+ and do not require this supplement. (Recall that receivers must be F+ for delivery of a DNA message by an M13 particle.) This allows counter-selection against sender cells by growing in LB media with no DAP supplementation.  Receiver cells that have received the message can be selected using chloramphenicol and RFP expression.
In order to perform the gene VIII complementation test, we made the following constructs using standard assembly and PCR methods, and then transformed them sequentially into E. coli βDH10B (F-) strain (Figure 1.1).
M13 ori – RFP cassette - Constitutive Promoter + RBS – M13 gVIII (pSB1C3) (BBa_K314110- BBa_J04450- BBa_K1039020)
HPdO Δ gVIII (BBa_K1039017)
Figure 1.1: A messaging phagemid containing M13 gVIII would complement a modified helper plasmid with gVIII deleted and create M13 viral particles. The messaging phagemid would then be packaged into an M13 viral particle due to the presence of the M13 origin on the phagemid and could then be transferred through viral infection.
An indicator plasmid containing a GFP expression cassette was transformed into E. coli JM109 (F+) receiver cells (Figure 1.2).

PowerCell Contruct Design
We wanted to isolate sucrose secretion to just vegetative cells, as heterocysts do not participate in production of sucrose through photosynthesis. A similar cell-type-specific gene expression was was achieved in Construction and use of GFP reporter vectors for analysis of cell-type-specific gene expression in Nostoc punctiforme . Arguetta et al. confined expression of a fluorescent marker to only vegetative cells in a similar filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacterium, Nostoc Punctiforme. They placed the GFP gene behind a promoter present in the Photosystem I of Nostoc punctiforme, psaC. This way, GFP expression was only turned on in photosynthesizing cells, and not in heterocysts. They did not know the exact sequence of the psaC promoter, so they just took the 400 base pairs upstream of the psaC gene as a unit containing the promoter. We have done similarly to isolate the psaC promoter from Anabaena 7120. Below is an image showing cell-type-specific GFP expression achieved in the paper.
Cell-type-specific GFP expression in Nostoc  punctiforme. Arguetta et al.
We placed a sucrose symporter gene, cscB, behind our Anabaena 7120 psaC promoter in order to  confine sucrose secretion to only vegetative cells. Registry standard RBSes and terminators were used for ease of assembly and compatibility. Below is a diagram of our sucrose secretion device. A discussion of the inner workings of the cscB gene can be found in Active Transport by the CscB Permease in Escherichia coli K-12 .
We have also created several other constructs containing GFP for debugging purposes. We used a modified version of GFP, GFPmut3B because normal florescence markers are easily lost among background chlorophyll pigments in cyanobacteria ( Design and characterization of molecular tools for a Synthetic Biology approach towards developing cyanobacterial biotechnology ).

We have known the function of the three toxic peptides of PANTIDE, Omega-hexatoxin-Hv1a, µ-segestritoxin-Sf1a, and Orally Active Insecticidal Peptide(OAIP) respectively and they are easy to express with the help of the bacteria E. coli BL21 Rosetta Gami strain. So, we then start to create BioBricks of these three toxins which we have obtained the nucleotide sequences. We use a strong T7 promoter that is suitable with the strain of E. coli we chose and also powerful at expressing proteins with multiple disulfide bonds, and we add His-tag for protein purification.
PANTIDE without Lectin
PANTIDE can be a single toxic peptide of the three toxins we chose, Hv1a, Sf1a, and OAIP respectively, which derive from the natural predators spiders.

The BioBrick K802000 , built by the iGEM Team iGEM12_Lyon_INSA , was kindly sent by the team Insa-Lyon . Via PCR-amplification, the actual lyosostaphin-gene was amplified, adding the restriction sites required for the RFC25.
The coding sequence was cloned together with the promoter Pxyl ( BBa_K1351039 ) into the plasmid pBS1C ( BBa_K823023 ). After transformation into B. subtilis, the iGEM-team Groningen will evaluate the effectiveness of lysostaphin, produced by B. subtilis against S. aureus via spot on lawn test. This test will be conducted with living cells as well as with cell lysate in order to evaluate whether the lysostaphin is secreted into the supernatent by B.subtilis or not.

The original DspB contains an AgeI restriction site, which was deleted via site directed mutagenesis by overlaping extension PCR in order to make the gene compatible with the Freiburg standard RFC 25 .
Overhangs with RFC 25 compatible restriction sites where added during this PCR and the PCR-product was cloned into the pCRII-Topo-vector.
After sequence confirmation, the DspB will be cloned into pSB1C3 in order to be sent in as a BioBrick. The His-Tag will be added added C- and N-terminally, and a copy of each of the His-tagged-constructs, and one copy without His-tag will be cloned together with the promoter Pxyl ( BBa_K1351039 ) into the vector pBS1C ( BBa_K823023 ). The transformation into B. subtilis will follow.
In order to test the biofilm dissolving abilities of this recombinant B. subtilis, biofilms of E. coli Nissle 1917, an excellent biofilm forming bacteria with GRAS-status, will be grown in 96 well plates. The biofilms will be dy"
DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#PlugnplayAssembly_-_-_TEXT.html,"pnI treatment or by gel band purification(2).
Previous studies have demonstrated a high level of correct assembly and directionality of fragments (2,3) and although we did not make such analysis ourselves it was in general our perception that this was the case, as of the more than 25 different Plug 'n' Play assemblies performed we encountered no more than two false-positives.
It is well known that mutations can be introduced during PCR. To minimize mutations the x7 proof-reading polymerase (4) that are fully compatible with the Plug 'n' Play standard should be used. The x7 proof-reading polymerase helps lowering the risk of introducing mutations.
The design of the system
The system was designed based on the most common categories of biological part in the order; promotor, gene of interest (GOI), tail sequence (TS), terminator, marker cassette, and vector backbone. The standard marker cassette consists of a promoter, a gene, and a terminator. Short sequences are such as ribosomal binding sites (RBS) are meant to be integrated in the forward or reverse primer of the desired part when amplifying it by PCR. An example of this can be found on this page .
The system is dependent on the assembly of the custom-made linkers on each part. The parts with linkers are synthesized by PCR amplification of template DNA using primers designed with an upstream extension of 8-9 additional nucleotides with a single deoxyuridine residue directly upstream the part. In order to assemble multiple parts while having a flexible system the linkers have an adenine in the 5' end and a thymine in the 3' end. Furthermore, it is important that the linkers of the different parts are not identical to ensure the directionality and correct order of the biobricks.
Illustrated below, are the sequences of linkers between the parts, which are generated from the overhangs (linkers) on the PCR products.
The linkers are responsible for the flexibility of the system in that it for instance is possible use any promoter, since they will always have the same linkers. In the Plug 'n' Play system the coding sequence(s) can either consist of one gene of interest (GOI), called a module, or a GOI and a tail sequence, which could be any given DNA sequence of interest.

Bias introduced the network directed graph model, reveals the causal relationship between the gene expression level of statistical hypothesis based on the linear model, nonlinear model and hidden Markov model as a special case, including covers, the introduction of random element and hidden variables, and can well handle the hidden variable, can clearly model for data acquisition the process, can handle the problem of missing data and noise data, but also the confidence of different characteristics of the network.
When the experiment has been done and the data obtained, this model can be applied to examine the accuracy of the data obtained by experiment. We advance that the expression level of miRNA should be obtained by experimental process, basing on the current data document to erect the database and build up the relationship between it and the possibility of getting mammary cancers or clinic pathological characteristics, which lead to our primary predictive result. This result is not assured to be 100 percent correct, but it is not hard to imagine that in the near future, we can make full use of the miRNA as a tumor’s signature, and this model will be labeled with foreknowledge and significant directive. However, since we could not extract basic data from documents, we had to take deep cooperation with a hospital in order to collect a large number of samples, which was far beyond our ability. Regretfully, we had to give up this idea. But by communicating with doctors of oncology department thoroughly, doctors found our idea was very significant meaningful and very suitable for popularizing, and the only thing we need was just more time.
We have improved the problem that reaction rate of the very reversible reaction is the same. The reaction rate is the same, which is the result of the reaction coming to chemical equilibrium, and one of the key points of this model is the beginning of the 20 minutes of each reaction, If we design the model directly from the equilibrium rate, it will have a huge impact on the follow-up results. Based on the estimates of these biological responses, we set a large difference between the positive and negative reaction rate. Considering the consistency of the FimE loci and the terminator in terms of position and biochemical reactions, we have simplified the variables and parameter settings of USTC Team, only need to use TOFF concentration to undertake FimE and mRNA"

It is very important for us to consider                         more about the balance between cost and profits if we want to further develop our method. Now,                         the exported UDCA drugs are highly demanded and we need to find ways to help simplify the                         production process and to increase the supply of UDCA-contained drugs.
Interview
Q：We still have some questions regarding to the market. It would be such a pleasure if you can                         share some of your ideas or understandings about them.
A : Please ask, I’m very glad to help you.
Q1: Could you please inform us UDCA medicine’s value in market and its efficacy?
A: UDCA is an cholic acid medicine that has choleretic effect to human bodies. It can cure                         various dan diseases like gallstone as well as hepatopathy including hepatic adipose                         infiltration. UDCA medicine has stronger healing effect than CDCA medicine while having less                         side effects in treatment. However, subtracted from bears, UDCA has a relatively high costs. And                         using UDCA directly converted by CDCA mainly has two benefits: first of all, it requires a lower                         cost because CDCA is subtracted from poultry like chickens, ducks, and geese; also, use CDCA                         instead of UDCA can help protect wild animals (bears.) Also, I consulted experts in our                         marketing department about it and they revealed to me that this approach has very high                         vendibility that medicines manufactured oversea are in short supply.
Q2: What is the basic principle of this drug design/production?
: First we extract CDCA from the bile of chicken, duck and geese. Then we convert CDCA into UDCA                         through two steps of redox reaction. These two substance are isomers than differ in their                         three-dimensional structure only.
Q3: We found out that there are only few factories manufactures UDCA medicine. Is it because the                         producing process’s complexity? Where is the complexity embodied in specific?
A: In fact, the actual process or technology used is not very complex but the key dangerous                         factor is the need of sodium, a dangerous, active metal that burns when it meets with water.                         Moreover, to consider this issue from other perspectives, UDCA medicine’s production copes wth                         the pressure from people’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not                         too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine.
Maybe there are only two factories in China that"

For sure they did not use our methods, but they always cultivated the best and biggest plants for the next year crops, as well as, mixed different plants to create something new and probably better.
NMS St. Leonhard
On May 3 we got the chance to visit a “New Middle School” (NMS) in Graz. We were talking about iGEM and Synthetic Biology in all grades (from 1st to 4th). For this reason, we separated in two groups of 2/3 and visited 2 classes at a time. The lesson started with a small introduction to synthetic biology and genetic engineering, in a child-appropriate manner. We compared DNA and genes to a recipe and tried to keep it as simple as possible. The kids were very attentive and curious. Some of them also had an impressive knowledge about the topic. They asked us questions about Genetic Fingerprinting and inheritance.  After the theoretical part, we did our DNA extraction from strawberries again. The enthusiasm was huge and some kids told us they wish to become biologists, like we are. It was an awesome experience and we will never forget the excitement in the kid’s eyes.
Spritzerstand
After bringing the subject closer to the general public at “Lange Nacht der Forschung” and to kids by teaching at NMS, we tried to figure out the best way to get our university and especially students from all departments involved. It did not take long and we came up with the idea of a “Spritzerstand” on June 16. Spritzer is very popular among young people here in Austria, as it is wine mixed with sparkling water. We also added some flavour like raspberry and elder. Around the “Spritzerstand” we placed posters and further information about our project. The students were very curious and interested in what we are doing. It was a great success and it had exactly the effect we wanted because people were spending hours talking, drinking and discussing science!
Sturmstand
After the great success of our “Spritzerstand” in summer, we thought about doing a similar thing in fall. In Austria it is very popular to drink must, grape juice during fermentation. Especially in fall must in combination with sweet chestnuts is a lovely thing. For this reason, we planned a must event (like the spritzer event) on October 18. It is a great chance for us to present the results of our project to fellow students and to continue spreading the idea of iGEM among young people.

Collaborations with Other iGEM Teams
We collaborated  with two iGEM teams, National Yang Ming University (NYMU) and American School in Japan (ASIJ).  We mentored the ASIJ-Tokyo high school iGEM team, which is a new High school iGEM team this year. We taught them how to start and structure a new team, what lab and online resources to use for experiments, and how to set up a lab notebook. In return, they helped us test our nanoparticle calculator by running simulations from the standpoint of a patient, doctor, and manufacturer.
We also continued our long standing partnership with National Yang Ming University (NYMU_Taipei). Three students from our team have been interning on the NYMU-Taipei team (they are members to both teams) to learn about synthetic biology and some basic lab techniques.  Two of these students will be presenting for the NYMU_Taipei team presentation. NYMU-Taipei also hosted a summer camp for our team members, where they taught us about different aspects of iGEM. In return, we helped them increase the efficiency of their model using equations from their literature research and ran simulations using their experimental data. Finally, they also gave tremendous advice on troubleshooting our cloning procedure during the summer months when we ran the majority of our wet lab experiments. We really value the relationship we have with NYMU and look forward to more collaborations in the future.
These collaborations not only created opportunities for us to help each other with problems, but also allowed us to exchange ideas and stimulate creativity. It is also fun to share stories about lab work, successes, and even failures.
Impact
Counteracts Marketing Plan
With the help of our business and economics teacher, we developed a comprehensive marketing plan for our cataract prevention and treatment products, in order to create a more profound impact in terms of public awareness of cataracts.  Within this plan we performed a situational analysis based on market research, customer analysis, environmental/industrial considerations, and regulatory constraints (such as quality control and SWOT analysis). Furthermore, we statistically analyzed our products’ viability in the market by developing pricing and promotional strategies. Upon completion, we initiated discussions with several biotechnology investors and published our plan on business starter websites to garner interest.
We received constructive feedback from a former intern at RA Capital (a biotechnology investment firm). He suggested that we focus on cost projections, for it would put us in a better position to engage with venture capitalists. He also thought our competitor analysis and initial market sizing was impressive. Furthermore,"

Southwest Union
Having deep cooperation with Southwest Union(iGEM meet-up in southwest China) last year, we viewed the meet-up an important role in our early-stage, thus, as soon as our project got mostly shaped, we discussed with SCU-WestChina about holding the Southwest Union meet-up of 2017. Together with the SCU-WestChina, SCU-China , UESTC-China and SICAU-China, we have an overall assessment of the safety and feasibility of our project and the latest trend of iGEM competition including the newly added judging terms, etc. What matters most was that all teams exchanged information and built a deeper relationship.
CCiC Conference
As the competition approaches, the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) conference was hosted by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU-China), in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams. This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 48 teams. It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project. The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students. We made the best of the Panel Session and poster exhibition to establish collaborations with other teams. Interestingly, we were lucky to have deep conversations with Igem headquarter King L. CHOW and former iGEMer Zhang Haoqian, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university. From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements. More importantly, we made great acquaintance with many students and establish deep collaborations with teams with same interest, including ShanghaiTech University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

Project Overview
Our machine was designed as a proof of concept that commensal bacteria, which live normally and harmlessly on the human body, can be engineered to function as diagnostic and prophylactic devices against pathogens which are otherwise difficult to detect or control. Basically we wish to explore the possibility that commensal bacteria can be used as a biological “suit of armour” against disease.
We decided to focus on Human Papillomavirus, which is a sexually transmitted infection which causes cervical cancer. HPV invades the vaginal mucosa, which is where commensal Lactobacillus gasseri and various other Lactic Acid Bacteria can be found in high numbers in healthy females, making L. gasseri a good candidate as a chassis for our protective machine. Although we acquired a strain of L.gasseri, we were unable to test the machine in it due to a lack of appropriate shuttle vectors for cloning purposes. Thus, we elected to use Bacillus subtilis as a model Gram-positive organism, for initial proof of concept.
Machine Schematic
This schematic diagram illustrates how our machines would function in tandem to detect and report the presence of a viral infection. The commensal bacterial chassis would contain either of two machines and would need to exist as a mixed population. One machine, would detect the presence of the viral infection and use quorum sensing peptides to signal to the other machine that a virus has been spotted. This machine would then produce a coloured reporter which would be detectable by the host.
Desired behaviour of our machines
When designing the machine we considered the following:
The ability of the bacteria to detect and respond to a virus/viral element
Engineering a bacterium to alter its gene expression based on recognition of a specific virus is a major difficulty. For the purposes of this project we chose to focus, instead, on building and tweaking the ability of the machine to respond in certain ways to a specific (but non-viral) stimulus as a “proxy” for infection. Once this was achieved, it would be possible to investigate how to make the machine specific for HPV.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Collaborations#Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium_-_-_TEXT.html,"Lesson 1 - School Project Kick-Off
By Nina 20:48, April 28 2014 (CDT)
Today was the kick-off for the cooperation between our iGEM team and the Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium, a secondary school in Aachen. In the upcoming weeks, exciting school lessons with members of our iGEM team await the students of the 9th grade biology-chemistry class. Different aspects of our project will be highlighted and explained to the students. Demonstrative experiments will explain the practical relevance.
In today's lesson, our members Nina and René offered the students a short impression of what to expect in the course of this teaching module. We also explained synthetic biology and the goal of our project.
Lesson 2 - iGEM team members back 2 school
By Nina 16:00, May 22 2014 (CDT)
Since our last visit, the student of the biology-chemistry course at Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium in Aachen have been busy studying the basics of protein biosynthesis and the ""lock and key"" model. Now the 9th graders are prepared to have a closer look at synthetic biology and our project.
Each year, many people die of nosocominal infections - infections that the patients acquired in a hospital. However, these infections would be preventable in large part through better hygiene programs. Diseases caused by multi-resistant pathogens are especially critical because therapy options are very limited in these cases.
But actually, what are pathogens exactly and where do they come from? In order to answer these questions, we start the teaching module with the topic ""Microorganisms in our Environment"". In this part, we explain which germs we encounter every day, and how be can best protect ourselves from them.
In order to demonstrate how many and which microorganisms are our steady companions, we conduct an experiment with the students. A pair of students received 3 agar plates: one with regular LB agar, one plate with agar supplemented by an antibiotic, and one selective agar plate for yeasts and fungi. Equipped with the plates, the students wander through their school and take contact samples from places they think many microorganisms grow there. We will incubate the plates over the weekend so that we can show the students in the next lesson what has grown on their samples.

Rutgers,2013,Team:Rutgers#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," from this point then the active site and the functionality of the first protein would be at risk. In order to eliminate such risk there are linkers used. Linkers usually contain amino acids that are not very active and would not harm the functionality of the protein, glycine and serine are two very common amino acids used for linkers. The linker would be composed so that there would be an alternating trend of glycine then serene. The amount of reiterations is variable and depends on the location on the protein where the last amino acid is located. Normally, there is one or two reiterations of the glycine and serine. Upon the proper insertion of a linker, the expression of two proteins will be joined with no decrease in activity or functionality.
We are using a glycine serine linker in our project to join the expression of qsdA and GFP. The last amino acid of the qsdA protein lies on the surface of the protein and is far away from any important locations. Therefore, we are implementing a 2 repeats of glycine serine to make sure no factors harm either protein’s function. The reason we are implementing this fusion is to have a clear indication when qsdA in the cell has become active, GFP will become active and create green pigmentation, and to visually see the self-regulation that the lux operon and qsdA create.  This, amongst other things, will allow us to do multiple assays about qsdA and its function.
ASSAY
Flourescence Assay - Our project submission BBa_6120600, is designed with a glycine serine amino acid link between the degradation enzyme qsda-1 and GFP reporter.  Because of this, when the enzyme begins degrading the autoinducer AHL in the surrounding environment, our plasmid will fluoresce green.  For this assay, we used a Tecan plate reader to measure relative fluorescence given off by our modified E. Coli cell when AHL is prominent in the cell’s environment.
To be sure we are getting correct results, we decided to measure the relative fluorescence given off by our project cell when it is uninduced, our project cell when it is induced by the autoinducer AHL, and cells of the green fluorescence protein that will be constitutively be expressing fluorescence.  The hypothesized results before the assay was preformed were that the GFP would show the most relative fluorescence.  That the uninduced project cells will show little to no fluorescence, and the induced project cells will have a relative fluorescence in between the two.
Before we could run the assay, we had"

During the beta test of the Labsurfing concept of Team Darmstadt our team played host for the three team members Laurin, Thomas and Fabian during the last stop in their south tour. We showed them our beautiful city and introduced them to our local franconian cuisine. The next day was less fun more work. We presented to each other the progress of our projects since the meetup in Marburg. Afterwards we participated in their study to help improving the Labsufing website and of course all of us registered there.
Marburg - Human Practice
During the meetup we especially connected with Team Marburg . Tresor came up with the idea of a human practice collaboration with our team. We wanted to create a board game for children to introduce them to biology. Therefore Filip, Frederike, Nadine and Sabrina visited Marburg (15/08/15-15/08/16) where we thought of the basic concept of „Game of Cells“. Afterwards Team Erlangen was responsible for the biological content and the informative texts, while Marburg designed the game. To test the game, Tresor came to Erlangen (15/09/06-15/09/08) where we played the game and improved it.
Aix-Marseille University - Chewing-gum Survey
The team from Marseille asked us to participate in their survey about chewing gum and GMOs (genetically modified organisms). Three team members joined in the survey to help them in gaining statistically relevant results.

We are iGEMers from BNU-China, we are going to tell you a story about E.coli Prometheus ...
Mr E.coli Prometheus is a philanthropic bacterium. One day, he saw many poor peanuts living in so tough a condition that they couldn't grow up nor to flower. He was determined to do something and help!
He turned to us. He asked us for the power to collect molybdate and send them to poor peanuts. We told him: "" Since you were not naturally born with the power, for the sake of other lives, you must die after."" But he was as determined as ever.
With his power, E.coli Prometheus collected molybdate ...
He sent the precious micro-nutrient to those peanuts everyday. The peanuts became more and more healthier and was about to flower ...
Sadly, E.coli Prometheuspassed away before he saw the flowers of peanut. He suicided as promised. His body changed into nutrition for peanut after his death.      He is honorable.
THE STORY OF E.COLI PROMETHEUS
Our work
The ability of rhizobium to fix nitrogen is essential for legumes growth and development. The stronger the ability, the less chemical fertilizer will be used. Molybdenum is a key element in rhizobial nitrogen fixing enzyme, and is also necessary for the growth of plants themselves. However, Mo being heavy mental, abusing it will pollute the environment. Hence, spot application of Mo is of great importance; it would be even better to concentrate the element only around the roots.
We transferred our designed plasmids into E.coli ""Prometheus"" to make it express a fusion protein: one half of it anchors on the outter membrane and the other side, namely ModA, absorbs molybdate. With the help of organic acid chemotaxis system, our ""Prometheus"" will head for the roots. A suicide system depending on"
Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". The growth-inhibiting effect on microorganisms has been proposed to be due to the inflow of undissociated acid into the cytosol. Undissociated weak acids are liposoluble and can diffuse across the plasma membrane. In the cytosol, dissociation of the acid occurs due to the neutral intracellular pH, thus decreasing the cytosolic pH. With the obvious decrease of intracellular PH, acetate could cause severe amino acid starvation, repress the normal center carbon metabolism and thus damage the physiology of whole cell. Acetic acid has been shown to induce apoptosis in yeast, and TOR pathways (Tor1p) are involved in the signaling of acetic acid-induced apoptosis. Furan derivatives have been shown to reduce the specific growth rate, the cell-mass yield on ATP, the volumetric and specific ethanol productivities. They could give rise to production of oxidative stress, and consumption of enegy (as ATP) and reducing power (as NADPH, NADH). For example, HMF has been shown to cause accumulation of lipids and decrease the protein content in yeast cells. And furfural reduction to furfuryl alcohol by NADH dependent dehydrogenases has a higher priority than reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol, and furfural causes inactivation of cell replication. Phenolic compounds partition into biological membranes may cause loss of integrity, thereby affecting their ability to serve as selective barriers and enzyme matrices. They have been suggested to exert a considerable inhibitory effect in the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates, the low molecular weight phenolic compounds being most toxic. However, the mechanism of the inhibiting effect has not been elucidated, largely due to a lack of accurate qualitative and quantitative analyses. What’s more, the three groups of inhibitors have been shown to interact synergistically or antagonistically when they coexist, making the inhibition mechanism more complicated. With the treatment of composite inhibitors, the yeast will suffer from the raise in protein degradation, and ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), unfolded protein response as well as excessive consumption of ATP, which may lead to the stasis of ethanol production and cell growth, and even autophagy.
Clarification of the inhibiting mechanism is indispensible for the manipulation and domestication of inhibitor-resistant yeast. However, traditional methods that only focus on the characterization of a few genes or proteins are too limited for elucidating the composite mechanism. Therefore, there is plainly a tendency that system biology, as well as synthetic biology in which varieties of “Omics” (pro"

To introduce the lower school to synthetic biology and the ethics involved in this exciting field of science we created a weekly club within our school. We chose to make the club specifically for year 7s because by teaching them the basic principles of genetic engineering they can research further throughout their time in high school and form their own opinions about genetic engineering and potentially become the future iGEM team. The club provided the iGEM team with the opportunity to engage with the younger members of the school community and explore their opinions about the complex ideas we were introducing them to.
Each weekly 1-hour session in the BioBlast club built upon their knowledge about DNA and genetic engineering starting from the basics and gradually working up. We started by looking at cells and using microscopes to identify the nucleus, then in following sessions, we studied DNA and its structure. All our sessions had a practical element to keep students engaged since they were 11-12 years old. For example, when we were looking at the structure of DNA we used sweets to create 3D models - this was very successful as by the end of the session they could identify elements of the DNA structure. In following sessions, we transitioned onto Darwin and Mendel and the effect of genes on phenotypes (demonstrated by a practical involving Gelli-baff which mimicked natural selection) and then moved onto genetic engineering. It was in these sessions that big ethical debates were raised naturally by the students and lead onto organic discussions such as “Should we genetically engineer a ‘perfect’ human?” and “Is it ethical to genetically modify farm animals for agriculture?”.
It was very encouraging to see these debates developing without prompting from us and to see these issues discussed with a solid scientific background. In the final session, we played a board game created by the Exeter IGEM team in 2016 which taught the students about plasmid construction and illuminated the vast potential of genetic engineering- this was very successful as at this point the students had a solid scientific foundation and could follow along very well to a game created for slightly older students. It was important to us that the club was interactive and can"

This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated HP_-_-_TEXT.html," We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rectify misconceptions. We tried to ask students and parents questions like - “do you think it is dangerous to work with bacteria” or “is genetic modification safe?” Initial responses were generally negative, but the questions gave us a platform to address the issues.
The concept of toehold switches had also proved extremely challenging to explain. We subsequently developed the analogy of a knot to explain them. The knot prevents a protein making factory (ribosome) from reading the instructions (mRNA) to make a protein that glows (GFP). Through diagrams, and use of animations, we were able to explain the concept of our project. We delivered an assembly where we used this analogy to explain our project and sent out a quiz. To our delight people understood most of our project and a few understood nearly everything. 109 completed the quiz and the majority scored over 75%. Find out more on our engagement page .
We thereby vastly improved our education and public engagement programmes, learning from how people to develop an approach for explaining difficult concepts in an accessible and interesting way. We improved our presentation and communication skills throughout the project. We were delighted that rest of the open days, as well our assemblies and workshops went so well and got people interested in synthetic biology.

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Project#Thaumatin_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration of protein in the flow through (see figure C and D)
no clear peak around fraction No. 14 could be detected
SDS-PAGE performed from the reference and the fractions No. 12 to 15 showed a weak bond having the same size as the reference (see running properties on SDS-PAGE in figure D) and the same isoelectric point (both eluted in fraction No. 14)
Supernatant of yeast culture (see figure E and F)
export of the protein in high concentrations was unlikely to happen, therefore 48 ml of supernatant were loaded on the column
ratio between flow through and eluted protein was less favorable compared to the cell lysate
total protein quantities were to low to be detected by coomassie stain, therefore a silver stain was performed (see figure F)
beside the reference no additional protein bonds could be detected on the silver stained SDS-PAGE
Conclusion of this experiment:
A proof of principle for the expression of thaumatin was achieved using ion exchange chromotography and comparison of bonds obtained on SDS-PAGE relatively to a standard of thaumatin.
Further goals would include to increase the expression of thaumatin and to investigate the secretion. This could be achieved by improving the purification protocol to load more than 10 ml of cell lysate on the column in order to purify a sufficient amount of protein for a mass spectrum of the produced thaumatin.
Toxicity Assay
To check if thaumatin has an effect on yeast cells, we inoculated three different yeast strains with YPD including 45 mM of thaumatin and measured their growth rate after a defined period of time. The used yeast strains were the laboratory strain INVSc1, a strain which is used for brewing beer and a strain which can be purchased in supermarkets.  The growth rate of yeast cells which were incubated with thaumatin does not show a difference compared to the negative control (incubation of analogous strains with YPD without thaumatin). The small differences in doubling time are errors in measurement.
As expected, thaumatin does not have an effect on the growth rate of yeast cells. Hence we are not limited in over-expressing the sweetener in our beer.

When colonies have grown, the microorganisms are often colored and examined through the microscope. Also, biochemical tests are done to see which compounds the bacteria can convert. When a cow has clinical mastitis (visible symptoms), it is most likely that one type of bacterium is the cause. There are 6 types of known, common pathogens for mastitis. Engeline tells us that farmers would like a on site test for which antibiotic can or can not be administered. She thinks that within several years whole genome sequencing will be the golden standard.
We asked Engeline what is the most appropriate sample for detecting antibiotic resistance. She tells us that feces contains too many bacteria, blood is supposed to be sterile but is not common practice and thus economically not so attractive. Urine samples are often used with pet animals. Milk would be most suited as this is has little bacteria, only skin bacteria and the pathogens causing mastitis.
Engeline also told us about extended-spectrum lactamases that can break down a lot of types β-lactam antibiotics and thus can make a large group of antibiotics inactive. A lot of β-lactamases can be passed on from animals to humans

Summary
Interview summary
When asked about the most occurring/challenging bacterial infection in cattle, Bouwe Frank pointed us towards mastitis. This is in an infection of the udder. The problem with mastitis is that it can be caused by various bacteria. If you are interested in detecting antibiotic resistances in the case of mastitis, you will thus first have to establish which pathogen you are dealing with.
How the current process goes, is that a sample of a sick animal is sent to the GD Animal Health. They cultivate the sample to see what bacteria causes the disease. Often, an educated guess considering the pathogen can be made. If the test is positive, the animal can get a suitable treatment. If not, the test is repeated under different conditions. These tests are not based on detecting antibiotic resistances, because this takes more time and money.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Research#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"ucine-tRNA synthetase in combination with a luminol chemiluminescence reaction was used to detect leucine. In the article, a selective quantification from 1 to 20 µM leucine was mentioned and was further optimized in our protocol.
Below, the reaction equations can be seen. In the first step, leucine-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) is activated by ATP to form leucyl-AMP with formation of a side product - pyrophosphate. The formation of pyrophosphate is further used to detect the amount of leucine. After the addition of inorganic pyrophosphatase, this enzyme hydrolyses pyrophosphate to phosphate. When pyruvate oxidase and pyruvate is added to phosphate, it results in the formation of acetyl phosphate and hydrogen peroxide. In the fourth reaction, the hydrogen peroxide in combination with luminol and horseradish peroxidase leads to the emition of light. This luminescence is detected with a luminometer.
Figure 2
Reaction series for leucine detection - Kugimiya and Fukada (2015). Click to enlarge
The idea is to grow the bacteria on minimal medium without leucine. These bacteria are spun down and the supernatant is further investigated in the presence of leucine. The luminescence originating from the bacterial samples is compared with the standard curve. Firstly, a big range is used for the standard curve (0 to 100 μM) to then further zoom in to the biologically relevant concentrations.
Protocol
A mixture (40 µL) of leucine (0 - 100 µM), 1 mM ATP, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and human leucyl-tRNA synthetase (6.25 μg/mL) (Abcam) is made in 15 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0). This mixture is then heated untill 80°C for 45 min on a heating block (shaking at 300 rpm).
After cooling cown on ice, the second reaction mixture (10 µL) is added. It contains 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate, 5.0 mM MgCl2, 300 μM thiamine pyrophosphate, 0.08 μM FAD, 0.5 unit/mL inorganic pyrophosphatase (from yeast, Thermo Scientific) and 20 units/mL pyruvate oxidase (from Aer"

Intellectual Property Law in the Age of Synthetic Biology
On Friday, October 23, 2015 the Tufts Synthetic Biology team will be hosting a conference, Intellectual Property Law in the Age of Synthetic Biology: A Discussion on CRISPR/Cas9, with funding from Synenergene. We were inspired to hold a conference on this topic because of the current lawsuit between Dr. Jennifer Doudna and The Broad Institute of MIT over the patent rights to the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The conference will bring experts from a wide variety of fields including academia, law, policy, and business to have a public conversation with students and the general community on the implications of intellectual property law in the realm of synthetic biology.
Objectives:
The goal of the conference is to provide an opportunity for students to hear expert advice on the future of patent law related to synthetic biology. Attendees will learn about intellectual property issues they could face in the near future with regards to their own research, as well as hear opinions on current lawsuits related to this topic. The conference consists of two main components: speaker presentations and a discussion panel. Following the speakers’ individual presentations on their area of expertise, we will ask them a series of guided questions, which aim to delve deeper into the multi-faceted issues surrounding intellectual property law. We will then transition the discussion into an open forum, in which attendees can ask their own questions regarding their concerns.

UNAM_Genomics_Mexico,2012,Team:UNAM Genomics Mexico#HumanPractices#Who is Mrs. Cohnnie PhD_-_-_TEXT.html," the issues at stake in public perceptions of scientists. The project “Who's the Scientist?” was created to invite seventh graders to the facilities of Fermilab. In the lab, children would have chance to spend a day with real scientists and talking with them (corresponding!).
Amy 's picture
The most interesting thing of this activity was the series of drawings presented as part of the project. Kids were asked to draw scientists before they had met them and after they had spent the whole day with them. The before set of drawings is not surprising at all: children believed that scientists fall into the stereotype of mad scientists, doing their crazy stuff. The after set of drawings is more heart-warming: children realized that scientists are just like any other person in the world, with a not-so-normal job (we think that the only difference is that we enjoy it more on average!). But there was another surprising discovery.
The majority of the before drawings are male scientists. This changed in an interesting way in the after drawings:
Among girls (14 in total), 36% portrayed a female scientist in the before drawing, and 57% portrayed a female scientist in the after drawing.
Among boys (17 in total), 100% portrayed a male scientist in the before drawing, and 100% portrayed a male scientist in the after drawing.
Although we can be certain about the change in the general perception of scientists given that there's some kind of interaction between us and society, there's a worrisome thing that still needs to be addressed in the arena of gender equality. Can these results be showing some bigger problem in gender bias and perception towards female scientists?
Gender bias in Science is an issue nowadays. And it is important to do whatever it is on our hands to fight it as well. Even academic scientists are biased against women.  As it was reported in the New York Times last September, a new study suggests that science professors are widely biased against women with the same set of accomplishments and skills.
Figure taken from the original paper
The study, titled ""Science faculty’s subtle gender biases favor male students"" , and published in PNAS by researchers in Yale University, sought to test scientists' reactions to male and female job applicants through a randomized, double-blind study. In it, academic scientists were given application materials from a student applying for a lab manager position. The applications were identical, but some had female names, and some had male names. The dismal results went like this: female applicants were rated lower by both male and female scientists than male applicants on scales of competence, hiring, and mentoring.

Improvement
At the beginning, our logic circuit of CRISProgrammer was a little bit complex for we wanted to use CRISPR-dCas9 system to regulate the expression of multi genes and make our system have complicated functions. But after we had held the Sichuan University 2018 Architects Competition of Microorganism Application (SCU-ACMA) (a theoretical design competition sponsored by SCU-iGEM) and watched several projects about microbiology and industrial production, we realized that it would be better to simplify the logic circuit just as what other teams had done if we want to use it in industrial production. So, we cut down the genes we used and simplified the system so that it would be more stable.
Later in the communications with students from Shishi High School and the summer camp students of Chengdu University of Information Technology, we are asked some questions which remind us of the details of CRISProgrammer, such as the cost, the environmental effects, the maneuverability, the safety and so on. We took all of them into consideration and polished our project design. For example, we used fluorescent proteins and double antibiotic resistance to select the expected engineered bacteria and observe their gene expression.
Experiments
When we started our experiments, some problems followed. In this period, we got many help from other people based on the human practice. In the China iGEM Southwest Union (iSWU), “UEST-China” and “SiCAU-China” reminded us of the difficulty to clone a coding sequence in a genome. So we decided to clone genes of sgRNA and dCas9 into engineered vectors firstly.
And in the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC), Dr. Haotian Guo suggested that when we use CRISPR-dCas9 system to regulate the expression of multiple genes, we should consider that so many sgRNAs will occupy dCas9 protein, which directly leads to the decrease of efficiency of targeted gene regulation. With the consideration of his suggestion, we kept our regulatory system containing a small number of sgRNAs.

Liquid is crossing over a close valve in this chip. The blue liquid has crossed over the valve above it, a valve that is
closed, and is contaminating the red liquid, as seen by the dark-purple liquid in the red metering section.
Mixer does not mix liquids sufficiently
This qualitative failure is characterized by the final output of a mixer not being sufficiently mixed. This failure can be dependent on the chip being tested, as certain procedures will have varying levels of tolerance regarding mixture homogeneity. In general, liquids exiting a mixer should be relatively homogeneous; a quantitative calculation of mixing can be performed to calculate how homogeneous the final mixture is.
Liquid is not fully mixing in the mixer. Ideally, the liquid would enter the mixer on the left, mix as it passes through the primitive, and exit as a homogeneous liquid on the right side of the  mixer. However, in this mixer the liquids exiting are not homogeneous, as seen by the distinct sections of color.
Metering dispenses inaccurate volume of liquid
This qualitative failure is characterized by an incorrect volume of liquid being dispensed by a metering primitive. This failure is almost always observed in conjunction with other failures such as leaks and liquid crossing over closed valves. Therefore, if any of the above failures occur prior to or during metering, it is extremely likely metering will dispense an incorrect volume of liquid(s). To calculate the volume of liquid being measured and/or dispensed from a metering primitive, please refer to the metering quantitative analysis portion of Fluid Functionality.
Liquid crossing over closed valves is causing a metering failure. The presence of oil in the output (horizontal) channels of a metering primitive suggests that valves have not properly caused, as liquid should not be displaced in output channels (horizontal) as their accompanying valves should be closed. This would cause inaccurate volumes of liquid to be dispensed by the metering primitive.
Quantitative Analysis & Evaluation
Maximum Pressure Calculation
When a chip's internal pressure exceeds the maximum pressure that the sealing can withstand many complications such as leaks will ensue. In order to evaluate whether the chip will be able to function without these issues a PSI calculation is needed to be performed. This quantitative test is utilized to measure the internal pressure of a specific primitive inside your microfluidic chip. The MARS chips have all been manufactured using Makerfluidics, and have been evaluated to withstand an internal pressure of up to 5 PSI[1].  To calculate the pressure in a given primitive the following three equations need to"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Cry for Mosquitoes: A New Way to Control Mosquitoes by Synthesis Biology
Abstract:   In 2016, we focused on to control mosquitoes. We cloned various Cry and Cyt toxin genes from LLP29, Bacillus thuringiensis strain. We also constructed Cry and Cyt toxin parts based on option optimization of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Meanwhile, we built toxin groups express device based on 2A peptide system. And we tested their toxicity to the larvae of various genus of mosquitoes under the safe lab environment. Considering the potential problems in the natural environment, BNU-China and ZJU-China helped us to build the growth and toxicity model to estimate the natural conditions. To introduce the practical knowledge about how to prevent and control mosquitoes, we designed a handbook covering this topic and sent it to Zambia to help local people who are trouble in mosquitoes. We are proud of our project!

Contact with Nanoparticle Engineers
We met with Dr. Eric P. Lee, Senior member of Technical Staff at Maxim Integrated, and TAS alumnus, to discuss issues we were having concerning chitosan nanoparticles.  Specifically we had difficulty obtaining SEM images and with nanoparticle formation.  His advice on the specific order of adding TPP to chitosan helped us make consistent nanoparticles.  Additionally, he explained why we kept seeing large amorphous structures in our SEM images: a charge buildup in the nanoparticles from the electron beam. We used this information to improve our prototype and obtain quality images from both SEM and AFM.
Public Opinion
Bioethics Panel
We hosted a bioethics panel, where we invited teachers from various fields to engage in a conversation about bioethics and thoughts on our project in particular. The reason for including teachers from different fields is to allow our project and the topic of bioethics to be discussed from different perspectives. The panelists suggested that our project could really be applicable for use in dogs and cats. They also seemed unafraid of our use of nanoparticles, mainly due to the fact that they are biodegradable.
Cataract Survey
During TAS’s Spring Fair and our Taipei Cataract Awareness Day, we conducted a survey, from which we derived a general public sense of the following:
Understanding of cataracts
Willingness to use GMO products
Willingness to use our product in humans and pets
Side effect tolerance
Willingness to pay for cataract surgery

Interviews with Cataract Patients
We interviewed two former cataract patients about their experiences with surgery. Both patients suffered from inconveniences due to the synthetic lens options, which would either make one nearsighted or farsighted. Complications due to surgery varied among individual cases; one suffered from dryness and irritation of the eye, while the other had no complications at all. Both of them stated that the surgery process was efficient and effective; however, if given the choice to apply effective eye drops instead of surgery, they’d be willing to use it rather than face surgery again. Dr. Moran’s and Mrs. Clapper’s experiences reinforce the disadvantages of surgery, and further motivated us to create a non-invasive solution.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Receptors_-_-_TEXT.html," aTc: ""non"" = non-induced; ""low"" = 25 ng/mL aTc; ""high"" = 200 ng/mL. After induction the cultures were grown for further 5 h at the same concitions and cells were afterwards stored at 4°C until they were used for analysis or bioprinting.
After the cell harvest the optical density (OD550) was determined again as it is known that a high expression of EspP makes the outer membrane of E. coli permeable and this drastically affects cellular viability. For the scAvidin-autotransporter and the secreted BAP-NanoLuc autotransporter at high inducer concentration show clearly reduced viability as they did not show any growth after induction at OD550 = 0.5 (see Fig. A). In order to analyze the functionality of the whole design and these new BioBricks we subjected each of the twelve cultures to three different treatments and determined subsequently the amount of NanoLuc luciferase using the manufacturers substrate kit (Thanks to our sponsor Promega ;). At first the total NanoLuc luciferase content was determined in samples that were just washed once with PBS and contained the whole bacterial cell (see Fig. B), bacterial cells that were incubated with PPA-buffer (periplasmic extraction buffer; 500 mM sucrose, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) that extracts the proteins present in the periplasm (see Fig. C) and finally the culture supernatant of the cultivated bacterial cells (see Fig. D). The total NanoLuc activity is only present in bacteria that are transformed with a plasmid encoding the luciferase and there is a clear dependency of inducer concentration a detected luciferase activity. In the samples where a periplasmic extract was prepared the luciferase activity is highest in the samples of the secreted luciferase as the EspP-fused BAP-NanoLuc is attached to the cells and only proteins from lysed cells are present in the periplasmic extract. In the case of the samples where the supernatant of the cultures was analyzed the luciferase activity is present in both ""high"" induced samples.
As the luciferase activity only gave an indication for the subcellular localization of the cargo-autotransporter fusion protein, we also performed flow cytometry measurements. For this purpose the same cells were stained with app. 10 µM A3C5-Fab that was coupled to the fluorescent dye Dy634-NHS and "

Going further
In this part, we analyze the methods we used to answer our human practice question. We hope that this analysis will provide iGEMers material to think about their policy and practice project.
Survey
The internet as a media allowed us to reach more than 800 persons willing to participate in our survey. We thank each participant for its support! We are also grateful for all the people that provided us with additional comments; no matter whether these were suggestions for publications to read, complaints about the complexity of the survey or encouraging words.
We called for other iGEM team's solidarity for the survey. The idea of winning a badge for the wiki was appealing to many of them. The teams were motivated to participate as often as time allowed, since we introduced a two badge system (a colorful badge for 20 answers and a golden badge for 50 answers). In fact, two teams, namely the iGEM team Hannover and the iGEM team SDU Denmark , handed in more than 50 filled in surveys. We are impressed and grateful!
We did not define a target population, as we were too ambitious and wanted to cover all subgroups of society. However, the data set we collected is strongly biased towards students. It could be interesting to particularly design a survey concerning this part of the population.
Our goal was to learn more about the people's understanding of complexity and emergence. Even though our survey included spaces for own answers, most people chose one of the preformed answers. It would be interesting to encourage people to express themselves, so as to receive more individual answers. One option could be to ask people on the streets to answer one question, e.g.: ""what is complexity for you?"". Audio or video records of the interviews could be used to supplement the survey study. It would be strongly dependent on the country of investigation but it could give some unexpected insights on the topic. Moreover, it would give an occasion to increase awareness of the public on synthetic biology.
Interviews
First, we would like to thank every person that accepted to answer our questions.
As one of our goals was to investigate how complexity is taken into account in different fields, interviews seemed to be the best way to get a broad overview of different fields. We achieved to get seven personal and professional points of view about complexity. It was highly interesting to explore in details different conceptions of complexity in scientific and non-scientific fields.

Bacillus megaterium is a type of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria that play a significant role in phosphorus nutrition by enhancing its availability to plants through release from organic soil P pools by mineralization and is also a type of rhizosphere bacteria are known to play an essential role in the management of heavy metal stresses in plants. As our chassis, we have intended to highlight Bacillus megaterium as a metal-trap by using genetically engineering method.
MTs(metallothioneins)-are low-molecular weight, cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins found in wide variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi and all eukaryotic plant and animal species. MTs contain 61-62 amino acids and are structually composed of two globular metal-binding domains(α and β) with metal ion. The C-terminal α domain contains 11 cysteines and the N-terminal β domain contains 9 cysteines. The 20 cysteine residues in MTs allow it to bind up to a total of 7 cadmium ions.[1]Several systems have been developed to allow for stable construction and high level expression of recombinant proteins in bacteria. To avoid being degradated by proteolytic enzyme, the expression of MT in frame with GST allows for stable expression. Im previous research, the fusion protein was prone to increase metal ion sequestration in E.coli, this time we intended to try to express fusion protein in our chassis.
MBP(engineered from PbrR and MerR respectively)-PbrR and MerR are members of the MerR family of metal-sensing regulatory protein, acts a effective Pb(II) and Hg (II) capturer respectively. According to earlier research, the DNA binding domain and metal binding domain can function individually and the constructed peptide can form a stable dimer with its mercury and lead binding affinity remaining. In order to reduce side effects of over-expression, Peking University tandemed two copies of metal binding domain of MerR and P"

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-t_-_-_TEXT.html,"4 ]. In E. coli the flagellar motor rotates at up to 300hz and can turn either clockwise or counter-clockwise [ 4 ], both resulting in a distinct movement pattern for the cell.
Spinning in the counter-clockwise direction, the flagella will twist into a bundle in the shape of a corkscrew, and create a linear driving force [ 4 ], propelling the cell in a straight line through the liquid. This form of movement is termed run. Spun in the clockwise direction one might then expect the cell to reverse, but this is not the case. Instead the flagellar bundle will unwind, thereby creating chaotic movement [ 4 ]. This movement reorients the cell randomly and is termed tumbling. A cell will typically run for some time, then change it’s orientation by tumbling, and then run again [ 5 ]. The direction of flagella rotation is controlled by the binding of a cytosolic protein CheY, more on which later [ 4 ].
Different taxis pathways that steer cells towards favorable conditions and away from danger work by regulating the frequency of tumbling events [ 5 ]. An example is when a bacterium gets close to the source of a lethal toxin, then intracellular pathways will increase the frequency of tumbling events, in effect preventing the cell from dying. Since the frequency of tumbling events will decrease if the cell is going in a direction away from the toxin, it will “encourage” the cell to continue in that direction. In the case of an attractant such as an increase in nutrient concentration, the pattern will be opposite, so that the cell is encouraged to continue towards the source of the attractant. This form of movement, combining tumbling and running, with regulation of the tumbling frequency is termed a biased random walk [ 5 ].
Figure 1: A biased random walk motion pattern.
To understand how this can work we need a simplified understanding of the chemotaxis pathway at a molecular level. Chemotactic receptors can both increase and decrease tumbling frequencies to generate a biased random walk behavior [ 6 ]. Increased tumbling is achieved through a phosphorylation cascade beginning with the binding of a repellant to a transmembrane receptor [ 4 ]. The receptor is linked to two proteins, CheW and CheA [ 4 ]. CheA is a histidine-kinase that will autophosphorylate when the repellant binds [ 4 ]. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to CheY [ 4 ]. The flagellar motor complex has high affinity for phosphorylated CheY (CheY-p), and binding"
Nanjing-China,2016,Team:Nanjing-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," NEFU-China are excited about this invitation and expressed intense interests in collaboration. Therefore, about one month later, they invited us to their lab for a visit. Team members of our team gave presentations in their lab and both of the teams had a great team communication about iGEM and experiments. However, because of the long distance and the big expenses, they cancelled the plan to come to our lab proceed experiments. Nevertheless, we are communicating through emails and we have supported them with experiment materials as well as suggestions on their experimental design.
 
 
3. Team UCAS
 
We formed collaborations with team UCAS during CCiC’s poster time. We are impressed about their hard work and great courage because they are the youngest team and the oldest students of their school (UCAS has been established three years ago). During the conversation between two teams, they put forward their future plan to use a kind of reusable materials to adhere bacteria, which is exactly the same as we tried last year. The adviser of our team realized immediately that they might have chosen the wrong reusable material. Therefore, we gave them suggestions about choices of reusable materials. Students of their team were grateful hearing this useful suggestion. Moreover, we also provided them with materials shown in the picture, which is used for bacteria aggregation in solution. No doubt that we saved them a lot of time choosing the reusable material and building the right equipment.
Establishment of New iGEM Teams
 
1. Southeast University
 
Students from Southeast University are interested to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuit. However, they are not familiar with characteristics of DNA. They are also unaware of iGEM. They came to us for suggestions about how to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuits and expressed their interests in participating iGEM in 2017. Thus we assigned one of our team members, Zhen Li to help them with their project design as well as give them information about the iGEM competition. From then on, we formed intimate collaboration relationship with them and discussed with them every week to track their progress. We even specially designed a brochure containing detailed explanation of iGEM competition to them. ( Click here to get the PDF file. ) The collaboration goes smoothly and they have already formed ideas about the project in next year’s competition. They will establish a new iGEM team next year with our help!

TIMELINE | Building the Neptune Flow
16 - 30 May 2016
Training and Orientation
Our project is part of an existing workflow in our lab, and during training and orientation we learned about the flow and how we fit in. We also started to test tools that we could use to build our graphical user interface and planned out what we could do with the hardware setup.

June 2016
A GUI is Born
After testing out tools, we decided to implement a web application using a node.js (operating as a local server) framework. We started ordering parts and 3D printing components to set up the hardware.

July 2016
Expanding Horizons
We started building Neptune piece by piece. From what was initially a GUI designed only to interact with hardware, the idea of Neptune as a full-fledged toolchain arose.

August 2016
In the Trenches
We carved out the major components that make up Neptune today. The Specify, Design, Build, Assemble, and Control pages were built with the end functional goal of each component clearly laid out. Many iterations of control infrastructure prototypes were made and firmware was solidified.

September 2016
End-to-end Integration
Full integration of Neptune software and hardware was made. Neptune software was stress-tested by benchmarks and levels of hardware precision were evaluated and documented.

By late Friday afternoon, I found it harder and harder to concentrate, as I was getting anxious about taking my GRE on Saturday.  The GRE turned out ok; I'm glad it's done with and out of the way now.
Week of August 17, 2009
This week the comp team got a chance to go the wet lab to learn about assembling parts and do some lab work.  On Tuesday, we did some EcoRI/BamHI Transfers to move basic parts from entry vectors to assembly vectors.  Wednesday, we picked some colonies to grow.  Thursday, we did minipreps to isolate the plasmids from the cells and ran gels to check if we got the correct plasmids.  We also started the assembly process with a ""one pot"" digestion and ligation.  Friday, we went back in to pick colonies again.  Sherine, who took us through all these steps, was going to finish up the assembly on Saturday (thanks =) ).  It was nice to experience what goes on in the wet lab.  I now have a better understanding of what terms like Eco/Bam transfer and miniprep means and will hopefully be able to better understand what other wet lab people will be talking about at the Jamboree.
Meanwhile, on the computational side of things, I finally managed to get the database lookup of part implementations working by the end of Friday.  Wet lab work ate up some time during the week, and I also spent a bit of time figuring out why the combo boxes weren't working as I thought they would.  I still need to put in some checks and do some more testing.
School is starting next Wednesday! :o
