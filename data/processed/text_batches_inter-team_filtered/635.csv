Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," 1 DNA strand. The movement rule is a type of Brownian motion, with no TALE-DNA dissociation, with no noise or false DNA possible for binding, and with no DNA and strip interaction. But those are future directions that I can work on to make the model more sophisticated.
Week 18: August 26 - August 30
After the quantitative modelling was presented to the entire team on Monday, some senior members gave us some great suggestions. One of them requested the implementation of the concept of saturation of TALE such that each TALE can only bing one DNA. It looks simple to implement, but in reality it increases the computational effort significantly. If there are n possible states for DNA to be with an unsaturated TALE, then another n states with saturated TALE needs to be included in the state transition matrix. This effectively doubles the number of states needed and quadruples the number of calculations. Given that TALE and DNA will be much smaller than the space we consider, a large number of states will be necessary, which translates that the computational effort will be enormous. Here Dr. Nygren's suggestion of using partial differential equations for the modelling of diffusion and reaction might be appropriate, except that we were unable to find the parameters needed for a detailed DNA TALE binding scheme.
After a few days of research and thinking, two approaches seem to be worth a try: either do Monte Carlo simulations of the discretized system, or Bayesian network to exploit the overlapping sub-problems. The Monte Carlo simulations would be the more straight forward to code, for it simply describes the system in computer language then runs thousands of simulations to empirically determine the probabilities. The Bayesian network it would be a little bit complicated. For an investigation of a DNA and b TALE, we first compute the probabilities of 1 DNA binding, existing on the same space with {b,b-1,b-2,¡­,1} TALE respectively. Then to find the probabilities of n DNA we assume no interaction and apply binomial distribution to get the result from the corresponding 1 DNA case. Thus we obtained the probability of moving from the state of n DNA with m TALE to, the state of n-1 DNA with m TALE (if DNA exists) or the state of n-1 DNA with m-1 TALE (if DNA binds). Then the entire network from n DNA with m TALE to 0 DNA m-x TALE will give us the distribution where we can ask the expected number of DNA binds.
For now the simulation method is very easy to code so work has been started on that"

Washington,2009,Team:Washington-Software#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," circles of radius CA, while the locus of the linkages are spheres of radius L.
We will calculate θ1 first, which only involves the points, circles and lines p, CA1, A1, and P1.
Find the plane where CA1 's circle resides in. Use it to cut the sphere around P1. For future reference, call CA1 's circle C1 and the circle resulting from the cut C2
Define xo1, for x offset, for the difference in the x coordinates of the center of C1 and the point P1.
xo1 = TR - BR - x
Define D1 to be the distance between the center of C1 and C2. It will also be the line connecting the centers.
D1 = sqrt(x12 + z2)
Obviously, D1, CA1, and linkage form a triangle. The angle between CA1 and D1 is a close approximation to θ1, but it is not exact. We will find the error in the next step. We will call this angle θ11. We use the law of cosines to calculate θ11.
L2 = CA2 + D12 - CA * D * cos(θ11)
θ11 = cos-1((D12 + CA2 - L2)/(2*D1*CA))
One endpoint of D1 is on A1. Thus, we can make another triangle, and the angle between D1 and A1 is the difference between θ1 and θ11. We will call this angle θ12. If we have the length of the side on A1 be z, then the last side will be xo and the triangle will be a right angle triangle. Since only xo1 changes sign in the good interval, we should use a trigonometric function that involves xo in the numerator. Thus,
θ12 = sin-1(xo1/D1)
θ1 = cos-1((D12 + CA2 - L2)/(2*D1*CA)) - sin-1(xo1/D1)
You just have to rotate the model φ1 degrees counterclockwise for θ2, and another φ2 degrees for θ3 using the following three dimensional rotational matrixes:
Once you rotate the model, use steps 3-7 to get the next angles.
θ2 = cos-1((D22 + CA2 - L2)/(2*D2*CA)) - sin-1(xo2/D2)
θ3 = cos-1((D32 + CA2 - L2)/(2*D3"
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins encoded by three genes that rebuild Kai circadian oscillator.
Three key proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, comprise the central circadian oscillator . KaiC undergoes ordered autophosphorylation and autodephosphorylation events that signal the time of the day (oscillator timekeeping) for the control of genetic expression patterns. Most important to the circadian control of cellular responses is the ordered phosphorylation of two adjoining amino acid residues (Thr432 and Ser431) in the CII domain of KaiC; they become sequentially phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated during a cycle about 24h. As there are two phosphorylation sites, there are four possible states in every KaiC monomer (ST, SpT, pSpT, and pST. pS and pT represent phosphorylated Ser431 and phosphorylated Thr432, respectively). KaiA facilitates the phosphorylation of Thr432 and then Ser431. Subsequently, KaiB antagonizes KaiA activity, and then KaiC undergoes autodephosphorylation of Thr432 and then Ser431. The association/dissociation of all three Kai proteins controls the period, phase, and amplitude of the circadian oscillator. [2]
Figure 4. The gene circle of the transcription factors that link with the Kai clock.
For transcription, we selected SasA, CikA, and RpaA proteins, as well as pKaiBC, which can respond to the oscillator. Among them, self-phosphorylated KaiC can phosphorylate SasA, which will then transfer phosphate groups to RpaA, thereby activating RpaA as a transcription factor and inducing pKaiBC to transcribe downstream related proteins. But phosphorylated RpaA constantly activates transcription, so we added CikA as a protein to dephosphorylate the RpaA. In this way, the 24-hour oscillations of KaiC phosphorylation are transformed into periodic oscillations at the transcriptional level.

Finally, we choosed sfYFP BBa_K864100 to present the rhythm, which is supposed to be a 24-hour rhythmic fluorescence. And Bioluminescence assays were performed as described. [3]
Advantage
1.                                 Compared with the traditional repressilators and time-delay pacemakers, the Kai protein system has a longer period, and its stability is optimized due to its natural origin. Furthermore, Kai system can restore the rhythm in the natural"

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," system. Dodd et al. (2001) made experiments constructing two mutated versions of OR3 operator site. The other mutant (λr1) led to CI concentration of 2.3 compared to the wild type and the other mutation (λc12) led to 0.6 times the lysogenic concentration. This difference is of similar scale as in our experiments. They compared the effect of these mutations to prophage induction by UV light. λr1 was induced at 10% efficiency compared to wild type whereas λc12 efficiency was 170%. CI protein represses lytic genes including cro under PR promoter. If the probability of prophage induction is proportional to CI concentration (as they showed in the paper), we can hypothesize that such difference in CI concentration would lead to 17-fold repression in PR activity. According to the the increase in CI concentration from 0.6 WLU to 2.3 WLU (wild-type lysogenic units) would be sufficient for PRM repression in the wild type lambda repressor. Based on these observations, we estimate fourfold repression with blue light to be sufficient range for our three channel system.
Our light response element seems to be capable of fourfold repression of GFP-LVA with blue light.
.: PRM promoter activity with lacZ reporter system. In this experiment,cI was fused with Plac promoter to control CI concentration with IPTG concentration. The figure shows the effect of CI concentration in wild type lysogenic units (WLU) to PRM promoter (Dodd et al., 2001).
As it can be clearly seen from the , PRM promoter will be derepressed efficiently already in low concentrations. In addition, we also observed that even at very high light intensities, the measurement device for light response element shows clearly elevated fluorescence compared to negative control. This implies leakiness in the FixK2 promoter. As this promoter also controls the CI expression, we might experience significant levels of CI in high blue light intensity. This might pose a problem by repressing PR promoter and derepressing PRM promoter even at the highest intensity of blue light. We need to keep this possibility in mind in future experiments and possibly look for solutions to eliminate FixK2 leakiness.
In contrast to our initial expectations, the response time of our light response element was very short. This means that we can control the gene expression at FixK2 almost real time. Phosphorylation of YF1 and as well as FixJ seems to be rapid and responsive process and presumably most of the delay occur in transcription and translation of our reporter protein. The"

Design
Since the birth of synthetic biology in 2000, metabolic engineering has made increasingly huge progress on high value-added natural products. The synthesis and construction of metabolic pathways play a fundamental role in microbiology, biochemistry, and many other relevant fields. In 2003, Jay Keasling’s team reconstructed the biological synthesis pathway of arteannuinic acid in E. coli, providing functional confirmation for this metabolic process. In recent years, researchers have engineered yeast to produce a variety of plant-based natural products. These pathways are likely to involve the introduction of many heterologous genes and numerous genetic modifications to increase productivity. In the biosynthesis of opioids in yeast, 17 enzymes from different plants, animals, and yeasts were encoded through synthetic biological way. Although there are several tools for scientists to analyze and select the potential genes of the designed pathway, these tools all focus on the one or two specific gene instead of the whole metabolic system. Therefore, what our team’s trying to do is making comparisons between the designed pathway we want to synthesize and the natural-existing pathways to make sure that the researchers can get the whole picture. In this way, scientists can learn more about molecular functions and biological process from an innovating aspect.
During the project, we had the pleasure to interview a PhD student in the university of Toronto. Based on his experiences working on biological metabolism, changing from several different software to visualize the network, do simulations or other studies, is quite inconvenient. Therefore, he suggested us to make our tool more handful for researches by integrating a few frequently-used functions together.
Besides, according to our survey among students in the biology department in our school, an integrated synthetic biology tool box was in urgent need. So we selected some commonly-needed functions to combine into the toolkit, containing SBML Drawer, SBML Differ, SMILES Drawer and DNA Editor. We found these existing open-source projects, did some modification and improvement, and integrated them into our Metlab.  
Now, we are still conducting more user surveys and looking for more practical needs. For these user demands, we will seek existing projects or develop more softwares, making our tool box more integrated.

Current and Commonly Used Tetracycline Detection Methods
Antibiotics as antibacterials and growth promoters are widely used in various fields, resulting in a lot of residual hazards that are difficult to eradicate. At present, there are many methods to detect antibiotic residues in water, among which chromatographic and spectral methods are the most widely used. In order to assess the advantages of our project over traditional methods of testing, we chose a representative traditional method for comparison. This page mainly compares the characteristics of             these two methods, and on this basis summarizes a set of methods suitable for our project.
1. Chromatography
Chromatography is used to separate various components in the mixture. The chromatographic system consists of two phases, stationary phase and mobile phase. When a moving phase flows through a stationary phase with a sample, each component moves at different speeds and separates from each other because of the different concentration ratios between the two phases.             The stationary phase can be solid or liquid supported by solid or gel. [1]
1.1 High Performance Liquid Chromatography
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) uses liquid as mobile phase, pumping a single solvent with different polarity or mixing solvent with different proportion into chromatographic column. The components in the column are separated and then enter the detector (such as ultraviolet, fluorescence, diode array detector) for detection. [2] As the most commonly used detection method, HPLC is very suitable for high molecular weight, difficult to gasify, volatile or heat-sensitive substances, and has the following advantages: 1) Resolution higher than other chromatography. 2) Fast, 10 minutes to dozens of minutes to complete. 3) Repeatability,             high-performance chromatographic column can be used repeatedly. 4) Automatic operation with high accuracy.[3]

        In order to prove our device can work in real world, we chose one to test the metal                     iron in the water sample.
Sample Collection
         To verify whether our products can accurately detect the concentration of heavy metal ions in wastewater                     of realistic environment or not, we took the water samples from the factory to conduct an experiment.                     We took water samples in two spots, an electroplating factory and a pool in an industrial district. For                     mainly manufacturing plating products, the electroplating factory has a great deal of effluent which                     contains heavy metal ions.
         Besides, we noticed that there are at least six electroplating factories in                     Jiahewanggang, Guangzhou City , so we visited there and collected water samples. We collected water from                     a pool and a stream there and put certain amount mercury into it to simulate the real environment for                     the engineered bacteria testing whether the materials in the real environment world effect the work of                     them.

The Importance of Collaboration
The iGEM Competition stresses the importance of collaborations between scientists and encourages teams to significantly collaborate with one or more iGEM teams. Collaboration is an important component of scientific research in general, as it teaches will-be scientists to exchange ideas and assist others in their innovations. Our team has collaborated with several iGEM teams as well as a team of undergraduate researchers outside of the iGEM Competition.
University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM Team
Our collaboration with the University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM team began when four UCSC team members Skyped with two members of the UM team. During the meeting, we exchanged information about our projects and our progress on them, and we noticed that the human practices portion of UM’s project was lacking; with our strong background in outreach and human practices, we helped UM develop their own. Four of our iGEM team members met the UM team at their lab in Minnesota. When talking with them, we realized that their project had much more potential value than they were aiming for; we advised their team to reach out to areas affected by their project target (mercury ion pollution), and to speak with  environmental regulatory groups in Minnesota to gain insight about potential users. We also suggested they start a crowdfunding campaign so their entire team can attend the Jamboree in Boston, since they had not considered that to be an option. We believe we significantly helped the UM team by mentoring them in these various aspects of their project.
iGEM Team in Montpellier, France
We discovered an iGEM team in Montpellier, France through the iGEM Troubleshooting & Collaborations Facebook page created by iGEM Thessaloniki. Their project, Vagineering, aims to create a non-hormonal contraceptive. Our projects both address inadequate access to contraception, so we were interested in collaborating with them. UCSC team members Skyped with the Montpellier members and discussed our projects and progress. We suggested that the Montpellier team spend more time developing"

Introduction
This model is to better illustrate the effect of the whole imaging system. We hope to elucidate the substantial effect which the motion control system of the C. Crescentus has upon our imaging system:
Does the motion control system of flagellum and holdfast indeed improve the resolution of the expected image?
Given an input light array, i.e. the expected image, we in detail simulate our imaging system with the host E. Coli and C. Crescentus respectively, and give a prediction of their respective output image. We draw a comparison between the resolution of their output to see whether the motion control system in the C.Crescentus indeed works in the imaging setting.
In practice, our model can serve as a tool to predict the output image. The user can upload their own photo, our model will tell you how our C.image would perform.
Methods
We do the simulation of the whole C.image system in an agent based fashion. Each cell is considered an agent, who can do the following:
Express fluorescent proteins with respect to the input light array
Motion in a biased random walk
Division stochastically
We keep track of the following of each agents:
Position, in terms of x coordinates and y coordinates in the imaging plane
Motion state, including
their flagellum state, clockwise or counter-clockwise rotating
the time left for the flagellum state switch, from clockwise to counter-clockwise or converse
their velocity, both direction and magnitude
Division state, the time left for the next division
The model is as follows:
Fluorescence Expression
Since we keep track of the position of each agent, at any time, we know exactly where they lie. For convenience, suppose at time t, and agent x is being considered.
Since the input light array is known and assumed constant, we know the exact light intensity at the position where x lies. Given the light environment, our compartmental kinetic modeling can tell us how this light condition will affect the protein concentrations within the agent x.
We assume that within a short time dt, the light condition doesn’t change much. Using the kinetic model, we can calculate"
Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," is compatible mainly with biological phosphorus removal methods, especially EBPR method (explained below), which happens to be widely used throughout Central and Western Canada (Oleszkiewicz, 2016). Finally, there is plenty of information on Canadian wastewater treatment systems, which facilitates market research. In 2012, Canada also established first national standards for wastewater treatment, which set fairly strict limits of 1mg/l of phosphorus concentration in discharged water (Environment and Climate Change Canada Website). This might further increase the demand for efficient phosphorus removal methods in the future.
Our extensive research on the Intellectual Property Rights has prompted us to choose Canada for a place to set up a business. This decision was also supported by the favourable characteristics of Canadian WWTPs and recent legal developments.
Canadian EBPR WWTPs usually operate in municipalities in Western Canada, including the Prairies and central British Columbia (Oleszkiewicz, 2015). These WWTPs have to comply to Water Quality Guidelines adopted by Canadian Government as well as the regulations set by the relevant province. British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba (Prairies) have all adopted a limit of 1mg/l of total phosphorus in discharged water (Oleszkiewicz, 2015). These WWTPs need stable and effective yet inexpensive phosphorus removal methods, which would allow them to meet the limits set by the regulations.
Competitor Analysis
In most of the cases, WWTPs have their own systems for removing or recycling phosphorus. Thus, an industry for providing WWTPs with these services is almost non-existent. In other words, there is nearly no competition that Phosphostore would have to face. As a technology which removes and recycles phosphorus, however, Phosphostore would be still indirectly competing against currently used methods for these processes. Let us compare Phosphostore to the other two most commonly used phosphorus removal technologies: Chemical Precipitation (=Chemical Dosing) and Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR).

Hi, I’m Cheryl, a PhD candidate in the Moon Research Group. I am developing synthetic biology tools for cyanobacteria, mainly utilizing transcriptional regulation. Through their millions of years of evolution, cyanobacteria have developed amazing capabilities that I would like to employ for societal needs. By unlocking the secrets of nitrogen fixation in a photosynthetic cell, we could one day transform agriculture to keep up with the demands of our ever expanding population. My passions are solving puzzles (in and out of the lab,) as well as exciting students about the mysteries of science and helping them develop the tools to become society’s problem solvers.

Vanderbilt,2014,Team:Vanderbilt Software#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," working with that sort of input and are extraordinarily inefficient. darwin is a way around that. It uses version control tools as a backend, so it takes advantage of their strength. But it preprocesses the DNA data to optimize these tested and proven methods of version control, producing a much more efficient and secure tracking system built from the ground up to be able to scale to genome-size files. darwin is completely open-source, so any security or optimization issues can be identified and solved immediately to help all users of the tool. It's also agnostic to the type of version control backend used, so it can be put into place on a massive variety of systems.
Biology
The basis for the workings of any organism is rooted in its proteins as provided for in its genome. Every single protein can be traced back to an open reading frame, a set of base pairs defined by a start and stop sequence that evenly divides into codons (sets of 3 base pairs). Every codon corresponds to an amino acid and through the processes of transcription and translation, proteins are manufactured in the cell.
While DNA is a relatively stable molecule, different things can occur causing a mutation in the genetic code. There are several different types of mutations which are defined by how they affect protein translation downstream, specifically insertions, deletions, and substitutions. These can either be synonymous meaning that although there is a changes to base pair, the codon still codes for the same amino acid so there is no detectable change, or nonsynonymous which may affect the makeup of the protein. Lastly, there are frameshift mutations which generate an entirely different open reading frame.

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots"

Overview
BIT-China is now taking their third iGEM trip! This year we continued the fine tradition of our team, and hence we created Human Practice through large varieties of academic activities, which belongs to a significant part of our project, including giving preaches and training at school, project communications with plenty of universities in China and obtaining financial support from COFCO. Eventually, we accessed our project from three aspects, containing Risk Assessment, Feasibility Assessment and End-User Considerations.
Promotion
Many people are still unfamiliar with iGEM and synthetic biology though there were over 200 teams in last years’ competition. For promoting the concepts of synthetic biology and iGEM, we held several lectures about synthetic biology and iGEM in our university. After these lectures, we held a winter camp for recruiting and training new team members. In May, we contributed to Newsletter of Xiamen University, popularizing synthetic biology and advertising our project.
1.Lectures and Winter Camp[Collapse]
Fig.1 Lecture of synthetic biology and iGEM
After 2014 iGEM Giant Jamboree, we decided to hold synthetic biology lectures for promoting iGEM competition and synthetic biology and meanwhile recruiting new team members who are interested in synthetic biology.
The lectures are for all students in our university. Besides students from school of life science and technology, some students major in Electronic Engineering, Software and Art Design also attended these lectures. We invited Prof. Chun Li, team instructor of BIT-China, to make speeches at lectures. After these lectures, we recruited some new members with great passion for iGEM and opened our third iGEM trip.
Before project brainstorm, we conducted a winter camp for all potential members. In winter camp, we gave some basic knowledge and offered several classes for improving their fundamental research ability.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html," from Pittsburgh University, the authors put into light both the difficulty and, above all, the uselessness of a definition of life. Thus, trying to define life and explain its complexity had face many failures : “This (…) is no surprise and is consistent with a whole programme of “life definitionism” that fails to confine its object”. That point is supported by a quote from a 2007 editorial of Nature showing both the tension and failure expressed by the naturality / artificiality concerns : “Many a technology has at some time or another been deemed an affront to God, but perhaps none invites the accusation as directly as synthetic biology (…) It would be a service to more than synthetic biology if we might now be permitted to dismiss the idea that life is a precise scientific concept ”. Otherwise, authors enlighten the idea that, if we decide to keep that ambition of definition, it has to be interdisciplinary. It leads to other problems, not for scientists but for the observers, ethicists or critics : if definition of life is that complex, unstable and ambiguous, why do we refer to its alteration, manipulation, or its creation, with immoral characteristics?
D. … An ironical answer
Although the idea of the “false question” is proposed, the report relates the answers that were proposed by it. Through these answers, we can find the proposal from the NSF funded synthetic biology Engineering Research Centre, the SynBERC's “Human Practices” project, lead by Paul Rabinow from University of California, Berkeley and Ken Oye from MIT, the PACE consortium and the CHELL Program. First of all, we have to notice that the first question of naturality and artificiality were gradually turned into another : we are not talking anymore about the ethical statute of nature and devices but about what kind of qualification we can put on the productions of synthetic biology.
With the aim to put qualifying “living” or “unliving” to that “emergent scientific objects”, the CHELL Program proposed something interesting. Researchers from the CHELL Program proposed an altered version of the Turing Test in order to question that statute.  Alan Turing is the inventor of the first artificial intelligent system. In Computing machinery and intelligence published in 1950 (Strathern 1999), Turing wondered about the same kind of question about machines : “could a machine think?”. The obsolete nature of the question will be enlightened by the pragmatical approach of the engineer in his way to answer it. The test is to establish to what point a machine can pass itself off as a human, in the scope of a"

Bring Biological Modeling to the Next Level
Chain-Node Model (Figure. 1) is a brand new Complex Modeling Concept incorporating its detailed structure description with universal applicability. Instead of treating complex as a whole while ignoring their basic composition and structure, Chain-Node Model view complex as a construction of it basic Parts . Just as its name implies, our model includes two components: Chain and Node. As a correspondence to natural polymer chains, each Chain consists of an arrangement of its basic unit, Part, whose concept has been greatly extended and includes but not limited to Biobrick Parts. The Node component is not a natural correspondence but an abstract concept to describe binding states of two or more parts: each binding will create a Node. The abstract nodes may continue to bind with other parts or nodes to form a tree structure. However, parts or nodes in bound states are not allowed to bind again. With help of chains and nodes, it is possible to model any complex with arbitrary architecture. Simple and inaccurate modeling of biological process could"

Description
Collaboration
This year, we collaborated with a collegiate team NCHU-Taichung iGEM 2018 from National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan. NCHU is just located nearby Mingdao High School (15 minutes distance by car). At very beginning of the journey in iGEM 2018, we met up with each other at NCHU and Mingdao’s laboratory and school campus. We helped them host the 6th Asian-Pacific Conference hold in August. We shared with each other many ideas and dealt with problems met in the project and experiments. In this moment, just several weeks before iGEM Jamboree, we’d like to say,  “Thank you, Friends. Happy to meet you because of iGEM”
MINGDAO
We helped iGEM team NCHU to verify the bacterial cell growth affected by their BioBrick devices. They want to utilize synthetic biology to recover an environment polluted with dioxin. They created BioBricks of HAD, TonB and TLCC. They prepared the transformed E. coli with BioBricks and growth media (KB medium). Go to our lab in Mingdao, we measured the OD values of the E. coli cultured overnight and added IPTG for the induction of the gene expression and completed the assay following their protocol and instructions.
EXPERIMENT BY MINGDAO
↓ Measure OD600 values for E. coli with HAD, TonB or TLCC genes
↓ Dilute to OD600=0.05 with KB medium
↓ Culture at for 2-3 hours until OD values reach approximately 0.6
↓ Add 1mM IPTG for gene induction
↓ Set a kinetic mode for analysis in Microplate Reader (BioTeK Synergy H1)
↓ Analyze the data with each"

Interlab study
Our team has been participating in the iGEM Interlab Study , to help further characterize three different promoters. This was done by using GFP-fluorescence as a way of measuring how strong each of the promoters are compared to each other.
Figure 1:The three constructs made for this experiment.
The three constructs were made through iGEM standard biobrick assembly, inserting gfp into pSB1C3 plasmids containing the different promoters. The gfp-gene were originally cut out of pSB1A2, before ligation with each of the three promotes. Transformation of the constructs was done into E. coli K12 Top10, because it has been optimized for transformation and high levels of plasmid synthetisation. Reference:One Shot® Top10 Chemically Competent E. coli. Catalog number: C4040-10. Visited: 17.09.15. [ThermoFisher] According to iGEM headquarter protocol, biological triplets and technical triplicates was made for each promoter. Each construct has been sequenced and verified with colony PCR.

General Considerations
Building the OD/F Device has been an interesting task. While this device has been developed mainly by the IT division of our team, we got an immense support from the biologists suffering from color-blindness, yet eager to help selecting the best color filters for the LEDs.
The measuring principle and guidelines for this project have already been presented in the project section. Here, details about selecting filters, code and a construction manual are presented.
Cuvette Holder
The essential part of this device is the cuvette holder. In short, we had to overcome a dilemma created by the need for an optimal height for the sensor:
A too low sensor position bears problems with sedimentation as well as light diffraction from the bottom of the cuvette.
The sensor has to be as close as possible to the bottom so that enough light shines through for the fluorescence measurement.
As a compromise, we place the sensor at a height of 0.75 cm. It is comparable to one of the standard heights (0.2 cm, 0.8 cm, 1.2 cm) of OD meters. It is important to note that our device works with filling volumens of just 1 mL, which in fact comes close to reality in the lab.
The final cuvette holder design is rendered from a stl-file shown below:
Cuvette Holder developed for our OD/F Device.

Finding the right and optimal filters is a tough challenge. The main goal throughout our project has been to choose"

SynBio Intro
synthetic biology - is this another name for genetic engineering？
People must hear the term, 'genetic engineering', however, synthetic biology seems to be new. Somebody wonders if this is a new name referring to genetic engineering.
Synthetic biology which was a infant discipline emerged within this few years. It focused on devices assembling, system building and engineering methodology. Of course, it was similar to genetic engineering and advantaged most of the techniques of genetic engineering. But synthetic biology was a brand-new stuff which was the further development of genetic engineering.
In terms of scale, conventional genetic engineering tried to transfer one or a few genes from one organelle to another, maybe with tiny modification on genes. Synthetic biology wants more, the ultimate aim of synthetic biology is to synthesize new life to meet our need. This kind of new life is nothing but artificial life. So at this point synthetic biology intersects with system biology. Since synthetic biology is young, it need to enrich the available devices and modules to build the system.
Where do the devices and modules come from? This answer reveals other aspects of differences between synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Traditionally, if we wanted a fluorescence pig, we had to find the cDNA of fluorescence gene. If the genes we wanted were rare, maybe we needed to catch that creature by ourselves. The whole picture changed after the technology development of high-speed and cheap sequencing and inexpensive DNA synthesis. All we need to do is start computers and search for target genes in database, then make an order to let company to synthesize those genes for us. The name 'synthetic' came from this.
Suppose we get the genes, the next step comes to constructing. Here, we shall see the last differences. Conventional genetic engineering connected the parts and tested the functions differently from cases to cases. Thanks to standardization, assembling in synthetic biology is as easy as playing with LEGO toys, the interface is well-designed so that the construction is so simple. Besides,"

Result – 5. Confirmation of protein expression by SDS-PAGE
The figure here showed data of SDSPAGE. ACFL is sample from E. coli BL21(DE3) supposed to express mRFP and full length Adenylate cyclase. 2AGL is sample from E. coli BL21(DE3) supposed to express mRFP and IIA(Glc). While CTRL is sample from E. coli BL21(DE3) supposed to express mRFP.
Protein band corresponding to mRFP was clearly shown in either total proteins or soluble proteins which mean that mRFP was expressed as soluble protein. Meanwhile protein band corresponding to Adenylate cyclase could not be observed. Protein band corresponding to IIA(Glc) seemed to present.
However, after DNA sequencing result, it was confirmed that neither ACFL nor 2AGL coding genes were not able to be constructed. Thus all E. coli samples here were the same, namely only expressing mRFP – harbouring BBa_J04450.

Meetings
We organized mettings every wednesday to check the progress of our project. Here are the records of our meetings:
June 17th
In this meeting we define work groups as follows:
Also, we made a brainstorming for the fundraising and we got ideas like doing a Bingo, a party, a bake sale, etc.
June 25th
We talked about what we want for our construct. Also we made this scheme:  It is beautiful, isn't it?
July 8th
Laboratory: Our goal for the next week is to transform the parts from the register.
Mathematical Models: We set the model's equations and the next week we are going to put it in Matlab.
Human Practices: We were thinking about ideas for this year. For example, we proposed to transform bacteria with common materials. Another idea, was to discuss ethical situations born from synthetic biology based on technology.
July 17th
We brought detective's stuff and took a photo of each member of the team. That was really fun!
July 22th
Laboratory: We are stuck in  pTet- TetR-RBS part. When we made the gel and we got very big bands and we don’t know what could it means. Also we made digestions with different enzymes for the iGEM parts but they didn’t work , so we couldn’t know were the enzymes were cutting . There’s nothing new about Interlab.
Social Networks- Collaborations:
• Paris Team is planning to encourage the formation of new iGEM teams. So, they were thinking that we should do a part of the video and also help them with their Newsletters.
• With the TEC-Monterrey Team we were talking about doing collaborations in Mathematical Models and Interlab, by doing some fluorescence measurements cell by cell with our microscope.
• We are planning to organize a Low Budget Laboratory competition with the other iGEM teams. Wiki:"

Investigator: Roman, Saskia
Aim:
Isolation of plasmids pSB1C3 and pTUM104, to check for uptaken inserts by an analytical restriction digest.
Operational sequence:
The putative positive clones were picked and used for inoculation on monday, 1 am. Thus, the plasmid preparation took place at 3 pm. Four clones of each plate had been picked. The plates were stored in the fridge, at 4°C. The plasmid preparation was performed as described in the manufactueres protocol (Quiagen). Elution was done with 40 µl of elution buffer (Kit) at room temperature, with the columns having been incubated 5 minutes at room temperature before the final centrifugation.

Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#team#bios_-_-_TEXT.html," was an unassuming freshman. Little did we know she was a ticking time-bomb just waiting to go off. Her rapid rise to power makes perfect sense in retrospect: she is well-versed in four different martial arts and has received training from two separate intelligence agencies. She has no need for competent cells because she has developed her own martial art, clonejutsu, which allows her to punch, kick, or elbow DNA directly into the cells of any organism. She possesses great strength, cunning, and ruthlessness, and will be the most difficult adversary you ever face.
Yoshiko Toyoda
Yoshi is the muse of our iGEM team. She comes in the early mornings to set up PCRs to prepare everyone else’s day in lab. Her awe-inspiring penmanship on primers and mini-preps brings clarity to our otherwise chaotic assembly of reagents. Faster than a green dinosaur or a trusty mid-sized automobile, Yoshi works with great diligence and grace, even when under pressure. When she is done for the day, she relaxes with some of the finer works of culture, such as her history readings or Japanese soap operas.
Lydia Wang
Still using Snap Chat? That is going to be outdated soon for college students. Our electrical & computer engineering genius—Lydia—is working on developing super advanced mobile apps for the iPhone 11 that can literally read your mind and plan your life for the next 50 years (…or more). As a co-op in GE Intelligent Platforms in 2013, Lydia has already started her master plan. She joined iGEM in the spring of 2012 to gather information on what smart people in Cornell do in their daily lives for her project, but was disappointed to find that they are actually not robots, but a bunch of kids playing with bacteria and pipettes. So she decided to stay and help out with the Dry Lab, while secretly incorporating microcontrollers in whatever systems the team develops to monitor and control iGEMers, slowly turning them into real robots by the end of 2013. Even though a few people on the team know of her plan, they are more than happy to accept whatever Lydia put into the Dry Lab components because they make the systems work like magic. And ultimately, they accept the fact that they will become robots someday.

Kyle Wheeler is Cornell iGEM's resident cyborg. After failing to ride a century as a wee babe, Kyle, in his infinite infant wisdom, had an epiphany: to succeed, he must genetically engineer himself to become one with the machine. Thus began his interest"

Molecular biology
Molecular biology /məˈlɛkjʊlər/ concerns the molecular basis of biological activity between biomolecules in the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA and proteins and their biosynthesis, as well as the regulation of these interactions.[1][2] Writing in Nature in 1961, William Astbury described molecular biology as:
Relationship to other biological sciences
Researchers in molecular biology use specific techniques native to molecular biology but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas from genetics and biochemistry. There is not a defined line between these disciplines. The figure to the right is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields:
Techniques of molecular biology
For more extensive list on protein methods, see protein methods. For more extensive list on nucleic acid methods, see nucleic acid methods.
Since the late 1950s and early 1960s, molecular biologists have learned to characterize, isolate, and manipulate the molecular components of cells and organisms.
These components include DNA, the repository of genetic information; RNA, a close relative of DNA whose functions range from serving as a temporary working copy of DNA to actual structural and enzymatic functions as well as a functional and structural part of the translational apparatus, the ribosome; and proteins, the major structural and enzymatic type of molecule in cells.[citation needed]
Main article: Molecular cloning
Transduction image
One of the most basic techniques of molecular biology to study protein function is molecular cloning. In this technique, DNA coding for a protein of interest is cloned (using PCR and/or restriction enzymes) into a plasmid (known as an expression vector). A vector has 3 distinctive features: an origin of replication,  multiple cloning sites (MCS), and a selective marker (usually antibiotic resistance). The origin of replication will have promoter regions upstream"

We set up cultures and colony PCRs of pC13AT (in pAg13H), but none of the other plates had colonies. We checked the colony PCRs, and were puzzled by the unexpected-sized bands of 300kb and 600kb - we guessed that the primers may be annealing oddly to the new vector, and decided that we’d try to transform those into C. heterosporus anyway. We also set up new ligations of pC13AU and pC13AV into pAg13H. We transformed the remains of pAh13EA into E. coli. We ran a PCR for pOSCAR for future Gibson assembly with pC13DU, pC13DV and pC13DW. We then ran a gel screen of the pC13DU, pC13DV, pC13DW and pS13EB and they looked ok. We also prepped the pC13P & pC13BA for sequencing and digested pC13P and pC13AI with SpeI and PstI and pC13BA and pC13CY with XbaI and PstI. We gel screened the digestions performed on 10/21/13 and all 4 digestions (‘’PpkiA’’ SP, ‘’TxlnD’’ XP, pC13Z XP, and pC13F XP) appeared successful. Progress was halted due to the lack of columns for DNA purification.
We continued the transfer of completed constructs into C. heterosporus transformation vectors. Submitted PtrpC and ‘’afp1’’ construct for sequencing and digested other plasmids and inserts.

Introduction
The work of the former IGEM Team had a great influence on our choice, particularly those of The ESBS 2008 Team . Their goal was to control cells’ state by linking the natural variability of life to the binary system of computing. In the project of The ESBS 2008 Team , the incrementing from one bit to another required a protease which was expressed during the mitosis in yeast. Renaud Renault of the actual iGEM team had thus the idea of inventing a degradation system which would be not only temporally controllable but also specific.
Based on this idea we chose to create a light-controllable specific protein degradation system. The system contains several parts: the bacterial ClpXP protease from E. Coli and the specific recognition sequence (DAS-tag) for ClpX for the degradation part as the photoreceptor protein phytochrome B (PhyB) and the phytochrome interacting factor (PIF3/6) from A. thaliana for the light-dependent part of the system.
The different parts, their basic ideas and their strategic development will be discussed in detail in the following separated parts. The choice of the host organism will also be explained, followed by the final structure of the light controllable protease.
Degradation system
The ClpXP from E.coli protease rapidly established itself as an evident choice. Indeed, this protease has been very well studied, notably by the Tania Baker Team from the MIT.

Completion of DNA Extraction Activity in Second Life
The DNA extraction activity is finally done, and it works! (I think). This officially makes me the slowest scripter ever  D:< . I am still thinking of a way to make it easier to do. It is intuitive in that it gives you direct instructions, but right now, people can kind of jump in to the middle of it without doing the first bit (which I’m not sure is a good thing – it IS a long activity after all).
Following the DNA extraction activity, I’ve completed most of the instructions/description for the third lab mission. Tomorrow, I will be checking with Katie to make sure the alternative components fit in both the PCR and restriction digest activities to give the desired products (eg. PCR to make a linearized biobricked part). We will also be changing notecards and mission instructions to reflect the changes to these activities.
Speaking of notecards, I’m editing the one I wrote for DNA extraction. I’ve started writing up the instructions for the first lab mission (bacterial transformation) – it’s a ridiculous task (INVISIBLE BACTERIA :D), but I thought it would be fun. This was inspired by seeing Katie make a thing you can wear on your avatar to make you mostly invisible- we might be able to give something like that as a prize?

Flaws and Fixes
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
Seeing the biobrick simulator systems in action in the blog video I put together was an excellent way to point out its flaws!
Made one simple but huge upgrade to all of the proteins that bind DNA: caused them to glow briefly when the binding event is accepted by the DNA. No more banging that RNAP on the DNA wondering whether it will take, or whether it wasn't close enough yet! Now it lets you know, as soon as you see your RNAP light up you can"

Investigation of Taxus yunnanensis
The most famous microtubule-stabilizing medicine is taxol, which comes from extraction of Taxus trees. However, since the great performance in curing cancer was discovered, yew trees                     in Yunnan have experienced a period of massacre, which caused a sharp decrease in yew population.                     So, in these years, the government has taken measures to protect them. Then we are wondering whether                     those measures truly work and how is everything going with yew trees now in Yunnan. So we spend                     several days this summer in Yunnan investigating the yew trees there. We went to some places                     including Yunnan Hande Biotechnology Corporation which is the first producing source of taxol in                     China, Yunnan Acadamy of Forestry (YAF) and Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB), Chinese Academy of                     Science. Besides, we carried on population survey in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and Kunming                     Botanical Garden.
From our survey, we learned that there are more and more yew tree plant bases coming into being in                     Yunnan and they are mainly allocated at sipsongpanna, Wenshan, Diqing, and so on. The distribution                     of wild yew trees is separated and in small population, for both natural and human reasons. In the                     YAF, Dr. Jinfeng Zhang and his fellow said that it's important to nurture artificial yew forests,                     especially from the angle of economy and forestry. The yew trees and its wood are both valuable so                     the artificial forest is a great protection of wild trees. He said that, the yew trees do have other                     values in addition to anticancer. For example, it can be used to treat diabetes, skin diseases and                     sore throat. Besides, its wood is also precious (Though we can't agree with some of what he                     said.).
As to planting yew trees, the farmers should get united with enterprises, who can give guide to                     farmers and ensure the quality of yews. Some farmers just noticed the great profits in planting yew,                     but had little techniques in it, which caused large loss to them. Besides, these cases was also a                     waste of soil and resources. As a consequence, governments and companies should actively guide                     farmers to plant trees, and it’s a win-win choice"

The cells will eventually destroy their own genetically engineered DNA, and leading to cell death and releasing the heavy metal ions. Furthermore, this step can prevent horizontal gene transfer due to the disposal of cell debris to the environment, minimizing the environmental impact.

II. Improvement on the HR desalination system
 
Our sensory rhodopsins system (BBa_K786003) and the halorhodopsin system (BBa_K559010) are both sensitive to long wavelength visible light source. They can be integrated to enhance the desalination efficiency [3]. As E. coli can be attracted to a region closer to the light source with greater intensity, the halorhodopsin system should function with a higher efficiency and absorb more Cl- ions.
BBa_K786002 the phototactic device sensitive to near-UV light can be integrated to become a tool for cells/Cl- ions direction to a separate chamber, so that the remaining solution can achieve desalination.

III. Incorporation with BBa_K786031 as a new biosafety approach
Genetically-modified organisms have been put in use extensively throughout the last decade. Yet, concerns about such organisms causing undesirable effect to the environment once released have been raised. Our biobricks might be one of the answers to tackle such concerns. When the gene expression system for sensory rhodopsin is incorporated with the CRISPR/Cas system, bio-engineered cells would cleave their own DNA into nucleotides once exposed to natural light.
This system would be useful for bio-engineered cells that could be used to work in the dark. (e.g.: Biofuel synthesizing cells, human hormone-producing cells)

I have graduated from METU Molecular Biology and Genetics       department and just started the Bioinformatics Graduate Program       this fall. My main research interests is in systems biology,       and its applications. Currently I am focused on genome wide       association of SNP biomarkers, where we will utilize systems       biology approaches for discovering disease gene and pathway       associations after highthrough-put genotyping studies. During       the course of our research on the iGEM project this summer as       a Molecular Biologist I worked on the standardization of the       parts information for our applicaiton database. Also, as a Bioinformatician       in training, contributed to the development of the algorithms       for the BioGuide software. Besides research, I develop educational       tools for biology and bioinformatics education and getting used       to do couples dancing.
Motivation
Since 2008, we have been participating in iGEM as METU ( Middle East     Technical University) wet-lab team, and each year we have noticed the     increasing number of teams participating, along with an increase in     biobricks entries at partregistry.org .     While having more choices of biobricks to choose from is incredible,     searching for and choosing the appropriate parts is becoming a challenge.

Since we got feedbacks from Science Park’s participants, the results from survey implies that people’s attitudes prone more to the negative impact of GMOs, even though they did not have in depth understanding regarding biological engineered product. We therefore created an article tackling this problem, and posted on facebook where several followers are from Science Park events. We wish this article can more or less contributes to people’s well-thought point of view.

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#PlugnplayAssembly#customization_-_-_TEXT.html," BioBrick can be deleted.
1. First the site of the deletion should be defined.
2. The primers need to be designed so that the fusion point will bridge two desired sections of the gene at the matching USER linkers.
3. The primers are ordered from your favourite company. Notice that the price can be a bit higher and delivery time a bit longer, when ordering primers with a uracil incorporated. We have had a good experience with the price, delivery time and quality of the primers ordered from Integrated DNA Technology.
4. To amplify the BioBricks the protocol Amplification of biobricks by PCR can be used.
5. Check the PCR reaction on an agarose gel before assembly. The new BioBricks can be used directly or purified by agarose-gel purification if needed.
6. The assembly of new BioBricks should be performed according to the protocol USER cloning .
7. A BioBrick, device or new plasmid with the deletion should now have been assembled.
Adding short sequences
Short sequences such as ribosomal binding sites, kozak sequences etc. can be added by incorporating them into the primer that will be used to amplify the part it should be fused with. Introducing a short sequence can also be of interest when two proteins are wished to be connected by a linker. The linker can also carry a single point mutation, be degenerate or non-degenerate, which means that only one or both primers needs to carry the mutation.  When creating a linker a short sequence of either random or known sequence is added by incorporating the sequence into the forward or reverse primers.
Introducing a linker
1. When introducing a linker in the connection with a gene of interest (GOI), the first step is to define the mutation.
2. Primers are designed for the defined mutation site. To introduce the desired mutation one nucleotide should be changed in the primer. Four primers are used per mutation.
3. The primers are ordered from your favourite company. Notice that the price can be a bit higher and delivery time a bit longer, when ordering primers with a uracil incorporated. We have had a good experience with the price, delivery time and quality of the primers ordered from Integrated DNA Technology.
4. To amplify the BioBricks the protocol Amplification of biobricks by PCR can be used.
5. Check the PCR reaction on an agarose gel before assembly. The new BioBricks can be used directly or purified by agarose-gel purification if needed.

In the Lab
At the end of the day, an iGEM team’s project is made or broken in the lab. And at CLSB, if you were to walk along the science corridor to the small, unassuming lab that is Mr Zivanic’s, in the months leading up to Jamboree, be it before school or after, during term time or while the students are meant to be off school, you would undoubtedly find it bustling with activity. For this is where the iGEM team made our home over the last year. This is where we developed from a team that marvelled at the accuracy of our micropipettes and struggled to put on microbiology lab coats to one that routinely performed gel extractions with ease, and confidently recorded the growth rate of our cyanobacteria. We came from humble beginnings, but by soldiering on past cells that demanded -80ºC freezers and ligations that refused to yield any results for three weeks in a row, by coming in at the crack of dawn and leaving after the sun had long since set, by sacrificing our well earned summer rest while our friends went off on holiday, we have achieved more than we could ever have hoped for.

Proof of Concept
Our genetic modification of Synechocystis had two main aims. First, we planned to increase the rate of electron export from the cell. We anticipated that this would increase the efficiency of our biological photovoltaic (BPV) cell and increase the growth rate of Synechocystis. Previous studies have noted that the primary problem with Synechocystis is its slow rate of growth so we thought that speeding this up would be an important advance. We also believed that improving the rate of growth of Synechocystis would lead to improvements in the potential generated by the BVP cell. We designed and carried out proof-of-concept experiments to test these two hypotheses.
In order to increase the growth rate of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we overexpressed the CmpA gene (which codes for a bicarbonate transporter)"

One part of our project is to design an online platform for team interactions. Since all the teams were having problems with communicating and sharing large files, we thought the Phabricator software is a great way to organize your team. This is why we decided it would be great if every team has the opportunity to use the same platform. Hopefully, it also simplifies the communication between different teams. We send the installation data to the iGEM team at Northeastern University in Boston. They tried it and liked our idea and the site. They did problems concerning organization and sharing ideas. Our Phabricator is a good alternative to other sites e.g. e-mail chains or online notebooks.
“Phabricator seems like a great platform for building a modular site that essentially does everything. If the site evolves in the future to include some other tools that iGEM teams will also need […], I can see how the site may be adopted widespread.” Joshua Timmons, iGEM Northeastern
Göttingen/Interlab Study
In Marburg, we also met the iGEM Team from Göttingen. Even though our projects have different focuses; because they are trying to create a B12 Synporter and we are working with TALE’s, we decided to collaborate for the Interlab study . The iGEM Team in Göttingen sent us their samples so that we could analyze them.
Newsletter
We were also a part of the iGEM Newsletter 2016, which was created by XMU-China team. They gave all interested teams the possibility to present their project as well as introducing their team in an online newsletter. The publication was then sent to all iGEM Teams to provide an opportunity for new collaborations or contact between the teams.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Attributions bronze criterion .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," on preventing the dissemination of GE E. coli in the environment, as the Paris Bettencourt team 2012 already worked on preventing horizontal gene transfer with their Bware project. We chose to control the life or death of our bacteria using temperature, allowing them to survive in a defined range of temperatures ( thermal control ). Finally, we wanted the future iGEM teams to consider biosafety as an integral part of their projects, and not something to think about when writing the wiki or the safety form. We therefore wrote a Biosafety guide , which aims at helping iGEM teams to take into account potential biosafety issues at the beginning of the design of their system(s), rather than after the conception, and possibiliy the execution of their project.
Education and Public Engagement
We particularly focused on public engagement by building through the year an exhibition taking place during a science and art festival called CURIOSITas . This festival is taking place at the same time as the giant Jamboree, but members of our team will be present at the festival. Our exhibition comprises a sculpture (realized with the help of a sculptor, Pascal Masi), which is an original way to communicate with public about synthetic biology since it represents an “engineered” lemon tree which has two faces (“natural” vs “engineered”). It aims at making people think about what they will eat in 50 years and how could synthetic biology change their way of thinking about the living. Another interesting approach was the building of 3D Biobricks Legos which are used to make people basically and playfully understand how living organisms can be engineered. The exhibition also contained classical posters aimed at popularizing synthetic biology and presenting the iGEM competition. A video presenting interviews of citizens about synthetic biology was also shown to get an idea about the knowledge and opinion of people on engineered living organisms. This small exhibition will be moving around different cities through the Parisian region during the Autumn. Furthermore, we plan to re-use it for the Science Festival, a national event taking place on October, 11th.
CURIOSITas Festival
CURIOSITas is a rotary festival born from the meeting between scientists and artists and is held at Orsay but also transported into different cities of the Parisian region from September 24th to October 24th. iGEM Paris-Saclay team is presenting an exhibition called « This is not a lemon  » which is related to last year iGEM Paris-Saclay 2014 project.

Instead, if we fail, we will use engineering    ideas to test each of the major processes. For instance, we will use RT-PCR to verify the transcriptional function    of mitochondria, identifying whether the transcription of each functional gene is normal and apply Westen-blot to    verify whether the subunit related to aerobic respiration is translated, then the MitoZero genome will be optimized    on the basis of the test results.
3. Control test verification of gene region knockout
When we introduced our project to other teams, they all felt that our design was too radical, especially the    deletion of mitochondrial introns that may bring about the failure of these genes. Considering the possible    ""failures"", we have also designed two control test genomes where the intron and intergenic regions were separately    simplified.
Diagram of the separate deletion test of intergenic regions:
Figure 1.Control test genomic structure map of intergenic regions
The above PCR fragments were amplified from the wild-type mitochondrial genome by PCR and the test genomes of the    deleted intergenic regions were spliced based on our current genomic splicing technique and experience. In order to    verify the function of control test genomes as soon as possible, we first tested the separate deletion of Delete1.
Figure 2. Diagram of the separate deletion test of introns:
We plan to do a separate deletion test for the COX1 gene intron. First, by reference to the separate deletion test    method of the intergenic region, the rest part except the COX gene in the figure above will be amplified, then we    will test the existing COX gene CDS after assembly.
If you also crave to build MitoCRAFT together with us after seeing our project, please do not hesitate to contact    us.

COLLABORATIONS
NYMU-Taipei
We have continued our long standing collaboration with NYMU-Taipei. Several of our members have attended weekly meetings with the team and discussed our projects together. They have been very generous in lending us chemicals and reagents (PEG 8000 and MR17 broth). This year three members from TAS (Anna, Yasmin and Jake) are members on both NYMU and TAS teams. They learned the cloning cycle from TAS and helped run experiments and human practices for NYMU throughout the year. Additionally, they have provided access and instruction for several instruments. Specifically they provided protocols, cuvettes, and access to an electroporation machine so that we could attempt electroporation into Lactobacillus casei and Lactococcus lactis. They also provided access and instruction to a 96-well plate reader so that we could test the efficiency our alcohol induced promoter (K2539550). In return we have helped NYMU with the cloning of biobrick parts. Lastly, TAS and NYMU teams worked together to help troubleshoot the interlab study and measurements using their plate reader.
Near the DNA submission deadline, we assisted NYMU by cloning their ALB-mCherry (BBa_K2751012) and mEGFP (BBa_K2751011) parts into the standard BioBrick backbone pSB1C3.  We did this for them while they were also trying to clone the same part, just in case their ligation and transformation was unsuccessful.  Both teams were successful and this helped them verify that ligation and transformation of their part was successful.

We also have a long standing collaboration with Lambert iGEM team.  This year we were excited to test their prototype of an ElectroPen. They shipped their pen to us along with videos and a protocol. After going over specific details of the protocol through Skype, we then used their ElectroPen to electroporate a GFP expression construct into both E. coli K-12 DH5a and E. coli Nissle 1917. We validated that the ElectroPen works! It successfully helped transform both E. coli strains!

In the beforementioned studies, bacteria containing an activating IS upstrem of the flhDC operon showed an increased motility compared to bacteria without this IS. It is therefore resonable to asume that by placing a constitutive active promoter in front of the flhDC operon, hyperflagellation will be induced.
Our system
As we are trying to create a microflow in our system using flagella, we want to increase the flow created by a single bacteria by increasing the number of flagella on the bacteria. However, inducing flagellation in a wildtype E. coli strain requires too much of the bacterial environment. In order to avoid the tight control of the flhDC operon, we insert it into a plasmid backbone containing a constitutive active promoter. As we bypass the original regulations and continuously express the master regulon of the flagellum cascade we hope to see a significant difference in motility of the cells containing our composite part.
As E. coli already express the flhDC operon, we isolate this coding sequence by purifying genomic DNA from the E. coli MG1655 strain and then amplifying the operon using PCR with specially designed primers , before assembly and the insertion into the plasmid backbone
Furthermore, it will be interesting to see whether the overexpression of the flhDC operon will have an effect on the bacterial growth.

Chifley High School Event
We transformed our lab into an engaging workshop for up to 40 high school students in years 9 and 10 with interactive activities designed to promote an understanding and appreciation of various aspects of synthetic biology and our iGEM project. Students were invited to learn about various good and bad microbes and created their own out of Play-Doh, explored the microbial word through learning how to use a microscope, and the importance of safety and hygiene with an activity showing how easily bacteria can be transferred. They also had a lot of fun playing an original synthetic biology themed snakes and ladders game created by one of our team members, and they learnt all about fluorescent bacteria where they had the opportunity to use these bacteria to paint beautiful artwork. The workshop concluded with a game show style quiz, where the students competed against each other and showcased their new knowledge.
Both students and team members thoroughly enjoyed the day, and evaluations were conducted to measure the educational and engagement affect our event had on the students.

York,2014,Team:York#Judging_-_-_TEXT.html," surveys and data analysis shows that the ways in which GMOs are handled can greatly influence public opinion, which in turn can be a decisive factor in the success or failure of a project. One can only garner public support if they can reassure the public and provide them with as much information as possible about the systems in which they will use GMOs, about the existing contingency measures and about the risks and benefits the project presents.  Our research could help future iGEM teams use the right approach when it comes to getting the public on board with their project. We also hope this will help the scientific community communicate with the general public more effectively, especially with regard to the controversial topic of GMOs.

IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#protocol_-_-_TEXT.html," Add equal volume of phenol: chloroform. Mix the organic and aqueous phases by vortexing and then centrifuge the emulsion at maximum speed for 2 minutes in a microfuge. Transfer the aqueous upper layer to a fresh tube.
Precipitate nucleic acids from the supernatant. Now add 2 volumes of ethanol at room temperature to the supernatant in a 1.5 ml MCT. Mix the solution by vortexing and then allow the mixture to stand for 2 minutes at room temperature(optional). Discard the pellet in the original 2 ml MCT.
Collect the precipitated nucleic acids by centrifugation at maximum speed for 10 minutes in a microfuge.
Discard the supernatant by aspiration. Stand the tube in an inverted position on a paper towel to allow all of the fluid to drain away. Use a Kim wipe or disposable pipette tip to remove any drops of fluid adhering to the walls of the tube. Stand the tube for 10 minutes.
(Optional)Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol to the pellet and invert the closed tube several times. Recover the DNA by centrifugation at maximum speed for 2 minutes at in a microfuge.
(Optional)Remove all of the supernatant by aspiration. Take care with this step, as the pellet sometimes does not adhere tightly to the tube.
(Optional)Remove any beads of ethanol from the tube. Store the open tube at room temperature until the ethanol has evaporated and no fluid is visible in the tube (5-10 minutes).
Store the tube for 10 minutes at 37 degrees without shaking.
Dissolve the nucleic acids in 20 μl of mQ ( 1/100 times the initial volume in the MCT) or TE (pH 8.0) [containing 20 μg/ml Dnase-free RNase A (pancreatic RNase)] . Vortex the solution gently for a few seconds and store the DNA at -20°C.

The Bacteria Game is a simple all-in-one kit to let homegrown bacteria compete against each other. March in lockstep with nature, breed your own creatures and become coach of your very own athletes. Simply use the included breeding kit to raise your own team and challenge your friends.  Included is everything you need to start instantly: * 3 Petri dishes * Bacteria starter set (bacteria culture, agar, toothpicks) * 2 Game scenarios * Different Game objects (barriers, forts)  Use the Agar to build different landscapes and as a nutrient for your creatures. Inculate your team onto the agar and watch the game begin. Use the included game objects to evolve your team.  ==Technical Description== The concept of the game is based on the ability of some harmless wildtype bacteria to swim in soft media. Swimming enables the microbes to consume further nutrients if those in their vicinity are already consumed. All bacteria try to get away from the starting point as fast as possible to access fresh media. This mechanism can be employed for a game setup. Selection and culturing of best swimmers leads to propagation of ideal swimming characteristics. That is, why training may help gain a competitive edge. Those bacteria can easily be stored in the fridge with the supplied materials without any risk.  The showdown competition is run by synthetic bacteria. Predators and prey communicate and regulate each other's density. Via molecular signals, the predator cells kill the prey while living prey rescues predators. The diverse and colorful crowd surrounding the spectacle was genetically engineered to carry different pigments which has been appreciated at the iGEM competition 2009.  == Wetlab Notebook ==  * usage of [https://2009.igem.org/Team:Cambridge E. chromi principle] (pigmented ''E. coli'' cells)  ** as a colorful crowd *** plasmids available in iGEM Spring 2010 DNA Distribution (see table 1) * testing of a synthetic ''E.coli'' predator-prey system ([http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v5/n12/pdf/nchembio.244.pdf Song ''et al.'', 2009]), ([http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v4/n1/pdf/msb200824.pdf Ballagadd"

First Experiment
We used the same protocol than before, but with 60g of soil and 5mL of water. We made this experiment in triplicate.
Soil
We started a new experiment with more soil (60g) to analyze the contamination evolution during a longer period of time. We planned to do it for a few weeks but after three days, we observed contaminations on our negative control. After multiple trials, we concluded that this was due to the MCK medium used. Thus we changed the MCK stock and did tests from which we concluded that adding sorbitol to the MCK was more selective than adding lactose. Consequently, we decided to start another time the experiment for all the different contaminated media using Sorbitol-MCK rather than lactose-MCK.
Seawater and Freshwater
The first time we put our strains in 5mL of water but we encountered two main problems. The first one was that it was very difficult to spread the 100µL sample on plates. The samples seemed to slide on the medium. And the next day, we can only observe some “lines” of colonies. The second problem appeared on the second day: the medium, normally red, turned into a yellow color. This was probably due to a change of pH in the water sample, most likely due to the metabolism of some microorganisms when adding LB in the environment.
Final experiment
After those pre-tests, we finally had established a protocol that should allow us to carry out our experiment. We chose to test 15g (soil) or 15mL (seawater and freshwater) of our samples contaminated by 1,5mL of our bacterial cultures. We used the following protocol.
We performed CFU analyses each day by depositing 5µL spots of contaminated media"
