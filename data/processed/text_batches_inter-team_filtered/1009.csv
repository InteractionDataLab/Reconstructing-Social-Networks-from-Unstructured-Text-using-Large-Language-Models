The saga of CSS starts in 1994. One of the authors of this book works at CERN - the cradle of the Web - and the Web is starting to be used as a platform for electronic publishing. One crucial part of a publishing platform is missing, however: there is no way to style documents. For example, there is no way to describe a newspaper-like layout in a Web page. Having worked on personalized newspaper presentations at the MIT Media Laboratory, HÂ Ã¦n saw the need for a style sheet language for the Web. Style sheets in browsers were not an entirely new idea.

JavaScript was originally developed in Netscape, by Brendan Eich. Battling with Microsoft over the Internet, Netscape considered their client-server solution as a distributed OS, running a portable version of Sun Microsystems' Java. Because Java was a competitor of C++ and aimed at professional programmers, Netscape also wanted a lightweight interpreted language that would complement Java by appealing to nonprofessional programmers, like Microsoft's VB. Developed under the name Mocha, LiveScript was the official name for the language.

Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989, about 20 years after the first connection was established over what is today known as the Internet. At the time, Tim was a software engineer at CERN, the large particle physics laboratory near Geneva. Many scientists participated in experiments at CERN for extended periods of time, then returned to their laboratories around the world. These scientists were eager to exchange data and results, but had difficulties doing so. Tim understood the unrealized potential of millions of computers connected together through the Internet.

Gifu,2017,Team:Gifu#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," of the most important processes is making koji, Aspergillus oryzae is mainly used for propagating koji mold. In koji-muro, koji-making room at 30 ℃, koji spores are inoculated on the rice. After inoculation, the rice is kneaded and mixed well to put koji spores evenly onto rice. Under the condition of koji-muro, koji rice is incubated for one day.
⑤ Making shubo, starter culture of sake
Rice koji, a kind of mold grown on rice, sake yeast and steamed rice is added to shikomi-sui, water for sake making. With strict thermal management, mass propagation of sake yeast is accelerated. Toji, a chief of sake maker continues the pumping over the starter liquid. Taking out and pouring of starter culture liquid during early stage of the starter enhances the absorption of liquid by koji and steamed rice. The liquid of the fermentation starter is full of enzyme for saccharification. The chief verifies the quality of shubo overnight.
⑥ Shikomi, preparation for fermentation mash
After being transferred to a larger tank, more koji, the rice and water are added. To prepare the fermentation mash of sake, steamed rice and koji are divided into three portions and added over four days. Three steps are called hatsu-zoe or first step, naka-zoe or second stage and tome-zoe or third stage respectively. This method is the basic and traditional method of sake brewery and astonishingly effective to prevent microbial contamination. After incubation for 15 to 20 days, moromi, fermentation mash, is completed.
⑦ Pressing and filtration
Pressing is a process to separate sake kasu, sake cake, and sake. This is conducted by putting moromi in sakebukuro, cloth bags used at pressing stage. Filtration is also performed to let more solids such as rice settle out. Charcoal filtration is usually used to adjust flavor and color.
⑧ Pasteurization
Following filtration, sake is heated to 60 ℃ to sterilize and deactivate the enzyme. This is called hiire and indispensable to prevent spoilage.
⑨ Storing(Aging)
Sake is fundamentally left in the tank to age about a half of a year. The period depends on types and brands.

Freeze-dried Lactobacillus Experiment
Done for: Purdue team
Their project:
Purdue team is working on a spray device to purify lungs from benzene and toluene. Their idea is to spray engineered bacteria in the lungs that could purify lungs, thanks to their device. So they imagined a spray device supposed to be kept at -20°C and they were looking for a way to efficiently conserve bacteria at such temperature in a medium that human could ingest.
Their experiment:
It’s known that E. coli can be conserved for a long time in a milk/sucrose mix at -80°C. They enhanced the conservation protocol to maintain E. coli as long as possible in the milk/sucrose mix at -20°C.
Our experiment:
We obtained a lung microbiota strain, Lactobacillus spp ( coming from the Micalis lnstitute), to know whether the protocol they established could be used to maintain a real microbiota strain.
Procotol used:
In order to know if the lung strain could be maintained in milk for 2 weeks we made aliquots of bacteria in the milk mixture and everyday tubes were defrosted, dilutions were made and plated on petri dish. Two days after CFU were counted. Everyday 3 tubes of milk aliquots to check repeatability of countings were defrosted and 1 containing bacteria in water as a control.
The milk mixture was made with 18% of milk powder + 4% sucrose + 78% of sterilized water. The mixture was then pasteurized.
Petri dishes (MRS) with 10-4, 10-5, 10-6 and 10-7 dilutions of Lactobacillus spp
Results
CFU counts show that the freezing  induced an expected decrease of CFU in both milk and water (approximatively 35% of decrease after one day of freezing). In the following days"

Future Plan
The application we have developed can be used by all iGEM members.     As the iGEMs database expands and the recognition of the field of Synthetic     Biology increases, data resources from other biological databases such     as NCBI might be needed to be integrated to the application. In such     a situation, extendibility of the application is vital. New data resources     and new functions should be added easily.
Before planning ahead, feedback from other teams and iGEM headquarters     about the BioGuide 1.0 will be collected. That will help us to fill     in the missing features of the application and check the theories which     are basis of our algorithms.
As our application is not geared towards any commercial use and will     stay as an academic application, keeping track of the weekly developmental     process on the wiki notebook environment was satisfactory. If the need     for a commercial application emerges, we should be utilizing professional     software development approaches to determine the exact requirements     and to facilitate the use of a common language between interdiciplinary     members in the team.
For constructing BioGuide 2.0 we have some plans.
Short Term plan:
Next year we are planning to generate BioGuide 2.0 by using all parts     data but inorder to do this we will update our part database but easyway     is standardization and reorganizing all parts in partsregistrty.org     according to our suggestion because re-organizing and normalization     are crucial. We are planning to add new tools to improve graphs.Our     ultimate aim is finding best pathway based on automated construction     and input-output relation. BioGuide 2.0 will be more faster because     we are planning to use OODBMS and all all platform will support BioGuide     2.0.
Long term plan:
We want to improve our algoritm and add more parameter to make graphs     more effective. Our dream is embeding our software into partsregistry.org     so no mere iGEMers will choose parts in real time by using our software.

Make Pasr connect with GlsA. Asr promoter，Pasr， belongs to asr gene encoding acid-shock RNA. It is a pH-responsive promoter native to E.coli which induces transcription in acidic environment from pH 4.0 ~ 5.0 , and shows low activity at a neutral pH. We chose asr promoter as the base of pH regulation system.
After the connection of Pasr and GlsA, it was introduced into Escherichia coli to stabilize it at about pH = 6, and co-cultured with Acetobacter xylophilus at the optimum pH to produce high-yield bacterial cellulose.
The mutation parts
Overview :
In the world of synthesis biology,the prompters’ sensitivity always determine the rate of parts or systems reactions and mutation is a kind of the usual method to improve parts. So we designed 13 groups of point mutations around the -10 areas to improve the sensibility of the promoter. And then, we used the GFP protein to instead of our functional genes when we tested the mutation results.
Key Achievements:
We have already designed 13 groups of the point mtation to improve the sensibility                                         of the promoter and finished the most of mutation works.
Comparing with the target sequeces, the piont mutation sites are in line with our                                         expectations.
In summary, we have obtained 5 groups of the successful point muations which performance can improve a lot campared with the nature promoters.
Improvement :
Modified E.coli with plasmid BBa_K2267001 can stabilize the pH in the culture                                         media.
Via point mutation to plux, these promoters have higher efficiency than the original plux.

Approaches
House of Carbs is taking two approaches to increase the levels of butyrate in the colon
1. Butrylated Starches
The first approach aims for the production of butrylated starches that, when consumed, will release butyrate into the digestive system. Butrylated starch produced by chemical modification of purified maize starch have previously been shown to confer physiological changes associated with colon cancer resistance in rats 1 . The alteration of carbohydrate molecules in vivo would also be of great benefit, as modified starches are used in many industries. These starches are usually produced by chemical modification of purified starches and expensive processes using large quantities of environmentally damaging chemicals. For  example, acetylated starch is commonly used in food products such as frozen food, sauces and puddings due to its viscous, cohesive, gel-forming and freezing-stability properties 2 .
Figure 1: Schematic representation of a carbohydrate molecule with butyrate groups attached to it. We plan to do this enzymatically.
1. We have developed an experimental system to screen putative acyltransferases for their ability to modify alpha-1,4 linked carbohydrates. We are initially testing putative acyltransferases to determine if they can make acylated carbohydrates using acyl-CoA and butryl-CoA as substrates. Acyl-CoA is available in the cells of our chassis organisms but to provide butryl-CoA, we are also expressing two enzymes (butyrate kinase + phophotransbutrylase) from Coprococcus sp. L2-50 (DSM 16842), a colonic bacteria.
2. As the modification of plants is time-consuming, our initial experiments are the modification of the alpha-1,4 linked carbohydrate known as glycogen produced in laboratory strains of Escherichia coli. We also progressed to testing the enzymes for their ability to modify the starches produced in the plastids of plants. In the bacterial system, we also modified the structure of the glycogen using branching and de-branching enzymes in order to increase the number of free ends available"

A colony was picked and pipetted into 10mL of autoclaved LB and 10ul of Chloramphenicol. Two start-up cultures were prepared to ensure at least one is in the optimal OD range for 1 L culturing. The tubes were put into a shaking incubator at 37 degrees Celsius and left overnight for 17 hours.

Proof
Following two equations should be satisfied.
\begin{equation} f_u+g_a\lt 0  \label{eq:vern1}  \end{equation} \begin{equation} f_ug_a-f_vg_u\gt 0  \label{eq:vern2} \end{equation}  First, there are two possible equilibrium points \(\frac{du}{dt}= \frac{da}{dt}= 0\).
\((u,a)=(0,0)\)  and  \((u,a)=(u_0,a_0)\)
\(u_0\) and \(a_0\) satisfies the relations,\(u_0 = \gamma a_0\) and \(f(a_0)=1− u_0\)
\((u,a)=(0,0)\) doesn’t satisfy equation [\ref{eq:vern1}] and [\ref{eq:vern2} ].
When \((u,a)=(u_0,a_0)\),
$$ f_u=1 – 2u_0 – {\frac{a}{a+K}}{\delta}=1 – 2u_0 – (1 – u_0)= –u_0 \lt 0 $$ $$ f_a= –u_0・d_u{\frac{f(a)}{da}}|a_0 \lt 0 \qquad (\mathrm{for} \   d_u\frac{f(a)}{d_a} \gt 0)$$ because \(f(a)\) is approximated by Hill’s equation.
\(g_u­= 1\)
\(g_a= –{\gamma}\lt0\)
Putting these values into equation \ref{eq:vern1} and \ref{eq:vern2} ,
\(f_u+g_a= – u_0 –\gamma\lt 0\)
\(f_ug_a−f_ag_u = u_0(\gamma+ d_u\frac{f(a)}{d_a}|a_0)\gt0\)
So, \((u,a)=(u_0,a_0)\) satisfies those requirements.
To form Turing pattern, however, there is still one more condition to be satisfied two equations below.
\((d_ug_a + f_u)^2 – 4d_u(f_ug_a−f_ag_u) \gt 0\)

UNICAMP-Brazil,2009,Team:UNICAMP-Brazil#Coliguard#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," same conjugative plasmid. Bacteria that already have the plasmid display membrane proteins that prevent the conjugation with other bacteria that have the same conjugative plasmid. Therefore, if our E.coli has a conjugative plasmid, they will only conjugate with different organisms, which will be the contaminants.
For the conjugation, we will use a signal produced at the beginning of the conjugation process in order to stimulate the production of AI-2 in our E.coli. This signal will induce the promoter pY, which controls the expression of the conjugation-related genes. This promoter will then control the expression of the AI-2 gene in our E.coli. As a result, when conjugation begins the promoter will be induced and thus cause an up-regulation in AI-2 gene expression. In this way, the conjugation process will activate the killing and differentiation mechanisms in a way that is AI-2-dependent.
Combining these two recognition systems, our E. coli will be able to recognize a vast group of contaminants.
2) Differentiation mechanism
The initial differentiation mechanism is based on a random slippage mechanism that will determine the expression of a CRE recombinase in a small percentage of cells. This device is an adaptation from the device presented by the Caltech 2008 iGEM team. When expressed, the CRE recombinase will remove a device from the genome – containing a gene involved in the cell cycle and a gene that represses conjugation – and thus lead to the differentiation into killer cells. Killer cells are unable to reproduce, but able to conjugate. This device is an adaptation of the device presented by the Paris 2007 iGEM team.
Moreover, the presence of AI2 in the culture medium will also trigger the expression of CRE recombinase and thus induce the differentiation of more worker cells into the killer cells, so the proportion of killer cells will be elevated during the decontamination process. After a certain number of generations, the proportion of killer and worker cells will return to its original state, due to the killer cells being unable to reproduce.
3) Killing mechanism
After the signal indicating the presence of a contaminant, our Killer cell has  three ways to kill its target: It can be by the Hemolysin Secretion System, Kamikaze System or Colicin System.
The Hemolysin Secretion System core is a biobrick with the hlyB and hlyD  and the hlyA signal peptide.  hlyB and hlyD  genes codify for the proteins"

Running the Generator!

Generated Final Chip Sequences
We ran the generator once earlier this afternoon, but had to re-run it again due to a typo in the cut sites and the number of sequences we desired for each backbone. Luckily, we caught these errors, and after checking the program once again, we ran it a final time this afternoon.
It took about 45 minutes for the program to generate and reverse translate the 54900 sequences.
During this time, we created a function that will re-translate the sequences that the generator output. It compares the original helix with the re-translated helix to make sure that our reverse-translate works properly.
This step went smoothly, and we verified that the sequences were reverse-translated properly.
To make sure that the distributions generated were as expected, we made WebLogos of the helices generated(see below).

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Practices#WomanInScience_-_-_TEXT.html,", they massively stopped enrolling to such disciplines. Nowadays, in most of computer science courses in Brazil, only about 10% of all freshmen are women. And this trend seems stagnated.
Gabriela Mattos in a talk, probably talking about ""Grandma Cobol"" =)
This is one of the reasons why PyLadies São Carlos wants to organize regular excursions to high schools and technical schools, and show how cool computers and Python can be. Part of their program involves showing how to develop games using Python. Although they are not avoiding men, they focus on women. They already had one experience and they told us that one thing became clear: when girls are surrounded by boys, most of them feel uncomfortable of asking questions or commenting on something. Thus, they want to organize activities where only girls will be there and they will be encouraged to actively engage in such activities. This could potentially show to many girls who may think ""computers are for boys"" that ""computer are cool"" and they are for everyone.
In contrast, we asked ourselves: can a college really be this intimidating? Can the university environment be such unwelcoming as we are speaking of? It is not a matter of finding a culprit or a smoking gun. This is, however, a question to bug everyone; Yes, it should bug the present reader, the writer, everyone. Another topic of our conversation was how subtle jokes or comments, several times interpreted as naive or simply silly, may give away prejudices and deep opinions. And indeed, it is not hard to find ourselves in an uncomfortable situation where someone makes a joke that are solely based on false morals and prejudices. Who knows the effect of that joke, if said on the right time, can have on anyone, from any gender. Yet, women seem to be easier targets.
This is the reason why there is a need for such a community. A community that is not as interested in creating a group of Python experts, as in creating a diverse group. To PyLadies, the way to achieve this is through outreach, education and social gatherings.
To summarize, and allied to our survey on gender disparities , we believe the main problem might be that some people still do not acknowledge the existence of a problem; the existence of any disparity or segregation. That is why we wanted to make sure to promote PyLadies here. If you agree with us, help us spreading the word and share their website in all social media you have access to. This might help more than we think.
Brasil-USP team would like to publicly give a round of applauses to PyLadies!!

When doing the initial research for our synthetic alternative to palm oil components, we quickly came across lots of information regarding the current palm oil industry. It soon became apparent that the economies of some countries, for example Indonesia and Malaysia, depend almost entirely upon the current methods of palm oil production. Therefore we compiled a detailed impact analysis report for synthetic palm oil, which can be found by clicking on the button to the right.
Is The Palm Oil Industry Irreplaceable?
There’s no doubt about it, the economies of Malaysia and Indonesia, amongst other countries, rely heavily on the cultivation of palm oil.
But could there be a viable alternative, another industry which could support the economy as effectively?
Industries such as livestock[1], agriculture[2], services[3], tourism[4] and so on are already well-established and support the countries’ economies alongside the palm oil industry
Focussed development on any of the industries is foreseen to maintain the economies but in the meantime, environmental problems arise. Livestock industry, first of all, results in land-clearance in order to plant feed crops for the livestock. 8% of global water is used in the industry for different purposes[5] and the waste water or manure created, often composed of nutrients and harmful components, would be discarded into rivers and seas which affect the natural water source. Water and soil are polluted by chemical pesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture industry[6]. In Malaysia, tourism is considered as profitable as palm oil industry but disturbs the ecosystem[7] through the construction of tourism facilities and an increase in carbon footprints[8]. Perhaps most interesting, the biotech industry is strongly supported by the Malaysian government[9], suggesting that our project may well have a future on Malaysian and Indonesian soil (see Patenting )
The palm oil industry is well-known for having a short payback period and is highly productive. If replaced by another sector, the new"

Copper is an essential element to be added to the laccase module to enhance the efficiency of the laccase enzyme. However, copper ions might be added in excess if our MFC are supposed to be maintained by the potential users. This might be toxic to our Shewanella or might even pose hazards to the environment if any accidental release occurs. We therefore aimed to find any collaboration on potential safeguard mechanism to be implemented to our laccase module as a solution to this concern.
Team Hong Kong JSS project focuses on engineering bacteria to absorb accumulated copper in aquaponics and we therefore arranged for a meetup in their school to learn more about each other’s project and discuss the possibilities to integrate their design to help absorb our excess copper. In exchange, we will provide them with modelling guidance.
However, the collaboration is unsuccessful in the end due to our obstacles in cloning for the laccase protein and therefore could not achieve any characterization data to support the needs of absorbing excess copper.

Upon discovering that the SCUT China team B was working on PET plastic degradation, a small meetup was organised by the HKUST team during summer for exchange of ideas in project and experimental design with the 2 teams of SCUT China. Issues such as the ratio of enzyme subunits, surfactant to enhance the attachment of enzymes to the plastic surface for better degradation reaction were discussed. However, we could not identify any possible collaboration on system design and therefore this meetup was just used as a share of experimental insights.

We started by explaining both projects respectively, and understanding the similarities that we found in the NCHU wiki.
- As for now, our research is focused on same problem (TCDD as a byproduct of Agent orange). Within that, NCHU team visited Vietnam and visited the ""War Museum"".
- It's the first time their university is participating in iGEM    - The team consists of 17 students.
- Although the problem is almost identical to ours, their approach is different. They are looking to engineer a plant symbiont (Bacteria), while expressing genes that will help the transfer and the degradation of the molecule inside the plant.
- NCHU focus on 3 enzymes and have obtained results showing transfer and dechlorination of TCDD. They work with TCDD in their lab and not similar molecules like us (In terms of safety, they use 2 disposal masks when performing the experiments with the material).
- NCHU use mainly HPLC for analyzing their experiments. Also, they use HTC for toxicity tests.
- NCHU team showed interest to know more about our livestream and take an active part.

Besides, the phosphofructokinase was chosen for elevated fructose turnover: This enzyme catalyzes the reaction of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphat preventing fructose-6-phosphate accumulation after increased uptake. Enhancing this enzyme’s activity should result in higher ATP production via glycolysis using mainly fructose and sucrose as substrates. Enhancement of fructose and sucrose metabolism should be achieved by introducing the three endogenous proteins via the lactobacillus shuttle vector pNZ124Tue. The hypothetic results of the metabolic engineering and its effects are summed up in FIGURE 2. After we picked out possible knock-out and overexpression targets by educated guessing a systems biology approach was developed to simulate the proliferative behaviour of our modified lactobacillus.

Theoretical scheme of modified sugar metabolism of L. johnsonii.
In human, hereditary fructose intolerance is caused by accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. To simulate this cellular problem in a model organism, a ketohexokinase was codon optimized for expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This experiment is based on a paper by Donaldson et al. from 1993. Yeast cannot metabolize fructose-1-phosphate causing it to be toxic for the cells and inhibiting its growth. For this reason, no yeast enzyme produces fructose-1-phosphate. So the idea was to introduce a ketohexokinase into yeast leading to the production and accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in fructose containing environment. Hence, if there is any fructose consuming organism the modified yeast cells should grow better. The ketohexokinase designed for this project is based on the ketohexokinase of Rattus norvegicus, originally used for the experiments in Donaldson’s publication.
Knock out via CRISPR/Cas9
Our primary goal being an increase in the utilization of fructose in the Lactobacillus’ metabolism, we planned to disable key enzymes in the metabolic pathway of glucose, thus forcing the bacterium to rely on other carbohydrates as a source of energy. To that end, we aimed to use CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), being the most flexible and affordable tool for genomic modification, as a means to achieve a knockout. Using a Cas9 endogenous to another strain of L. Johnsonii, our plan was to replace our target genes"

In order to achieve our goals and develop FREDsense, we required a diverse background of skill sets. Seven members of the 2012 Calgary iGEM team joined forces to become part of the FREDsense team. Our skills represent a variety of technical specialities ranging from genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology to electrochemistry. To ensure our venture's success, we enlisted the aid of technical, business, and legal experts to our advisory board. This has aided in producing a dynamic team that will be able to deliver on FREDsense's goals and bring our technology to market.
Building the FREDsense Team
Our team is composed of seven students from diverse technical backgrounds, all who were members of the 2012 Calgary Collegiate iGEM team where this technology platform was initially developed from. To suppliment our skills we have also enlisted the aid of several key advisors from diverse technical, business, and legal backgrounds to sit on our advisory board and act to guide FREDsense Technologies as it develops.
Team Members
Our team consists of seven members from diverse technical backgrounds. Each member played a critical role in developing the technology from the 2012 Calgary iGEM team and has played a significant role in playing multiple roles in business development of FREDsense Technologies.
Iain George
This is my second year on our iGEM team at the University of Calgary. I am a master student in biological sciences at the U of C. My research is in investigating how RNA-binding proteins act to regulate various genes at the post-transcriptional level. Previously, I worked as a member of the Biofilm Research Group at the U of C, studying how bacterial biofilms could be applied to bioremediate environmentally contaminated sites. When I am not living/sleeping/supervising in the lab, you may find me in the mountains surrounding Calgary hiking and trying my hand at photography.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"9 functions more like a shuttle to carry the cytidine deaminase to the targeted DNA sequence. Another modified form of Cas9, called Cas9 nickase (nCas9), has a mutation in only one of the endonuclease domains (D10A). This alteration allows the nCas9 to only cleave one strand of the DNA thereby nicking the non-edited strand, favoring cellular mismatch repair of the nicked strand and leading to more of the desired editing outcome.
Lastly, the component uracil glycosylase inhibitor (ugi) is fused to the base editor fusion complex. This prevents the U-G mismatch created by the cytidine deaminase from changing back to the original C-G instead of the desired T-A mutation[2][3].
In the targeted DNA sequence, maximum base editing occurs when the C or G is located 13-17 base pairs upstream from the PAM site[2].
Base Editing to Record Stimuli
Earlier this year, researchers at Harvard and MIT developed two systems, termed CAMERA and DOMINO respectively, that utilize base editors to record stimuli[4][5]. In their systems, there are two components. A writing module contains the base editor complex and a gRNA driven by a small molecule inducible promoter. The recording component is a plasmid that contains the gRNA recognition sequence of DNA that is to be edited by the writing module.
After chemical inducers are added to the system, a gRNA-base editor complex forms. The gRNA, produced under the presence of the stimulus, guides the base editor to the recording DNA to make the single nucleotide change from a C-G to T-A. Since the recording DNA is contained on a high copy plasmid, these mutations are accumulated linearly over time as more and more recording sequences are modified. Samples of the DNA are taken at various time points in order to determine the amount of editing present at each time point. For readout of the mutation frequency, the researchers for the CAMERA system utilized high-throughput sequencing[4][5].
Amount of editing over time using the CAMERA system with varying concentrations of stimulus (IPTG) [4]
The second system, DOMINO, was able to accomplish temporal logic in which a desired outcome is produced after a certain amount of time has passed. This timing aspect is achieved by designing the recording DNA with a series of overlapping repeats as the target sites for the writing module. The sequence is designed such that the base pair edit on the starting repeat target sequence enables the gRNA to recognize the following repeat in the target sequence, and so on"

On the 8th of September a commercial about our project aired on the website and Facebook page of the University of Southern Denmark. We made this commercial in collaboration with the communications department of the University of Southern Denmark, specifically a producer named Anders Boe. It was seen 27,526 times, which is equivalent to 16% of our hometowns population. The click-through rate was around 10%, which is much greater than the average rate of videos on their Facebook page. The commercial led to random people, including doctors on the hospital of Odense, asking team members about the project and about GMO in general. With all this in mind it seems fair to state that the commercial was a smash hit of our human outreach and our engagement in the social media. In combination with our easily recognisable logo and our human outreach initiatives, we have been using our social media as a platform to show interest in synthetic biology and for sharing our work.
After seeing the commercial a local newspaper reached out to us to bring an interview in their Saturday special Newspaper article from Fyens.dk (Danish) . In collaboration with the student media RUST and Beton TV we have been featured in their magazine and a video of our attendance in Boston will be shown on their Facebook page briefly after our return. This is done to ensure an awareness of the iGEM competition among the students on the University of Southern Denmark. We hope this will inspire a lot of students to apply for the iGEM team next year, since it is a hallmark of the SDU-Denmark team to be interdisciplinary.
The effort put into our social media strategy and our goal of following it has paid off. Social media has shaped our outreach and made it possible for us to talk about iGEM and our project to people we did not know. Several times our outreach has led us to public discussion of GMO and solar panels due to persons contacting us, wanting to know more.

Figure 1. a: The growth curve in anaerobic condition (M9 medium).  b: Glucose consumption curve in anaerobic condition (M9 medium).
Shown as figure 1a, under anaerobic conditions, wild-type MG1655 has the same growth rate as MG1655ΔpflB, but MG1655ΔpflB + ldhE keeps relatively lower growth rate than the two strains mentioned before. Shown as figure 1b, the anaerobic glucose consumption rate keeps the nearly same among MG1655, MG1655ΔpflB and MG1655ΔpflB + ldhE.
Figure 2. a: The lactate production curve in anaerobic condition (M9 medium).  b: The lactate production in anaerobic condition (M9 medium, 25h after inoculation)
In anaerobic environment, lactate production of MG1655, MG1655ΔpflB and MG1655ΔpflB+ldhE has large differences between each other. Notably, knocking out of pflB together with ldhE insertion will increase lactate generation up to ~3 g/L and the amount produced by MG1655ΔpflB is smaller than MG1655ΔpflB+ldhE.
So, knocking out of pflB can dramatically improve the lactate production. Besides, ldhE also plays an important role in lactate increase. Engineered lactate producing strain (MG1655ΔpflB+ldhE"

To introduce the lower school to synthetic biology and the ethics involved in this exciting field of science we created a weekly club within our school. We chose to make the club specifically for year 7s because by teaching them the basic principles of genetic engineering they can research further throughout their time in high school and form their own opinions about genetic engineering and potentially become the future iGEM team. The club provided the iGEM team with the opportunity to engage with the younger members of the school community and explore their opinions about the complex ideas we were introducing them to.
Each weekly 1-hour session in the BioBlast club built upon their knowledge about DNA and genetic engineering starting from the basics and gradually working up. We started by looking at cells and using microscopes to identify the nucleus, then in following sessions, we studied DNA and its structure. All our sessions had a practical element to keep students engaged since they were 11-12 years old. For example, when we were looking at the structure of DNA we used sweets to create 3D models - this was very successful as by the end of the session they could identify elements of the DNA structure. In following sessions, we transitioned onto Darwin and Mendel and the effect of genes on phenotypes (demonstrated by a practical involving Gelli-baff which mimicked natural selection) and then moved onto genetic engineering. It was in these sessions that big ethical debates were raised naturally by the students and lead onto organic discussions such as “Should we genetically engineer a ‘perfect’ human?” and “Is it ethical to genetically modify farm animals for agriculture?”.
It was very encouraging to see these debates developing without prompting from us and to see these issues discussed with a solid scientific background. In the final session, we played a board game created by the Exeter IGEM team in 2016 which taught the students about plasmid construction and illuminated the vast potential of genetic engineering- this was very successful as at this point the students had a solid scientific foundation and could follow along very well to a game created for slightly older students.
Inter"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Practices#DualUse_-_-_TEXT.html," in an ethical discussion. To ensure these progresses, advisory institutions, such as ethical commissions, need to be established. While the optimal solution would be international applicable guidelines, which advisory boards are reaching out for, we believe iGEM to have the unique chance to be a role model in international collaboration and education of young researchers.
Biosafety and Biosecurity in iGEM
Every team is dealing with genetically modified organisms, methods of synthetic biology to analyze, combine and build those organisms and DNA parts, respectively. Therefore, the question of regulation is given in context of biosecurity and biosafety. It needs to be dealt with within each team and the competition itself as well.
Biosafety and Biosecurity in iGEM
However, we could not find definitions of biosafety, biosecurity, dual use and dual use research of concern (DURC) within the iGEM safety page. In terms of biosafety, obligational forms need to be filled and check-ins for certain organisms and proteins are required. A list of organizations publishing instructions and legal regulations for different countries is provided, since iGEM faces the challenge of teams from a broad range of countries. Regarding biosecurity on the other hand, we found questions to be asked in context of safe project design, such as “To whom will it be benefitial or harmful?” on the safety page. It is noticeable, that the questions asked try to cover a mixture of biosafety and biosecurity issues. The answers differ among the iGEM teams in a very broad spectrum. Interestingly, the questions aim to the designed product or the used methods/chassi. The information that are distributed among our society by the team´s homepages, wiki and other published materials is not addressed. In our view, the question concerning security in the safety form aim for the product rather than the knowledge too: “What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?” We think that biosecurity risks need to be defined and the question to be asked more precisely.
Dual Use Dilemma in iGEM

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of the aroA gene, elevating the EPSP synthase levels and rendering the encoded enzyme insensitive to glyphosate, respectively (9-11). Our genome sequencing analyses of the isolated iGEM1, iGEM7 and iGEM13 strains did not identify mutations that alter the synthesis or the coding sequence of the EPSP synthase. To assess whether B. subtilis can develop glyphosate resistance by the acquisition of mutations that alter the target of the herbicide, we isolated 12 additional mutants from CS-Glc plates containing 10 mM glyphosate. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that each strain had mutations within the gltT coding sequence that would truncate or lengthen GltT transporter (Figure 6). Thus, the inactivation of the gltT gene is the predominant mutational event allowing B.  subtilis to grow in the presence of the weedkiller glyphosate.
Figure 6. The mutations in the gltT gene and the consequences for the encoded transporter GltT in the B. subtilis mutants that were isolated from CS-Glc medium agar plates containing 10 mM glyphosate.
1.5. Characterization of gltT, gltP and gltT gltP mutant strains
Next, we tested whether the clean deletion of either the gltT gene or the gltT gltP genes is indeed sufficient to confer high-level resistance of B. subtilis to glyphosate. For this purpose, we constructed the mutant strains BP233 (gltT), BP234 (gltP) and BP235 (gltT gltP). To assess the glyphosate resistance of the gltT, gltP and gltT gltP mutants, we cultivated the bacteria in CS-Glc minimal medium supplemented with increasing amounts of glyphosate. As shown in Figure 7A and 7C, growth of the wild type and the gltP mutant strains, respectively, was inhibited by 5 mM glyphosate. This observation indicates that GltP is a low-affinity glyphosate transporter and that the cell still contains a transport system for the herbicide. The transporter with a high-affinity for glyphosate seems to be in fact GltT because the deletion of the gltT gene conferred high-level resistance to the herbicide (Figure 7B). Moreover, the deletion of the gltP gene in the background of a gltT mutant strain further enhanced glyphosate tolerance and the growth rates of the strains BP233 (gltT) and BP235 (gltT glt"

iHKU,2008,Team:iHKU#modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," D was defined as the diffusion coefficient. For a simple diffusion process, it is easy to write an diffusion equation to describe the density ρ distribution.
...................................................................................................(1.4)
Normally, as the  swimming speed of E.coli is about 20um/s and the tumbling frequency is about 1 Hz,  the diffusion coefficient is about 200um2/s [ 3 ].

Front propagation for cell growth
If we only considered the wild type E.coli that has the diffusion effect and  growth effect, it came up with the model Fisher-Kolmogorov  equation which was firstly developed by R. A. Fisher and A. N. Kolmogorov [ 4 ].
(2.1)
where ρ was the cell density, D was the diffusion coefficient, γ0was growth rate, ρs was saturation density.
Here, due to the symmetry, we investigated  equation (2.1) in case of cylindrical domains with u depending only on radius.  Numerical study with an initially condition of  Gaussian function                                                                      as Fig.2 can  give a solution shown in Fig.2, while analytical solution can refer to  reference [ 5 ]. Based on the solution, it was found that the speed of the front  propagation of the pattern was proportional to the square root of the product of  diffusion coefficient D and growth rate γ. As this migration speeds of the cell pattern at  different cheZ expression levels can  be obtained from experiments, and the growth rate was also measured, the  diffusion coefficient D at different cheZ expression levels were also known  then. And the cell density can be transformed to the brightness that we observed  in the experiments (see the brightness model part) , the quantity ρ can be compared with the experiments. Therefore, each  quantity in equation (4) can be compared with the experiments.
If we  looked at the wild type E.coli which  only had random walk and growth, the equation (2.1) was successful to describe its behavior. As shown in Fig.2, a droplet of wild type E.coli in the center of the plate will  from a round expanding pattern. And most regions in this pattern except for  some near in boundary seems to be uniform, which was the same as the  result of the model (Fig.2).

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2015,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Public Acceptance_-_-_TEXT.html," supports from government on bio-desalination industry, we visited Professor Xi Wang from KoGuan Law School of SJTU. Our conversation started from idea presentation and soon expanded to the specialized method to prove our project's possibility to the government. He is the fist experts that we get in touch with and his idea really helps this entire HP project's construction.
Government support
Here's some of our conversation that we did to expand our research. As we expected, to earn the approval from government is really hard at this point. However, Chinese government encourage the desalination industry with lots of support.
China has many policies and laws to support seawater desalination industry. The corporate income tax in respect of the income generated by an Enterprise from operating in the environmental protection, energy and water saving conservation projects including seawater desalination shall be exempted for the first to third years and allowed a fifty percent reduction in the fourth to sixth years beginning from the tax year the project derives its first production and operation income. (Implementation Regulations of the Corporate Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China)
In addition, seawater desalination is an important project of the 12th Five-Year Plan. In order to promote development of resource conservation and environmental protection, Chinese government invests in some projects which meets the requirements. Seawater desalination belongs to energy conservation, circular economy and resource saving projects. Chinese government invests 4.5 billion all together in it in 2015. The subsidy of a single project must be less than 10 million yuan.
There is an example. The pre-treatment membrane of seawater desalination and the complete equipment industrialization of a company called Tianjin Motimo Membrane Technology CO., LTD obtained 7.2 million yuan investment from the government.

Government approval
However, as we said before, if bio-desalination is used into seawater desalination industry, the new technology must face problems of feasibility. The keywords that government focuses are safe, environmental-friendly and economical. Safety means that products must be qualified with the national standards and shouldn’t contain anything harmful to human beings, which is the public focus.Environment-friendly industry shouldn’t let out pollution into the environment so we should deal with waste from bio-desalination as well. What’s more, the new technology must be more economical than traditional techniques, or else the new technology lacking competitiveness will be eliminated by market and won’t get supports from government.

Our business plan facilitates use of our product over the widest range of clients from single citizen users to whole cities, municipalities, and states. We engineered a way to reclaim a resource from what was otherwise considered a waste stream and concentrated it to increase its value and drive the economics of demand and supply. As the price of phosphorus increases it will become more and more feasible to deploy our PRMs in more places. We will be able to improve the environment and profit from the remediated phosphorus. The flexibility of our system even extends to other compounds allowing groups to cater the reclamation to their individual problem.

S. blattae with Glms w/o Thio as well as with BtuF w/o Thio were cultured anaerobically and induced with arabinose. Samples before and after induction were analyzed by western blot. Expression could be detected for BtuF and GlmS (see figure 4). After harvesting, fractions of cytoplasm, spheroplasm and periplasm were separated. Samples of the fractions were submitted to the B12 plate assay as well as to SDS page and western blot. BtuF could be detected in the spheroplasm and the periplasm (REFERENCE to WB 14.10.). In the plate assay, no B12 could be detected.

Calgary,2011,Team:Calgary#Team#Facilitators_-_-_TEXT.html," the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary. My main research interests deal with the electrophysiology of the heart, using a combination of experimental measurements and computer modeling. I realized a few years ago that the modeling methods used in this research also can be applied to an area I knew nothing about at the time: Synthetic Biology. This is the third time I am involved as one of the facilitators for a U of C iGEM team. The idea of applying engineering methods to biology just keeps getting more fascinating to me the more I learn about it. This year, I am particularly excited about the fact that we have built a team with students from three faculties joining forces to address a problem of great relevance to our local economy.

Since arriving at the U of C, I’ve also been examining the microbiology of oil sands tailings ponds with an eye towards how microbes can be used in their bioreclamation.  This is my first time being involved in iGEM.  I am very excited by the possibility that tools of synthetic biology can be used to help in the tailings ponds biotreatment and hope to learn a lot about all aspects of iGEM from our dynamic and diverse group of students!

Short Summary
Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) and the publics’ conception of risks pose a threat to free research. We assessed the awareness of this topic in the scientific community through a global survey and identified a dramatic lack of coherent international terminology. Different understanding due to different educational or scientific backgrounds led to huge debates in the past ultimately resulting in restriction of publications. Thus, we reached out to scientists increasing the awareness of DURC and gaining public trust by effective science communication. Our survey unveiled great need for training the next generation of scientists. iGEM is the ideal platform to provide and establish sustainable training, and to raise global awareness. Starting local, we organized a lecture at our own university, expanded our university library with DURC literature, provided open-source presentation slides, created a podcast, and established a seminar. Mission: Integrate DURC issues and their communication firmly into university education! Additionally, we got in touch with society by participating in the FameLab, performing experiments at street sciences and working with pupils on various occasions.

At present, China's large-scale fermentation products such as amino acids, vitamins and organic acids rank first in the world; bioenergy replaces fossil energy in the year with more than 33 million tons of standard coal, which is in the forefront of the world; realized organisms such as ethylene glycol, butanol and ethylene. The production of biological materials such as bio-plastics and bio-chemical fibers has begun to take shape. Pantothenic acid, acrylamide and nisin account for 50% to 70% of the world market, and raw material consumption and waste discharge are reduced by more than 50%. After the vigorous development during the “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” period, the output value of the main products of China's industrial biotechnology industry has exceeded 550 billion yuan, with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. In 2016, the output of major products in China's fermentation industry reached 26.29 million tons, an increase of 8.3% compared with 2015, which reversed the situation of low level in recent years. Among them, amino acids achieved rapid growth, starch sugar, enzyme preparations, yeast, functional fermented products maintained steady growth, the polyol industry grew slightly, and the organic acid industry experienced negative growth. In 2016, the export volume of major export products reached 4.08 million tons, a year-on-year increase of 18.6%, much higher than the 3.3% increase in 2015. Affected by factors such as the decline in raw corn prices, the export volume of starch sugar, lysine, lactic acid and sodium gluconate achieved double-digit growth. MSG, citric acid, polyol and yeast remained stable growth due to the continuous decline in export prices. Enzyme production showed a negative growth. The scale of industrial biotechnology enterprises has been continuously expanded, and the industrial concentration has been further enhanced. The production capacity of the top 6 enterprises of some major product capacity accounts for more than 80% of the national production capacity; the industrial cluster area shows the distribution of raw material production areas.
However, China's industrial biotechnology industry still faces challenges. Although the output of China's bulk fermentation products occupies an international leading position, it is competitive with high resource consumption, high energy consumption and low labor cost. The level of production strains is still relatively low; although Chinese enterprises are in emerging bio-industries (such as organisms) Fuel, bio-based chemicals, bio-materials have a certain foundation, but the production technology of"

SOB plates
Ryan
SOB plates failed/ dried up because they were left in the hood over the weekend (agar was thin and had a wavy texture, we felt it was better to make new plates).
100mL SOB was aliquoted and 1.6 g agar was added
The solution was heated and mixed, and then autoclaved for an hour (set at liquids 30, P03)
The agar did not completely dissolve when stirred, but did dissolve in the autoclave.
This was used to make 5 plates, which were of proper thickness

Take home message
Nothing really new here from what we heard in the previous interviews; apart from the fact that Professor Ricroch seems to have a much more positive vision of GMO then Pr.Gouyon. She perceives real benefits and is confident in second generation GMO (plants resistant to drought).

Storing cells in Glycerol Solution
What you need:
- 1.5 mL cryogenic vials
- 50% glycerol solution (can also use 20%)
- An overnight culture of the cells of interest
Procedure:
1. To a cryogenic vial, add 600 uL 50% glycerol solution and 400 uL liquid cell culture
2. Mix thoroughy and store in the -80˚C freezer until use
Unless noted, all procedures are based on those in the lab of Christopher Rao .
Subculturing E. Coli
What you need:
- Autoclaved 250 mL flasks
- Liquid Media
- Antibiotic, if necessary (not for DH5a c competent cells)
- An overnight culture of the cells of interest
Procedure:
1. Into your autoclaved flask add:
- 50 mL liquid media
- 50 ul antibiotic solution if necessary
- 500 uL overnight liquid culture.
Note: there is a 1:100 ratio of cells to media. Furthermore there is a 1:1000 ratio of antibiotic to media. When subculturing DH5alpha, antibiotic solutions are not required.
2. Incubate in the 37˚C warm room on a stirrer for 4-6 hours
Note: Need to check the cells 2 hours after inoculation to test their optical density (OD). The best competent cells come from cells in exponential phase of their growth. Therefore an OD of 0.4-0.8 is desired and this happens after 2-4 hours of incubation.
Electroporation and Transformation
You will need:
- 100 µl – Electrocompetent Cells
- 2-5 µl – Ligation Reaction (10 – 100 ng DNA)
- 1 ml – SOC broth/ LB liquid media
- Electrocuvette
Procedure:
1. Gather all your supplies and keep them on ice (or in 4o C room). This includes the cuvettes.
2. Thaw frozen electrocompetent cells on ice and place in electrocuvette. Then add ligation reaction and tap the cuvette to mix well. "

Future Plan
1. Digital  Display
Genetic parts we have constructed are more  complicated than normal BioBricks, leading to uncertain performance which may  not correspond to previous predictions. This problem highlights an issue that  how to build robust and predictable synthetic gene networks. Unlike electronic  circuits, most  newly  created  gene  circuits  are  non-functioning  due  to  intrinsic  parameter  uncertainties,  external  disturbances  and  functional  variations  of  intra-  and  extra-cellular environments [1] . In terms of molecular level, alteration in strength of the  promoter and RBS is necessitated to obtain an optimal method for assemblage of  genetic parts. Our goal for next stage is to seek a useful method for  constructing a complex genetic network that can achieve its desired steady state behaviors. Once we achieve that, a real genetic  seven-segment display will be much easier to build, so as other complex  circuits.
2. Time  Delay
Unsatisfying with our present stage of  primary research of time delay, we plan to use the marker gene GFP and then evaluate  the time spent for bio-circuits with different grade of RBSes to reach a  certain fluorescent level. Besides, we also tend to characterize the control of  pBAD and other promoter in a much more systematical way.
3. Cell  Immobilization
We have almost finished building our  display device, just a few more running tests are needed to improve and perfect  it. We plan to immobilize cells that contain other genetic circuits we  constructed and stuff them correspondingly into the seven glass tubes. The  transportation system of oxygenated medium is also needed perfection. After "
Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"The intensity of the blue color drecreases with increasing glyphosate concentrations (Figure 22). The change and intensity of the blue color correlates with the glyphosate concentration and can therefore be used as detection and quantification system. Furthermore, a β–galactosidase assay can quantify the activity of the promoter palf4 and thus, the concentration of glyphosate.
The promoter-reporter gene fusion of palf4 and lacZ allows to determine the activity of the promoter. Since palf4 is constitutively active this is directly linked to the survival of the cells. Transcription results in synthesis of ß-galactosidase which in turn hydrolyses o-nitrophenyl-ß-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG), resulting in the formation of o-nitrophenol. Formed o-nitrophenol absorbs light with a wavelength of 420 nm, and can therefore be used as an indicator for the amount of cells and subsequently for the concentration of glyphosate. We determined ß-galactosidase activity for the mixture of BP193 and BP235 in presence of increasing amounts of glyphosate. In addition, we used BP193 and BP235 as controls. Cells were grown in a 1:1 ratio. ß-galactosidase activity was high in the BP193 control and at low glyphosate concentration. Increasing glyphosate concentration is directly linked to cell death of BP193 and a corresponding decrease in ß-galactosidase activity (Figure 23).
Figure 23. Cell mixture (1:1) of strains BP193 and BP235 were incubated with increasing glyphosate concentrations (0 - 5 mM). Strain BP193 harbors the lacZ gene behind an artificial promoter, but does not tolerate glyphosate in contrast to strain BP235. ß-galactosidase activity can be measured at a wavelength of 420 nm using the substrate o-nitrophenyl-ß-D-galactopyranoside. Activity decreases with increasing glyphosate concentration. BP235 does not contain the lacZ gene, hence no activity can be observed.
In an additional step, we verified that the change in coloration occurred due to the death of the sensitive strain on the one hand and the increased growth of the resistant BP235 strain on the other hand. Hence, we adopted the experimental set up and analysed growth of the two strains in the platereader. To analyse growth of BP235, we used the strain constitutively expressing GFP, which was constructed similarly to the previously used strains"

This July, NCKU Tainan hold a meet-up with Ming Dao senior high school iGEM team and Chung Shan Medical school university iGEM team.We shared each other with our projects in the afternoon and motivated to challenge better.
Aims Of The Meet-Up
We chose to hold this meet-up in 7/3———It’s the time that each iGEM team has chose their project and have the brief concept to go on with the project.In this case, we had lots of things to share with each other,like the whole blueprint of human           practice program, design of device,the difficulties had meet …etc.In the meet-up,we listened to different teams’ prospection and their latest program. Because we are all registered teams, We could have more detailed discussion of lab design           and shared about some useful information about the competition——and most of all,we listened to other teams’ advice,and gave some feedback of their project.In conclusion,we hoped this meet-up would be benefit for teams attended, and made all           of us to think more thoughtfully about our projects.
How We Proceed ?
Both two schools invited are located in central Taiwan.One is a senior high school team(Ming Dao senior high school) and the other one is a college team(Chung Shan Medical school university).Before the meet-up, we had to pick up a good date earlier in           case they could figured out the transport way.
We sent E-mails to the leader of Ming Dao senior high school iGEM team to discuss about the the format of the meeting,including how long was the presentation time of each group,how many people would attend.
Here is our brief schedule.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Product Design_-_-_TEXT.html," 0.05 to 0.1 kWh/m3 (between 10 and 30 % more of the existing value without advanced treatment) the investigators still considered Ozonation as satisfactory solution. Additionally, Jesper Olsson’s statement “With PAC, the pharmaceuticals are not eliminated, they end up in the sludge’’ spotlighted another flaw of Ozonation (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018). When the conversation ended up on Activated Carbon the investigators voiced that: “The biggest concern is the production of PAC if we are going to implement both technologies, which is very energy consuming process. With GAC, a technique similar to the one the drinking water plants use to take away organic pesticides, the cost is much higher’’ (Study visit J Olsson, E Kusoffsky 15 Aug 2018).
Taking into account all the relevant data and information we managed to collect about the existing solutions, we considered useful to create a landscape map in order to synthesize an overview of the field.
Figure 3. Landscape of the existing solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals in WWTPs.
From the first sight of the landscape map in Figure 3, it is apparent that there is a great need for a new solution that will meet the capabilities of Activated Carbon for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater. In addition, the solution would need to be energy efficient without creating unknown by-products with unknown ecotoxic effects and it would not need to be coupled with another solution in order to sustain low costs.
In support to this conclusion comes the statement from Stefan Berg, SYVAB’s process engineer at Himmelfjärds WWTP during our skype meeting: “Ozonation can be good, but not enough if you have tough restrictions. Although it is very common to have Ozonation followed by PAC or GAC, I would prefer one technique and not a combination’’ (Skype call S Berg 29 Aug 2018).
Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that WWTPs are indeed examining their available options for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater and are susceptible to implement a solution that covers their unmet needs.

In order to limit the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment we developed Biotic Blue, an enzymatic solution exploiting synthetic biologic - based techniques. Diving into the molecular level, Biotic Blue comprises a mutant oxidoreductase, the laccase enzyme from the polypore mushroom Trametes versicolor, immobilized on magnetic beads.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," needed to do a lot of preparation. But luckily, with the help of the teachers we managed to plan the day. We did not only present the theoretical background of our project, but also put emphasis on safety aspects related to synthetic biology and the experiments. Hence, we were able to initiate interesting conversations and discussed both, our project idea and the practical work in the lab.
As we prepared some long term experiments, we visited the school again after 2 days and could show the results to them. On that day, they took the chance to ask more specific questions about about Synthetic Biology and our field of study. What looked like an overwhelming organizational challenge turned out to be a great experience with students not much younger than us.
Postcard Project
This year the iGEM Team Düsseldorf started a postcard project. Every participating team was encouraged to design their own, with the purpose to increase the knowledge about synthetic biology in the public. We thought it was a great idea, so we participated. These cards have first been distributed amongst all participating teams and then were distributed in different locations around each team’s hometown.
With our topic we wanted to inform people about synthetic biology and genetic engineering and show that they are present in their daily life, in an easily understandable way.
Here, we want to thank once again the iGEM Team Düsseldorf for this great idea and the invitation to participate.

English translation:
""What does synthetic biology even mean?
The term “genetic engineering” is often mentioned in critical media reports and in this context cheese manufacturers more and more advertise with the promise that their products were made without this allegedly dangerous technology. We, as students of this field, would like to give you a better understanding of synthetic biology with the following example: Nowadays, you can find the declaration “without gene technology” on cheese packages. This does not refer to the actual ingredients of the product, but to the production method, so the cheese itself does not differ from “normal” one. Synthetic biology makes it possible to generate products with the help of genetically engineered microorganisms. In contrast, cheese without genetic engineering is produced with dried calf stomachs, which raises the question if this is more desirable.”

We also tried to pinpoint which applications of synthetic biology worry the general public. We asked the subject to pick his/her main concerns among the following list: ethics, environment, social, national security, religion and health. Several answers were allowed. The most chosen answer was “environment”. Again, we can observe this association between synthetic biology and environment. “Ethics” trailed by a few answers.
One result we found interesting was the relatively low number of ‘National security’ answers. Although Switzerland is a neutral country, it spends a considerable amount of its GDP (0.8% in 2012) for military expenses [1] and is one of the only countries in Europe to maintain a compulsory military service. We tried to contact the Swiss military but they declined to answer.
We also asked the school chaplains to comment on the lack of religious concerns despite Switzerland's deeply religious history. According to them, this can be explained by sociology. In recent years Switzerland, has seen a large emancipation movement from religions: ""few people define themselves as religious, but this does not mean that they have an ethical reflection"" comments Christian Vez, protestant school chaplain. ""Today it is not religion that governs a country, we are in a plural regime’ says Xavier Gravend, catholic school chaplain.  ‘We are dealing with these issues together under the banner of ethics, which is healthier than giving this responsibility to the religious world"". He adds that ""secularism is a chance; it gives everyone the opportunity to express their opinion, including religions"".
At the end of survey we included a question from the ETHZ iGEM team. This questions sought to determine whether sensitivity or specificity was most important in cancer diagnosis. The results showed mixed feelings, and many people took some time to think before answering.
The themes developed in this analysis are further discussed in our main article.
Main results from Basel public survey and Vaud highschools students
As mentioned above, we also submitted the survey to passerbys in Basel (in collaboration with the ETHZ iGEM team) and to Vaud highschool students (following the “biology and chemistry” option) before they visited us for the Highschool day. We collected about twenty forms in Basel and fifty from the students. Because the target audience was different in each of the three surveys, we decided not to combine the data, but rather to compare it for questions where opinions varied the most. All results are plotted in percentages. Results from Basel are to be interpreted with care because of the small number of answers.

Integrated Human Practices
From our initial idea, the design of our toehold switches and our model to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work.
Here, we have broken our project down into its different parts. For each, we explain the role feedback played in improving the aspect of the project, and why we changed what we did.

Dr Kirsten Jensen
Our initial constructs used a constitutive promoter. After cloning our construct in pSB1C3 plasmid, we attempted to amplify them in E. coli. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find.
We asked Dr Kirsten Jensen, an expert in synthetic biology at Imperial College London for advice. She inspected our sequences and suggested that the transcripts from our constructs were toxic to E. coli. She therefore suggested that we switch our promoter to an inducible promoter to avoid synthesis of the transcript during amplification in E. coli.
Following her advice, we used an arabinose inducible promoter, which resolved the issue for the 15b-5p switches and allowed us to continue with our experiments. However, the 27b-3p switches were still toxic.
See the results page for more details.
Dr Alex Green
Dr Alex Green is an expert in the world of synthetic biology – and in particular toehold switches. He confirmed that our existing design should work and suggested looking into the design of his B-series of Zika virus toehold switches to improve our existing switches. We did so"

Virginia iGEM
The Virginia iGEM team conducted a survey about the awareness and use of biocontainment in iGEM projects, which our members completed, giving them many more data points for their analysis!
HKUST iGEM
Building upon the collaboration we started in 2015 as the joint HKUST-Rice iGEM team, we hosted a number of HKUST students at Rice this past summer. They traveled to Rice to construct gene dosage-tuning devices that would 1) tune the effective             plasmid copy number, and 2) involve antisense RNA interference; additionally, they studied the approach toward modeling used in our project and helped establishing mathematical equations we used in our model.
The Rice and HKUST iGEM students interacted with each other in lab, and in Team Rice’s group meetings. Beyond the lab, the HKUST students also attended events on Rice’s campus, including a BioSciences Department retreat, the Rice Biosciences             Summer Research Institute (SRI) journal club, and the Rice IBB Summer Research Poster Symposium!
UT Austin & Texas Tech
iGEM teams Rice, UT Austin, and Texas Tech had a state iGEM meet-up at the 2016 UT Austin Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium (FURS). The three teams got together to practice their Giant Jamboree presentations (the iGEM teams’ presentations           for the symposium itself had 8-minute time limits), and were able to exchange valuable presentation feedback!"

Extra idee
Bacterie als zoekrobot:
Basisidee: een bacterie beweegt in een bepaalde richting en verzamelt bepaalde stoffen of deeltjes; als de bacterie genoeg van de betreffende stoffen verzameld heeft, keert deze terug en geeft de verzamelde stoffen af. Daarna kan de bacterie aan een volgende verzameltocht beginnen
In de figuur hieronder schets ik een mogelijke situatie:
1: bacterie beweegt onder een zekere gradiënt naar de plaat met verschillend soorten deeltjes
2-3: eenmaal in contact met een specifiek deeltje (selectie op: grote, chemische eigenschappen, ...) verandert de reactie op de gradiënt. De bacterie beweegt naar boven en sleept het deeltje mee.
4: in contact met het medium van de topplaat wordt het deeltje afgestoten en zal de bacterie terug naar onder bewegen.

For the BRIDGE protocol we have one main BioBrick , which is the construct required for the two-step markerless insertion, a composite construct of cat ( chloramphenicol resistance ) and sacB ( prevention of growth on sucrose ).
In addition, we submitted the up- and downstream sequences of an example of a useful gene to be removed from the E. coli genome using the BRIDGE protocol: tnaA, which produces indole, such that when it is removed E. coli no longer smells!

Breakdown of Cellulose
Project Overview
Introduction
Cellulose is a natural biopolymer used for a vast variety of biological purposes and it is most commonly found in plants, where it serves as the main structural component. Since plants are primary producers, many organisms of the Earth’s ecosystems have adapted accordingly Lynd LR, Weimer PJ, van Zyl WH, Pretorius IS. Microbial Cellulose Utilization: Fundamentals and Biotechnology. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews. 2002;66(3):506-77. . One of the key evolutionary features for the primary consumers was the development of the ability to degrade cellulose into glucose, which could then be used as a cellular fuel. A simple organism, able to efficiently do so, is the Cellulomonas fimi, which converts cellulose to glucose in a two-step process, with cellobiose as the intermediate Jung SK, Parisutham V, Jeong SH, Lee SK. Heterologous Expression of Plant Cell Wall Degrading Enzymes for Effective Production of Cellulosic Biofuels. Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology. 2012;2012. .
Breakdown of Cellulose to Cellobiose
Cellulose is a long polysaccharide consisting of β-1,4-linked
D
-glucose units and many organisms, including E. coli, lack the enzymes able to degrade these strong β-linkages. To overcome this, the C. fimi has developed two cellulases, namely the endo-β-1,4-glucanase and exo-β-1,4-glucanase, respectively encoded by the cenA and cex genes Jung SK, Parisutham V, Jeong SH, Lee SK. Heterologous Expression of Plant Cell Wall Degrading Enzymes for Effective Production of Cellulosic Biofuels. Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology. 2012;2012. . The endoglucanase is able to randomly degrade the amorphous structure of cellulose, thereby allowing the exoglucanase"
METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". There, we explained the ethics of                  science to students and they were all convinced about the limitations of scientists.
At the game stations of the workshop, the first station’s, matching memory cards’, the goal was to introduce lab safety,                  types of equipment and overall the things we can find in the lab. As the students matched the memory cards in teams, we explained                  what it was on the cards for them to gather more knowledge about the lab environment and safety. We remember, the students kept on                  saying that they wanted to be in the lab, wearing special suits, doing experiments in the future.
The second station, finding the pair to a DNA strand, aimed to teach the structure of DNA, base pairing and nucleotides.                  Of course, because they were primary school students, first we had their opinions on those letters. Just as we hoped to, they                  likened the DNA to a code like the ones used in computers, phones and so on, which was, however, composed of four letters. As we                  further explained the complementary strands and the double helix structure of DNA, they successfully matched the strands.
The last station, extracting DNA from a strawberry experiment was furthermore an interactive station. As we carried on, we                  helped the groups to perform the experiment and gave them information about the use of the materials specified in this experiment.
By the end of the day, the students had learned about the DNA, ethics of what we do, lab equipment, lab safety and they had seen                  a real DNA which was the most thrilling part for them. The message of science ethics was also conveyed with the interactive Q&A                  session. It was an opportunity for them to meet the DNA at an early age, broaden their imagination and knowledge about life sciences.
Adding the Subject of Synthetic Biology to Our Curriculum
We had a meeting with the department of biology in our high school and spoke about how we can integrate the subject of synbio                  in our lessons. We agreed with the teachers on the idea of talking about the subject on the last topic of the grade 10 curriculum,                  as it was the most suitable one being ""Biotechnology"". We believe that introducing this subject to our peers will attract more                  attention to this field, maybe even raise scientists in the future or lead to more iGEM teams being born. We have also discussed                  this with our school principal to carry this topic to the Ministry of Education Regional meeting and to share our ideas with other                  school principals. We convinced them about how synthetic biology and iGEM have the contribution on 21st-century skills and prepare                  youth to future jobs"

As our library is made of binding proteins possessing variable as well as constant regions we had to assemble them in a special manner. For the assembly of our library we had to anneal the fragments containing the variable regions that we ordered through oligonucleotide synthesis.
As for Monobodies we assembled the fragments called V1-1 and V1-2 to V1 and V2-1 and V2-2 to V2, and then again V1 and V2 to have the variable region essential for the construct. The correct size of the whole assembled construct was estimated by a gelelectrophoresis (figure 2) and then later sequenced . For the Monobody construct we deciced to set the design up in a way that one can exchange RFP for the fragment containing the variable (randomized) regions (Figure 1a, 1b). The size of the annealed V1 fragment is 114 bp, the size of V2 is 132 bp. These are the fragments inserted into our Monobody construct which can be used to build the library .This construct was submitted by us as BBa_K2082000 for the simple Monobody and as BBa_K"
TMMU-China,2017,Team:TMMU-China#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," This gives the best chance of getting single colonies, while allowing you to recover all transformants. Incubate plates at 37°C overnight.
8.Transformation of B. subtilis
Thaw competent cells rapidly by immersing frozen tubes in a 37 ℃ water bath. Immediately, add one volume of SpⅡEGTA to the thawed cells; mix gently. In a sterile test tube add competent cells to the DNA solution and incubate in a roller drum at 37℃. Dilute the transformed cells as appropriate in T Base containing 0.5% glucose and plate immediately onto selective media.
9. Transformation of Lactococcus lactis
(1) Preparation of competent L. lactis cells
To obtain competent cells, the cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 to 0.8 and then diluted 100-fold in SGM17 (M17GS containing 0.5 M sucrose) supplemented with glycine. After growth at 30 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2 to 0.4, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C at 5,000x g. Following two washes in ice-cold 0.5 M sucrose containing 10% glycerol, the cells were suspended in 1/100 culture volume of washing solution and then stored in aliquots at -85 °C until use.
(2) Transformation by electroporation
The cell suspensions were thawed on ice. Portions (40 μL) were mixed with 1 μL of DNA and then transferred to an ice-cooled electroporation cuvette (2-mm electrode gap) and exposed to a single electrical pulse. The pulse was delivered by a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad, Calif.) set at 25 μF and normally at 2.0 kV. The cuvette was connected in parallel to a 200-Ω resistor (pulse controller; Bio-Rad), resulting in time constants of 4.5 to 5ms.
(3) Incubation and plate
Immediately following the discharge, the suspensions were mixed with 0.96 ml of ice-cold SGM17MC (SGM17 containing 20 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM CaCl2) and left on ice for about 5 min. Appropriate dilutions were then made in SGM17MC, and the cells were incubated at 30°C for 2h. The plates M17GS"

Welcome to iGEM Göttingen
iGEM is an international competition hosted by the MIT in Boston, USA, for undergraduate students of disciplines related to molecular biology. iGEM stands for International Genetically Engineered Machine competition. One the one hand, it targets to combine aspects of education and social collaboration among undergraduate students, on the other hand, it provides a library for standardized and interchangeable parts which can be used in living systems, particularly in model organisms like E. coli. Student groups from all over the world will receive a requested kit of biological parts, also called ""biobricks"", and work over the summer on an individual research project. Every year, the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"" is upgraded with further biobricks by the participating iGEM teams. These biobricks will be accessible to the iGEM community in the following years in order to use these parts for their own projects.
The iGEM competition started in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already 165 universities from all over the"

Our project in 1 minute
We want to fight hospital infections, using a biological machine.
For this purpose we have constructed a recombinant E. coli, which produces the RIP peptide. RIP inhibits biofilm formation in the bacteria S. aureus.
This peptide will make it easier to fight infections and kill S. aureus with conventional antibiotics.

A. ferroxidans were left to grow overnight and Solution C (pH 2.35 and 2 w% iron, or ~10g/500 mL) was made.
Aug 2
The A. ferroxidans pellets were separated from its supernatant using a centrifuge. Solution D, an agar solution necessary for making the solid media, was made to have a concentration of 1%. The following experiments were set up twice in solid media (unless otherwise stated)--one dish for each experiment contained cells, and one dish did not:
One 5x5 cm copper piece, with cardstock placed on top of the solid media
Four 2x2 cm copper pieces with nail polish (one fully painted on both sides, one half painted on both sides, one half painted on one side, and one not painted) with cells on each copper for the petri dish containing cells
Four 2x2 cm in 15 mL of solid media with 15 mL of AFM on top
Solid media enclosing copper in liquid media in shaker
Aug 3
The agar concentration was found to be too low for the experiments set up on 8/2, as the solid media did not solidify overnight. The experiments were scrapped and restarted with solid media of a higher agar concentration (4%).
Aug 4
4% agar was a more successful alternative. The experiments listed above for August 2nd were set up once again.
August 5 - August 11
Observations were made of the experiments set up the past week. Firmer solid media, greater % of agar in solution, may have also contributed to the reduced oxidation we saw in the copper pieces. The bacteria in most of our setups were also consistently etching more copper in the same period of time compared to the dishes that did not contain bacteria.
Aug 5
The copper pieces were massed and more experiments were set up.
Aug 7
Observations were taken of the flasks filled with liquid media containing the copper piece in a solid media ""shell.""  The solution in flasks containing no bacteria appeared unchanged. Copper in solid media in these flasks appeared darker compared to Day 1.  In the flasks containing bacteria, the solutions turned a deep amber color. The solid media was still intact. The flask labelled Bac 1 developed a yellow residue and its solution was more opaque than flasks Bac 2 and 3. The yellow residue also seemed to be coating solid media.

The copper pieces in the flasks were massed"

In collaboration of IGEM oxford Team we managed to do a toxicity assay of Curldan as we want to use it in vineyards.  Our lab does not have the required material to do so and this would help complete our project. So we sent them a sample of our produced Curdlan so they could do tests on it.
They decided to test curdlan toxicity on two Bacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Pseudomonas putida. They choose these bacteria because these two species are very common in the environment  so  they believe these bacteria represent a good marker for an eventual environmental toxicity.
Methods and Materials
Single colonies of wild-type Rhodobacter sphaeroides WS8N and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 were grown in SUX media and Lysogeny Broth respectively overnight to stationary  phase at 30°C with orbital shaking at 225 rpm. 1% w/v curdlan in NaOH was made by adding 0.1g of solid curdlan to 10mL of 0.5M NaOH  and warming the mixture at 55°C with regular vigorous shaking for 15 minutes to achieve complete dissolution. 100µL of stationary culture was added to 100µL of curdlan-NaOH or NaOH in the wells of a Corning 96-well flat bottom plate, and each condition was repeated in six-plicate. The plate was incubated at 30°C in a FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader with 200 rpm shaking in between reads, and OD600 was monitored every 15 minutes. The data obtained from each six-plicate was averaged, and error bars were constructed using the standard deviations at each time point.
Conclusions
- 1% curdlan does not appear to present any additional toxicity over the 0.5M NaOH solvent.
- Curdlan seems to be not toxic for our markers.
Perspectives
This assay is a good news for us but we have to go deeper into our safety tests. A good way to do that is to test the toxicity of our curdlan on"

Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Because our PCR didn't work on the boiled lyophilized cells we used CASO Medium for cultivation of S. griseus and S. lavendulae.
Team Immobilization:
Unfortunately, the activity test results weren’t promising. According to publications, immobilization via covalent binding is the most widely used method. Silica dioxide bead offer only an adsorption of laccases. Therefore, we decided to order CPC-(controlled pore carrier) silica beads, to which laccases covalently bind, especially that we found some papers with protocols and activity tests proving their efficiency.

Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
The cultured S. griseus and S. lavendulae bacterials has been centrifuged at 13.000 rpm for 5 minutes. After this step we ribolyzed the pellet in 1 ml TE-Puffer and set a PCR reaction after. But we still haven't had any results.
Colony PCRs on the transformations with plasmid with bpul(T7)_His and plating positive colonies.
Team Database:
In the last wekk we finished the tabels Eppi, User, Sequencing and BioBrick.
We have a problem with the search function, we use the false SQL statement and allready deleted entries are shown.
In the next week we have to write a new statement.

NCTU iGEM Conference
Three of our members joined the International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference at National Chiao Tung University from July 19th to 23rd 2015. As a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, it was an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology. And we received questions and precious suggestions from other participants after presentation and poster time, which turned out to better improve our project design :
Will L. casei secret too many CPP-PYY complexes and cause people unwilling to eat for a long term of time, which might cause malnutrition?
Will your product affect the sensitivity of hypothalamus to PYY? And is there a safety maximum concentration of PYY in blood?
How do you measure the concentration of PYY in blood?
How long will your product stay in human body?
When should people take the capsule? Before or after meal? And how many times should people take the capsule a day?
How do you measure the concentration of PYY in blood?
Can gastrointestinal tract digest CPP-PYY complex before it gets through intestinal membrane?
Question from TCU: Why not use a patch instead?
Suggestion from ZJU-China:
(1) We suggest you change the suicide mechanism, because there’s only one promoter before the gene circuit of CPP-PYY and CI. This might cause L. casei die before it works.
(2) Will holin and endolysin in the suicide mechanism harm other cells? Why not change suicide mechanism into quorum sensing?
What is your product’s positioning? Is it used as food or as medicine?
As we know, L. casei is prokaryote. Can your CPP-PYY complex fold correctly through L. casei?
Will patients be hungrier after they stop taking capsule?
Will immune response arouse by CPP-PYY complex?
Is there any chance that plasmid transfer to other cells and affect the colony in intestine?
Is pLP825 too small for the three parts of genes to fit in?
We know that"

SmoColi-Data page
SmoColi cells are engineered to sense toxic substances found in cigarette smoke. They are immobilized in a microfluidic channel, in which a concentration gradient of the toxic substance is established. The sensor is linked to a band-pass filter that leads to input-concentration-dependent GFP expression. Continuous increase of the input concentration and its detection, therefore, establishes a moving fluorescent band in the channel. Finally, if the input concentration exceeds a certain threshold, cells produce RFP and the device turns red.
