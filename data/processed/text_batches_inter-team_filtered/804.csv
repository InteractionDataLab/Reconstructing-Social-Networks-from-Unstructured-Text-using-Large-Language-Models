iGEM 2014Weekly newsletter
Newsletter n°4
from Sept 1st to Sept 15th 2014
Hi, all the iGEMers.
Last time when I wrote on this page of the newsletter, it was our first issue. Now, the summer is coming to the end and this is our fourth issue of the newsletter, also our last regular issue. Afterwards, we will replace it by special issues and review sessions, as i mentioned before. A couple schools have asked me about the timeline. I understand that school is starting and life is getting crazy. The student review of the judge question would be done by October and the peer review session would be in the first or second week of October. I will send out one more email with details and the rubrics in the coming three days.
I can’t thank you enough for being part of this community. I hope this newsletter has been and will continue to be a valuable resource for your team. In the process, we started with 8 teams and have had over 25 different teams from all over the world involved.
Again, thank you so much for all the cooperation. One thing I would like to emphasize and encourage you to do is to reach out to other teams on your own, ask for advise, talk about ideas, or just have a casual conversation. One thing I personally love about synthetic biology is how young, ambitious and creative everyone is.
Good luck with the rest of your project and journey to Boston! Watch out for the emails about the following special issues and let us know if you have specific things you would like to read or learn about!

UCLA,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Customizing Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," the frequency of producing a full-length sequence that we intend to build. This is achieved by adding capping oligos that ligate to a chain where a previous monomer piece fail to attach. Any incomplete or incorrect sequence due to unsuccessful ligations would be blocked from further extending, and thus monomers that are added later would ligate to the right sequences at a higher frequency.
Once the full gene sequence has been generated, the terminator oligo containing the biobrick suffix is added to complete the assembly.  The gene can then be released from the streptavidin beads by heating and disrupting the Streptavidin biotin interaction [5] .
ICA is a proficient technique to standardize assembly of any custom gene sequence. Not only does it provide flexibility in producing custom gene sequence, it is also compatible with the iGEM biobrick system. The initiator contains the prefix sequence of a biobrick and the terminator contains the suffix sequence. These contain primer sites allow PCR amplification of the full-length constructs after the release from the beads. In addition, restriction sites within the initiator and terminator enable the insertion of the complete, assembled product into a biobrick backbone easily using Golden-Gate cloning.
What We've Done
Over the course of the summer, we modified the nucleotide sequence of MaSp1 and MaSp2 so that it is both compatible with the iGEM standards as well as with our ICA assembly scheme.  We generated these sequences by ordering single stranded oligos and doing multiple rounds of pcr to assemble the full construct.  These sequences contain the biobrick prefix and suffix as well as the required Bsa1 restriction sites for the ICA/Golden Gate reaction.    Furthermore, we designed and assembled the other nucleotide sequences necessary for ICA from primers that we ordered. These sequences include the biotinylated initiator oligo, the ICA terminator oligo, as well as the capping oligos (see above for description of each).
We ran some trial runs of ICA by trying to assemble only a few monomers together.  We only were able to run a few trials, and unfortunately, were not able to create the full silk construct.  We were able to ligate the initiator oligo to the terminator oligo, showing that the initiator oligo was successfully conjugating to the streptavidin beads and that the ligation reaction reaction worked.  Hopefully with some optimizations and troubleshooting, we can use this protocol to assemble a full length silk construct in the near future.

Figure 9b. Prototype for Continuous Time Model
SIRV model for the interaction between bacteria and phage populations. As susceptible bacteria replicate and grow, they reach the threshold (the peak observed) for mass action, where the probability of phage infection increases greatly, at which point most susceptible bacteria become infected, causing a drastic increase in the population of infected bacteria. Then, as infected bacteria are lysed, their decrease is accompanied by a surge in the phage population, which reaches 2.0e9 about six hours after inoculation. As with the previous model, although the number of susceptible bacteria decreases greatly, their population is never truly zero due to the constant influx and intrinsic rate of natural increase. At any given moment, however, the entry of susceptible bacteria into the system is followed immediately by the infection of these bacteria by phages. Therefore, the number of phages continues to increase gradually, and the total number of dead bacteria also gradually increases.
Bacteria that have grown resistance to phage infection are not affected with the concentration of phages. Their growth resembles the natural bacteria lifecycle with a log phase (20-25 hrs after inoculation) following a lag phase (0-20 hrs after inoculation). Without a limiting factor (figure 9a), the log phase will continue indefinitely, as the figure on the left shows. With a limiting factor (figure 9b), the population will reach their carrying capacity, and the curve levels off into a stationary phase, as the figure on the right shows. Additional resistant bacteria may also be introduced to the system through mutation of the susceptible population.
Discussion:
This model explains the fact that bacteria and phages may co-exist in the natural environment—over time, some individuals of a bacteria population undergo genetic mutation and become resistant to phage infection. These individuals are subsequently selected for, and the bacteria population evolves. The “disappearance” of susceptible bacteria can be partly explained by evolution, and partly by our assumption that phage infection is instantaneous. A better way to construct the model would have been to use a system of delayed differential equations (DDE), but that is beyond our current ability.
The model suggests that the evolution of the bacterial population may pose a problem to the implementation of our system. If we use the same strain of bacteria and their corresponding phages over long periods of time, the entire population may grow resistance to the phage, meaning that our engineered phages will no longer be able to reproduce and our system no longer functional. To correct this problem, we may need to introduce another strain of bacteria that is vulnerable"

The core of all speech recognition systems consists of a set                 of statistical models representing the various sounds of the language to                 be recognised. Since speech has temporal structure and can be encoded                 as a sequence of spectral vectors spanning the audio frequency range,                 the hidden Markov model (HMM) provides a natural framework for                 constructing such models.
Basically, the input audio waveform from                 a microphone is converted into a sequence of fixed size acoustic vectors Y[1:T] = y1, . . . ,yT in a process called feature extraction. The decoder                 then attempts to find the sequence of words w'[1:L] = w1,...,wL which                 is most likely to have generated Y , i.e. the decoder tries to find.
w' = argmax{P(w|Y)} for all the words w considered
operating this (Bayes rule) the likelihood p(Y|w) is determined by the                  acoustic model and the prior P(w) is determined by the language model.
Language model
Language model refers to the grammar on which the recognizer will work and specify the phrases that it will be able to identify.
In Julius, recognition grammar is composed by two separate files:
- .voca: List of words that the grammar contains.
- .grammar: specifies the grammar of the language to be recognised.
Both files must be converted to .dfa and to .dict using the grammar compilator ""mkdfa.pl"" The .dfa file generated represents a finite automat. The .dict archive contains the dictionary of words in Julius format.
Once the acoustic language and the language model have been defined, all we need is the implementation of the main program in Python.
Arduino
The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.
The Uno differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the Atmega16U2 (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.
Revision 2 of the Uno board has a resistor pulling the 8U2 HWB line to ground, making it easier"

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," simulate the concentration of plasmids losing on different levels. Three kinds of plasmids, pSB1k3 (100~200 copies), pSB3k3 (20~30 copies), pSB4k5 (5~10 copies), are chosen and constructed with target fragment. By observing our system's working conditions, we can finally prove its function of controlling plasmids number.
Goal
(1) Simulate the plasmids losing on different levels
(2) Prove that our system is functional
Part Design
The gene circuits are shown in Fig.6.
Fig.6 The gene circuits of threshold device with constitutive promoter.
(1) We constructed the circuit on different plasmids with different copy numbers.
(2) The locus of constitutive promoter will be replaced by another constitutive promoter which has the similar strength as PBAD promoter.
We assume that:
When the number of plasmids is less than N, inhibitor is not strong enough to inhibit the in-promoter totally, so the killer gene will express triggering the death of bacteria. On the contrary, if the number of plasmids is higher than N, the bacteria won't die.
We expect that in the high copy number plasmid circuit, fluorescence gene will express, and in the low copy number plasmid circuit, there will no fluorescence.
Forth step
The threshold of plasmid number is decided by the relationship between inhibitor and in-promoter. To achievement the goal of build a controllable system, we decide to use different RBS (B0034 B0032) and promoters (J23119 J23116 J23109) with different strengths to change their concentrations. Thus we can finally change the threshold of plasmid as we hope.
Goal
(1) Adjust the threshold of plasmids by substituting different biobricks.
Part Design
The gene circuits are shown in Fig.7.
Fig.7 The gene circuits of threshold device constructed on a different plasmids with different copy numbers.
(1) Simulate the plasmids losing on different levels.
(2) The locus of B0034 and J23119 will be replaced by B0032 and J23109 J23116.
Killer device
As an executor for killing the cell labeled as slackers, killer device should include the detecting part like in-promoter interacting with inhibitor protein as well as the killing part like toxin gene mazF and hokD.
Ways of self-killing:
1) toxic protein
2) sgRNA targeting genome of strains with no NHEJ"
Brasil-SP,2014,Team:Brasil-SP#Results#Sporulation_-_-_TEXT.html," is: exposing our cells to a stressful medium will lead them all to form spores? Certainly no. Sporulation is the ultimate bacteria's decision. And when they finally decide to do it, there are always some of them who betray the movement.
     Many of other strategies are tried before sporulation. These include secretion of antibiotics and other chemical weapons to kill other microbes that are in the same niche, the activation of cellular motility by flagella to search for new sources of nutrients and the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes to remove extracellular polysaccharides and proteins. Furthermore, before sporulation starts the cells check chromosome integrity and the state of chromosomal replication, so if the process begins the bacterium is sure that it will be finished.9
     Once situation is extreme, cells must choose between three ways: sporulation, competence or cannibalism. Most cells make the commitment to sporulation. However, the genetic material released by cell lysis isn’t wasted by the colony. Some cells opt for a different state of competence, triggered by ComK exceeding a certain threshold level. If a cell chooses this way, it can uptake exogenous DNA resulting from lysis and uses it to repair his own DNA or sometimes new genetic information. In the case of Bacillus subtilis approximately 10% of cells choose this path and after approximately twenty hours they switch back to the vegetative state. On the other hand, it has been showed that some bacteria further along sporulation to produce and secrete antibacterial factors that block sibling cells from sporulating. This makes them to lysis. Such cannibalistic cells feed on the nutrients released by the lysed cells. So, in the end, they prevent their own progression toward sporulation by satiating their feeding needs.9
     But it's even more important to understand how spore's germination occurs. In our device, we provide nutrients to the bacteria. These nutrients act as germinants. The spores can recognize them as receptor proteins encoded by the gerA family of operons, which includes gerA, gerB and gerK. We can induce germination providing alanine (Ala) or a mixture of asparagine (Asn), glucose, fructose and potassium ions (AGFK) for example. The first one activate the alanine receptor GerA and the second, the asparagine receptor GerB. The interaction between nutrient germinants and receptors triggers the replace of spore core's huge depot of dipicolinic acid and cations by water. This effect triggers the hydrolysis of the"

WashU
Out of 244 participants between 10 to 22.10.2010, 57% of the      participant had scientific degrees from B.Sc to Professor and 18%      had graduate degrees. 18% of participants are enrolled in their      teams as either Instructors or Advisors.
95 teams have responded to the survey while we are still waiting      to hear from 33 teams. 74% teams participated with one or more members      to the survey.
75% of participants were interested with synthetic biology field      for academic purposes.
Browsing the Registry of Standard Parts
56% of participants think that it is not easy to search      for the parts in Registry of Standard Parts. Many comments      indicate a need for a better search engine and more flexible keyword      search options, especially excepting aliases. Also many are longing      for recognizable parts names, which will ease searching with keyword.
Partnership with Google and enforcing standardized parts names     are suggested
As a global organization iGEM can offer the Parts Registry in     different languages and more illustrations describing how the system     works.

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#DailyNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". putida genome overlaps. We plasmid prepared new dCas9 to use as a template for PCR. New and old dCas9 templates were used for PCR Rescue of the third genome overlap. See the schematic here for more information.
Plates show only two colonies, one each from ""slow"" GFP and ""slow insertion time"" GFP. These colonies sampled, grown in cultures.
Wednesday, June 18, 2014
Digested the HMF pathway with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF restriction enzymes. All PCR's of the third genome overlap containing dCas9 failed, and we realized we must complete the first plasmid by inserting dCas9 and use that as a template instead of the original dCas9 plasmid. This points the failure of the ligation to either the dCas9 PCR's or the ligase buffer has expired. We made new aliquots of fresh ligase buffer to test whether this was the case. We have run out of ClaI and cannot digest dCas9 until this arrives. Our strategy now is to Gibson assembly the Lambda Red Recombinase system and dCas9, then PCR Rescue and ligate into plasmid 1 using XhoI/SalI-HF and XbaI to mitigate the lack of ClaI.
Plasmid prep on cultures from colonies that grew after transformation. New hypothesis develope: perhaps the higher expression GFPs killed the cells due to their extremely rapid translation elongation, leaving only the less efficiently translated GFP carrying cells to live. Online check using website Genscript and their free gene analysis tool shows that the common GFP scores a perfect 1.0 and the rare GFP a perfect 0.0 on their scale (from 0 being not optimized at all to 1 being perfectly optimized). This reveals that the algorithm used by Genscript corresponds directly to the codon usage profile for E.coli over the entire genome.
Thursday, June 19, 2014
Conducted 2-part Gibson CBA to assemble the Lambda Red Recombinase system and the dCas9 system.
Many more RBS library calculations run, some using a method where the Shine Dalgarno (SD) sequence is mutated, but not the rest of the initial condition. Hopefully this will speed up the calculations and finally yield some high TIR libraries that evenly span the range we are looking for. Another overnight culture of slow GFP/slow insertion time GFP cells innoculated.

Interviews with Experts
Our team didn’t possess all the skills and knowledge we needed.  While we gained lots of knowledge from reading, we decided to interview some experts on different areas of our project. We hoped by these interviews to get a critical evaluation of our project and to gain insight into areas we might have overlooked. We chose to interview experts in several fields related to our project.  We interviewed an expert on bacteriophages to discuss the types of phage we could use to attack Xylella fastidiosa;  an informatician to talk about the dry lab;  and the national specialist of Xyllela fastidiosa to talk about the relevance of our project.
Mireille ANSALDI
As our project grew, we had more and more questions about our bacteriophage approach.  We wanted initially to use Xylella fastidiosa ’s natural phages,  but we met some difficulties.  We went to see Ms ANSALDI, who directs the “phage cycle and bacteria metabolism” research group in the LCB in Marseille.  As an expert in the field, she is an obvious choice to seek advice.  She generously granted us time for an interview.
Thanks to our discussion, we learned that X. fastidiosa certainly has some resistance mechanism, such as CRISPR and restriction enzymes.  She also told us that we could work on Xanthomonas campestris instead of X. fastidiosa since the bacteria and their phages are very similar.  Furthermore, working on X. fastidiosa is only allowed special P2 labs, whereas Xanthomonas can be used in P1 labs. So we will use X.campestris instead, for more safety.
Finally, she also suggested for us to look at prophages.  Unfortunately for lack of information about specific X. fastidiosa prophages and how to induce their toxicity, we left this approach aside.  This interview helped us focus our project on phage-like particles . Thanks to her, we changed our mind about what we wanted to do and concentrated on combining phage specificity with efficient toxins.
Jacques VAN HELDEN
We initially contacted Jacques van Helden to help us with how to design a strong X. fastidiosa promoter sequence and strong RBS, for our biobrick BBa_K2255004 .

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today ampicillin plates will be made in order to have them available for protein expression.  In addition, the PCquad optimized will be designed in order to be expressed using PSB1C3 in E. coli DE3.
A schematic of the construct is the following:
Prefix-T7 promoter-lac operator-RBS-NdeI-gene-XhoI-histag-stop-suffix
The file made on benchling was named “PCquad Optimized for iGEM 3.0.”
The T7 promoter was taken from the pET22b vector file.  A C-terminal histag and stop were created. From the iGEM website, the master RBS sequence was found to be the following.
Master RBS:  TCTAGAG-AAAGANNNGANNN-ACTAG-ATG(start) The sequence from http://parts.igem.org/cgi/partsdb/puttext.cgi was used.
Notes on making agar plates:
LB media Component Amount per liter
Tryptone  10 g Yeast extract   5 g NaCl  10 g
For preparation of 1 liter of LB medium, add 10 g NaCl, 10 g tryptone, and 5 g yeast extract to 950 ml distilled or deionized water, and shake or stir until dissolved. Adjust the pH to 7.0 with 5 M NaOH. Adjust the volume of the solution to 1 liter with distilled or deionized water. Decant into smaller aliquots and sterilize by autoclaving (see Sterilizing media).
Tip: It is advisable to autoclave liquid medium in several small bottles rather than in one large vessel to avoid possible contamination of an entire batch. After autoclaving, do not use medium for 24 hours to ensure that it is properly sterilized and free of contaminating microorganisms.
Tip: Antibiotics should be added to liquid medium immediately prior to use from stock antibiotic solutions that have been"

Student members
All student team members performed outstanding work and showed interest and dedication to the project. As we are a rather small team, we did not have a strict division of roles and many times we worked all together to accomplish certain parts of our project.
Inspiration
Our project was inspired by the works of iGEM Peking 2015 and iGEM UiOslo_Norway 2016 .   Our decision to detect vulvovaginal Candida albicans stemmed from the public lack of knowledge concerning the subject, and increasing antimycotic resistance.
Background
At the University of Oslo, iGEM is offered as a two-semester course (course code: MBV4910IGEM ) and is evaluated on a pass or fail basis. There are no supporting course materials, for this course as the course consists of a student-driven interdisciplinary project in synthetic biology. The course starts in March and finishes in October after the Giant Jamboree. We started brainstorming in the beginning of March and had a clear project idea at the end of March. In April, we started planning the lab work and experiments. In late June we received all components we had ordered; thus we were able to start working in the lab.
On this page, we would like to thank everyone who believed in our project and help us in the execution. We could not have come this far without the contribution of the people and companies listed below.

Expressing heterologous genes in yeast isn't a problem but generating enough MAAs to have photoprotective effects            remains to be seen. Can the yeast cell catabolise MAAs? Are MAAs toxic to yeast? If so then it may be difficult to produce enough           for what you desire. You'll have to do these experiments to find out
Whether the additional exposure to sunlight have the same effect in yeast as in Cyanobacteria in terms of increasing concentration of MAA? In your opinion, what can be done to increase the yield of MAAs in yeast?
Additional exposure to sunlight will only induce MAAs biosynthesis in yeast if you engineer         their expression to be controlled by light inducible promoters (which would be pointless).         You may as well engineer yeast to constitutively express the genes.
Would you please suggest anything to increase the yield of porphyra-334 compared to shinorine? Do you think whether the change in serine/threonine proportion would have an effect on the ratio porphyra-334/shinorine?
MAAs stem from amino acid bio-synthetic pathways which are usually negatively regulated         by their end product. You could try altering these pathways but it may have detrimental effects         on the host organism.
How do you think, is the combination of Shinorine and Porphyra-334 reasonable for sunscreens?
If you can demonstrate they absorb across UV-A/B then I think it is sufficient proof of principle.

Do you think that production of yeast extract enriched with MAA would be a valuable combination?
The biosynthetic production of yeast would be extremely valuable,         especially if the yield of MAA can be increase. Extraction from seaweed         is the most viable option currently but the yields are relatively low and         this is a restriction on the widespread development of MAA.
Whether the additional exposure to sunlight have the same effect in yeast as in Cyanobacteria in terms of increasing concentration of MAA? In your opinion, what can be done to increase the yield of MAAs in yeast?
Again I am not sure the answer to this. As a guess it will depend on the pathways        regulating the synthesis and if they are linked to environmental stress. in cyanobacteria        it is not only UV radiation that induces MAA synthesis - other stressors also increase       the yield so perhaps one of these will work in yeast if UV doesn’t"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," program funded by the NSF whose stated purpose is “to build the capacity of the field to use public engagement with science (PES) activities to extend STEM learning about science, technology, and societal implications through public and scientist dialogue about synthetic biology.” The kit contained instructions and materials for a variety of activities. Of these, we decided to run a “See DNA” event and hold a “Should We Engineer the Mosquito?” forum.
Society of Women Engineers
Our “See DNA” event engaged a group of approximately 25 girls, aged 12-14, participating in a summer program held by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). To start, we delivered a presentation about a variety of subjects related to genetics. In the remaining time, we guided the students through the isolation of visibly clumped wheat germ DNA. The most interested participants asked many unexpected questions throughout the activity, such as what we thought about GMO food and whether they could safely eat the wheat germ DNA.
Sam, Jordan, Sara, and Paul at the SWE outreach event.
Everyone displayed visible excitement when we used phrases such as “gamma radiation” and “you might die if you eat enough protease” in our answers. We concluded that in order to keep the public’s attention, it is a good idea to pause for questions frequently and to highlight the most exciting parts of the topic being presented. Overall, we provided the participants with a chance to learn about an engineering field they hadn’t encountered during their program, as well as an opportunity to experience molecular biology firsthand.
Center for Talent Development
Our “Should We Engineer the Mosquito?” forum was presented to a group of eight high school students taking an Introduction to Genetics course at Northwestern’s Center for Talent Development (CTD). First, we played a video explaining gene drives, CRISPR, and how CRISPR can be used to make an effective gene drive. We then asked the students to split into two groups, and they clearly split into a quiet group of friends and a boisterous group of friends. Both groups excitedly worked through the material, clearly demonstrating that they understood the video and found the subject matter intriguing. We asked them to fill out the Building with Biology standard exit survey, and while reviewing their submissions, we learned that the students enjoyed having a chance to debate the ethics of genetic engineering. Until our forum, their class had focused entirely on technical material. We also concluded that the Building with Biology standard survey did not exactly fit our needs, and resolved to develop our own survey going forward.
Within the week, we gave the same class a tour of two labs belonging to our advisors"

Background
As the background we described, to solve the problem that cockroaches’ flooding in home environment, we use the transformant of Metarhizium anisopliae to achieve the effect of killing the cockroaches. In order to ensure the lethal effect of Metarhizium anisopliae , we improved in three ways: adhesion, penetration, and immune-avoidance.
Which chassis to choose and why?
The biological chassis we chose was Metarhizium anisopliae. This is an entomogenous fungus that infects more than 200 species of insects, most of which are pests includes cockroaches[1]. Its infection process is divided into the following steps: spore attachment -- penetration through the body wall -- colonization in vivo -- killing the host -- re-sporulation. It is a natural insecticide, and by genetically-enhancing it, we can make better use of it.
How to achieve?
We designed a system to improve Metarhizium anisopliae from three aspects: HsbA, Bbchit and MCL1.
HsbA: The HsbA from Beauveria bassiana encodes a kind of membrane surface hydrophobic protein which helps spores adhere to the waxy surface of cockroaches[2]. Then it will be followed as spores' germination, germinal tube, appressorium, and next is penetration.
Bbchit: Cockroaches’ body wall is composed of protein, chitin, and lipids. Bbchit ,which comes from Beauveria bassiana,encodes chinase[3]. It can decompose chitin"

CPU BioX Club Academic Association
In the joint efforts of all CPU_CHINA iGEMers, we established the first life science academic association in China Pharmaceutical University---- CPU BioX Club (Figure 1). The daily activities of CPU BioX Club include:
Figure 1. The speech meeting for establishing the club
1. Journal Club
It is held mainly by students in CPU BioX Club. We invite a reporter to make the presentation of the latest discoveries every week. The reporter will introduce the new discovery of medicine, synthetic biology and so forth. Our team members have absorbed a lot of knowledge, which widens our horizons and provides us with novel ideas (Figure 2).
Figure 2. The journal club
2. Academic debate contest
We encourage all students to participate in the debate contest. In the debate contest, we argued about some scientific problems such as whether tumorigenesis was determined by congenital genes. After a series of debate contests, all of team members have developed a critical thinking and judged scientific problems more dialectic (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Students in the debate contest
3. Thematic academic reports
According to the content which students were interested in, we invited professors of the relevant research areas to come to have the academic reports on their research areas to explain for the students’ questions (figure 4).

For the most important part, he recommended that we should add a function of metabolites comparison. Based on his research experiences, he was always troubled by changing from one software to another to finding interested molecules from network. And there are always problems of format conversion between different tools. We took his advice, and took a step further. At the end, we completed a toolkit including network visualization, network alignment, SMILES comparison and DNA editing.

While the designs were met with enthusiasm, there was one major problem that we hadn't considered, which was rules between devices. For example, when certain devices are in a particular system, other devices/promoters are turned off. Overall, this gave us a lot of things to think about for next week, when we iterate on our design and start development.
Week 5: June 24-28
Monday:
Today, we took into account all of the suggestions from last week and refined our design. We then started planning our user interface so that we could start development the next day. We identified the major technological challenges, which trimmed down our design even more as we started to look at what we could realistically design. We settled on a web application, which also means that we have to start learning HTML/CSS as well as JQuery to create the user interface. Tomorrow, we actually start coding, so I'm excited for that!
Tuesday:
Today, we attacked one of the major programming problems we knew we would face when we put together our design, which was drag and drop. By breaking down our design into smaller pieces, we'll be able to divide and conquer and to make what is initially a daunting project into something more manageable. We managed to get the drag and drop function working today with pieces snapping together,  but currently just with arbitrary parts. Tomorrow, we'll focus on creating a delete function and adding functionality to our drag and drop.
Wednesday:
Today, we improved the functionality of the drag and drop feature and added a delete function. We also started on a mock up of our web layout and created a simple layout with tabs and a search box. It was a lot of learning about HTML/CSS, but it was a good experience to learn about basic web development!
Thursday:
Today, we continued to refine our mock up and make it presentable enough to show the premise of our user interface and how it would work. Additionally, we continued working on our drag and drop feature and adding more functionality. Today, we also created a video of our paper prototype clearly outlining each step of our project, and this was helpful to not only inform people of the details of our project, but also gave us some clarity as to what we needed to clarify in our design.
Friday:
Today, we took a day off and visited the Museum of Fine Arts with the BU team, which was an enjoyable break to socialize with another iGEM team and to take a break from our programming"

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Rutgers,2011,Team:Rutgers#Etch a Sketch_-_-_TEXT.html," photon with a wavelength near 470 nm. The absorption of the photon leads to the formation of a covalent bond between a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor and a conserved cysteine residue. This new bond distorts the conformation of the protein, causing the detachment and unfolding of the Jα-helix (see figure X). In natural AsLOV2, the unfolding of the Jα-helix results in further downstream signalling. However, we will be most interested in the fact that the Jα-helix detaches when LOV2 is hit by blue light.
Figure X. (Need a figure legend)
DNA Binding
The DNA binding domain of LovTAP is the well-known bacterial transcription factor trpR. In the presence of tryptophan, the trpR protein will repress transcription of the E. coli trp operon by binding the operator region in the trp promoter and, thus, blocking RNA polymerase.
Figure Y. (Need figure legend)
LovTAP
Overview
The two seemingly unrelated parts described above share one crucial feature: an alpha helix. LOV2 binds and unbinds an alpha-helix in response to light, and one domain in the functional trpR structure is “bound” to an alpha-helix. Strickland et al.’s idea was to force them to “fight over” a single alpha helix. Thus, since LOV2 has a higher affinity for the helix in the dark than trpR, there is no trpR activity in the dark. However, when exposed to light, LOV2 releases the alpha helix, allowing trpR to bind it and, thus, result in trpR activity (which of course is repression of the trp promoter).
Details
Thirteen successive amino terminal truncations of trpR were ligated, in frame, downstream of the region coding for the Jα-helix in AsLOV2. One construct, referred to as LovTAP (the LOV- and tryptophan-activated protein), showed increased binding affinity to trp operator DNA when illuminated. Further tests showed that, upon light exposure, LovTAP binds DNA in a manner that is characteristic of the trpR domain. Additionally, mutation of the conserved cysteine of the LOV2 domain, which should prevent the conformational change that releases the Jα-helix, was shown to abolish binding to DNA in the"

Due to the contaminated EB found yesterday, our EB supplies were checked to ensure no further delays. To begin, the Gibson hph was submitted for sequencing, and pAK13AD and pC13Z were miniprepped. A PCR of pC13Z, pC13F, pCP13X, pC13M, and pC13E was then run with primers 31 and 32, the standard pSB1C3 primers.  A gel was run to check the PCRs. All the PCRs looked successful except pC13M and pC13E, which had nonspecific bands around 1kb.  A new technique was used on a few of the digests involving a restriction cocktail of enzymes to cut the DNA. Plasmid pAK13AD was digested with EcoRI, SpeI, SacI, and ClaI so that it could be placed in pSB1C3. We used SpeI instead of PstI due to the small distance between the PstI and the SacI cut sites.  Plasmid pC13F was digested with EcoRI, SpeI, and KpnI so pAK13AD could be placed in it.  Plasmid pAK13D was digested with SpeI and PstI so crtI and crtB could be placed in it.  All the digests were then column purified rather than gel purified--a move which has improved our ligation efficiencies. The purifications were quantified.  Cultures were made for pC13P and pC13K and, finally, pAK13AD was dephosphorylated then ligated into pC13F in order to make pC13AH.
Gibson hph was submitted for sequencing, and ALL of the cloning was performed.

Our results - dCas9
For the dCas9-project we designed a high copy and a low copy plasmid, which should be transformed together in E.coli to do metabolic channelling. We finished our high copy plasmid, so the plasmid with the target sequences for our signal guide RNAs. The plasmid is shown in the figure below:
Figure1: Finished high-copy plasmid
Our low copy plasmid includes the fusion of the LacI-repressor with dCas9, our enzymes IAAM and IAAH fused with the RNA-binding proteins MS2 and PP7, respectively and the sgRNAs. We finished the pre-plasmids, LacI-dCas9 in pExA2 shown in Figure 2 and IAAM-MS2-IAAH-PP7 (IAA-fusion) in pSB4A5 shown in Figure 3. We had very big problems with the assembly of the IAA-fusions which cost us six and a half weeks. The next steps to first clone the LacI-dCas9 also in the pSB4A5 with the IAA-fusions and second clone the sgRNA cassettes as last step in this vector, too, couldn’t be finished.

Modeling
„Any modeling project should be tempered by the morality of laziness.“ (Barnes et al., 2010)
Short Summary
This phrase illustrates that lab results can be predicted before actually working in the lab, saving precious time.
Our project revolves around new discovered or theoretical biological systems like for example RNAi in prokaryotes or newly discovered copper transporters. Our project required four different modeling approaches:
toxicity modeling
siRNA modeling
ferritin structure modeling
Toxicity modeling
The toxicity of copper ions on the cell is well characterized (Ning et al., 2015) but for important parts of this project like the crossflow reactor we needed to know the exact point of time when our cells will die to achieve highest possible yields of copper.
The residence time should not exceed the rate of dying and cell lysis in the system . If cell lysis kicks in copper gets released back again into the substrate media and the yield minimizes. The modeling started with the copper uptake in our cells containing the BioBrick BBa_K2638204, which expresses oprC under pAra​BAD ( BBa_I0500) ) control and induction at 1.0 % arabinose in. The toxicity is calculated for a single cell.
The first step was to calculate the rate of expression of oprC. Therefore the characterization of BBa_I0500) of Groningen was used to calculate the expression speed.

IIT_Delhi,2016,Team:IIT Delhi#Workshop_-_-_TEXT.html," consultation regarding drug synthesis (production of opiods).
Our last year’s project, which involved a meeting with the Delhi Govt., has been turned into a full-fledged collaboration and startup. Its components and prototype were patented as well.
We organised a Skype video conference between the iGEM teams of IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur, IISc Bangalore and ourselves. This pan-Indian iGEM meet involved 15-20 minutes presentation by all the teams. This was followed by a Q&A session which proved to be extremely fruitful for all the participating teams.
iGEM IIT Delhi conducted seminars and workshops on synthetic biology in IIT Delhi and various schools of South Delhi. These workshops were aimed at informally introducing the students to this field. ‘Just like you join together Lego blocks to create structures, you can join together genes to create new biological systems’ was the main theme behind most of our workshops as they were meant for people with very limited knowledge of this upcoming field.
We also presented our past and current projects at the various festivals of IIT Delhi such as Tryst. Tryst, IITD’s technical fest, is one of the largest and most successful technical festivals across India. It seeks to bring together the world’s leading scientific minds and budding enthusiasts and witnesses an annual footfall of over 40,000. Our team also gave a presentation at Open House, which is IIT Delhi’s annual research presentation and lab demonstration event featuring presentations from all the academic departments of IIT Delhi. Moreover, we ensured proper exposure of first year students to synthetic biology and its multi-disciplinary aspects by setting up a stall at the Tour of Stalls, IIT Delhi’s annual club orientation, which has an annual footfall of nearly 1000 students.
Apart from these, we have been conducting lab workshops to teach interested students basic lab work and techniques. We started by teaching them plating and pipetting followed by plasmid isolation .We gave them an overview of our project and its potential applications. The images of our microscopy experiment were shown to the students to introduce them to the beauty of synthetic biology."

Safety And Ethics
At IISER Mohali, we are committed to following biosafety protocols from the bottom-up. The institute’s Bio-safety Committee oversees the provisioning of labs with adequate safety facilities. Dr. Ram Yadav is the member secretary of the Bio-safety committee at IISER Mohali, whose approval has been sought at each stage of our project. Few of the lab safety practices adopted at IISER Mohali based on rules implemented by the committee include:
• Safe handling of chemicals, glasswares:
Usage of fume hoods to minimize the inhalation of chemicals that generate harmful vapours.  Gloves, lab coats, safety glasses, and shoes are compulsory to wear while handling any chemical or doing any experiment.
• Biosafety
Most of the biological agents used in the Department of Biological Sciences are non - pathogenic. No BSL3 or BSL4 labs are currently present in the institute. Accordingly, only risk level 1 and 2 organisms are handled, the latter with extra safety precautions such as bio-safety cabinets.
Proper clothing norms are adopted while working and the access to certain working places like the animal housing SAFE (read below) are only allowed to specific members and entry for anyone else is prohibited. Such working places are kept properly insulated to avoid leakage of any potentially harmful substances including biological agents like viruses!
There is a Small Animal Facility for Experimentation (SAFE) at IISER Mohali. Established in 2015, small laboratory animals are bred for research and education. The animals bred therein are used for experiments strictly as per the protocols approved by the Institutional"

NYMU-Taipei,2014,Team:NYMU-Taipei#project#4c1_-_-_TEXT.html," INSA-Lyon and HIT-Harbin iGEM teams, we decided to use lysostaphin as our ideal enzyme. Lysostaphin has activities of 3 enzymes, including glycylglycine endopeptidase, endo-β-N-acetyl glucosamidase and N-acteyl muramyl-L-alanine amidase. Those enzymes can cleave the glycine–glycine bonds, which form cross links between glycopeptide chains in the cell wall peptidoglycan, and cleave the peptidoglycan of a backbone made up of alternating β-1,4 linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues as well.
Design
Promoter (Asr promoter)
The Asr promoter comes from Escherichia coli strain MG1655, and has the ability to be induced by external acidification (pH 4.0 ~ 5.0). The sequence of Asr promoter includes an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide consists of 111 amino acids. Besides, according to computer-assisted analysis, the predicted polypeptide also contains a typical signal sequence of 30 amino acids, and it might represent either a periplasmic protein or an outer membrane protein.
Signal protein (yebF with RBS)
As described in the killing part, yebF is a transporting protein naturally secreted by Escherichia coli, and it can also be used in experimental strains which are rarely involved in protein secretion.
Lysostaphin producer (iGEM part BBa_K748002)
Part BBa_K748002 comes from 2012 HIT-Harbin iGEM team, and it encodes lysostaphin. Lysostaphin is naturally secreted by Staphylococcus simulans. It is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme of 27 kDa, and has activities of three different enzymes, which are glycylglycine endopeptidase, endo-β-N-acetyl glucosamidase and N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanine amidase. Glycylglycine endopeptidase hydrolyzes glycylglycine bonds in the polyglycine bridges that form cross links between glycopeptide chains in the cell wall peptidoglycan. As for endo-β-N-acetyl glucosamidase and N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanine amidase, they can cleave the bonds between N-ac"

Harvard_BioDesign,2016,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," is being degraded by proteases because it is so large. We hypothesize the smear we see between 70 kD and 30kD in lane 2 is because of the same phenomenon, such that the PETase-GFP fusion is being chopped into varying length fragments, each which has a histag and therefore shows up on the blot. Finally, we see no signal in lane 5, which was lysate from cells containing the same construct as lane 1, but uninduced.
In conclusion, this Western demonstrates that we have inducible control over PETase expression.
Checking enzyme activity
After constructing our PETase-sfGFP fusion plasmids and demonstrating we had inducible control PETase expression via sfGFP visualization, SDS Page and Western Blot, we were ready to test whether the PETase-sfGFP construct catalytically active. From the original paper published on PETase1 we knew that the PETase could be catalytically active in our chassis organism E. coli, but we didn’t know whether the upgrades we made to the system would interfere with the catalytic activity. In particular, the sfGFP fusion we made to allow Plastiback to be easily serviced by ocean researchers might interfere with the enzyme’s active site, for example. Not willing to sacrifice this ease-of-use feature, we set out to show that PETase-sfGFP could still be catalytically active.
We adapted an assay used by the UC Davis 2012 Team that could characterize PETase’s esterase activity with a colorimetric readout. The assay, called the p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) substrate assay, demonstrates enzyme activity when the breaking of an ester bond in the substrate produces 4-Nitrophenol. This absorbs at 405nm and can be detected with a spectrophotometer2.
To conduct this assay, T7 lysY Iq cells expressing our PETase-sfGFP plus pelB secretion tag construct were were OD standardized and induced with .1 Molar IPTG or left uninduced. Cells were lysed, and triplicates of induced culture lysate were mixed with pNPB substrate or the same lysis buffer they were already in. To show that any change in absorption was due to PETase-sfGFP fluorescence rather than other artifacts of the cell lysate, an uninduced control was run with pNPB substrate. To control for the background absorption of pNPB, just the substrate was also run. OD 405 absorbance of these samples"

DILUTION PROCEDURE/ GENERAL OPTIMIZATION
For the Ligation mixture, I did a study on whether or not a 1:5,1:7,1:10 dilution would be needed for the the FPCR step. The Results are shown below. The grouping on the left takes is comprised of 12 BBs of three groups of 4 BBs each subjected to the above dilutions. Only the 1:7 dilution produced a pass result for all 4 BBs. In the end we decided that having more (1:5 dilution) would be best since the LCR does not actually amplify the original amount of starting DNA. It only assembles what is already in the mix. The test on the right is for a 1:8 dilution of Taq DNA Ligase. Many dilutions of the Taq Ligase were performed but the original amount still works very well. 2µL for a 20µL reaction.

General Today we had a video conference meeting along with Calin from Sweden through skype. We asked everybody's opinion on whether Esengul can come instead of Orr to Jamboree. Everybody accepted and appreciated the decision. Since our team is allowed to attend only one and half hours of the Kluyver centre's meeting and also there is a huge amount of lab work pending we decided to make sure can only Daniel and Saeed attend the meeting. We will decide after discussing with other Holland-iGEM teams.
Calin He is updating the modelling of the delay module in the wiki. He also needs to do more modelling and he was suggested that Domenico and Emrah are willing to help any of the issue he faces in modelling.
Tim Vos He has got 172 reponses for the ethics survey. The deadline for ending the poll was set as 21st September. He also decided to send a mail around to all iGEM teams about ending the poll. He is also updating the wiki for the ethics and he is also going to sought the help of Suzanne of Biotechnology and Society who has also shown willingness for updating the wiki.
Weenink He has assured that the final assemblies for self destructing module will be completed next week. He is also planning to test the enzyme's role of cutting the plasmid. He also discussed with Calin about the knock out kits. He is also going to test why the sequencing is getting failed, by doing PCR using the primers given for sequencing.
Saeed He is going to meet the Delft Gementee for sponsorship next week. He is also planning to interview our Biosafety officer Lesley Robertson for the microethics. He is planning to finish the communication plan and send it around to us.
Sriram The assembly of the LacI generator is getting over today. It has to be attached to the other final assemblies and tested next week. The other sequencing opportunities must be checked and finalised. He is also"

Abstract
Our project goal is to maximize the photosynthetic productivity for a culture of Rhodobacter sphaeroides under both high and low light intensities in a bioreactor by synthetically regulating the size of the light-harvesting antenna.   We chose to undertake such a project in R. sphaeroides due to its well-characterized photosynthetic and genetic system.
The antenna system functions to expand the spectrum of light available for photosynthesis by absorbing different wavelengths than that of the reaction center.  Essentially, it is like the dish around the main receiver of any antenna.  Marine bacteria, such as R. sphaeroides, evolved very large antenna complexes to absorb light in a natural environment where there is great competition for photons.  As a result, the photosynthetic machinery is saturated at a rather low light intensity in a synthetic non-competitive environment, such as a bioreactor.  This causes up to 95% of incidental photons to be dissipated as heat or fluorescence by the bacteria at the exterior of a bioreactor through a process called Non-Photochemical Quenching (NPQ) (Mussgnug et al., 2007). In essence, these photons are being wasted as NPQ reduces light penetration into a bioreactor and starves cells on the interior for photons.  One method that has been shown to improve photosynthetic efficiency is the reduction of light-harvesting antenna sizes (Polle et al., 2002, Mussgnug et al., 2007).  Though, current approaches to this end rely on genetic knockouts and as such are difficult to precisely control from the perspective of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.  Our intention is to create a more dynamic system to vary antenna size that is dependent on incidental light intensity and that"

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer

Collaborations
Inter-team collaboration is one of many exciting things about the iGEM community. Throughout our project, we have collaborated with many different iGEM teams around the world. We did not only benefit from each other’s expertise through collaborating, but we also formed invaluable bonds with many teams around the world, boosting the team’s creativity. With this in mind, we would like to thank all the iGEM teams who have collaborated and shared ideas with us.
iGEM BOKU Vienna
After attending a lecture about Pichia pastoris at KTH hosted by Professor Diethard Mattanovich, we got introduced to the iGEM team of BOKU-Vienna 2018. Being their primary PI, Professor Mattanovich helped us getting into contact with the team and their secondary PI Hans Marx, who we talked to about technical issues we encountered while working with P. pastoris. The team further offered to clone our laccase sequences into their expression vector for P. pastoris so we sent them our constructs.
BioBrick Tutorial
In April, we were invited for a weekend of Biobrick tutorials, organized by DTU Copenhagen Biobuilders. The aim was to learn more about how to work with BioBricks, and to perform 3A assembly. The event was a splendid opportunity for us to meet other Nordic teams, and it led to us getting into contact with iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Lund, which we later did a collaboration with. See the event ""Limits of Life"" on the Public Engagement page.
NiC- conference
This year, iGEM Lund was hosting the annual Nordic iGEM Conference, NiC. The conference was held in the beginning of June, and gave all the Nordic iGEM teams the opportunity to pitch their project idea. We were able to meet the friends that we made in the BioBrick tutorial in Copenhagen, but also to form new friendships. The conference included a poster session and a presentation, and we got valuable feedback from the judges and our newly found peers. Read more about it on the Public Engagement page.
iGEM Uppsala
After our participation in the annual Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) held in Lund, we decided to meet iGEM Uppsala again during the summer to discuss a possible collaboration. To serve our great interest in public engagement and education, we came up with the idea of hosting a panel discussion. The event was called ""Limits of"

We have used algae to produce biological hydrogen that could inflate the balloon. We have engineered bacteria to produce radiation resistant materials that would increase balloon durability. Finally, we have been working on biological thermometers and small molecule sensors that could attach to our balloon's surface. Together, these projects could create a novel scientific instrument: cheap, light, durable, and useful to planetary scientists.
Our balloon is not just for outer space. It can be used to collect data on Earth, as well. Each of our balloon subcomponents has independent applications.  For example, this summer we made a biological thermometer sticker that changes color when placed on a hot flask. We also successfully engineered bacteria to produce natural latex .

SCUT-China_B,2016,Team:SCUT-China B#HP#HP3_-_-_TEXT.html," learnt that studying synthetic biology also meant construction of synthetic biology chassis, searching for bio bricks, standardization and enhancing of bio bricks .etc. These are parallel parts in synthetic biology and they are not only an assist of “regulation”.
Different from what we believed, synthetic biology is not a branch of biology but a connection between biology and different subjects likes mathematic, bioinformatics, automation, and information technology .etc.
The workshop also gave us a new understanding of the ideal of synthetic biology. There were so many new idea put forward by scientists during the workshop.What impressed us most were OKS and NPRS which the team 2014 SCUT-China and the team 2013 Heidelberg had worked on. We thought these teams had quite new and astonishing idea about OKS and NPRS but their work were only on the stage of designing these two enzymes. In the workshop we found that the idea of OKS and NPRS was quite normal for scientist. In fact it is one of trends of synthetic biology.
What is really new in this area was the idea of separating different domain of the enzyme which could catalyse a reaction independently and rearrange these domains for different functions. Now scientists are looking for new polyketides or polytides with this rearrangement as well as searching for other enzyme which can be separated and rearranged. This was just the synthetic biology in our mind. Another thing that impressed us so much was the idea of energy module. The separation and rearrangement of OKS and NPRS was a design of reality bio bricks and the idea of energy module was a design of abstract bio bricks. A self-contained organism needs energy supplying department, energy consuming department and energy conveying department. for example, a plant has photosynthetic pathway, Respiratory pathway and ATP. ATP has a stable amount in organisms. When a bio-macromolecule is being synthesised, it needs continuous energy supply so we need a new energy unit as the specific energy supply for the organism to synthesise special bio-macromolecules.
The new unit is NXP which is similar with ATP and what we need to do is to develop a suitable energy supplying unit and energy consuming unit.
CRISPR-Cas9 was another example used in the workshop. CRISPR-Cas9 is a universal enzyme for gene editing. We can control the gene segment that Cas9 target to by designing sgRNA which would not influence the structure of Cas9. This is what we talk about module assembly and module standardization.
There is still a question confusing us that is “what is synthetic biology”. Professor Ouyang Xin academician of Chinese"

Introduction to Biology Courses in SHSBNU
There are different levels of Biology courses in the SHSBNU international division. Those students who have the best potential and enthusiasm for Biology (about 20% of all students) usually choose to learn Accelerated Biology during the summer vacation before grade 11, Honors Biology in the 1st semester of grade 11, and Genetic Engineering Experiments in the 2nd semester of grade 11. In some special cases, students (about 5%) even choose to learn these courses in grade 10.
The Accelerated Biology Course or Standard Lv. Biology Course, normally takes 60 hours to finish. The students learn: molecules of life, cell structure and metabolism, cell cycle and genetics, basic molecular biology, basic concepts of evolution, regulatory systems in human physiology, and basic concepts in ecology.
The Honored Biology Course aims for SAT2 and AP Biology tests, and takes another 60 hours to finish. The students learn: phylogeny and systematics of life, invertebrate structure and evolution, structure and evolution of chordates, plant structure and evolution, detailed physiology in animal tissues and 10 human systems, as well as supplementary knowledge in ecology, biomolecules, biochemistry and animal ethology.
The Genetic Engineering Experiments course takes 20 hours of teaching and practice with the students: basic concepts of genetic modification, techniques of bacterial culture, plasmid extraction, enzyme digestion and ligation of DNA, electrophoresis to examine DNA molecules, plasmid construction and transformation, and induced gene expression of GFP.
By learning through all these courses, the students are well-armed and prepared to engage the challenges of Biology contests like iGEM, and even real-world biological research.

This CCiC has made history. There were more than 35 teams (over 300 students, teachers and scholars) attended the event. In addition, Prof. Chun B. Lou from the Institute of Microbiology (CAS), Prof. Xiong F. Fu from Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (CAS), Prof. Lu P. Xu from Tsinghua University, Prof. King L. Chow from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Prof. Kenneth A. Oye from MIT, Dr. Hao Q. Zhang from Bluepha as CTO and Dr. Teng Li from Bluepha as CEO brought wonderful presentations about synthetic biology research and their iGEM experience.
Two excellent synthetic biology enterprises, Bluepha and Beijing Syngentech, gave great support to the conference as sponsors.
The preparation time of the 4th CCiC lasted nearly five months. The CCiC community created a lot of 'first time' since CCiC was born. There was widespread support for such a public welfare work from participants.

All the mutagenesis primers have been delivered, so Douglas diluted them. They are now all at 1 ug/ul concentrations, and need a further 1:10 or sodilution before being used for mutagenesis. He then ran a first mutagenesis on Alina's pF3A-tetR-GFP plasmid, introducing the following five mutations, in addition to a control reaction:
V36F
E37A
P39K
P39Q_Y42M
P39Q_L41V
The mutagenesis kit (remains from last year) was almost empty, so he made 10 ul instead of 50 ul reactions. There should be enough remaining reagents for one more batch, possibly with control, but hardly any more.
The mutated plasmids were frozen over night, in order to digest and transform the following day.
A gel was run for the gradient PCR, that used HiFi enzyme. It gave no product! In conclusion, we shall wait for the High Fidelity PLUS Enzyme, which should get here tomorrow.
In the mean time, Doug ran an identical gradient PCR with Matt's HiFiPLUS enzyme, changing the buffer concentration to 10 ul per 50 ul and lengthening the extension step to 2'30"", as recommended by the datasheet.
Wednesday, 27 July 2011
Alessandro purified the pSB3K1 backbone (to use for Gibson assembly and make the Pconst-TetR plasmid) from the PCR of the day before getting 60.6 ng/uL. The sequencing reaction failed and checking the conditions of primers and template with NanoDrop, it seems like reverse primer has no DNA (but this doesn't explain why the reaction failed also with the forward primer); there's also a weird thing to annotate: checking the template on NanoDrop we always have an error of calibration. Alessandro made new sample to send again sequencing.
We FINALLY HAVE A WORKING PCR!!!!1111one'.
Backbone and Lysis fragments for the reporter plasmids, PCR'd with HifiPLUS. Expected product lengths: 2.4 kb backbone, 1.9 kb Lysis cassette.
More seriously, a gel was run on yesterday's gradient PCR products --- the PCR was ran using the High Fidelity PLUS enzyme, on the J61002-pTet backbone and pLac-T4Lysis fragments, for the Gibson assembly of the reporter plasmids. For both fragments, high quantities of specific product were yielded"

The bacteria tested (table 1) were killed using UV sterilization and placed on glass pieces to dry overnight. Since our biolenses were placed on a glass plate instead of directly applied to the solar cell, another parameter was added: the glass plate could potentially also influence the spectroscopy measurements. Taking this into account, a control measurement of a clean glass plate had to be performed and then subtracted from the measurements of our biological samples. This way we could measure the effect of our lenses on the light  detected by the solar cells, which we call the ‘spectral response’. The spectral response was scanned from 300 nm to 1200 nm, since this is the range of wavelengths measured in the solar cells. Because we are not so interested about the exact spectral response in each wavelength we averaged the transmission data.
Results & discussion
The amount of light that was absorbed by our cells was measured, as well as the absorbance of the substrate - a glass slide -                                              on which our cells were placed and dried. The absorbance of the substrate was subtracted from the measurements done with our cells                                              to get the absorbance of solely our biolenses. The amount of light that is transmitted by our cells is presented in figure 1 below.
Figure 1: Percentage of light that is transmitted by our cells. The  transmittance was measured using spectroscopy, at a wavelength varying from 300 nm to 1200 nm.
Figure 1 demonstrates how much light is transmitted by our cells. The light that is not transmitted is either absorbed or reflected.                                              Nevertheless, from figure 1 we can see that the light that was transmitted through our cells is almost 100%.
We do not see a significant difference between polysilicate-coated cells and uncoated cells. The intention of the polysilicate layer was to                                              focus the light, not to increase transmittance through the cells. However, due to the extra layer it was hypothesized that our biolenses                                              would absorb more light compared to uncoated cells. The fact that we see no significant difference means that the polysil"

Light Induced Learning System in C. elegans

EXPLORE
In a Glance
Learning is the act of acquiring new or modifying and reinforcing existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences which may lead to a potential change in synthesizing information, depth of the knowledge, attitude or behavior relative to the type and range of experience.
The learning behavior of C. elegans (Caenorhabditis elegans) has been studied for a long time. Worms are demonstrated to possess both non-associative and associative learnings induced by intermittent stimulation of chemicals or heavy metals.
However, the main drawback of these studies is chemical stimuli cannot be withdrew cleanly. The the residual chemicals will make it impossible to avoid the stimuli cross-contamination. They will make the results difficult to interpret.
In our project, we design novel synthetic biology methods to overcome this obstacle.
One Target
to study learning behavior in C. elegans
Two Approaches
to provide accurate insight into the worm's neural system
Three Systems
to enable observations at both the neuron level and the behavior level

In a synchronized oscillation circuit, each A, B and C plasmid is necessary. The plasmid A expresses GFP reporter and LuxI proteins, which is the positive feedback in oscillator; the plasmid B expresses protein aiiA to degrade AHL and acts as the negative feedback in oscillator; the plasmid C expresses NAD-2 to generate H2O2 to communicate between colonies, is the coupling part in circuit (Fig 2-5).
Fig. 2-5 Plasmids A, B and C in oscillation circuit
You may have noticed that these three plasmids have different resistant genes and replication origins on their backbone. Different resistant genes are used mainly for selection. And since different replication origin means a different copy number of target genes in this plasmid. Using different replication origins is to produce different target proteins in an appropriate ratio, and only in this way can oscillation be observed. Just like a glee needs Soprano, Tenor and Bass to cooperate to finish a song. Besides, three artificial plasmids with same copy numbers always have a competitive relation in one cell and cannot be well expressed.
Plasmid A has two different backbones with high and middle copy numbers respectively. We built them to see the copy numbers' effect on oscillation. Results can be seen in Exploration (For a better Glee).
All of the plasmids we constructed are confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and result can be seen in Parts , where you can also get the link to parts we submitted.
After the onerous construction work, our glee is ready to perform the synchronized oscillation song, so we have to find them a stage. Let's go to see the beautiful opera in Microfluidics (Stages) .

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables"

Modification of the yeast
Gene knockout
Based on previous research, three genes are recommended to be knocked out.
Ste2, the receptor of α factor, in order to eliminate the probability of yeasts getting affected by native ligand-pheromone.
Sst2, the GTPase-activating protein for Gpa1p, as a receptor-desensitizing factor in order to eliminate possible up-stream GPCR signal conductive decline due to incessant stimulation.
Far1, the cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, in order to eliminate side effect to cells’ life circle and formation due to signal intensification in MAPK pathway of the pheromone pathway.
Fortunately, we found that BIT-China 2017 used the same pheromone pathway in yeast in their project last year, so we established cooperation with them and brought their yeast-- CEN.PK2-1c ura3::far1 his2::sst2 trp3::ste2 △leu2. It greatly reduced our experiment works.
Mutation screening
Judging that the auxotroph marker is not enough for subsequent experiment, and resistance markers have a few problems such as plasmids’ easy losing in CENPK2-1C ura3::far1 his2::sst2 trp3::ste2 △leu2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we used positive 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) selection to obtain Ura3 mutant strains.In this method, Wild-type strains of yeast (or ura3 mutant strains containing a plasmid-borne URA3+ gene) are unable to grow on medium containing the pyrimidine analog 5-fluoro-orotic acid, whereas ura3- mutants grow normally [1].

Impact/Usefulness: The degree to which how useful the project is and how it can impact society (how stakeholders benefit and how many stakeholders are benefitted).
Each of the criteria are assigned a weight for each track, in an attempt to reflect how different tracts emphasize different criteria to varying degrees. For example, if we’re in the Foundational Advance and New Application tracks, the novelty of the project is much more important).
The general criteria weighting is described as follows:
Feasibility - /5
Novelty - /4
Application to Subteam - /3
Impact - /2
Usefulness - /2 Interest - /2
The projects with highest scores are taken to our iGEM advisors from the Faculty of Biology. The advisors offer technical advice, as well as suggestions based on their experience advising previous iGEM teams. The final decision is made after consideration of all of these evaluations.
Team Wiki
As part of the iGEM Competition Requirements, each team is responsible for constructing a wiki site to demonstrate their projects. In the later half of the year, our team puts together a Wiki Taskforce, who are members across the whole team who are responsible for creating the layout, content and the code for the wiki page. Each subteam focuses on writing about their own aspects of the project. For PNP, this means we create the pages for Human Practices, Public Engagement, Project Assessment, and other notable projects that we work on throughout the year. We also contribute to pages that are general to the whole project including project design, online notebook, and safety assessment; wherever we can contribute.
The main tasks that come with Wiki building are the design of the page’s physical appearance, the writing of content to fill the pages with, and the coding of the page. The team tries to keep a consistent theme throughout the wiki through the use of the same colour scheme, the same designs, similar use of images, and other visual aspects. Recently, the team has begun using a program called sketch to design graphics, and in our most recent wiki - 2017 - we have incorporated designs into many of our wiki pages. While the development of content is specific to each subteam and the work they did, there is some content that can be contributed to by any team member. This includes outlines of collaboration, descriptions of the team and individual bios. Finally, the actual code behind the page is headed by the math and modelling team, but any team member is welcome to contribute according to their ability.
Wiki development is a stressful process with a very strict time constraint as iGEM sets a wiki freeze"

We have had some great help from our supervisors, who have guided us throughout the whole process of making this project a reality.
Christopher Workman has been the primary supervisor of our team. He has dedicated a lot of his time to consult us, and has been great in representing us internally in our department. Besides helping us with practicalities, general management of the team and giving scientific advice, he has helped with design ideas for our prototype as well. He came up with the idea of using biotin/avidin interactions to attach our detection protein device to a surface in the incubation chamber of our device.
Rasmus Frandsen, our secondary supervisor, has provided feedback on our cloning techniques. He was also involved in designing USER-primers for USER cloning of our BioBricks, however, we opted not to use the designed primers, as it was easier for us to order de novo synthesized composite parts as gBlocks from IDT, thereby making USER cloning obsolete.
Martin E. Kogle, our residential lab technician, has helped us a lot with getting familiar with the lab, and he has lended us both equipment and chemicals crucial to our experiments. He has also been of great use with helping out when we were unfamiliar with a technique. His apprentice, Sofie L.K. Jensen, has helped us prepare buffers and solutions etc. on a daily basis.
Soumya Kannan provided valuable feedback during the idea generation.

Andreas Hougaard Lausten (Ph.D., postdoc, co-founder of Biosynthis, co-founder of VenomAb, on Forbes 30 under 30) have provided some great feedback on the feasibility of our diagnostic tool, and he has contributed with ideas to improve our project in general. He has also helped us with our BioBrick design, as he inspired us to construct a composite part using β-galactosidase, to amplify the output signal of our detection device.
Clara Guerra Duarte (Ph.D., Fundação Ezequiel Dias) has helped us design and optimize our BioBricks, by giving us feedback on the different fusion proteins we designed. As an expert in venomics, we have been able to get a lot of feedback on how we should expect venom to affect our constructed fusion-protein.

Safer Transgenic Vector
In improving the actual safety standard in modern biology, we try to construct a new general transgenic vector. The principle is rather simple: using light condition to manipulate the growth of colony.
What we are expecting to get is a newly-built plasmid backbone. In addition to an antibiotic resistance gene for selecting, add in a simple light sensor expressing path would be added in.
Two schemes might be possible for this design.
Scheme 1:
Just add a light sensor promoter on the upstream of restriction site. This is a rather simple scheme which allows the plug-in genes to express under a certain light condition. However, to express plug-in genes, a RBS must be ligated in at the same time. Moreover, this kind of procedure can just be equal to using light to start a process. Although such a process may seem to be controlled by light, it should be noted that normal solar light contain almost all lengths of visible light and some common invisible light. Even white lamp would limit the meaning of this part. So this design is not rather ideal.
Scheme 2:
Now that the first design is not practically possible, consider the problem from the back side.That is, make the plug-in genes express only when there is no light.The principle is quite simple. Attach another division repressing part to the former light sensor and make the transformed bacteria stop growing when there is a certain length of light. We have successfully constructed a rather high efficient division repression biobrick and we design a special part consisting of a light sensor and this division repression biobrick.  As the figure on the right indicates, a light-triggered division-repressor could be constructed and added in the backbone. One option might be the division repression biobrick we designed ourself.
Unfortunately, the fabrication of this small system has not been finished yet due to lack of time. But once the connection is successful, a promising general biological tool would come out. Imagine the circumstance where the colony is exposed to certain length of light and then died automatically. What the experiment executers need to do during the transgenic process is to add specific light (physical) condition to the colony. When the experiment finished, an exposure to normal solar light would directly make the colony die and prevent pollution from the laboratory and therefore improve the biosafety standard.

1.Motivation: Western medicine has been dominating our society in treating diseases for decades.  However, Chinese medicine has been playing an important role in Asian culture in food and medicine for long.  We are not sure whether detecting in heavy metals and mycotoxin in Chinese medicine is still an important issues deserving attention if there are few people using it.
2. Objective: to investigate the knowledge and use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan
3. Research questions:
(1) Whether use of Chinese medicine is more prevalent among the elderly than younger population?
(2) Whether Taiwanese people’s knowledge on GMP and prescription of Chinese medicine is different across socio-demographic characteristics?
(3) Whether potential inappropriate use of Chinese medicine is related to socio-demographic characteristics?
4. Method:
(1) Design: pooled cross sectional study
(2) Data: 2005, 2009, 2013 National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the government.
(Questionnaire and code-book of year 2005 NHIS)
(3) Dependent variables:
a. Use Chinese medical service as the major medical measure to deal with illness (Yes vs. No)
b. Have >=1 outpatient visits for Chinese medicine treatment in the past month (Yes vs. No)
c. Aware Taiwan GMP regulation on Chinese medicine(Yes vs. No)
d. Knowledge of GMP is requirement for manufacturing Chinese medicine(Yes vs. No)
e. Knowledge of prescription requirement for Chinese medicine(Yes vs. No)
f. Experience of buying Chinese medicine without prescriptions from doctors(Yes vs. No)
(4) Independent variables: age, gender, education
(5) Statistical model: logistic regression
5. Results:
Over eight years, Taiwanese population has an increasing proportion of the elderly.  Population with education of college or above become the majority society segment.
The results in Table 2 show that use of Chinese medicine service is not rare in the Taiwanese society.  Only one third of the Taiwanese people have adequate knowledge regarding the regulation on Chinese medicine manufacturing and prescription.  It is common to see that Taiwanese people purchase Chinese medicine without physician prescriptions.
The results of logistic regression is shown in Table 3.  Compared with year 2005, there were less people using Chinese medicine as main medical measure in year 2009(OR=0.87) and 2013(OR=0.83) (Table 3).  However, there were more likely for the Taiwanese to report visit Chinese medicine outpatient care in the last month in 2009(OR=1.11) and 2013("

Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#Regulatory Sequences_-_-_TEXT.html," low level in E. coli, it was hypothesised that E. coli should have a gene regulatory molecule which controlled the nemA operon enabling its expression only in environments where TNT was present. In E. coli, nemA is located downstream of a gene encoding a transcription factor known as NemR, previously entitled YdhM29.  Disruption to the gene encoding NemR results in a decrease in nemA expression, both in the basal and induced states, which indicated that the nemA gene and NemR form a single, connected operon. Umezawa et al. (2008) proposed that the function of NemR is as a redox-operated transcriptional repressor of the nemA gene.  NemR is proposed to remain bound to the operon and, when it binds TNT in the environment, undergo a conformational change to expose the promoter. The region of the promoter sequence to which NemR binds (the ‘NemR recognition box) has also been identified30 (Figure 8).
Figure 8: Diagram depicting the sequence of the ‘NemR box’. Adapted from Umezawa et al.31
On the assumption that TNT was able to naturally diffuse into the E. coli cell, we hypothesised that if we designed a promoter containing this binding site gene sequence, the promoter would therefore become inducible by the addition of TNT through the use of the NemR protein which is naturally found in E. coli and would be a vastly simpler TNT-detecting gene expression system as it would rely on the success of considerably fewer engineered parts. It has been shown that NemR also responds to cysteine-modifying electrophiles, including NEM, showdomycin, and, more weakly, iodoacetamide 33 . The repressor function of NemR was inactivated through the addition of Cysteine modifying reagents. Furthermore, based upon a predicted 3D structure (Figure 9), it has been proposed that NemR utilises reversible oxidation of a conserved Cys-106  residue as the signal for confirmation change and dissociation from the DNA strand thus activating gene expression34.

The overwhelming majority responded to “yes”.
Although people (especially the public) don’t have a good impression on GM foods and genetic recombination at previous question, while more than eight-tenth of people respond to “continue research” here. This means that whether people agree or not depends on research content.

There are hardly any differences between College student and the Other..All have almost same tendency.
Quite many people answered “useful for food crisis”, ‘solve environmental problems”, “applied to medicine” or “it has potential”.
People expected genetic engineering and biotechnology in the future.
The reason that the research shouldn't continue
Quite many people chose “harmful to environment and humans”, “can be harmful to ecosystem” and “harmful to human body”
There are no big differences between biotechnology and genetic engineering.
Summarization of Question 7
Solution to food, energy, environmental issues and medical treatments is expected.
Many people worry about harmful effects on the environment or on us. Some people say GM is against their moral values.
Some of these worry may come from ignorance about genetic engineering and biotechnology. We hope we can relieve their worries by explaining to them more in detail.
Q8
The result that only 10~20 percent of whole knows this term, shows that this term have hardly spread to people.
We think that the most contribution of this questionnaire is that 1242 person now know this term.
There aren’t large difference between university students and the Other

Conclusion
Overall tendency
The big difference of opinions in Japanese people comes from whether the subjects of a survey are student (including college and high school) or not. This difference might come from the following reasons.
It comes from difference of generation. For example, when college student or high school student were children, Dolly was already born (1996).
It comes from difference of education. Contemporary students are"

mRFP production over time
Method
A 100 ml ArsRFP culture was grown at 30°C until it reached OD=0.4 (OD 600nm). At this point arsenite was added (1000ppb final concentration) and fluorescence was measured every 30 minutes during 8 hours at 584 nm excitation peak and 608 nm emission peak.
Results
As shown in the figure below, mRFP production increses over time with arsenite (1000 ppb). However, there is a 3 hours lag after inoculation.
mRFP stability over time
Method
ArsRFP culture was grown overnight at 37ºC in 10 ml LB medium with 2000ppb arsenite concentration. The following day, the culture was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded in order to remove the arsenite, thus stopping the induction. Afterwars, fresh LB medium was added and the pellet was resuspended. This was done twice and the culture was returned to 37ºC incubation. 1 ml of this culture was taken every 12 hours for the following 4 days. Finally, fluorescence was measured.
Results
mRFP degradation is shown over time, specially during the first 24 hours.
Naked eye discernibility range of mRFP production by arsenite inducible promoter
Method
ArsRFP cultures were grown with different arsenite concentrations ( 0, 10, 50, 200 and 1000ppb). 1ml aliquots were taken every 12 hours and centrifuged at 10.000rpm for 5 minutes. Pellets pictures were taken in order to compare the range of colour at naked eye. mRFP fluorescence was also measured with a fluorimeter at 484nm for excitation and 608 nm for emission.
Results
As it can be seen in the pictures below, a difference in the colour production can be clearly distinguished between different arsenite concentrations after 24 hours of induction and between the higher arsenite concentrations only. It can also be observed that over time the production grows and that after 62 hours the difference between 200 and 1000ppb is not clear.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," chosen sequences by mass spectrometry (MS) (see samples preparation) and an additional culture only featuring the same backbone (pSB1C3) as a control. The peak areas of the resulting mass spectrographs shown in Figure 27, reflecting the occurrence of a given sequence in the sample.
Figure 27: Bar chart graph including the peak areas of the TDP samples analysed by mass spectrometry after purification. For the control, the expression strain only contained the same backbone.
The unique peptides that were screened for were only present in each TDP expected to contain the sequence. The differences in peak height in Figure 27 can be attributed to the different lengths of the target peptides, which can influence the readout due to the variation of the mass/charge ratios. Hence, it can be concluded that the results were positive and the identity of the proteins could be verified by mass spectrometry.
Preserving lactate dehydrogenase activity with TDPs
As the production of TDPs by our cloned BioBricks had been validated by different methods, we moved on to evaluate the protective capabilities of our proteins of interest. We performed a series of preliminary activity assays with the enzyme “Lactate Dehydrogenase” (LDH) to determine whether the TDPs conferred desiccation tolerance to non-native proteins following the LDH assay protocol . In this assay, LDH was dried with and without TDPs and rehydrated before their measurement, so that the protection TDPs offer can be established as the difference between the initial and final enzyme activity. Subsequently, the feasibility of long-term storage with TDPs was studied by measuring the activity of LDH+TDP samples dried and stored at room temperature for different amounts of time, up to a maximum of 18 days. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
To the end of assessing the protective effect of the TDPs, all four proteins were tested as buffer excipients (in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L) for the enzyme Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) in an enzymatic activity assay based on that described by ( Boothby et al. 2017 ).
Figure 28: LDH activity after drying and subsequent rehydration for the different TDPs.
As depicted in Figure 28, the LDH activity is least preserved at the lowest TDP concentration for all TDPs and a maximum of activity preserved for the highest concentrations we assessed, with the exception of CAHS 94205, though the error bars should be considered. This indicates that"
