We are striving to do the best integrated human practices program for our human practice works centred around the topic of biosafety. We investigated the current state of the rather obscure biohacker community, its self-regulations, the various laws about the distribution and import of biological products, and the actual situations on the purchase and sale of dangerous biological products in China. We concluded that there exist substantial security risk associated with them, confirmed by our interview with the station director of the centre of disease control and prevention, who opines that the outflow of biological agents can be hugely destructive to ecosystems. We proposed that beyond legal solutions, culture should also be emphasized in addressing the risks aforementioned, yet at the foremost this is the reason for our project on preventing the leakage of bacteria. We also conducted interviews with a chief engineer of Bluepha company about these problems, and found that our project has great prospects for further development;
We are striving to do the best of education and public engagement for our iGEM team originated from our school's synthetic biology club, and we used the club as a base for our works of public engagement. We focused on"

Test of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol degradation done by TVEL0 and BPUL  without ABTS. Experimental setup: 1 µg substrate, 0.1 mM ABTS, 110 µL BR-buffer and 0.6 µg laccase in 200 µL reaction volume. Measured at t0 and after 3 hours.

Team Activity Tests:
Negativ control for substrate saturation analysis to investigate in the effect of CuCl2 oxidizing ABTS. Instead of laccase in H2O, only H2O mixed with 0.4 mM CuCl2 was applied.
During the Jamboree in Amsterdam we had the oppurtunity to discuss our activity results with a lot of people. One remark was about the calculation of the enzyme specific units. As you all remember, we measured the activty with 0.1 mM ABTS, but to get comparable results with the literature, we had to measure each protein with other concentrations of ABTS. The concentration of ABTS should be saturated for each laccase. So we started with ECOL and BPUL and applied different ABTS concentrations starting from 0.1 mM as usual: 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM and 5 mM. We applied 616 ng Laccase in each sample. Our results showed, that especially ECOL does not reach its substrate saturation with 5 mM ABTS. Our plans are now to check these concentrations of ABTS for BPUL and TTHL and also higher concentrations of ABTS for all laccases. For that we should reduce the enzyme amount to be able to detect the change in OD 420 properly.
Activity assay of our new ECOL laccase with different ABTS concentration to find the substrate saturation of ECOL. 616 ng ECOL laccase (incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2) and 20 % Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) were applied.
Activity assay of our new BPUL laccase with different ABTS concentration to find the substrate saturation of BPUL. 616 ng BPUL laccase (incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2) and 20 % Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) were applied.

The figure below shows sensor device II’s GFP production rates at different concentrations of C4-HSL. However, the difference between the production rates at 0 M and 9.90E-8 M was still not significant (12.2%), and the rate at 0 M did not decrease as expected.
Fig 5. GFP production rate of sensor device II
V. Problems with Sensor Device II
We were confused with the result and discussed it with Mr. Yihao Zhang again. He explained that the device displayed fluorescence when there was no induction because the interaction between promoter and RhlR has reached equilibrium and cannot be altered by changing the RBS strength. Thus, we asked Mr. Zhang if there is any method to increase the difference between GFP production rates at 9.9E-8 M and 0M of C4-HSL. Based on the dual-mode nature of RhlR, Mr. Zhang suggested us to increase the RBS strength for rhlR (LVA-tagged) in a large scale (from 10 times of original strength to 100 times), so the cooperativity between RhlR and C4-HSL can be improved, enabling more GFP to be expressed at low inducer concentration.
VI. Characterization of Sensor Device III ( BBa_K2548001 + BBa_K2548003 ))
We calculated four new RBS sequence with strength of 10, 20, 30, and 60 times of BBa_B0034 and assembled them with our sensor device. We tested the GFP production rate of these four devices, and found the device with 60 times of RBS strength gave the best result. The GFP production rate of this device at 9.90E-8 M of C4-HSL is:
Fig 6. GFP production rate of sensor device III
This time, the difference between GFP production rate at 0 M and 9.90E-8 M of C4-HSL reached 35.7% of the expression level without induction, enabling people to detect A. hydrophila more easily from fish feces by using fluorescence detector. Moreover, as Mr. Zhang predicted before, the cooperativity between RhlR and C4-HSL was improved. Figure x. shows the modelling results of the three sensor devices. The slope of device III is the steepest one, and the Hill coefficient of the function, which describes the cooperativity between inducer and RhlR, increased from 1.154 in device I to 2.250 in this device.

Children's Comic Series
One of the most important aspects of education today is to spark curiosity. iGEM has created Comic Series devoted to educating children in elementary school and middle school on the fundamentals of synthetic biology and lab safety. Our story revolves around two characters, Dr. Tom and Marie (a current student), in their synthetic biology lab. Tom serves as a mentor to Marie who is not familiar with the field of synthetic biology. The comic discusses PCR, Gibson Assembly, and fundamental concepts of DNA.
Launching a High School Team
We’ve received numerous emails from high-school students interested in joining the University of Washington (UW) undergraduate team. Thus, we have decided to launch the first high-school iGEM team in Washington with students from the Tesla STEM High School in Redmond and the International School in Bellevue, but open to all interested high-school students. The Tesla STEM High School has agreed to let us use its BioSafety Level 1 facilities which contain the basic equipment needed for an iGEM team, including a PCR machine and an autoclave.
We are also in contact with a number of teachers at high-schools within reasonable distance from the Tesla STEM High School who have expressed interest in acting as PIs, instructors, and advisors for the team. We plan to train students in the lab using the online lesson plan for iGEM training designed by members of our team that includes a syllabus attached to useful videos, lecture notes, and numerous protocols for the most common lab techniques used in an iGEM project. The lesson plan has been effective with new members of our own team and with the help of official team PIs, advisers, instructors, and general support from members of the UW iGEM team, we hope it will also prove effective for the high-school team.
Recruited High-School iGEM Team Leaders
Our only current high-school iGEM team member, Roya Amini-Naieni, who has been with us  for two years now plans to branch off to become a leader and founder of the high-school team, providing it with constant access to an experienced individual in the iGEM process along with student Anna Vasyura from the Tesla STEM High School.  Below are the steps the UW iGEM team plans to take with them.

Dutch iGEM teams (iGEM Wageningen, Amsterdam, Delft, Eindhoven)
On the 10th of July all Dutch iGEM met in Wageningen for the first mini-symposium (Greek for meeting and having a drink together). We could share our ideas, get in touch with other team colleagues and present our team subject. See video “Symposium iGEM Netherlands 2"" (posted on July 9 2012) http://wurtv.wur.nl/P2GTV/cataloguepage.aspx . The iGEM Groningen presentation starts at time point 1:42. After these serious talks, a great dinner was served: we had a BBQ inside an old school building. The lab space as very suitable as dinner space.   And there are more interesting symposia to come. On the 6th of September we are invited for the next iGEM- The Netherlands symposium in Eindhoven. And also Amsterdam invited us for a next one.
After the wiki freeze, all Dutch iGEM teams work together on a nice activity: during the Discovery Festival on Friday 28 September located in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven, the teams aim to get the public in touch with Synthetic Biology in a playful way. We want to let them guess about the ideas of previous iGEM teams and humbug. Or in other words, Synthetic Biology: Science or Science Fiction?
Besides these Dutch iGEM"
Imperial_College,2018,Team:Imperial College#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," high-value, processing-free biomaterials such as bacterial cellulose into ready-to-use defined shapes (Buldum et al., 2018).
Gene Activity Dosing (Foundational Advance)
Selecting an optimal expression level of a gene in synthetic biology is difficult, inefficient and costly when dosing the gene using a standard chemical inducer system. Activating transcription of the gene of interest along with GFP in our electrogenetic circuit would allow for easier selection of gene dosing. Electrode potentials could be varied across an electrode array, with the GFP fluorescence from the position with optimal dosage being used to calibrate this expression level to a constitutive promoter from the anderson set.
Bioreactor Control (Therapeutics, Industry and Nutrition)
By controlling flagella control via electrical stimulation, it would be possible to spatiotemporally regulate bacterial motion in a 3D culture. you could either keep cells in constant motion, or induce clearance of the liquid volume at the flick of a switch. We propose the above application where one could potentially have a co-culture in which one strain undergoes constant swimming via electrical induction, and another undergoes tumbling and becomes trapped in a mesh close to the electrodes. At the flick of a switch, we can change the behaviour of our culture composition, allowing us to develop and realise more complex biosynthetic pathways for applications such as therapeutics, industry and nutrition.
Tissue Engineering (Therapeutics / Food & Nutrition)
Although porting this electrogenetic device into a mammalian system may prove difficult, a series of redox-responsive transcription factors are found in mammalian cells which could be used to build a cognate system. One such example is USF-1 which responds to DTT in its reduced form only (Kraj et al., 2013; Brigelius-Flohé & Flohé, 2011). By applying the spatial control achievable with electrogenetics, such a system could be used to control cell-fates in embryonic stem cells for organ transplants. Alternatively it could be used in the production of synthetic meat, which if an efficient method existed would allow for significant reductions in the humanity’s carbon output.
Extended-Use Applications
High-Throughput Drug & Antibiotic Screening (Therapeutic)
Some antibiotics utilise oxidative stress to target cells, whereas antioxidants are commonly used to treat various diseases. Our reporter system responds to oxidative stress, and as such could be used for the high-throughput screening of drug and antibiotic candidates.

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," the process of the deimmunization we seek minimum value for the protein’s immunogenicity while maximizing the free folding energy ddG. For the immunogenicity score we used an adapted version of a score for population optimized peptide vaccines and epitope reduction [] [] .
$$ I(S \vert A) := \sum_{e\in E(S)} \sum_{a\in A} p_m \cdot i_{e,a}\\\\  with \\ E := set of epitopes \\ A := set \ of \ alleles\\ p_a := frequency \ of \ allele \ a \ in \ target \ population\\ i_{e,a} := immunogenicity \ of \ epitope \ e \ for \ allele \ a\\ b_{e,m} := binding \ affinity \ of \ epitope \ e \ on \ allele \ a$$
Using both, the calculated difference in the immunogenicity score and the predicted ddG after the amino acid substitution, we formulated a score which takes both objectives together. We added an adjustable weight w in the formula, which controls whether the immunogenicity value or the ddG value is give more weight for the final scoring. A low weight favors the reduction of the immunogenicity but could result in accepting in structurally very unfavorable mutations. In contrast, a high value for the weight allows mainly structurally neutral mutation but could result in an ineffective removal of T-cell immune epitopes.  In order to ensure reasonable results in the deimmunization workflow, we set different constraints. Firstly, the immunogenicity has to be improved in every step, to make sure that no unnecessary mutations are introduced in the sequence (CI). Secondly, every position of the amino acid should be mutated only once (CII). Thirdly, we also limited the maximum number of point mutations introduced in the sequence (CIII).
Application on BoNTC
We applied our BERT deimmunization workflow on our botulinum neurotoxin C shuttle to show the capabilities of our modular tool, as well as to optimize the potential applicability our shuttle, which is the key players of our project. In particular we applied the workflow to the binding domain of the botulinum toxin C, since this domain plays the most important role in recognizing and entering neurons by specifically binding to ganliosides. Therefore it is crucial that this domain in not masked by ADAs which would most likely prevent interactions between the protein and its target. Is has already been shown, that a vaccination in mice with the binding domain of BoNT-A in mice protected them botulism, by neutralizing antibodies [] . Trans"
ULB-Brussels,2011,Team:ULB-Brussels#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," horizontal transfer, a notion which wasn’t, at that time, taken into account by the KULeuven team. That’s why our debate was so important. It helps the Belgian teams to develop a reflexion about their projects. Thanks to this debate, we were confronted to others points of view than ours and it helps us to improve our projects.
The professors gave us some ideas, which turned out to be perfect reflexion sources for us. Therefore, we decided to go into these notions in depth, in the following section. These notions are the precaution principle, the communication between society and science, probabilities and at last, the legislation.
The precautionary principle (McCullum et al., 2003) has its origins in the German word “Vorsorgeprinzip”, which is freely translated as the obligation to “foresee and forstall” environmental harms. A 1998 consensus statement characterized the precautionary principle in this way: “when an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established”. The 4 central components necessary to achieve its implementation include (1) taking preventive action in the face of uncertainty, (2) shifting the burden of proof to the proponents of an activity, (3) exploring a wide range of alternatives to possibly harmful actions, and (4) increasing public participation in decision making. As noted by Applegate, “properly construed, this principle defines a process for taking environment- and health-protective actions while the dangers of not taking such protective action remain uncertain…. It seeks to anticipate the risks of new and existing technologies so as to avoid or minimize them.” In December 2002, the British Medical Association (BMA) issued a statement on GE foods in which it reiterated its support for the precautionary principle. Adherence to the precautionary principle is consistent with at least 3 different tenets of scientific analysis.
 
First, it fits with the desire to minimize type II error (false-negative). 40 Scientists in the fields of ecology, conservation biology, and natural resources management have been increasingly concerned about the tendency to downplay type II error in studies that aim to inform environmental policy. As explained by Kapuscinski, this is because the potential for harm is greater if conclusions commit a Type II error (false negative) compared to a Type I error (false positive) since recovery from most harm to ecosystems or human health involve large time lags, and are sometimes irreversible. Type I errors, on the other hand, are usually limited to short-term economic costs borne"

<legend>Fig. 8 Sigma-Memory Sigma-memory is a genetic device which have two states and can memorize the state. Induction of A or B changes the state.</legend>
The existence/absence of sigma factor can be regard as a binary 1/0 of memory, and this value of memory can be switched upon input A or input B. Using the promoter which is corresponding to the sigma factor, the information whether the value of memory is 1 or 0 can be observed as reporter expression. For example, consider the circuits below. The reporter is expressed when the value of  the sigma-memory is 1 (i.e. sigma factor exists).

In addition, sigma factors, promoters, and anti-sigma factors which have one-to-one correspondence enable us to make multi-sigma-memory genetic circuits. To make the explanation easier, consider the case in which E. coli has two sigma memories, sigmaA-memory and sigmaB-memory. The value of sigmaA-memory changes from 0 to 1 after the induction of A1 exists and change from 1 to 0 after the induction of B1 exists. Also the value of sigmaB-memory changes from 0 to 1 if input A2 exists and changes from 1 to 0 if input B2 exists. For example, after the induction of A1, only the value of sigmaA-memory change from 0 to 1 since sigmaA promotes only transcription from PsigmaA (the promoter that is corresponding to sigmaA). Since the transcription from PsigmaB is not activated, sigmaB is not expressed and the value of sigmaB does not change. The same is true of input A2. After the induction of B1, anti-sigmaA is expressed and the value of sigma"

Evaluating the experiments process in terms of safety, the department always reminds our team to put the safety in priority and arrange some experienced research assistants to help us.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
In terms of the safety issues, once the synthetic products have the chance to be commercial products, we should take the harmony between synthetic and natural products into consideration and find an appropriate place for the synthetic products.  Most importantly, we should establish some particular protocols for these products which are created by human using synthetic biology techniques.

Since we have decided the core of our project, we moved on to designing our systems. In brief, our microbe incorporates four independent modules listed below.
CRC targeting module
Ultrasonic Reporting module
Suicide module
Therapeutic module
With the combination of the four modules, we’ve constructed ECHO, a device that can target cancer cells, image the cancerous tissues using ultrasound and give a preliminary bio-treatment of CRC.
Read more about design .
Capture the Cancer Cells
This module enables bacteria to specifically adhere to CRC lesions in the lumen. To this end, ECHO is designed to display a CRC antigen binding moiety, a 15-aa oligo peptide, on its surface and can be anchored on the foci of CRC (design) . A series of experiments were done to determine whether the cell surface display system (CSDS) correctly transports the oligo peptide to the outer membrane of the bacterium, as well as whether the oligo peptide are effective to build a cell-bacteria junction.It turned out the targeting module can bind to cancer cells with the average positive rate of 24.1% while that of the control group is only 2.9% (results) . Moreover, in order to better suit ECHO to realistic application, we introduce young's modulus of bacteria to simulate the locomotion of bacteria in human colorectum and study its fluid mechanic behaviors (adhesion model) .
Fig 1. T peptide anchoring the cancer cells.
Ultrasound and I
When ECHO successfully binds to cancer cells, it is ready to image the cancerous tissues. The ultrasonic reporting module is prepared for the imaging. It contains a cluster of engineered gas vesicle proteins (ARG) that could form gas vesicles in the cytoplasm of E.coli. These bubbles are able to generate signals upon high-resolution ultrasonic inspection (design) . We tested the function of ARGs by mixing cell cultures with gel and observed it through ultrasound. Furthermore, we injected the gel into mouse colon and observe under the same condition. The results show that the gas vesicles produced by ECHO can be detected both in vitro and in vivo using ultrasound and MRI (result) . Since we would like ECHO be accessible to as many people as it can, we must make sure the gas vesicles ECHO produces could be detected using the most common ultrasound machine in clinical use. In order to realize this, we modeled the ultrasonic response of gas vesicles in our device and modify the key parameters by experimental results (model) .

Nevada,2013,Team:Nevada#Donate_-_-_TEXT.html," College of Agriculture, Biotechnology and Natural Resources (CABNR) has donated start-up funds to begin research in May. After this point, the students are expected to raise money on their own to keep the research going through October. No lab fees are ever charged to students.
Another major expense is travel to the iGEM jamboree. In the past, travel has been covered by the National Institute of Health (NIH) INBRE grant and the Department of Biochemistry. However, with budget cuts to state and federal agencies, the money for iGEM travel is becoming limited. With your help, the Nevada iGEM will be able to take all the team members to the national jamboree in November 2013.

We used the alkaline solid medium containing Na2CO3 to plant the transformed strain WB800_tupA and the original strain WB800. After 48hours, the plates of same pH value were dyed with crystal violet followed by washing with ddH₂O and compared the size of bacteria ring(Fig.12), which indicates the function of tupA to increase the alkali tolerance of B.subtilis.
Fig.12 Growth situation of original and tramsformed strains at different pH. The bacteria rings of WB800 _tupA are always bigger than original WB800 , especially at pH 9, which indicated the function of gene tupA as respected.
Meanwhile, Strain transformed and original WB800 were plated at 37°C in the alkaline liquid medium (pH = 9.0) simultaneously, then we recorded the OD600 of them at the same time to compare their growth rates (Fig.13).
Fig.13 OD600 of various strains in the alkaline liquid medium (pH = 9.0)                                     At the same time, the OD600 of recombinant B.subtilis WB800 _nhaC and WB800 _tupA always exceed the original strain WB800, which proves the effect of two genes to some extent.

THE HEALER: Carbonic anhydrase
To realize the self-healing of cracks in concrete, we need to increase the mineralization capacity of B.subtilis . The Healer in our project is Carbonic anhydrase(CA) , which catalyzes the hydration of CO2 to produce HCO3- and captures free Ca2+ with OH- in the environment to form Calcium carbonate precipitation.
We have two parts encoding CA, including the TSLV1-CA ( BBa_K2232014 ) and the OF4-CA( BBa_K2232015 ) both express and function intracellularly. We constructed  two shuttle vector to transform these two parts and the positive clones was confirmed by nucleic acid electrophoresis (Fig.14,15).

OVER VIEW
Synthetic biology is still in an early developing stage in China and it is believed to bring new opportunities to biotechnology and to solve critical problems and scares that we might face now and in the future, like food and fuel crisis.
However, similar to the situation in western countries, synthetic biology is still in an emerging field in China that lacks clear definition and safety laws. The lack of a well-accepted definition and safety concerns do not seem to stop the Chinese government and scientists from pursuing synthetic biology. In recent years, high standard labs and institutions have been set up featuring mainly on research of synthetic biology. Funds from Chinese government on synthetic biology increases significantly. There are several universities that are playing the leading role in the field of synthetic biology in China, while more and more universities and colleges are joining in. A good example to show the Chinese students’ curiosity on synthetic biology might be the increasing number of universities that took part in the iGEM competition through the past five years.
The iGEM competition opens the door of synthetic biology to the new generation of Chinese college students. What the iGEM offers is not only a new study field, but also a new way to conduct scientific research work: work as a team. What’s more important is that this competition gives students a chance to evaluate the safety issues related to a new scientific field which is not yet widely known by the public.  Hence we know that our project might raise some safety concerns and we have the responsibility to inform the public of potential risks of biotechnology and synthetic biology, and also teach them how to avoid these risks in the lab and our daily life. The public’s opinion in turn, could be used to help us examine our safety protocols as well as considering the general safety principles of synthetic biology. Therefore, for our Human Practice we have organized and participated in various events. We organized the Open Lab Day for kids from a primary school in Xiamen. Our team members and instructors gave a lecture on"

Our scoring system is based in five criteria; for each one of those criteria, independent literature-based algorithms evaluate different aspects of the DNA string. Different papers and empiric results from our own and associated (UPV) researches have been used. The criteria are better explained in the scoring section. In order to know how close our results were to the optimum ones, we have compared our targets to the ones obtained for the same sequence by the competence, and our results always matched the ones located in the 5 best results using their algorithms.
Why did we always obtained results among the 5 best matching sequences and not the first one? In our case the search is not only in one PAM NGG, but also includes a promotor G 20 H GG specific for plants, so it differs from the rest of targets providers. That is also the reason why our search has different parameters for the general score, giving “negative points” for some characteristics that provide better score in other’s algorithms.
Our web application was created as a supporting tool for the labcase and the database, also, a sharing information platform which allows communication between users has been created with the aim of sharing knowledge and improve the quality of the information, so that its functionality is not reduced to the initial consultation software. For this purpose, we have also developed API routes for the external use of the scoring system, meaning that other platforms can use this element without log in our web application. If a thirds’ application user communicates by a post red protocol by sending a DNA file, thus the application will respond with a json object with the possible targets ordered by the punctuation assigned by the five algorithms of the system. Those users will not have access to the algorithms, but they will to the results. Three other different routes can be used in this communication without the need of being logged, allowing searches by gene name, phenotypic characteristic and/or plant name.
At the end of this wiki page, you will find a small user’s manual for the API use with an example of its usage. This guide has been developed with an example of the scoring system, but the other three routes are also completely functional and have similarities in its way of usage.
In order to make a user-friendly software, the service has been externalized, so a 500+ pages template specially developed by company expertized in creating friendly frontends has been used, dynamizing the user environment. This specific template has been downloaded by 4000 worldwide, which means that is generally considered as good supporting material for web development. It was designed one year ago and the last"

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

Since our team currently lacks a lethal system, in this exchange, we worked with NEU_China_A to jointly verify and optimize the cold shock system, improve the project, and meet the iGEM safety requirements.(To be continued)
rIgem Xuzhou Communication Meeting
    At the beginning of the meeting, the four universities (Dalian university of technology, Lanzhou university, Jiangnan university, Zhejiang university of technology) publicized the igem related situation to the students present and answered everyone's questions. Since the meeting was in the third quarter of the National Undergraduate Life Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, it achieved good publicity. Next, the four universities introduced their projects in turn, accepted questions from everyone, and explained the bottlenecks of the project, hoping to get inspiration through discussion.
    Our team's project has aroused great interest from the teachers and students present. Everyone said that the project is novel, practical, and cleverly designed, but at the same time it also put forward many opinions. First of all, because our products have to enter the human body, the lethal system is essential, and how to maintain it in the body is controllable and effective is also an extremely important problem; secondly, how do we penetrate the intestinal wall to act on the blood; finally, respond in vivo What is the threshold value of uric acid and can be sensed before the minimum value. We answered the above questions one by one.
    This exchange will be very rewarding, not only learning the advantages of other teams, but also discovering their own shortcomings. And with the help of some teams, Jiangnan University expressed its willingness to provide E. coli exocrine system. Zhejiang University of Technology expressed its willingness to exchange experience in mathematical modeling and learned that Beijing University of Technology has a signal amplification system."

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," design. Having more then 5 year experience in microfluidic technologies she quickly pointed out what may be the negative design aspects in our system:
First of all, if we encapsulate only a single template into each of the droplets, the template concentration would be too low for protein expression to occur inside the droplets. This was based on Greta’s own research – it was nearly impossible to express detectable amounts of green fluorescent protein in droplets when only single DNA templates were used.
For this reason we have recognized another thing that requires innovation – protein expression from single templates. To see how we solved this problem, please click here to go to Rolling Circle Transcription section in the design page.
Secondly, as our design incorporated phi29 elongation reaction to record the activity of information after protein expression Greta has noted that Phi29 mix might not be compatible with in vitro transcription-translation (IVTT) mix. Because of that we did early separate experiments to see how phi29 works with IVTT. You can see the results by clicking here . Phi29 amplification has only started working after IVTT mix was diluted at least 4 times. It was a life saving advice, because if we would not have caught this huge problem early on, we would not have enough time to solve it later on.
Close
Week 27
After some more research we had the idea to add phi29 reaction mix to each droplet after protein synthesis reaction is finished by merging substrate droplets with another population of phi29 droplets. This has both allowed for IVTT reaction to be efficient as possible and later when droplets were merged, diluted the IVTT mix enough for phi29 to be functional.
Linas Mažutis from the Sector of Microtechnologies (Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University) pointed out that our design might not be efficient at this point, as it incorporates difficult and inefficient DNA fragmentation and barcoding steps. In turn, He suggested we should find alternatives to this approach. The developed method should have as little steps as possible to avoid data loss, as our goal is not only high-throughput but also high-quality data.
Week 29
In order to avoid DNA fragmentation and barcoding we have thought of a solution that could solve this problem - Nanopore sequencing. It solves the problem by having the ability to sequence long strands of DNA and at the same time - detect modifications. That completely removes the need of fragmentation and barcoding, and in turn, eliminates at least 4 burdensome steps from the overall design.

The gene was also synthesized with a double transcriptional terminator designed from sequences described for iGEM part BBa_B0005.
petBD promoter+RBS: The strong light inducible petBD promoter will be used to drive the expression of invertase gene in Synechocystis. The petBD+RBS (BBa_K390015) was generously provided to us by the Utah State iGEM team.
Chloramphenicol resistance cassette (CamR): The chloramphenicol resistance cassette was PCR amplified from pSB1C3. This cassette includes the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene with its own constitutive promoter and transcriptional terminator. This cassette is frequently used to select for positive transformants in Synechocystis.
Gibson Assembly of ThiE K.O./GLF Components
Primer Design: Forward and reverse primers for each DNA part were designed with 20 base pair overlapping sequences with the upstream and downstream flanking segments. This will create 40 base pair overlaps between neighboring parts in the construct.
PCR: GLF, CamR, and petBD+RBS were amplified from BBa_K558005(Nevada), pSB1C3, and K390015(Utah State) respectively under standard PCR conditions. ThiE in pSB1A3 will be amplified to include the vector. This will be used as the backbone for Gibson Assembly.
Assembly of Parts: The above parts will be assembled into the following construct
Primers developed for PCR and Gibson Assembly for GLF operon. Overlapping DNA sequences can be created through PCR by adding twenty base-pairs of the end of your first genetic sequence to the beginning of your second genetic sequence. A blunt-end 40 base-pair sequence is then created that is ideal for Gibson Assembly.

* Should these biological circuits be patented? What governing structure should society have for monitoring these developments?
The issues above just highlight some of the issues our team decided to explore.   The ethics conference was held in Second Life. The public can now contribute and express their concerns and opinions regarding the issues that surround synthetic biology. Our Second Life project is intended to provide an educational platform for molecular and synthetic biology. By holding an ethics conference in SL, we hope that the public is better informed of the issues that surround biology. This will also be a creative format to explore issues and allow the open discussion of ethics. Anyone from anywhere can use this service after our island has been opened to the public.
OUTREACH
The University of Calgary iGEM outreach team had a main focus of raising the profile of synthetic biology in Alberta. Our goal was to expose the public to not only the University of Calgary's iGEM project and competition but also synthetic biology as a general topic. This segment is in charge of getting our message out to the public. This will ensure the continual growth of synthetic biology especially in Alberta. This year, we raise the awareness of synthetic biology in Alberta by:
* Creating informative sessions for high school students: Exposure to these young minds can help promote the field of synthetic biology and have potential candidates in future research in these fields.
* Holding a Summer Camp for high school students: This camp was aimed to expose high school students to the work that goes behind molecular biology research. Some of the activities that the students are able to perform are PCRs, Restriction Digest, Gel Electrophoresis, Cloning, etc. Not only do they gain a general understanding of molecular biology, but they also get exposed to the work that the University of Calgary is involved with.
* Campus Fair at the University of Calgary: People with varying ages attended this fair. Our main goal for this event was to expose synthetic biology to Albertans, particularly the project that we are involved with this year. We created some fun activities (pipetting contest, artistic bacterial construction) for the younger crowd. For the older audience, we exposed them to the University of Calgary iGEM project and explained to them about what we do as a team. This will in hope provoke some interests in this field, for the continual growth of synthetic biology in Alberta.
* Collaborative project with UChicago: Both teams aim to create an outreach kit for future iGEM teams in the competition.

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Notebook#Timeline_-_-_TEXT.html," I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .

After lunch we met with Francesca Ceroni and she was amazing to be honest. She is thinking about applications of PixCell in mammalian cells and said that probably the leakiness of our system could be due to the fact that our construct is plasmid based... perhaps it would be interesting to integrate it in the genome, so there is only one copy.  Josh is still sick. Siwat is back and Shivang is sick.
Friday
Josh is finally back. Alberto set up a new growth curve with different Pyocyanin concentrations.  The plates we incubated yesterday with redox molecules and electronic stimulation did not work, as we put the wrong antibiotics. Alberto, Siwat and Thomas met to work on the Human Practice Gide draft. From collaborations we hear back from Joe Windo to arrange the New Scientist Live booth.  Luis and Will tested the agar salt bridge but no good results. Also we ordered silver electrodes, which hopefully should work faster! We still don't have vouchers for sequencing.

Tuesday
As soon as the doors of lab were opened by the guardian Ismael, we started to prepare new plate solutions and constructs. Golden Gate is still not working. Hopefully Diellza does not give up and she is trying again and again.  At 12 Prof. Danny O'Hare came into our lab and spoke his words of wisdom. Apparently, oxygen at the interface of carbon electrodes reacts and forms hydrogen peroxide, which interferes with our oxidation signal (pyocyanin). He suggested (as already Tom  and Thomas thought) that we could add some reducing molecules in the solution. Basically the idea is to reduce chemically the solution as a whole and then oxidise locally with the electrodes. Possible reducing molecules we can use are ascorbate, DTT and even reduced ferrocyaninde. Also sulfites can get rid of the oxygen, to prevent H2O2 formation. Also it is important that we calculate the molar absorbitivity of pyocyanin to make sure we can detect its oxidation with the"

I have been the instructor of the METU iGEM teams over the years.  Currently, I am a Professor of the Chemistry Department.   My research focuses on plant pathogen interactions, interested in identifying genes, proteins and miRNAs involved in disease formation and resistance mechanism by pathogens in plants.  I am a former graduate of The Ohio State University, OSU Biological Program, and worked at USDA-ARS and NIH-NCI as postdoctoral fellow and as a senior scientist prior to joining to METU.  All of the METU iGEM teams that I worked with including this one are always the sole creators and doers of the projects.  I am just enjoying getting to know the young, bright minds and being a guide as much as I can.

Hi! I am Stephen Jiang from Yali High School in Changsha, Hunan Province and it is my pleasure to participate in IGEM competition this time. I would like to watch some movies, travel to someplace I have never been or have a debate with my partner if possible. Personally I appreciate to conduct research about biochemistry or biomaterial. Looking forward to the communication and collision of thought between elites whose knowledge in the field of Synthetic Biology is pretty advanced, I believe that there will and must be something which is precious for brighter future prospect and cannot be obtained in class.

Abstract
While a low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to combat obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism. Employing a synthetic biology approach, we are working to create an artificial futile cycle in mammalian liver cells by introducing glyoxylate enzymes native to bacteria. Past research has shown that mice expressing enzymes facilitating an active glyoxylate shunt are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Our team plans to introduce an inducible system that allows us to couple the sensing of circulating fatty acid concentrations with a circuit of glyoxylate shunt. Our inducible system is intended to prevent the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while facilitating greater fatty acid uptake at higher fatty acid circulating concentrations. Such a system should increase the feasibility of a glyoxylate cycle engineered to function in vivo.

Abstract
3D printers are an easy and powerful way to produce 3D structures out of a solid polymer filament or a liquid resin. In this years iGEM project the team from TU Darmstadt created a fully working SLA-DLP 3D printer using a self-written software running on a RaspberryPi. As a light source a commercially available beamer manufactured by Acer Inc. is used. This beamer hardens the resin layer-by-layer on a metal base plate. The hardened structure is lifted out of the resin basin. For testing purposes, two different resins are used. Hardening is achieved using a commercially available resin and the self-manufactured resin of the iGEM team of TU Darmstadt.
Introduction
In the last few years 3D printing became a popular and cheap method to manufacture three dimensional structures in small numbers of units. At first it was only used in Rapid Prototyping in industry but as the process is quite simple and can be realized with atoxic substances, 3D printers later on became also available for personal use [1] [2] . Among other procedures of Rapid Prototyping, the process of 3D printing is either established by heating a solid polymer filament and placing it via a movable nozzle in desired shapes or by hardening a liquid resin by energy contributions from a light source. The latter process is also referred to as Stereolithography (SLA) [1] [3] [4] ."

Transfection of HEK cells with receptor
HEK293 were transfected with the receptor plus mCherry to see, if the virus infect only cells expressing the receptor (the two plasmids should infect same cells). In parallel cells were transfected with the blue light and the red light positive control (PMZ422 and PSAM200) and the receptor inducible by the light systems. After 24 h cells (expressing the receptor) were infected with MuLV IRES EGFP.
HEK 293 tranfected with PHB308 (mCherry) and the receptor. Transduction with MuLV after 24 h of incubation. Pictures were taken two days post transfection.
Transfection HEK and Pheonix cells with receptor (transfection while seeding)
To avoid a too high cell density for transduction cells were transfected while seeding. The PEI transfection mix was given to the HEK or Phoenix cell suspension (1,5 x 10^5 c/ml, 100 µl mix per 1 ml cells) and seeded on a 12W plate. Results indicated that PEI was too toxic for cells during this method.

Plastic waste: a worldwide problem
Yearly, roughly 260 million tons of plastic are being produced worldwide. This represents 8,880 kilograms per second. That plastic is far too frequently thrown off in natural environments, such as forests or oceans, producing visual pollution but also affecting the life in all the ecosystems [1] .
Conventional plastics take from 500 to 1000 years to degrade. However, effort put into research have allowed the discovery of a new type of material having similar properties as petroleum-based plastics with lower degradation time: bioplastics. These bioplastics come from renewable sources, are compostable and they do not produce toxic fumes if incinerated. Our question is: can we use synthetic biology to promote the usage of bioplastics?

On the origins of synthetic biology: bacterial production of bioplastics
Historically, one of Synthetic Biology's starting pillars was to engineer bacteria to produce bioplastics. Back to 1984, Oliver Peoples and Sinskey's lab started sequencing a bacterial gene that turned out to code for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a natural polyester. From that, they inferred that they could take bacteria's plastic production at the industrial scale.
With that in mind, they created a company, Metabolix. There, they focused on metabolic engineering, trying to improve the yield of plastic production, which they did [2] .

Tsinghua-E,2013,Team:Tsinghua-E#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," of all, we cultured E.coli JM109 carrying pTrc99A_trp sensor_RBS_tetA series of plasmid in M9 medium (100 mL Solution I(NaCl 0.5g/L,NH_4 Cl 1g/L ,Na_2 HPO_4∙〖12H〗_2 O 17.1g/L, KH_2 PO_4  3g/L),100 µL 1M MgSO_4,500µL 0.1M CaCl_2  ,4mL 20%(mass fraction) glucose). However, their growth in such medium was quite weak, which made us change to test this circuit in LB medium. The general protocol was firstly to culture seed bacterium in LB medium for overnight. The seed medium was added to fresh LB medium in the next morning to adjust the initial OD600=0.05. When OD600 of this new medium reached about 0.6, IPTG, tryptophan and tetracycline were added to adjust the final concentration to be 24mg/L, 2mM, and designed concentration, respectively. OD600 was measured and growth curve was obtained for further analysis. All the condition test experiment was conducted in 24-well plate with 1.5mL LB medium in each unit and further confirmation was conducted in a 100mL flask containing 20mL LB medium. In the first round, we tested some low concentration of tetracycline (0, 12, 18, 24ug/mL) which was added when induced by IPTG and tryptophan but found no significant difference in growth. Therefore, we increased the concentration of tetracycline and added it at the initiation of the growth. Some interesting results were obtained and described as the Figure below.
Figure. 11 bitter pressure part function: growth rate against tetracycline addition  (extracellular addition of tryptophan)
It was found that growth of microorganisms was significantly influenced by tetracycline, which was shown that as the increase of the concentration of tetracycline, the growth rate decreased. We also found that for pTrc99A_trp sensor_RBS-ori_tetA, its growth was severely inhibited by the induction of IPTG. The growth of bacterium in the condition with zero IPTG and tryptophan addition proved that the leakage expression of tetA existed so that our desired condition should be in a high tetracycline concentration. When we further"

The microalgae will receive this unnatural amino acid only when it's confined in the photobioreactor. Transcription and translation should thus take place normally.
However when the microalgae escapes from the compartment it will have no more access to the non-natural amino acid. This will interrupt the traduction process which would ultimately lead to the death of the algae. Furthermore, in the case of horizontal genes transfer, the recipient organism does not associate transfer RNA with the codon of the mRNA, which causes the translation to stop. So the proteins will be truncated because the ribosomes will read the stop codon as it is.

II. Laboratory safety
Laboratories
Every experiments was made in the “Institut de biologie physico-chimique” of Institut Curie, Sorbonne Université, Paris (France). Before any lab work, our team members were train about the good laboratory practices (GLP).
All components used in our experiments are classified as safe and were used under established protocols and with proper guidance. “Classification and labelling” regulation identify hazardous chemicals and inform users about their risks through standard symbols and phrases. In the EU, the classification and labelling of hazardous chemicals is governed by Regulation N. 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (the 'CLP Regulation'). (3)
Hazard pictogramms (CLP regulation)
Safety considering chemicals
Besides microorganisms, we also used several chemical compounds, one being Ethidium Bromide to visualize DNA in gel electrophoresis. Ethidium bromide belong to substances suspected of causing genetic defects.
Ethidium Bromide is a sensitive fluorescent dye used to detect nucleic acids in agarose gels. It is a mutagen and probable carcinogen. It is toxic and we always wore gloves when working with ethidium bromide. We wiped the area with a damp cloth after the work with ethidium bromide. Also, while wearing gloves after handling ethidium bromide, we were careful to not touch and thereby contaminate other surfaces.
Personnal safety
The experiment were done with several precautions such as:
We always wore lab coat, protectives gloves and clothing
autoclaving or disinfecting
Disinfecting work areas before and after use
labeling with name and date every cultures, chemicals clearly"

Main Headquarters
Our headquarters for the development of this project were the facilities at the FEMSA Biotechnology Center at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico. At this center, we were kindly given access to the Laboratory of Genetic Manipulation and Molecular Diagnostics, which became our main workplace throughout the summer. It was in this laboratory that we had all the necessary equipment to perform most of our experiments: DNA extractions, gel electrophoresis, ligations, digestions and gel purifications, as well as space to carry out research for the development of the project.
We also had access to the Fifth Floor Research Facilities at the Biotechnology Center, where we performed the part of the project that demanded much more sophisticated equipment, such as transformations by electroporation, quantifications and fluorescence assays.
Additionaly, part of our work had to be done at the ITESM School of Medicine, namely the preparation of electrocompetent cells.
FEMSA Biotechnology Center
This Center, located at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico, is devoted to the generation of research, the transfer of knowledge and the modeling of new business schemes that involve biotechnology and food technology areas.

$${\bf{\hat F}} \cdot U + {\bf{\hat L}} \cdot \Omega  =  - \iint_{S(t)} {{u_s} \cdot {\bf{\hat \sigma }} \cdot ndS}$$
Assuming that the swimmer is a bacterium with filament, what makes its movement in low Re possible is mainly the existence of drag forces perpendicular to the motion of the filament. The propulsive force generated along the filament (length L and deformation amplitude y(x,t)) is given by:
$${{\bf{F}}_{prop}} \approx \left( {{\xi _ \bot } - {\xi _{||}}} \right)\int_0^L {\left( {\frac{{\partial y}}{{\partial t}}\frac{{\partial y}}{{\partial x}}} \right)dx{e_x}} $$
This equation is a consequence of Purcell's Scallop Theorem and is derived for Re -> 0[ 4 ].
MESHING & NUMERICAL SIMULATION
The software for the model's numerical simulations is Comsol Multiphysics (v. 5.0) thus, the numerical method utilized is Finite Element Method (FEM).
The number of physical problems that can be solved analytically is very small compared to all the real world physical systems that can be solved only by approximations. One way to find a solution to a complex physical problem such as fluid flow in the human large intestine is to utilize discretization methods that lead to numerical solutions. An example of space discretization method is the Finite Element Method which considers an analytical function as a linear combination of basis functions.
Comsol Multiphysics uses this method in order to compute the numerical solutions of fap in every single node of the space discretization. However, in order for such calculations to be possible one needs to discretize the problem geometry into nodes and elements. The grid that is being produced by the software user is called a “Mesh” and the shape of its elements can vary. In our model, the tetrahedron mesh was utilized, which is the 3D representation of the 2D triangle mesh. Although the meshing was implemented by the software itself by using “physics-based” mesh, the discretization method was tetrahedral as it is easy and quick to create but it also creates an unstructured grid which in our case"
Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#COLOR-Q_-_-_TEXT.html,"Threshold Value: The amount of memory the system has to store the detected circles
The 6 by 6 grid located underneath the first row can be loaded with experimental samples and a percentage value can be determined on a scale from the negative control to the positive control. The circle detection process loops through until the maximum radius reaches 120 pixels. If anywhere from 35 to 40 circles are detected in total, then the loop stops. However, if there are fewer circles detected, then the loops restarts to finish through the maximum radius until anywhere from 25 to 40 circles are detected properly. If less than 25 circles are detected, then an error is caught and another picture is requested to be used. Zooming in or zooming out could possibly make the circle detection process easier for the system and more efficient. The following formula is used to calculate the relative percentage values:
The results are then displayed based upon the row in which the circles fall in on the base of the Chrome Q hardware. The app is able to determine the row in which the circles fall in by comparing y-coordinates. If the y-values are similar to each other, then the circles are classified as being on the same row. The relative values are then transferred to another page within the app where the user is able to enter information that could help contribute to our machine learning model, CALM. The application uses the latitude, longitude, and timestamp values obtained from the phone's GPS to effectively determine where and when the test was run. When the user submits the data, the results are sent to a MySQL database, which is a part of the Relational Database Service (RDS) as a part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. Refer to Discussion under CALM for further information.
Testimonial from Nanjing-China:
We've re-downloaded the app and have successfully used it on the picture you sent. In the attachment is the results. We have to say that it is awesome to exploit a new app all by yourselves moreover the app is so excellent. We like the fluency when using it, the simple and tidy interface to look at...It is a brilliant app and we truly admire that kind of skills to make an app~ Thank you so much again for participating our collaboration. Hope to see you in Boston!

d-AuNPs Generation
In order to generate dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles, first a gold chloride (HAuCl4.H2O) stock solution of 50 mL was prepared by dissolving 393.8 mg of HAuCl4.H2O in 50 mL of distilled sterile water. After preparation, this solution was stored at 4 °C covered in aluminium foil.
Secondly, a 10% sterile sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution was prepared by dissolving 4.985 g Na2CO3 in 50 mL MilliQ water, after which the solution was filter sterilized.
Then, 200 mL distilled sterile water was be adjusted to pH 9 by carefully adding 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) drops of 20 uL at a time, while keeping the solution sterile under a flame.
Subsequently, 25 mL of dextrin solution was prepared by dissolving 625 mg of dextrin powder in 25 mL of sterile MilliQ water to obtain a concentration of 25 g/L. This solution was then added to a sterile 250 mL flask.
Then, 5 mL of the gold chloride stock solution was added to the 250 mL flask and the pH was adjusted to 9 with the sterile 10% sodium carbonate solution, while working sterile.
Lastly, the reaction volume was completed to 50 mL by adding 20 mL distilled water (pH = 9).
For the actual generation of the d-AuNPs the flask was then incubated at 50 °C, covered in aluminium foil with continuous shaking for 3 to 8 hours. After 3 to 8 hours shaking, a reddish colour was observed on the solution that is characteristic for the correct size nanoparticle formation. The solution was observed every 30 minutes to check for red color formation.
Transmission Electron Microscope analysis was performed to check the size and size distribution of the d-AuNPs. the suspension of d-AuNPs in distilled water (ratio 1:4) and sonicate it for 5 min. Then, after plasma treatment this solution was be"

As discussed with Prof. Davis Bookhart, the head of HKUST department of environmental sustainability, for our integrated human practices, a mechanism to reuse or store the CO2 produced by cellular respiration is required to prevent creating the problem of increasing greenhouse gas in our system.
Team HKJS_S worked to convert carbon dioxide to methane using a modified nitrogenase. By learning more about how this nitrogenase works, we have came to an idea that we can convert the CO2 produced by cellular respiration of Shewanella into methane that can be used as nutrients for Shewanella under our Alkane metabolism pathway. With this implemented, CO2 from respiration can be fed back into the system for more electricity generation and therefore increase the production yield.
Apart from the implementation of system, we have also discussed about some of the issues each other have been experiencing during the summer. While the JS_S team successfully clone their constructs using standard assembly and Gibson Assembly, our team have found difficulties in cloning the long sequences we have ordered from IDT into the desired plasmid. With multiple failures in our attempts, we have decided to clone the separate parts using standard assembly and link OmpA to the laccase sequence by adding overhangs to the plasmid using PCR and then perform Gibson Assembly. However, our first attempt of Gibson Assembly had also been unsuccessful and therefore we bring out this issue for further discussion during our meet up.
The JS_S team had helped us to troubleshoot our process on plasmid amplification with overhangs and Gibson Assembly. They suggested us to put the overhang on OmpA instead and linearized the plasmid before any PCR process for higher amplification efficiency and had suggested us on using BL21 E. coli expression strain rather than DH5 alpha strain for greater efficiency in protein production. With the time limit and consideration of our team dynamics, our members with experience in protein extraction had agreed to help the JS_S team with protein extraction using SDS-PAGE. To spare our workload, the JS_S team had also agreed to help us"

Figure 1. Graphic design of human-plant circuit. a) The transcriptional factor, PIF6, is fused to a DNA-binding domain (E) and PhyB is fused to the activator domain (VP64) and a nuclear location sequence (NLS). Both genetic expressions are controlled by plant strong promoters. b) When irradiated with 660nm light, PhyB changes its conformation and this complex is recruited to PIF6 at the promoter site. The polymerase III will recognize the activation domain and the transcription will begin. Only upon absorption of a far-red photon (740nm) the interaction between PhyB and PIF6 is terminated, resulting in a shut-off of gene expression. c) Line graph representation of luciferase inducible expression pattern under different light conditions (dark, red and white light). d) Bars graphic representing the luciferase expression in all conditions (white light, red light and dark conditions) after 23 hours from red-light activation. “Strong promoter” corresponds to the luciferase expression obtained with a constitutive strong promoter (35s promoter) under different conditions, while “weak promoter” corresponds to the luciferase expression obtained with a constitutive weak promoter (pNOS promoter) under different conditions.
