Collaboration with NYMU iGEM Team from Taiwan
On August 25th Mr. Vincent Lim from NYMU iGEM Team from Taiwan paid us a visit. We held a modeled presentation at our university Kanagawa Institute of Technology. And after the presentation, we discussed about our project and experiment method. From the discussion, we noticed an important point, HAY FEVER IS NOT AN EPIDEMIC DISEASE EXCEPT IN JAPAN.We also introduce him to our instructor and our laboratory. It is a valuable chance for us to get to know more about NYMU iGEM Team and Taiwan.
Reagent support intermediation from promega to all 8 undergraduate iGEM Team in Japan (Ordering reagents and presentation representation)
Until last year, University of Tokyo iGEM Team is responsible to be the intermediation of reagent support. However, as UT iGEM Team did not take part in iGEM 2017, KAIT_JAPAN Team become responsible for reagent support intermediation. We collect orders from each university and for those university who cannot attend to the presentation for the support of the reagent, we presented on behalf of them. And after we received the reagents from Promega, we sort it out and distribute to the correspondent iGEM Team.
May Festival
On the 20th and 21st of May, 2017, we ran a booth at school festival in the University of Tokyo, named ""May Festival"", and collaborated with four iGEM teams in Japan: Tokyo-Tech, Kyoto, Gifu and Bot-chan Lab. More than 150,000 visitors came to this festival, and we had a good opportunity to explain synthetic biology and our project to them. At the same time, each team gave some advice on the other teams' project.
Meetup at Boston University
On November 9th, our team will meet up with other Japanese team at Boston University and we are looking forward to share our ideas and opinion. Each team will present their project as rehearsal just before the event and will have the opportunity to get advice from other iGEM teams and professors.

In the past decade, the synthetic biologists are trying to integrate the idea of physics and engineering science into biology, yet made great progress. One major purpose of synthetic biology is to transform the cellular to let it have a new function. However , another important purpose in this field”understanding life in the way we creating it” is becoming more and more attractive. The traditional method for biological pattern formation researching is forward genetic and backward genetic. Therefore,it is a significant shift to use the idea of synthetic biology in the biological pattern formation researching.
So we design this project to propose a concept that biochemist reaction in different kinds of biological stimulation can be mimicked by placing cells in AR system can be applied in medical field or in our daily lives. For example, the biological material 3D printing and in vitro induction of tissue or organ. In the meanwhile, we also considered what bio-pattern formation could be applied for and how bio-pattern formation could influence our lives. Moreover, we did other work to help our project. And we also do some outreach activities to raise public understanding of our project.
In the safety part, our lab locates in the building of college of life science and technology in Huazhong Agricultural. For our project is actually safe to the society and the outside world ,we have some basic safety requirements in the laboratory such as the lab coat and gloves must be worn all the time during work, we also printed “Dos and don’ts when using hazardous chemicals” and posted them on marked place.
However, It is just like seeking a road in the maze of complex cellular components and muti-layer control network to use to traditional bottom-up methods to study the biological pattern formation. In most of the cases, it is all complicated. Though we can rebuild some key components of the bio-systems with the traditional vitro bottom-up method, it still need detailed molecular mechanism yet artificial. Using synthetic biology to create a new biological pattern formation to form a system was a more radical idea. We can learn some unknown principle during the building process of the artificial pattern system.
The similarity between the artificial system and the natural system is understandable for the diversity of the natural patterns. Researchers can re-examining the regular pattern in the natural system with the principles known from the artificial systems.
On the other hand, a major purpose of synthetic biology is to build a new bio-system, we have notice dozens of components in the bio-system and the interaction mechanism between them. But how can we put them together to form a functional bio-system or"

As part of the gold medal criteria to improve a previous years part, the team decided to improve on British Columbia’s (2013) three parts (BBa_K1129003, BBa_K1129042, and BBa_K1129039) to create the “flavor” of cinnamon through the production of the molecule cinnamaldehyde. These three parts created enzymes to break down the naturally produced, in E. coli., molecule phenylalanine into cinnamaldehyde. Our team decided to take these three separate parts and combine them into a singular part for easier use and cloning. Two ribosomal binding sites were also added in front of the second two parts in order to increase the efficiency of the production of the enzymes to create the cinnamaldehyde (The first part did not need an RBS as the promoter had one attached). In the context of this year’s project, this part would be used in order to produce the cinnamaldehyde molecule as a means of killing off bacteria and fungi that contaminate biofuels in containment systems. This molecule will also kill off the bacteria that is producing it, effectively causing it to be the bacteria’s killswitch. This will ensure that the engineered bacteria will not begin to contaminate the containment system as well. However, due to the part ending up around 5 kb and time constraints, the team was unsuccessful at cloning the part into the iGEM backbone in time for submission and it was not submitted.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Basic Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Basic parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

By means of collaboration hub provided by iGEM HQ, it is convenient to get in touch with OUC-China iGEM team. According to the Collaboration Request, we understood that they were investigating Aquatic organisms’ outbreak caused by water eutrophication and looking for collaboration. As a result, we not only shared our local experiences about eutrophication in Taiwan but also documented several governmental reports, online Data database and academic papers in National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan for them. Similarly, they shared lots of information and toughed us to model out project by Michaelis - Menten equation.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and thereby increasing your yield.
Also in the case that the purple intermediates inhibit their own production (feedback inhibition), structuring the bacteria and thereby minimizing the intermediate concentration could have a beneficial effect on the yield (Kiely, Regan, and Logan 2011).
Figure 24: Industrial process with metabolic pathway divided among a microbial consortium. In this process the orange substrate is converted by the blue bacterium to the purple intermediate. This intermediate is converted to the green end product by the red bacterium. In the upper process, the bacteria are not structured and the outflow contains also substrate and intermediates next to the end product. In the bottom example the cells are structured to improve the conversion of the intermediate to the end product.
To be able to make structured biofilms of different (types) of bacteria, it is important that we prove that we are able to structure the bacteria and that these bacteria stay in place.
To prove this we used cells producing the fluorescent proteins GFP and RFP, to resemble different strains in an industrial process. To to show that we can structure these cells and that they do not mix, we wanted to assess the distribution of the cells after printing with confocal microscopy (Figure 2).
Figure 25: Layer formation experiment setup. To test whether we can produce structured layers of bacteria that do not mix, the above experiment will be conducted. Layers of cell producing GFP and RFP will be printed on top of each other and with confocal microscopy the spatial distribution of the cells will be assessed.
Methodology
We have transformed TOP10 cells with the plasmids I27020 (GFP) and I13521 (RFP) (Table 12.). We grew cultures of these cells overnight in 5 mL LB with antibiotics. To obtain 500 μL of bio-ink, 1 mL of cells was spun down at 4000 rpm for 3 minutes and the supernatant discarded. We added 100 μL of sterile LB, resuspended the cells and then added 400 μL of 1% w/v sodium alginate. This mixture was vortexed to ensure that the cells are homogeneously distributed. The formation of the hydrogel by alginate and CaCl2 is discussed in more detail in the hardware section.
Table 12. Strains used for the production of bio-ink
To be able to visualize the cells, the bio-ink needed to be printed on a coverslip suitable for the spinning disk microscope instead of the usual agar plates (See hardware). We used plasma-cleaned coverslips, since the normal coverslips are very"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Jamboré Meeting
Policy and Practices
On July 18th, we've hosted Jamboré, a brazilian meeting especially organized for Latin American teams to discuss Synthetic Biology and topics relevant to their projects. We could hear directly from iGEM UFSCar and Equipe iGEM-UFMG about their latest progress and discuss with them issues we've had in common. We also had an extra-special keynote talk  by Anita Sifuentes, from iGEM headquarters! We were very happy that we could create a welcoming environment to share ideas, issues and our experiences so far in this year's competition.
Meeting program
RubberBye - Brasil-USP Project Presentation
In this talk, we presented our ideas on how to use a synthetic system to degrade natural rubber, while still ending up with product of high commercial value: fuel. We also shared some of our plans to turn it into a startup soon enough!

This device also contains a generator of red fluorescent protein (RFP) controlled by the cstA promoter. PcstA is induced by cAMP, which makes it usable as a reporter system for our bacterial two-hybrid system. When using a cyaA-deficient strain, red colonies will form when a protein-protein interaction occurs.
In our project we worked with the three target proteins: carbon storage regulator A, CsrA, ( BBa_K1638037 ), the RNase adaptive protein, Yhbj, ( BBa_K1638038 ) and the RNA-binding protein, Hfq. ( BBa_K1638039 ).
Figure 3: Modified peptide aptamer Device: Peptide aptamer-scaffold fused to the T18 domain through intein and a flexible linker.
Our device with T18 domain is our peptide aptamer device. It contains the human thioredoxin (hTrx)-based peptide aptamer conjugated to the T18 domains through a flexible linker. The device is controlled by the strong hybrid promoter PLlacO-1. Reference: Lutz R, Bujard H. Independent and tight regulation of transcriptional units in Escherichia coli via the LacR/O, the TetR/O and AraC/I1-I2 regulatory elements. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 15;25(6):1203-10
[PubMed]
The hTrx-scaffold contains a XhoI restriction site that enables insertion of a random nucleotide library. The resctrion site is situated in the active site of hTrx leaving it functionless when a library is inserted. The design of this peptide aptamer is inspired by Borghouts C. et al..

Background
Artificial design of enzymes is an important theme in synthetic biology, usually in order to fundamentally increase enzyme efficiency or to achieve de novo enzyme activities. However, due to our limited knowledge of how the coding sequence determines the 3D structure, and in turn decides the function of a protein, rational design of these molecular machines is basically not possible in current stages.
Enzymes are designed by the nature, so it would be feasible to utilize the power of natural selection: evolution to design our desired enzymes. Directed Evolution (DE) thus emerges. It is now a part of the industrial standard for applying an enzyme found in nature to mass production or other specific purposes, and the method itself has won the Nobel Prize of chemistry in 2018, which reveals its significant impact to the society. However, directed evolution always suffers from low throughput in screenin. It is usually troublesome for desired property of enzyme, such its productivity of small molecules, to be converted into the growth pressure of chassis cells. Thus, the screening step in DE depends heavily depends on manual assays such as fluorescence reporters or HPLC. The throughput of these manual screening techniques is limited to around thousands, which is far smaller than the theoretical library space of an enzyme.
In the light of current techniques, the XJTU iGEM team has proposed a new framework for directed evolution. We have applied this framework to promote the productivity of D-psicose, a valuable rare sugar. In this case, the productivity of final product, D-psicose, undergoes a series of conversion and finally yields a distinguishable growth pressure to individual chassis cell. Four genetic devices have been constructed and unit tests been performed on each to ensure that the final device will work. The four devices are Sensing Circuit, Selecting Circuit, Coupling Circuit and Evolving Circuit.
This page emphasizes the mechanisms of the whole system. Go to Demostration page to know how we characterize our devices in detail!

With more time, it would be interesting to repeat the toxicity experiment using hydroxylamine to determine the threshold concentration that causes cell death.  We expect that in vivo, the hydroxylamine to nitrite reaction catalyzed by HAO  happens very quickly and that even at high throughput, hydroxylamine should not accumulate in the cell.

Regulation
To make the final product even safer, we will use a kill switch designed for each organism to minimize the risk of release to the environment. For B. subtilis we plan to use a part developed by METU_TURKEY 2013 (BBa_K1197007) . The kill switch turns on in absence of IPTG, an inducer of the B. subtilis promoter used in our project, so as the IPTG supplement is fully consumed, the bacteria dies.
In E. coli we would add the kill switch designed by the Technion-HS 2015 team , tying the bacteria to a specific medium containing AHL.  The kill switch was submitted by the team: BBa_K1767003 .  The illustrated circuit can be seen in Figure 1.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Modeling#netlogo_-_-_TEXT.html," with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

BBa_K1763444 is our highest quality part: it is extremely well documented, from construct generation, to purification and expression of our final recombinant peptide, to even validating complete and proper function of the module.  We hypothesized that when the module containing sfGFP would spin with silk dope in small concentrations, the silk would fluorescence in fiber form.  As our micrograph analysis and stress/strain analysis indicates, we have successfully produced a silk fiber and fluoresces, consistent with proper function of sfGFP.  Our pat is extremely innovative, in that it can be extremely modularized to fit any functional domain of interest from the Registry of Standard Parts, and that any team can quickly screen these functional domains for proper function when processing silk, instead of having to produce direct silk fusions.  This product is extremely useful to the community, as the first novel peptide used to add new biochemical functions to silk structures.

Popular Science Creation
Department of Biological Science and Technology and Department of Communication and Technology cooperated to make a Brief introduction to synthetic biology.With the skill of CT and knowledge of DBT, we make a video with four simple Q&As.
We hope this short interview can help the public understand the applications and techniques, as well as the influence of synthesis biology. Also we hope that this video can decrease irrational fear of Genetically modified creature, and build the positive concept.
This short interview will be put on the popular science website – KEBOWEN , sharing it to the whole Chinese-speaking region.
Surveys
We have designed a survey. Please click to View the English Version File(PDF) or View the Traditional Chinese Version Form .
We received 360 valid surveys. And the results are as follow:
Figure 1.
Fig. 1 shows that one third of people have ever heard about the synthetic biology. Meaning that, we still have a lot of progressing space to promote biology related knowledge.
Figure 2.
Figure 3.
From the Fig. 2, we found that about one third of people accept the synthetic biology, and when Fig. 2 compared with the Fig. 3, we could see that the age between twenty and thirty contribute the most on ""accept"" option, and the age between ten and twenty also choose the accept one as their answer. Therefore, we could see that this cutting edge science, synthetic biology, is taught in almost college students as well as senior students in Taiwan. So, these ranges of people have the tendency to accept synthetic biology.
Figure 4.
We continued analyzing the people who have ever heard about synthetic biology, and from Fig. 4, we found that only sixty three percent of people really knew the correct definition of synthetic biology. As a result, we must do our best not only on popularizing the synthetic biology but also letting people know it completely.

We made colorful double-side-L-shaped folders, which were designed by De-Jung Tseng. We hoped that those who received our folders could have a deep impression on NCTU iGEM team as well as our experimental topic ,E. coline, and our experimental purposes which is solving the problem of energy crisis and air pollution, life would  be better by our project.

Population Dynamics
1 Overview
In this section, we want to model the proportion of the plasmid that is knocked out after the addition of Cre when         accounting for population dynamics, namely cell replication and death. Here, as before, we wish to ﬁnd how the gene         of interest (GOI) concentration will eventually decrease. Here, we assume that the population has reached carrying capacity and so the rate of cell replication is equal to the rate of cell death. We also assume all cells with the construct have Cre constitutively         produced after the activation of the construct.
As described in the Cre module model, the GOI is separated from the origin of replication (ORI) when Cre recombinase         cuts the construct at the lox sites.
During each cell replication, all plasmids with an ORI will be replicated before the cell divides. If an unrecombined         construct (with both the GOI and the ORI) replicates, it would create another copy of itself. Any plasmids with only         the GOI cannot replicate as they lack an ORI. The plasmids with only an ORI would also replicate.
Here, we will refer to the proportion of unrecombined plasmid as S, the proportion of the recombined version (having         the GOI and ORI in separate plasmids) as P, and the proportion of ORI-only plasmids from the replication of the recombined         version as N.
Referring to the figure below, during cell replication, when S replicates, it will generate a copy of S, while when P and N replicate,         they will generate a copy of N. Because we assume the cell population is at the carrying capacity, meaning that the         rate of cell replication will be equal to the rate of cell death. Thus, we will only have to consider the replication         and death mechanism for P because the rates are balanced for S and N.
Because we could not conﬁrm the"

Secondly, this method ensures us to get the perfect circuits as soon as possible. It makes constructing long designed genetic circuit a more flexible process compared to the original gene synthesis and it is just the same way as an engineer welds all electronic components together to make a circuit board with expected function. Moreover, in this case, we won’t need to repeat constructing the same modules used in different circuits.
Thirdly, Gibson assembly is capable for successful assembly of multiple DNA fragments. Hence, verified modules can later be integrated with others quickly.

PhD
in condensed matter physics, having primarily studied quantum physics dots. He has also participated in the NASA-funded HI-SEAS Mars stimulation.
What are your perspectives on the ethical implications of establishing a Mars colony?
The hardest part of human space colonization is humans. Honestly, it goes back to the idea that we, as a society, are risk-averse right now. The reality is that if you are sending people to Mars, you are setting them up in a situation that is risky, and for many reasons, it’s not just due to resource or psychological constraints; they have to get there; they’re got to cross interplanetary space, which hasn’t been done before; they’ve got to live with a significant light delay between planets, so that with any emergency that comes up, it means a minimum 20-40 minute contact with Earth. I did the HI-SEAS Mars stimulation, and we were well-versed in the fact that any time we had a problem, it would take a good 20-40 minutes in order to get information back to us. How do you deal with that? Or, if you’ve got a medical emergency, how do you deal with that immediately? And, the truth of the matter is that we’re talking about it today as if we’re leaving today, but we don't leave until 10-20 years, and by that time, we’ve got improvements in computer technology, hardware medicine, robotic medicine… So from an ethical perspective, you then have to talk about things like genetic engineering… anytime you talk about life, there’s going to be some ethical concern.
What you guys are doing is really interesting. You recognize that genetics and organisms behave like machines and they can be programmed with a genetic modification. I think that’s the perception that needs to grow. The fear is always going to be that we’re taking resources away from existing life, and the thing is that it’s not the goal. The goal is to create a machine that is a component in a recovery system.
Outreach and Collaborations
After having heard the opinions of several professors, researchers, and students in this field, we decided to base our outreach on educating the general public about synthetic biology and Mars colonization. We have presented at several elementary schools. The main purpose of these presentations was to educate kids about synthetic biology at an early age. We made a 15-minute, condensed and simplified overview of our project, including the way our bioreactor worked and what purposes our project had. As a team led by students, we believe fostering"

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane for complete elution of bound DNA. The average eluate volume is 48 µl from 50 µl elution buffer volume, and 28 µl from 30 µl. Elution efficiency is dependent on pH. The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5. When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent. The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.

As mentioned in the collaboration section, we designed our project with the help of students from the Design Academy Eindhoven.  We met with them twice : The first time, we visited them and took part in a design workshop.  The second meeting was a lab day for them to see what our everyday life in the lab looks like.
May: National Meetup
We organized the meet-up of all interested Dutch iGEM teams. Four teams took part: Groningen, Leiden, Eindhoven, and us.
June: Synenergene forum
The Rathenau institute organised a conference , for relevant stakeholders regarding the future of synthetic biology, to explore the right conditions for responsible research and innovation.
September: RIVM forum
Concluding our Collaboration with the RIVM, we attended a meeting organized by the RIVM and the Rathenau institute, with the theme: “Veilig verder met synthetische biologie”, or “Making safe progress in synthetic biology”. During this meeting we gave a short presentation about the topic of our project and how we integrated ""Safe by design"" through toxin specificity, controlled expression of the toxin and confinement of our product to the beehive.
October: Lunch lecture at Wageningen University
The last month before the wiki-freeze we organized a lunch lecture at the university for researchers, beekeepers, students and other interested people to present our project and collect input for the last time.
Media
We have contacted various newspaper and magazines to inform the public about our project. Not only did we tried to reach out to the Wageningen community but also to alumni, beekeepers, scientist from outside Wageningen and people who are interested in synthetic biology. Partly to receive input about or project and partly because we are just very proud about how our project turned out. We also proactively kept people updated with the help of a Social Media campaign.

The first peak from the copurification showed a distinct cellulase activity. As the peak ran considerably higher than expected than either the scaffoldin     or the CellulaseCCEL in the gelfitration, it can be expected that this peak contains a successfully formed complex between CellulaseCCEL and the CTHE     scaffoldin.

An important algorithm is how to project a special area in special color. The key is coordinate system transformation between camera view(2560*2160) and projector(1024*768). To simplify the question, only the left projector edge and 4 ROIs(region of interesting) are drew. Every point(X_{projector}, y_projector) in the image will be generated from following formula(Fig. 10). \left[\begin{matrix}x_{projector}\\y_{projector}\end{matrix}\right]= {\frac{1024}{L}}(\left[\begin{matrix}x_1\\y_1\end{matrix}\right]-\left[\begin{matrix}x_0\\y_0\end{matrix}\right])
In ROIs Setting, every ROI can define the color(Blue or Red) and intensity(0~255). 4 ROIs can move by mouse in real time, so the projector can response immediately. Generated image is showed a full-screen window in another extended desktop. Projector just show on extended desktop.

Team Overview
Team
This year 10 students started the iGEM USTC Software team: Chen Liao, Zheng Wang, Kun Jiang, Jue Wang, Luojun Wang, Yubo Qi, Zhaoyi Li, Zhengda He, Shangyu Luo and Mort Yao. There are only 8 of us in the picture, while the only female team member, Jue Wang was in Beijing engaging for her TOEFL exam, and Shangyu Luo had gone to Hong Kong for studying in The University of Hong Kong as an exchange student. What a pity! But they will join us at the iGEM 2010 Jamboree.
USTC has formed two IGEM teams this year, one wet lab team and one dry lab team. As many students majoring in biology was attracted to the wet lab team, our team consists of students from other departments, such as Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and so on. Thanks to our instructors Hao Jiang and Zhaofeng Luo, with their professional instruction, we are guided to decide the project plan, design and implementation.

Measurement of parts
BIT-China collaborated with Team Tianjin in the measurement of their parts.
They send their sample of K1361007 to us, in which CsgA, the major subunit of curli fiber modified by twin 7Xhis tag, is under control of a strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100. And the K1361007 was arrived in company with a parallel part where BBa_J23104, a relatively weaker promoter, replaced the BBa_J23100. In order to find the better fit of promoter, we measure the cell growth curve of each part and Bradford protein assay was adopted to monitor the total quantity of secrete protein in matrix.
Cell growth curve of BBa_J23100 and parallel that a relatively weaker promoter was used to control the CsgA secrete level.
This figure shows the absorbency of secrete protein in culture between K1361007 and parallel. No significant divergence was found.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Secretion_-_-_TEXT.html," lysis genes become activated (George et al., 1987).
Advantages:
No chemicals required
Lysis is automatic
Disadvantages:
Heating our fermenters on Mars would use large amounts of precious power
Lysis results in dead cells that can no longer replicate and produce PHB, so our system would need to be reinoculated consistently
Cellular debris from lysis makes separation of PHB more difficult
We ultimately chose a secretion based system because of its advantages in space. This system requires no chemical input, no replacement of bacteria, and provides continuous production that saves both time and room aboard the spacecraft, which are both precious commodities during space travel.
We decided to implement a PHB secretion system that takes advantage of the naturally-occurring Type I hemolysin system found in E. coli. Intracellular PHB granules are tagged with the hemolysin secretion motif, known as HlyA, and the granule is then secreted from the cell via hemolysin membrane transport proteins. This system is advantageous for our space application because it reduces extra materials and power needed, allows cells to remain intact for easier PHB separation from the liquid media, and only requires minimal bacteria replacement. The hemolysin secretion mechanism has been used previously by the SDU-Denmark 2016 and Utah 2009 iGEM teams for PHB secretion. We have used BBa_K2018024 from the SDU-Denmark 2016 as the basis for the design of our secretion complex.
Our Secretion System
Type I Secretion
PHB is secreted through the hemolysin pathway, a Type I secretion system, that is endogenous to E. coli. Naturally, the hemolysin toxin (HlyA) is secreted from E. coli as a defence mechanism. This is a single-step process that involves three additional proteins: HlyB, HlyD, and TolC. HlyB is an active transport protein that uses ATP in the cytoplasmic membrane, HlyD is a membrane fusion protein that spans the periplasm and connects the inner and outer membrane proteins, and TolC rests in the outer membrane. When HlyB recognizes the C-terminus of HlyA, it stimulates formation of the secretion channel and the toxin is secreted (Thomas et al., 2014).
To use this system in our biologically engineered cells, we added the C-terminus of HlyA to the end of a phasin molecule. Phasin, coded for by phaP,"

About ABACUS
The integrated plugin ABACUS is actually constituted by two parts: the executable, written in Java and not hosted on Github, and the caller, written in Python and located in biohub/abacus/. Due to some technical reasons, we cannot provide the executable. If you want to test ABACUS locally, you may use one of our remote servers by writing the following content to biohub/abacus/config.json:
{ ""ABACUS_REMOTE_SERVERS"": [ ""http://106.15.205.191/"" ] }
Setting up the frontend
The frontend of Biohub 2.0 lies in frontend/main. Firstly you should install the dependencies:
$ cd frontend/main $ npm install
During developing, Biohub 2.0 uses webpack-dev-server for hot-reloading. You should configure the proxies in frontend/main/domain.config.json to make it work properly. As above, an example file is available:
{ ""dev"": {         // during developing, plugins and the main frontend are compiled and served separately         // the following field maps each plugin to a port where its frontend files served         // to serve a plugin frontend files, run `npm run dev <port>` in its frontend"
Harvard,2009,Team:Harvard#Daily_-_-_TEXT.html," Nfluc-PIF3,  Cfluc-PIF3,  PIF3-Nfluc,  PIF3-Cfluc.   Based on the suggestion that fusing things to the N terminal of luciferase reduces function, we should only attach proteins to the C terminal of the Nfluc. This leaves us with several possible pairs,  Nfluc-PhyB/C-fluc PIF3  Nfluc-PhyB/ PIF3-Cfluc  PhyB-Cfluc/ Nfluc-PIF3 Cfluc-PhyB/ Nfluc-PIF3.    Then the next question is do w e want to put the N or C terminus on PhyB or on PIF3? According to Phee, the cDNA of phyB or PAPP2C was subcloned into BiFC vector containing either the Nterminal region of YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) for YFPNE:: PhyB or the C-terminal region of YFP for YFP-CE::PAPP2C) (Phee et al, 2008). The Phee paper and Subramanian paper both put the protein fragment on the N terminus of PhyB, which leaves us with the following.  Nfluc-PhyB/C-fluc PIF3 Nfluc-PhyB/ PIF3-Cfluc Cfluc-PhyB/ Nfluc-PIF3  Based on the following: Subramanian used the following BRET pair: RLuc-PhyB:PiF3-YFP (Subramainan et al., 2006), we should probably follow the same orientations.  Nfluc-PhyB/ PIF3-Cfluc   Red-shift of reconstituted proteins. Another factor that must be taken into consideration is the red shift known to result from reconstitution of the protein.  In the paper by Cissell et al., they found that the emission max of the reconstituted Renilla luciferase was 495 nm, while native luciferase has a peak at 485 nm, a shift also seen with GFP. They describe this shift being a function of the change in proximity of amino acids around the chromophore as compared with native Rluc, and the  presence of the negatively charged DNA which in these experiments drove the association (Cissell et al, 2009). I assume this may also be an issue with the firefly luciferase.   Lack"

The graphs (Figure 11.) indicate that this distance stays between 45 and 70 Å. This is a very satisfactory result, showing that we can design uses for our platform both with separate functions used independently and with two halves of a molecule that need to be assembled to produce a function. We had also considered using FRET to test this distance experimentally, which is now possible seeing as the distance between these two heads remain at an appropriate distance to observe interactions of that nature.
By selecting only specific residues, we can measure the variability of certain regions of our platform through the RMSD value, calculated on the whole protein, including the side chains this time.
Figure 12: Evolution of the RMSD of the different domains of our Cerberus protein over time: N-terminal linker in yellow, mSA2 in red and CBM3a in green
The structured domains keep their stability over time, with the RMSD of the CBM3a staying at around 2 Å throughout the simulation, and the streptavidin at around 4 Å.
The N-terminal linker however shows great flexibility, never keeping the same position during the time period studied here, with an RMSD peaking at close to 60 Å. The C-terminal linker presents a similar behaviour, with peaks at around 40 Å, it is not shown here for clarity’s sake.
This confirms that what we designed to be stable remains stable, and what was designed to be flexible remains flexible.
Conclusion
Thanks to these results, we are able to determine through multiple methods that out molecular binding platform behaves as planned when we designed it. Using the LAAS’ innovative robotic inspired methods, we overcame the challenge presented by the Intrinsically Disordered Regions. This novel approach circumvented the limitations that classic modelling software encounters and allowed us to progress in our project.
By measuring the RMSD of each domain of our protein and following their positions over the duration of our simulations, we can confirm that our linker regions are too flexible to resolve a definite conformation. Despite this extreme variability, we never observed entanglement between them during this simulation, nor did we see them bring the binding sites of our domains into contact. With this information, we can also be sure that the linkers shouldn't adopt a conformation where these binding sites become unavailable to their ligands.
Although we observe that the biotin molecule exits the streptavidin docking site during the molecular dynamics simulation, this occurs quite often in protein molecular modelling and is not a great source of concern for the viability of our platform. It is important to remember that"

Phenylketonuria
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder where the body is unable to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. This is because of a deficiency of an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. Absence of PAH causes phenylalanine to break down into phenylketone instead. A chronically high level of phenylalanine, called hyperphenylalaninemia will result. Phenylalanine then accumulates in blood and tissues and results in characteristic symptoms of PKU.  Left untreated, PKU can lead to problems with brain development resulting in progressive mental retardation and brain damage.
PKU is usually detected at birth, and all new born babies are tested for the disease using a heel prick test. However, there is currently no cure for the condition. Current treatments are centred around following a very strict low-protein diet. By engineering the E.ncapsulator to manufacture PAH, we hope that our cells can be taken as a dietary supplement to replace the missing PAH. This will break down phenylalanine from the diet in the gut, before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.

If we run the simulation with the default parameters, we can see that LacI repress the transcription of c1ts. The oscillations are caused by the division process.
We can observe that under these conditions the c1ts promoter is always repressed.
The bistable works correctly with these conditions.
Turning off the bistable
Secondly, applying 1 µmol of IPTG to induce the off-state, we observe how the protein LacI disappears. However, this state is mucho more unstable and sometimes c1ts repressors fall from the promoters they are repressing and LacI is expressed fast.
Specifically, in the second 15000 we can see that c1ts are not repressing and that allows the RNA transcription and modify the bistable state. Moreover, we can see peaks of LacI expression that are turned off by c1ts, but they should not appear if this state was perfectly stable.
Turning on the bistable
In third place, we have increased the temperature of the system in the second 6500 to see how the bistable turns on. Here we see that this process is much effective than in"

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," hold more “fast” codons, which will lead to higher translation elongation rate and thus higher protein expression, whereas the slow regions will hold more “slow” codons leading to lower expression. This data is summarized in the following figure.
Codon Frequency in Fast and Slow regions of the Genome
Fast codons show a positive correlation between frequency and TIR, slow codons show a negative correlation
Ng, C. Y., Farasat, I., Zomorrodi, A. R., Maranas, C. D. & Salis, H. M. Model-guided construction and optimization of synthetic metabolism for chemical product synthesis. Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center Spring Retreat (2013), Berkeley, CA.
Codons whose frequency increases with TIR are defined as fast codons. Those with declining frequency in relation to TIR are slow codons, and those with no correlation are defined as independent of TIR. This can be viewed in the figure above as the slope of the graphs for each codon showing ratio and TIR. If ratio increases with TIR, the codon is fast, and the graph displays positive slope. Slow codons slow negative slope, and TIR independent codons show essentially no slope.
Example of a fast codon. Notice that the codon is more frequent in higher TIR regions of the genome.
In another related research project, researchers developed a program which models the process of translation elongation. This program takes into account the chemical binding of individual codons to ribosomes as well as numerous other relevant biological criteria and is able to predict the time taken by a ribosome to add an amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain. This is known as the “insertion time” for that codon. Using this software, a list of the insertion times for each codon was compiled. It is theorized that codons with longer insertion times will have lower translation elongation rates and thus lower the expression of the protein of the particular CDS that contains the slow codons. This data is summarized in the table below.
Codons with faster insertion times are theorized to lead to higher protein expression.
2) Apply These Criteria to a Reporter Gene (GFP)
It is important to understand the difference between the slow, fast, rare, common, and insertion times criteria. Common and rare codons are based on the frequency of particular degenerate codons in the entire E. coli genome. The hypothesis that common codons will lead to higher expression of proteins is based on the idea that cells have become optimized through evolution to efficiently translate proteins necessary to their survival."
Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project#future_-_-_TEXT.html,"Electron transport chain functionality can be impaired by a variety of defects on the DNA level: not only point mutation and local deletions in genes encoding proteins of the chain, but also deletions of larger fragments or even the whole mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Normal mitochondrion contains from 2 to 10 copies of mtDNA. Defects in mitochondrial DNA result in severe medical disorders which are especially evident in tissues which require large amounts of energy (such as nervous and muscle tissue). Effects of these impairments are neuro and myopathies [20]. The standard therapy based on bypassing interrupted pathways does not apply under these circumstances. The administration of enzyme cofactors and other metabolically active substances is not largely effective and may be applied only as supplementary therapy. We are forced to seek novel treatment strategies to cure patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders [7]. Currently the most commonly used method of mitochondrial transformation is the ""gene gun"" approach which is based on the delivery of metal beads coated with DNA into the cell. This method is mostly limited to plants and fungi and has low therapeutic potential [7]. Current mammalian mitochondrial transformation techniques like electroporation also have serious limitations. Whole process takes place ex vivo and causes irreversible damage to the mitochondrion which makes its efficient reintroduction into the cell almost impossible. The conjugation between bacteria and mitochondria is free from these side effects. Moreover, this phenomenon has been preformed in vitro.[22]. More recently a conjugation between two strains of bacteria within the cytoplasm of a mammalian cell has been observed. These findings suggest that conjugation between a bacterium and a mitochondrion is feasible [10].
Details
To locate the copy of the mitochondrial genome into bacterial cell the pBACrNESd plasmid will be used. It is based upon the Bacterial Artificial Chromosome. Replication origin (ori R6K), kanamycin resistance gen (kanR) and replication complex genes (repE, parA, parC) from pBACrNESd plasmid will be fused with origin of transfer (oriTF) from a natural conjugative F plasmid. Unique restriction site will be introduced into the mitochondrial genome by PCR reaction and the described construct will be inserted into mitochondrion. To enable conjugation proteins encoded on RP4 plasmid (Tc, MuKm, Tn7) will be placed in the cytoplasmic operon. These genes are responsible for pillus formation and transport of a single stranded DNA. The cell with this system will conjugate with any structure surrounded by a lipid bilayer."

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#References_-_-_TEXT.html," while the same population of bacteria dies without the presence of acetosyringone.
Primary selection of virA variants with novel binding properties
After the determination of the MIC the screening for virA variants with new binding properties could be started. The aim of this screening is to find versions of virA that can be induced by one of the tested substances capsaicin, homovanillic acid, dopamine and 3-O methyldopamine.
For that purpose one should transform the mutagenised variants of virA to E. coli and plate the bacteria on LB-agar with the determined kanamycin concentration. At the same time a mixture of all mentioned substances should be present in the agar. All bacteria including a virA variant that is activated by at least one of the substances will grow on the selective agar, since it expresses the kanamycin resistance. With this step it is thereby possible to select thousands of bacteria with unwanted versions of virA from few individuals with wanted binding properties.
At this point it must be mentioned that some grown colonies might still be non-induced and false positive results. As the virA gene has been randomly changed before, it is possible that some variants occur where the receptor is always active. This would lead to a constitutive expression of the reporter gene and thereby a high level of kanamycin resistance. To exclude those false positive clones, the bacteria should be tested whether they are only resistance to the MIC of kanamycin when one of the tested substances is present. Every colony that can withstand the high kanamycin concentration without any inductor includes a constitutive version of virA and should be discarded in further analysis.
Quantitative analysis of virA variants after induction with novel substances
Should we find some bacteria that respond to the presence of the tested substances (capsaicin, homovanillic acid, dopamine and 3-O methyldopamine) by growing on the MIC of kanamycin, it is desirable to quantify the induction. For that purpose it is appropriate to change the read out system from kanamycin resistence to luciferase expression. This complex and time consuming task can easily be achieved without any cloning step, when using the advantage of our two plasmid system.
After primary selection each bacteria includes two plasmids with different origins of replication (oris). The plasmid with the virA is in a common <partinfo>pSB1AT3</partinfo> backbone with a ColE1 ori. Contrary to that the read out plasmid with KanR has a special ori, named R6K, which can only amplify"

When the BioBricks are touched by the handle, a system which provides skills to players will start. The system will automatically select a suitable gene chain according to the gene blocks being touched. To start the game and acquire special skills, player must touch the virtual promoter and terminator, respectively. If players touch the wrong gene, the gene chains will be overloaded, which means they are cleared and regenerated. Players are provided with four special skills: explosion (reduce the blood volume of all enemies), blood supplement (return to full-blood status), no-enemy status and shooting speed acceleration. What's more, players will get extra rewards when they find symbols of """"BioDesigner Dolphin"""". After players complete the game, their duration time and scores acquired will be ranked on the leaderboard in the main UI interface. What’s more, to make the game more interesting, there is also a rewarding mechanism. A searching “magnifier” is randomly generated in the game, and by touching it, the gene chains will be instantly filled and players can release the current skills.

In order to follow this thematic, we chose to focus our workshop on the incredible features of biodiversity, how to use it in synthetic biology, and what are legal limits on GMO use in France.
Experiments
Observation by microscopy of V. harveyi (rfp) transformant
Ligation of pBBR1MCS-4 and Vh3 at 16°C overnight, and transformation in competent E. coli (Stellars)
New cytotoxicity tests on petri dishes were made with the leucrocine and cOT2 supernatants. This time with appropriate discs. Positive control did not work again.
New cytotoxicity tests on petri dishes were made but using pure chloramphenicol. A weak halo was seen. We found out that the V. harveyi strain we used to do cytotoxicity test was maybe! the JMH626 one which was chloramphenicol-resistant.
RT-PCR experiment was made.
To test the Odr10-RFP system and activate pFUS, nitrogen depletion cultures were done and two sources of nitrogen were tested: sulfate ammonium and glutamine. The fluorescence following was made in a plate reader.
New cytotoxicity tests on petri dishes were made starting from a fresh V. harveyi cuture. Leucrocine, cOT2 and D-NY15 (40g/L and 50g/L glucose) productions were tested. Halos are clearly visible for D-NY15 40g / L not concentrated and concentrated 10 times.
A 24 well plate was launched by adding leucrocine, cOT2 and D-NY15 supernatant to V. harveyi cultures in exponential phase.

During this research, 258 respondents from different genders and ages received our investigation.

Figure 4 proportions of different ages
We collected their opinion about obesity and different methods of losing weight, in order to find out a more specific direction of our project.
Figure 5  viewpoints of losing weight on diet (blue: effective; orange: not effective; pink: difficult to hold on; green: difficult to keep the weight off)

Figure 8 viewpoints of losing weight by bariatric surgery (blue: effective; orange: not effective; pink: difficult to hold on; green: difficult to keep the weight off; darker blue: do not know)
The reflection indicates that these prevalent methods to lose weight all have different kinds of defects in some way. So it is high time that we should invent a new therapy which overcome most of these problems in our research.
Figure 9 reasons why people choose not to use weight-reducing aid (orange: side-effect; pink: price; blue: effect; green: not know much; darker blue: others)
Fig 9 shows that side-effect is the most concerned problem people may worry about when using medicines like weight-losing aid. So our primary work is now clear.

As is known to all, the inventions of most anti-obesity drugs on the market focus mainly on the medicine efficacy and the technology breakthrough, however the acceptance of patients and the side effects are under less consideration.

Since we chose a strain of bacteria as our chassis, and bacteria are the most thoroughly researched and widely used, we asked Professor Hu about synthetic biology on microorganisms. Her feeling was, although it has been developing rapidly in the past few years, most of the methods are yet to be applied in large scale, so it is still unheard-of for the majority of people. For governments, since the long-term effect remain unknown, they cannot issue new regulations. This leads to a potential problem: if laboratories or individuals use illegal sources of organisms, or the material is not properly disposed, it might do harm to the human health and environment.
The problem of biosafety cannot be solved without the effort from authorities and academia, as well as the understanding of the general public. After the interview, we became more determined to organize and improve the outreach activities for students.
Through this experience, we gained more understanding about biosafety, and think it is an extremely important topic.

Biological Education for Kid
We organized a STEM activity for children at Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum with another team from Zhejiang University. We designed various games and experiments which involve science knowledge like transcription, translation, and the double-helix structure of DNA molecules. A lot of kids and their parents participated in these games, and they were so fascinated by the laboratory equipment such as the pipette.
The activity was so well-perceived: nearly 1000 children with parents visited our booths that day. We decided to make our activity a project that is easy to carry out by any party, and offers interesting perspectives on complicated biological facts. The following is our project details.

Cloning in pGEMTeasy
After receiving it, the fusion chromoprotein was amplified by PCR and then cloned into pGEMTeasy. Unfortunately, after transforming E.coli and plating the tranformation mix, no colonies display any color. We sequenced the gene cloned to ensure the absence of mutation. The simplest explanation is that the fusion protein is not anymore functional. One may suggest that the fact the chromoproteins need to be in a multimeric form to be functional, prevent the fusion protein to be functional.
As the fusion chromoprotein did not work, the colour switch system that we planned to do is no longer valid.
Alternative pathway
To resolve this issue, we planned to separately express both FwYellow and AeBlue in bacteria. We decided to place the FwYellow under control of a constitutive promoter whereas AeBlue will be place under the Psal inducible promoter, as mentioned above. As previously, the beginning, salicylate concentration is maximal into the agar media leading so both chromoprotein will be expressed. Assuming that the presence of both chromoprotein in the cytoplasm will display a green color, bacteria will be green. However, as bacteria grow into the agar media, the amount of nahR-salicylate complex will decrease through time. Thus, the expression of the AeBlue will decrease whereas the expression of FwYellow will remain equal. As a result, bacteria will gradually change from green to yellow.

During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [5]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [9].
If farmers had the possibility to know when to treat their horses, prevention of mass rupture and other severe consequences like increased resistance development could be achieved. To reach this goal we have developed a model that (based on multiple parameters) calculates the optimal amount of treatments in a specified period. This will avoid unnecessary use of anthelmintics by raising the awareness in farmers regarding when they actually need to treat their horses.
Current Methods for detection
Currently the only method for detecting/counting how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires time sensitive shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing; treating their horses regardless of need which contributes to the resistance problem [10].
Current Methods of Detection
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,4]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance [2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15].
--
Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of horse intestines. Moreover, we have developed new applications on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should"

Measurement: Newcastle
The thermal conductivity of growth media.
Newcastle's 2016 iGEM project looks at the creation of biological electronic components, and as part of their modelling they needed to know the thermal conductivity of different growth media. With a strong team of physicists on board the Exeter team, they came to us for help. With support from our biophysicist supervisor Ryan Edginton , we built an experimental setup (Fig. 1a) that made use of the transient hot wire method (Healy et al 1976).
A 0.65m insulated copper wire (cross-sectional area, 0.05m2) was passed through the centre of a 50mL falcon tube containing the liquid medium to be measured, suspended in a water bath (Fig. 1b). Three thermocouples (Pico Technology TC-08) were attached, one to the wire in contact with the insulation using blue tack, one suspended in the liquid medium 5mm from the wire, and one in the water bath. Power was supplied to the wire at 5A, 1.8V for 600s, generating a small temperature increase of approximately 2°C above room temperature (23 ± 1°C) to avoid convection effects. Our experimental setup was calibrated to the thermal conductivity of water at 20°C, 598.4 $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$. Measurements of two growth media, liquid broth (LB) and M9 were repeated at least in quintuple.
Figure 1a - experimental setup of the transient hot wire method.
Figure 1b - arrangement of thermocouples within the falcon tube measuring thermal conductivity using the transient hot-wire method.
Figure 2 - representative plots of temperature against natural log of time for water, liquid broth and M9 media. A fit was applied from the point where the relationship becomes linear to extract the thermal conductivities.
Nagasaka and Nagashima noted that wire insulation has negligible impact on the measurement of the      thermal conductivity of saline solutions (Nagasaka and Nagashima 1981) and thus can be described by the equation:      $$ \lambda = \frac{Q"

Project Development
As our iGEM project developed, so too did the methods we used. Our project began with a journey through the literature on OMVs, to see what had already been done, and to try to spot the gaps which our project could plug. From this, we identified a range of proteins that could either be overexpressed or knocked-out to induce hypervesiculation. Our aim was to compare the size, number, and stability of OMVs induced by these mutations.
Proteins that could be overexpressed we synthesised from IDT, and cloned into pSB1C3 using 3A assemblly, as for such small parts we felt this was the fastest approach (and free!); proteins that could be knocked-out we designed guide RNAs that fit could be cloned into the noSCAR CRISPR Kit from AddGene, with support from a recent Nature Methods paper [1]. Each of these approaches, however, proved troublesome.
Regarding overexpression parts, a Western Blot revealed that they weren’t expressing from pSB1C3, and so had to clone into the Duet Expression Vectors using Gibson assembly before reliable expression was achieved. The NoSCAR CRISPR system, likewise, seemed to be going well, but we wound up having to pull the plug as deadlines fast approached, where we needed strains to characterise; instead, we ordered knockouts from the Yale Coli Genetic Stock Centre, recommended to us by Dr Jai Tree, a lecturer at UNSW.
Now that we had strains, it was time to begin characterisation. Our first avenue was to try the Zeiss Airyscan LSM 880 microscope; it was only late in the project that we realised that this didn’t have the resolution to see nanoscale-OMVs. This microscope still had use in seeing our localising-fluorescence parts, though. Other papers that characterised OMVs seemed to use Electron Microscopes [2], but we didn’t have access to these.

Chiba,2008,Team:Chiba#Meeting1_-_-_TEXT.html,"08 第1回iGEM勉強会
場所：工学系総合研究棟2階会議室1 今回の題目は「iGEMとはなにか？」ということで公式WEBページの内容とErika Checkの書いた記事を使って進めました。 Webページの内容については本部からの1次情報を読みすすめ、どのようなものなのか、また何が必要なのかなどを理解するところから始めました。 Erikaの記事ではジャーナリストの目からからみた（客観的に見た）、iGEMとはを知ることで、これから自分たちがやろうとしていることに具体性を持たせていきました。 また過去のチームがどのようなことをしたのかにも少し触れていった。多少イメージがくふらませていければと思います。（プレ事前研究といったところ）
後半は、今後の方針についての話 年間予定の確認や、役割分担、そして勉強会の進め方について。 役割分担は、まだはっきりしたことが決まらずまだ分担にまでは至りませんでした。
今後の勉強会の進め方について。 講義形式（前にだれかが立って話をする）にするのか、または、ディスカッション形式（事前に読んできて分からなかった点について解消していく）にするのかを選択するようにしました。 今回は講義形式で進めたので、次回はディスカッション形式にしてみて、どちらがいいかの選択をしてもらいます"

TJU,2015,Team:TJU#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," lactate is the primary metabolites and riboflavin is the secondary.
However, the electricity output cannot sustain for long and decrease promptly (as shown in figure 5).Based on the measurement, samples from anode reaches an excessively low pH (lower than 6.2) which might not meet the survival requirement of Shewanella.
To optimize the system, we try to control the rate of lactate production and adjust the proportion of fermentation bacteria.
Figure 7. The electrical output of co-culture MFCs with optimized division of labor and bacteria proportion.
The maximal potential increased up to 322 mV and could maintain for 30 hours in the optimized three-strain system. (consist of Shewanella and two kinds of E. coli)

Besides, the highest power density can reach to 10mW/m2. b (1)A series of voltage brought by different external resistance from Shewanella + ΔpflB ldhE + B. subtilis (2)The polarization curve and power density of Shewanella + ΔpflB ldhE + B. subtilis MFC system.
The relations between current density and voltage is referred as polarization curve while the power curve can represent the relations between output power density and current density. We can learn from the figure 13, the highest power density of (1) reaches 10 mW/m2 and (2) reaches 17 mW/m2.
Figure 13. (a) The comparison of polarization curve and power curve among Shewanella, Shewanella + MG1655, Shewanella + ΔpflB ldhE + Rf02S. (b)The comparison of polarization curve and power curve among Shewanella, Shewanella + MG1655 and Shewanella + ΔpflB ldhE + B. Subtilis.
It is obvious that the power output in three-strain MFC systems with a more complete division of labor are far greater than single-strain and two-strian MFCs.
It significantly improves the commensalism relations between electricigens and fermentation bacteria"

In this step Intein selfcleaves releasing the peptide aptamer. This is achieved by flushing the   column with 3 BV of cleavage buffer (20 mM Na-HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM threo-1,4-Dimercapto-2,3-  butanediol (DTT)), where after the resin is left at room temperature for 16 h, therefore it is assumed that all   buffer leaves the column as waste in this step.

Now the product is ready to be eluted with column buffer. Since the peptide aptamers are an alternative to   monoclonal antibodies, the concentration of the end product has been chosen by comparison of 50   products from Sigma-Aldrich. Concentrations of the antibodies range from 0.5-2 g/L, the most common   concentration (39 out of 50) was found to be 2 g/L, thus making this the target concentration of PAST’s   products.

Depth Interviews
In order to further validate the safety and clinical recognition of our program, we conducted a thorough interview                 with several physicians and discussed the reliability and effectiveness of Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy                 with dialectical thinking.
In June 2017, we interviewed Ai Zhang, a senior physician who specialized in rheumatoid arthritis at the                 department of rheumatology at the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou university, who was currently studying                 at Gulou Hospital in Nanjing (Figure 15). She was well aware of CAR-T and made a lot of suggestions to us.She                 pointed out the problems in actual operation which we needed to pay attention to and all of these are very                 instructive, such as Treg in the separation of the choice of flow sorting or magnetic bead sorting problems,                 Treg training problems, etc. We also had to further develop analysis and optimization of specific experimental                 programs. Plus, she suggested that we would focus on foreign pharmaceutical giants in CAR-T and Treg and                 other clinical trials of clinical therapy, and learned from some of the lessons learned.
Figure 15. We were interviewing Ai Zhang
Fortunately, we also interviewed Minning Shen, who is the associate chief physician of Nanjing first hospital                 in , Department of Rheumatology (Video 2). She was very concerned about this area and she gave a systematic                 evaluation within her point of view of the existing treatment and Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. Her views                 were consistent with the conclusions we had made in the survey, and again verified the security and reliability                 of our program from an authority expert. She also made a general prediction of the clinical application of                 Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. From the pre-basic research to the real application, Novartis's CAR-T pathways                 were significant for our application. Optimistically, Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy in the treatment of                 rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases will have a good effect.
Through the interview with two physicians, we received a lot of suggestions and opinions, and more of which                 was the recognition of Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. And they were also considered Syn -Notch CAR-T"

Figure 15. The picture of test.
Because the brightness of the RNA-fluorophore complex is very low.(According to reference report, it is only decimusly brighter than the GFP ) And the half- life of RNA is just few minutes. So the concentration of RNA-fluorophore complex is at low level in cells. The Figure 15 has shown the difference among three samples.The sample of intermediate is E.coli with Pλ promoter and aptamer,and it is the brightest. The sample of downmost is E.coli with Pλ promoter, and it is brighter than the sample of uppermost . The sample of uppermost is control test sample, only with M9 medium and DMHBI ,and it is the darkest.We conclude that the aparter is available.

As we perform iterative rounds of competition assays, a few colonies were sequenced to determine their Cas9 mutations. The recurring variants were selected as the potential candidates for more efficient SpCas9. These selected variants of SpCas9 were recreated using Gibson Assembly in order to examine their cleaving efficiency in human cells. An alternative method employed to recreate the mutants was QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Scientific).
After the variants being recreated, we cloned in different gRNAs (eg. WAS-2, TAT) into the plasmids and transfected HEK293T cells with these plasmids. T7 Endonuclease assay was conducted to determine the cleaving efficiency of various variants compared to the wild type SpCas9.
