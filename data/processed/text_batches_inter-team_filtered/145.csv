Investigation
We collected many food waste samples from different sources, i.e., school, family and the canteen. After the collection, we obtained diversified and a large amount of samples, which provides a strong support for us to build a more realistic and reasonable database. Then we sent the sample to Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences test the salt concentrations of the waste.
Communication
CGEM Forum
Besides the idea-exchange seminar we had with the experts in Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science, before the experiments in summer, in August and September we contacted many iGEM teams in China and invited them to attend the CGEM (China Genetically Engineered Machine) Forum in October, which is organized by our team together with CIEI-BJ.
On 4th, Oct. the First CGEM Forum was held in the meeting room “Reddish Lake” on the 4th floor of WenJin International Hotel. In respond to the invitation, two high-school teams (HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou and RDFZ-China) and one college team from Beijing institute of technology came to the forum. In total, more than 70 teachers and students attended the conference. Our team was in duty of welcoming, leading the people, setting the room, as well as doing signing up for visitors.
During the seminar, teams first gave presentations on their own topics on the stage; then, the professors provided advice and improvement directions from many aspects including topic (purpose, experiment design, influence, potential danger), power point (words, color, number of pages), and speech (content, volume, order of speaker, motion, time management). Dr. Li, Dr. Cheng and Dr. Xue kindly provided every team with suggestions and opinions.
Through communication with members in other teams after all speeches and comments were given, we gladly heard that they considered the forum as a useful chance to modify their own presenting process. “The suggestions from Dr. Wang made us jump out"

The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

July 21, 2008: Code Rush #2
We're nearing our alpha release, which (finally set in stone) is Friday. Or Saturday. Admittedly, we set this on wobbly stone. But it'll be out, I promise :). Contain yourselves.
Today we met with some JBEI members and one of the developers of BioStudio. Jonathan Goler, JBEI , worked on BioJADE and talked a bit about his current status with BioJADE's development (he also initiated the MIT Parts registry! Wow! =O). Sarah Richardson, one of the developers of BioStudio , is a genetics grad student from John Hopkins working here at Berkeley during the summer at Arkin lab. Tim, JBEI , has a fair amount experience with the Biobricks/Pobol community and hopes to set further standards for the synthetic biology community. Tim is part of the JBEI registry project. One more person had come to the meeting, but admittedly I completely forgot how to correctly pronounce his name let alone spell it, but I do know he's from JBEI (Doug, any help here?). Sorry!
Either way, I really hope to work with Sarah and Jonathan regarding new views for Clotho. Both have very good already-implemented ideas and it would be great to incorporate them into Clotho.
Tuesday is Anne's day with the SMASH kids. I might head over to Cory to get a few pictures with them.
Wednesday should be a normal coding day, with the exception of Zachary's for lunch with Anne and Doug. I also hope to put my foot down on Wednesday with major changes with my code.
Thursday is SMASH presentation and icon making day.
Friday is cleaning up visuals (resizing windows, confirming working buttons, etc.) and (hopefully) releasing.
Saturday is slack day.

The flux is 0-10,000, meaning they are cycling.  Jess explored deletion of these two reactions to see if removing them would help to push flux through pyruvate synthase and aid nitrogen fixation. Also looked at other ways to produce acetyl coA and other ways to spend pyruvate; however, no result yet for viable knockouts.

Made comparisons between N2 fixing WM1788 at fixed biomass and N2 fixing WM1788 with maximized flavodoxin at fixed biomass. Had to spend some time troubleshooting when the comparison didn’t yield values that we expected.
Did not notice any large differences between values at max flavodoxin and values without max flavodoxin-- ie. can conclude that maximizing flavodoxin as much as possible is already a way for the cell to maximize biomass.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews (Overview)_-_-_TEXT.html,". At all times we attempted to frame our prepared questions as openly as possible, not leading the interviewee. This had an interesting effect on the varying length and content of each interview.
That said, we did attempt to maintain consistency by creating a framework in which we could position our questions. Generally, we opened by asking about the interviewee themselves, after which we asked broad questions relating to Synthetic Biology and their understanding and opinion of it. Afterwards, a general introduction and explanation of our project and biorefineries was given and an immediate reaction was requested. We had a number of questions related to the interviewee’s expertise and their stance on our hypothetical biorefinery which were asked next and we ended by once again asking broad questions related to sustainability. We also asked if they had any advice they would like to offer to future synthetic biologists. So, the general format used for all the interviews was: broad, specific, broad.
It was our hope that by opening the interview with broad questions related to Synthetic Biology the interviewee would begin to think about their own understanding and perception of Synthetic Biology (which is what we were interested in) and would continue to answer the remainder of the questions (those specific questions) through this understanding.
Four interviews were conducted in person, one over Skype and one via e-mail. In all instances we attempted to keep the questions consistent; however interviews that were conducted over Skype or in person obviously held a margin of flexibility.
The interviews
Summaries of the interviews are at our dedicated Interviews page.

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015,Team:OLS Canmore AB CA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," is greatly appreciated that you could give us some insight from firsthand experience. We had a couple more questions regarding this email. Firstly, we were wondering about how you planned to implement the under-sink bioreactors ethically, and while given permission from the home-owners, because as we see it, many people would be scared about putting a bioreactor within their house? We also wondered if you still had the papers you referenced, because we do have some papers that we have read, those ones might be useful for us to look into. If you don't still have copies, no worries, but thank you again! I'm sure we will continue to come up with questions for you, as it is much appreciated that you would be willing to collaborate with us and share your knowledge!
Thanks, Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy iGEM Team
Hi,
I'll have to talk to some of my team about the bioreactor thing. If I remember rightly we weren't looking to make them compulsory, but would have put an incentive scheme in place with water companies for people that used them. We definitely interviewed some people about whether they'd be comfortable having one in their home, and most people weren't as worried as we'd assumed they would be.  I'll have a look for the papers tonight, I don't have access to my google drive from work. If I don't get back to you with them, just send me a reminder email.
Thanks,  Lara

Our second collaboration was also with another team who previously attempted this project, the University of Chicago.  The University of Chicago 2013 iGEM team designed a construct to degrade feathers in the poultry industry but did not complete their construct. They also planned to use the byproducts in the reaction to make useful products “By developing an efficient process for the digestion of keratin, we would not only drastically reduce the cost of disposal but also allow the keratin to be used in products like animal feed, fertilizers and biodegradable plastics. Our final product would be a one-step continuous process in which feather waste could be continually added to B. subtilis cultures.” -University of Chicago. From the collaboration with the University of Chicago we hoped to get advice from them concerning our project and the issue we are tackling, as well as advice for implementation.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#BroaderApplications_-_-_TEXT.html," is a likely solution to combating contamination. This knowledge gave us much confidence towards using our Cld enzyme in regards to  this application.
However, genetically engineered E. coli cannot be simply introduced  into water systems, or even treatment plants. Not only could our synthetic organism act as an invasive species, E. coli is in itself has certain strains which can cause various symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting. Even though the strain used in our project is not harmful, as you’d imagine, introducing the bacteria straight into the water system would be met with huge resistance from the scientific community and general public. In order to use our enzyme in the context of removing perchlorate from ground and surface waters, it must be extracted once synthesized. Our supervisor luckily was aware of a method to purify proteins using Ni-NTA columns. This technology is based on the affinity side amino acid chains have with immobilized metal ions such as the nickel(II) ion (Borhhorst and Falke, 2000). Based on this technology, and with a possible on-Earth application in mind,  a polyhistidine tag was added to the end of our G-Block’s coding sequence in anticipation for the need to extract the enzyme from the cells.
Solid Storage of Oxygen
On a side note, our enzyme could also be used in a solid chemical storage of oxygen since Sodium Perchlorate is solid at SATP. A purified enzyme extract could hypothetically act on this on compound to produce oxygen.  However, our team would need to explore the logistics of this topic, and perform future research before any more conclusion can be made.

Imagine you turn the switch on and the cancer is gone…
Cancer is the second most common cause of death killing about 8.2 million people annually, which equals the total population of New York City.  The global increase of cancer cases and the lack of highly specific therapies for various types of cancer states a clear message:
New approaches have to be found, which allow a level of precision in cancer treatment that has been long-awaited.
Our approach aims at achieving high spatiotemporal control of apoptosis in tumor cells by applying an optogenetic double-killswitch. This system combines clean removal of cancer cells through apoptosis with the accuracy of light-controlled optogenetics. We utilize two optogenetic proteins, to create the desperately needed holy grail of cancer therapy.
This is the goal of OPTOPTOSIS.

Computational Design of Ligand Binding Sites
The bacterial world offers a relatively small selection of chemoreceptors, in comparison           to the vast number of possible ligands. These receptors evolved specifically to recognize           substances, which benefit or harm the organism in some way. On top of that, the fact that           the majority of known receptors today are not well characterized, meant that we had a very few           options of designing chimeric receptors like we initially planned.
In light of the above we had to turn to a new path – redesigning the Tar chemoreceptor           to bind a different ligand using computational biology with the Rosetta software.
Rosetta
Rosetta is a bioinformatics software for macromolecular modeling and design, created           by the Rosetta Commons organization - a collaboration between several universities and           research groups from around the world.
Rosetta development began in the laboratory of Dr. David Baker at the University of           Washington as a structure prediction tool but since then has been expanded to solve           many different computational macromolecular problems.
As of 2016, Rosetta algorithms have been used to predict, design and analyze almost           every set of biomolecular systems: proteins, RNA, DNA, peptides, small molecules and           non-canonical amino acids.
Local installation of Rosetta
For complex problems such as redesigning a protein,            Rosetta requires more computational power than a regular PC            has to offer. While searching for possible computing resources,            we came across the local Technion grid of WLCG.

Quorum​ ​Sensing
Motivation
Can we predict if and when our engineered bacteria will invade their surrounding tissue in order to transfer the classifier plasmids? Tumor invasion is mediated by a quorum sensing mechanism controlling the production of invasin and listeriolysin, the machinery that actuates it. It is a critical module of the integrated system. This basic safety- and efficacy -minded question motivates a closer examination of the system we call “quorum sensing”. It has been thoroughly examined in the literature [ 1 ] and by previous iGEM teams (ETH 2014, KU Leuven 2015, etc.), but with the assumption of spatial equilibrium -- for example, bacteria growing in a well-stirred bioreactor. But what happens with bacteria growing on top of a surface, such as the colon epithelium? Are the existing models adequate to describe this phenomenon emerging at the population level -- or does the distinctly different diffusive environment lead to unexpected phenomena? To answer these questions, we’ve produced a modular matlab code that can serve future iGEM teams concerned with how diffusion can interact with other biological mechanisms.
Overview
Quorum sensing (QS) is the phenomenon of coordinated behaviour triggered by high bacterial population density. The Lux operon, responsible for quorum sensing, is a leaky switch. When it’s turned off, LuxR and LuxI are produced very slowly. LuxI produces a small signalling molecule in the homoserine lactone family (simply called “AHL” hereafter). LuxR is activated by it and in turn induces the Lux operon, in a positive feedback loop. The entire system thus functions as a latch-on switch; once the concentration of AHL enters a critical area, it increases rapidly and reaches a much higher equilibrium. The name “Quorum sensing” is most often used to describe the Lux operon’s regulatory system - but does the operon itself always function as implied by that name? Does it turn on only when the bacterial population density is high? To answer this question, let’s first imagine a thought experiment. In the shady forest underbrush, on top of a wax-covered leaf there is a minuscule water droplet. Measuring no more that 0"

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-t_-_-_TEXT.html," other hand often only have enzymes coding for the final steps of the pathway, more on which later. They rely on a supply of retinal precursors or vitamin A (a group of molecules consisting of retinal and it's metabolites) in their diet [ 16 ]. This is why vitamin A deficiency causes night-blindness as an early symptom in humans [ 17 ].
Retinal biosynthesis
Retinal can be synthesized from the enzymatic cleavage of some carotenes. In our system we focus on cleavage of beta-carotene, partly because it yields 2 all-trans retinal molecules which are the molecules we desire, and partly because the beta-carotene biosynthesis pathway has already been introduced to E. coli by the Cambridge 2009 iGEM team.
The Cambridge construct uses genes from the plant pathogen Pantoea ananatis and our construct completes the pathway to retinal with a gene from the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.
The Cambridge 2009 construct consists of four genes crtE, crtB, crtI and crtY from P. ananatis that together make up the pathway that converts farnesyl pyrophosphate to beta-carotene, which is a precursor for retinal. Farnesyl pyrophosphate is naturally present in E. coli.
• crtE encodes the protein geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate synthase that converts farnesyl pyrophosphate to geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate by elongating it by one unit of isopentenyl.
• crtB encodes the protein phytoene synthase and synthesizes phytoene by putting together two molecules of geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate whilst cutting off 2 molecules of pyrophosphate.
• crtI encodes the protein phytoene dehydrogenase and converts phytoene to lycopene by converting the trans bond to a cis bond and adding more cis double bonds.
• crtY encodes the protein lycopene B-cyclase and converts lycopene to beta-carotene.
The pathway (including the step that generates retinal) is summed up below:
Figure 3: The retinal Biosynthesis pathway.
To introduce the final step from beta-carotene to retinal, we use the gene ninaB from D. melanogaster. This gene encodes the protein beta-carotene 15,15’-monooxygenase, which cleaves beta-carotene to produce two molecules of trans-retinal under the consumption of oxygen [ 18 ]. We"

As specific components wildly fluctuate in price and often go out of stock, we tried to use as many generic components as possible (the exceptions were the cuvette holder, the light sensor and the LEE filters swatch book). These components can be bought from any distributor, allowing  teams from across the world to build their own.
In a real-world environment using generic components would reduce production costs due to lower shipping costs by sourcing them from a nearby manufacturer and there is more competition amongst generic components. As such we can’t give direct purchasing links but you should be able to find them online easily.

NLS
Nuclear localisation signals are peptidesequences that are able to bind to nuclear import receptors. These cause an import of newly synthesized protein through nuclear pores. This feature is caused by several positively charged amino acids. Nuclear localization signals can be located almost anywhere in the peptide chain [57] . We used a nuclear localization signal at the C-terminal end of the protein.

GFP
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was first discovered by Shimomura et al. in the Aequorea jellyﬁsh. They described a slightly green colour of a GFP-containing solution that in the sunlight [63] . The same group of scientists investigated the protein in more detail, and have since discovered many characteristics, including the excitation and emission wavelengths . The most important accomplishment was the cloning of the GFP gene into other organisms to make them fluorescent [64] , [65] . Many scientists have since worked on GFP and introduced mutations to enhance fluorscence levels or change the spectra. Nowadays flourescent proteins exist in different colours exist increasing their range of application even more.

4. 'As farmers are the main gain takers of GM crops with its comparative high yield, how do you ensure that they are well aware about what they are cultivating?
[kvks- http://krishi.icar.gov.in/Index.jsp Krishi] vigyan kendras are set up to aware the farmers and provide them information about seed variety, kind of insects attacking a particular crop,  and many field demonstrations.
5. We also spoke with members of Gene campaign and Asha, one of their main concerns was there are other safe cultivation methods which could be effective if implemented properly. Please comment on the necessity of GM crops.
Other yield increasing cultivation methods involve hybrids where random characters are mixed and getting our favourable character is uncertain. It is time consuming and not efficient. No other methods have produced insecticidal and high yielding crops like GM technology.
6. How do you tackle insect developing resistance to the crop’s killing nature due to insecticidal crops?
This problem of insects developing resistance is existing from olden days even with use of pesticides. Only a small population of the insects were found to develop resistance and there comes an issue if they start to transfer those genes either horizontally or vertically. One of the effective ways is to cultivate a very small percentage of non-bt crop over the perimeter of the land where bt crop is cultivated. Thereby reducing the chance of resistant genes being transferred to large part of the population. This method was found effective and other methods like using a small percentage of pesticides is also done.
7. As 70% of the population of india is involved in agriculture, should patenting of crops be promoted?
This is still under discussion where a balance should be made between protecting the intellectual rights of an innovator and the farmers from paying high amount of money for their seeds.  If patenting is allowed, at first, GM seeds will be comparably costlier than non- GM but it is expected as it’s output are comparatively high.  Talking about reduction in efficiency levels in some areas of india (Bt cotton issue), GM crops are highly target specific. It kills only certain species of insects. It might not be effective in certain locations as the pests might vary.
The talk was very informative and it helped us in explaining to the public about GMOs in an effective manner.

Our biobrick BBa_K2329000 is an improvement of the earlier biobrick part BBa_K740000 from team Tsinghua-A 2012. The improvement of the cre-lox recombinase system was done by changing the loxP site from reversible switch to a non-reversible switch with the help of a mutated form of the LoxP sites. The new mutant loxP sites (lox66 and lox71) have shown great success since the direction of the promoter did not flip back. Read more about the part improvement under Achievements, biobricks .

This conference confirmed and backed a conclusion we had formed: there is still too little work and studies on indoor air while it is the most dangerous and toxic. Creating an indoor pollution database would be an excellent initiative. Azéline and Juliette then attended a conference on air purifiers with a presentation of the state of the art existing models. It turned out that systems that have the most chance of success in the future are those that do not consume energy (passive), that do not produce more pollutants after use, and that are not too expensive. Azéline and Juliette then had the opportunity to present our project aether, which received very good feedback.
As you can see, we spent a lot of time outside the laboratory to meet all the actors of the French ecosystem of the fight against air pollution. We were able to meet all these actors because we made ourselves known in the press. Indeed, our work has been presented in different national journals:

We first tested the ability of our protein to bind to cellulose. To do that, we used several types of cellulose: Avicell, Sigmacell, and carboxymethyl-cellulose. As described by Goldstein et al1, we mixed cellulose with an excess of competitor non-specific protein (BSA), and with or without our protein of interest (Fig. 8A). After washing and centrifugation, we harvested proteins from supernatant and the cellulose-based pellet in order to analyze them by SDS-PAGE. We clearly noted that the 25 kDa and 50 kDa proteins were retained by cellulose, instead of the non-specific BSA (Fig. 8B). Indeed, data showed that almost no monomer remained in the supernatant after the second wash, but the pellet contained most of the protein. However, some dimers seem to remain in the second washing supernatant because the initial protein concentration was too high: the binding sites were saturated. The pellet also contains a lot of the dimers. As control, we observed that BSA remained in the supernatant and didn’t bind to cellulose.  Therefore, we can conclude that our protein binds to cellulose.

Procedure: Synechocystis PCC 6803 genomic DNA was isolated using a lysis, denaturation, and ethanol precipitation. This genomic DNA was used to PCR out agp and ThiE for the creation of knockouts of the respective genes using gibson assembly. PCR was performed on CmR, petBD, GLF, and INV from the isolated pSB1C3 plasmids. PCR was also performed on KnR from pUC4K. These PCR reactions were performed using the gibson assembly primers and master mix was prepared with phusion DNA polymerase. DNA was present in 1 ng/ul reaction. All PCR reactions were run on .7% agarose gel at 110 V for 60 minutes.
Results/Discussion: Bands were expected at 4231 bp for agp, 1061 bp for KnR, 219 bp for petBD, 1711 bp for INV, 1548 bp for glf, 894 bp for CmR, and 1031 bp for ThiE. None of these bands appeared on the gel. Thus, PCR failed for all genes and the experiments need to be redone. Since the primers are quite large for gibson assembly parts, the optimum initial annealing temperature for the first three PCR cycles needs to be determined for all genes.
VG:One liter of LB liquid media and stock solutions of ampicillin were made. Ampicillin was added to the LB liquid media and ampicillin plates were poured for future use. Invertase (INV) and glucose facilitator gene (GLF) contained in the pUC57 vector colonies were streaked on ampicillin and chloromphenicol plates to check for growth.

場所：VBL3階会議室
今回はブレインストーミング第4回ということで手法を変えてみました。 全員で話し合うのではなく、小さなグループに分けて議論の活性化を図りました。
これは2006年に実施していた方法で、うまくいっていたという話から今年もやってみることにしました。 全体で進めてもある程度成果が出ていたのですが、少人数にしたことでさらに活性化されたようです。
ブレインストーミングのログについては後ほどアップします。
事例研究も担当を決め次回から少しずつやっていこうと考えています。 事例研究とは別に以前のiGEMでのプロジェクトをタイトルだけスキャンするということをします。（少ない人数でさらっとという感じで）
近いうちに梅野先生に時期を見て遺伝子工学についてのお話をしていただきます。

The amount of cells should be small, just a touch will do, the small amount required to fill the end of the opening is sufficient. Sufficient mixing will result in complete cell lysis and high yields.

1 cycle : 5 min at 95°C -initial cell breakage and DNA denaturation
30-40 cycles: 1 min at 95°C -DNA denatures into single strands 30-40 cycles  1.5 min at 54°C -primers anneal to ssDNA template (temp depends on primers)  1 min at 72°C -primes are extended from 3'-end by Taq(1 min/kb)

Inoculation of E. coli
A starter culture tube was obtained, and 5mL of LB + 5uL of ampicillin was added.
To inoculate:  Unscrew the LB bottle and flame the lid.  Flame the lid of the culture tube and add the LB using a serological pipette.  Cover everything when not in use, work quickly and near the flame.
Vinson helped with the streaking of the bacterial colony.  The pipette was sprayed with ethanol, and the tip used was sterile.  A colony was gently swept with the tip, and ejected into the culture tube.  The tube began shaking at 3:30PM at 37 degrees.
Conclusions:  Colony PCR was not done as primers were not ready for them.  Tyler will take care of making the glycerol stocks tomorrow morning.
Today Phil looked over a lot of protocols for stuff we need to do over the next week or so. We innoculated a starter broth after picking a colony from our plate. Tomorrow I will create glycerol stocks to use early next week.

We ran transformation tests to determine whether or not the method we were using to dry our plates prior to transformation plating was unnecessarily exposing them to contamination.  The results did not show any relation between the method of drying and the contamination.  What was suggested instead was that the stock chloramphenicol we had used in the previous batch of plates may be too weak to be entirely effective.  New chloramphenicol stock was made at 30mg/mL and new antibiotic plates were made using that.
Over the weekend, we gel extracted esp and rsaA in preparation for new ligation and transformation attempts.  The first round of tested transformants did not contain the desired ligation product, as shown by agarose gels .  A second round of tests on new colonies was started while we prepared new plasmid DNA for digests and gel extraction of both insert and target plasmid to reduce the likelihood of re-ligation.  The second round of tested colonies, however, showed one colony with the desired ligation product ( gel or gel ).
Overnights were made of the new esp + rsaA containing strain.  The DNA that was obtained from both PCR and gel extraction was later digested for ligation with promoter/RBS pieces.  Miniprep DNA was also prepared for sequencing to verify the sample.
We had optimized esp and dspB gene synthesized (G/C rich for Caulobacter) and transformed these two genes into E. coli Top10.
The BioBrick promotor was successfully added in front of the new esp+rsaA gene.
Wild Type dspB:
DspB gene arrived from the University of British Columbia 2010 iGEM Team in the form of a plasmid.  We will call this gene ""WT dspB"" This gene was transformed into E. coli Top10.  Transformation was successful with a lot of growth, more than usual.  But this is expected because this was a transformation of a purified plasmid rather than a ligation product which we are used to which makes  more growth understandable.
Overnights of 6 colonies of the transformed WT dspB were Miniprepped  and three colonies were digested with EcoRI and PstI to confirm size ( DspB Figure 1 ).  Once the size was confirmed, colony 3 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated and transformed into previously digested pSB1C3 plasmids containing the three promotors.
The transformations had a lot of small colonies, too many to count.  4 isolatable"

Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," be successful in Lethbridge. They stated that beekeeping was so easy in B.C. due to the “excellent beekeeping community”. Based on their experience with beekeeping in B.C., they recognized that an essential service to facilitate urban beekeeping is a beekeeping club. The explained that this would help in a variety of ways: That it would provide a source of information and support for new beekeepers, a collective organization to share tool, information, and expertise, and would also be a great resource for the government to fall back on in the case of a problem arising. They also mentioned that holding large-scale events such as press conferences may be counter-productive and further scare the community, and that it is more effective to educate people in smaller, more personal ways. They suggested beginning with those “who are comfortable and who understand” urban beekeeping. We took this into account with our human practices approaches, including the seed bombs and speaking to smaller groups rather than holding large presentations or events. Additionally, the beekeepers mentioned combining the more common gardening passion with beekeeping hobbyists, to create a partnership where both pollination and the growth of food sources can occur. We also asked them if they had had any experiences with mites. They stated that over their beekeeping career they have certainly experienced this. They noted, however, that it has not been an issue in Lethbridge thus far. We also asked them for their opinion on the feasibility and practicality of our project, and they raised concerns regarding contamination of the honey harvest. Specifically, there was concern over how the public would feel about the presence of oxalic acid in “honey, which is seen as such a natural product”. This is a factor which we have considered throughout the development of our project.
In general, beekeeping in Lethbridge has a relatively non-existent past, but a bright future. Minister Shannon Phillips provided valuable insight on both legal and civilian opinions of urban beekeeping, while the urban beekeepers provided information on the effectiveness and feasibility of urban beekeeping, and on ways to facilitate it within city limits. The questions, comments, opinions, and concerns of community were taken into consideration when developing our construct, and when evaluating the safety and ethics of our project.

We got to hear their side of the story on the issue of BP’s infamous Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including some of the innovations they came up with to deal with millions of gallons of oil flooding into the ocean. Our work on creating a genetically modified organism that could fill that niche was noted by the scientists, and they took great interest on how heavy duty mechanical cleanup could be joined with the microbial approach. They mentored us on how to properly test our product, suggesting we look into dispersants as a way of dissolving and isolating the oil from the water. We learned a lot about how the oil industry has dedicated significant amounts of research and development into oil spill response, and we’re glad to be involved in that front.
Synthetic Genomics
In order to gain more perspective about our project, our CCA iGEM team met up to discuss the idea with scientists from Synthetic Genomics, Inc. They went into detail on the similarities between our project and their work and gave us advice on how to approach making our idea into a reality, having worked in the field before. One method they suggested to us was to evaporate the crystals formed from PAHs. At the top of the plate, the clear area would be where the bacteria had degraded the PAH. Although we didn’t implement this technique right away, we hope to use it in the future in an attempt to improve our project. We were also offered a tour of their facilities, which was very enlightening, as we caught a glimpse of their workplace and the type of research they were conducting. They were very enthusiastic in explaining the uses of various equipment and introducing us to their current work on creating biofuels from bacteria, where they engineered yeast and algae to make oil. The result of this human practice event was an increased awareness of our project’s practicality in the real world and its relation to professional and highly recognized laboratories in San Diego.

Saturday, August 2, 2014
Ashlee performed a gradient PCR for the overlap containing the dCas9 system. Because it failed at 60 degree C annealing temperature, we want to test a range of annealing temperatures from 56 degrees C to 66 degrees C. In order to do a CBA of this overlap and the HMF system in Plasmid 2, we needed a long (90 bp) reverse primer, which could be causing our PCR issues. She transformed the ligation of Lambda Red Recombinase and the L6-dCas9 plasmid and plated it on Kan plates to grow overnight at 37 degrees C.
No colonies observed on plates from yesterday’s transformation. Retransformed with less ligation product.

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Achievements#Policy and Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," has been a great experience to work with them.
We spread the word on synthetic biology and iGEM at a student conference at DTU, Life Science and Beyond , held to make bachelor and master students aware of different ways to expand and specialise one's studies to exceed the ordinary study programme.
Due to our initiatives we have already been contacted by several high school students that have participated in our events, because the field of synthetic biology caught their interest. They are now looking for more information on the subject and for supervision on the major Danish high school assignments. Getting such requests is a great achievement, and we are proud to have excited the students' interest, and we are eager to help them.
Conclusively, working with talented students has been a great and inspirational experience for all of us. The students' unbiased minds and unspoiled creativity allowed them to come up with ideas that we as university students within the field of synthetic biology have never thought of. As our project developed we also experienced an increasing interest within synthetic biology and it has been a pleasure to pass this along to other students.
Interactive Workshop
In line with our outreach strategy we developed a workshop concept to inspire and take advantage of the creativity of the many talented high school students in Denmark. We held the workshop several times, both in cooperation with Academy for Talented Youth (ATY) and ScienceTalents in Denmark. Both ATY and ScienceTalents are initiatives for ambitious and talented Danish high school students, primarily interested in science, willing to extend their education beyond the ordinary high school curriculum.
The main focus of the workshop was to inspire the students rather than providing them with dry facts and heavy theory. The idea was to make them aware of the huge potential within synthetic biology, including how synthetic biology can provide solutions to several current global problems.
Furthermore we wanted to take advantage of the creativity of the students. Many Danish high school students are not aware of the power nor the limitations of synthetic biology and the students we engaged with were therefore not primed beforehand nor biased in their way of thinking. Thus, by only providing the most necessary and basic information it was our intention to inspire these youngsters to come up with new and original ideas that are appropriate for different problems - global as well as local.
We initiated the workshops with an introduction to the iGEM competition, synthetic biology and examples on innovative synthetic biology projects partly inspired by previous iGEM projects partly by projects from the synthetic biology society. The introductory presentations were followed by an idea development exercise, where the students were to pair a global problem with an element from synthetic biology. Prior to the workshop the students were"

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#ApproachA_-_-_TEXT.html," nutrient for E. coli, we continued the response experiment with the related compound 𝝰-methyl-aspartate. This molecule has structural similarity to aspartate and is therefore also sensed by the Tar       receptor. However, it is not degraded by the bacteria. Although no response was observed for very low concentrations of 𝝰-methyl-aspartate (around 1 μM), we were still able to detect a rotational bias similar to aspartate. This proves the       hypothesis that other non-nutrient molecules can be sensed by the Tar receptor.
Sticky Flagella
After promising result, we expanded on the idea of tethering bacteria to a glass surface by creating a flagellum, which sticks to objects, without an antibody as an intermediate molecule. This would make the setup even easier and cheaper to produce. The idea was to introduce a mutation in the flagellar gene fliC, which generates a fully functional but sticky version of the protein.[8,9,10] We generated the BioBrick “Sticky fliC” (BBa_K2845000) as a basic part as described in literature, as well as a composite part with the Sticky fliC under a constitutive promoter plus RBS (BBa_K2845001).
Conclusion
The readout of the chemotactic response of bacteria turns out to be a viable approach as a fast cell-based biosensor. The post-translational pathway allowed us to measure a signal seconds after induction with different aspartate concentrations. The big advantage of this approach is that it does not contain any artificial protein interactions but is purely based on the natural pathway of the Tar receptor, which has been optimized over millions of years of evolution. This promises the speed required for our biology-electronics interface.

Q1.What do you do?
I am an assistant professor at the University of Tokyo. I teach science and scientific writing to 1st and 2nd year students
Q2.Have you ever thought about Intellectual Property?
Yes, I have thought about patenting my work. Two of my previous projects were considered for patents (in the USA), however they were rejected.
Q3.and why(not)?
For those projects, my colleagues and I thought that we had created inventions that had commercial potential. Therefore we wanted to protect out ideas.
Q4.What do you think of the fact; Japanese university rarely give lectures to undergrads and graduates?
I think it is unfortunate that Japanese Universities (and American Universities too) rarely give lectures to undergrads and graduate students about   intellectual property. Although having scientific publications is the main criterion for measuring a scientist’s success,               I think that in the future, patenting and intellectual property will also be important. So it is necessary that we train students early so that they can   learn to identify work that has potential to be intellectual property. Students also need to learn easy in their career               how to protect their data properly so they can validate their claims when applying for patents.
Q5.Do you think the situation should be changed? and why?
Yes, see my answer to question 4.
Q6.We would like you to give us comments for young scientists?
Be creative and think outside of the box. The most successful scientists are the ones who are creative and willing to take risks!
Generals
We also conveyed a survey about Intellectual Property and Patent on Synthetic Biology.
Body: 70 Target: all age, various backgrounds.
Q1. What is your academic background?
Q2.How familiar are you with the following terms?
Q3.Have you ever learnt Intellectual Property at your university ?
Q4. Do you think it is important to teach about IP to undergraduate students?
Q5. Should all technologies patent-able?
Q6. Synthetic Biology is a research field that deals with the modification of life with a purpose. For example, in 2010,               some researchers managed to create a bacterium with completely synthetic DNA. Do you think that this kind of emerging technologies should be patentable?
Q7. Why/Why not?
YES(excerpt)

It encourages research.
I believe patents have the power to protect original ideas and allow for those ideas to enter the mainstream.

For a class IIa device, a European Notified Body would need to do a quality assessment of the product, and there would not be a need for a clinical evaluation of the product. The organization manufacturing the product would, on the other hand, need to prove that it has effective quality management systems (QMS) (International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485), pass a EC verification exam, assure maximum quality of the product and production process and have a EC declaration of conformity. A successful QMS needs a Risk Management System (RMS) (ISO 14971). A good RMS comprises an analysis of the intended use and potential misuse, a failure mode and effect analysis, a risk management report, a risk management plan, and a risk acceptance (risk/benefit ratio) analysis 40.
For a further description of this process read the Guideline in the Pharmaceutical Quality of inhalation and nasal products of the committee for medicinal products for human use inside the MPA umbrella.
In the US, the product would be classified as a Class II medical device by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and would get market authorization through a 510(k) exemption, meaning it would be approved by its similarity to other products that have received approval previously 41.
The used applicable standards are ISO and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards, and even though they are not mandatory, they facilitate getting a CE-mark. In addition, they are useful to identify risks that could be related to the use of our locator system.
Firstly, ISO 13485 will be used, which is a standard for working with quality management system.  Secondly, there are some standards of product level that will be used: ISO 14971 is a standard used for application and risk management and IEC 62366-1:2015 specifies a process for the manufacturer 42.
The intended use of our device is according to the data, supplied by the manufacturer on the labeling in the instructions. The intended use of our device is to administer a GMO based treatment for diseases with high mucus production.
For the intended use of this device, we have used a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to identify the risks and their consequences, as well as an action plan that can be used in case a risk occur. For the development of this FMEA, we have used the guidelines provided by the European Medicines Agency 43.

It was difficult to remove the supernatant because the viscous liquid kept getting sucked up and bringing the pellet up with it.
Resuspend pellet in 1/2 volume of original 0.1X bug buster solution

Mix to get an even suspension by pipetting and vortexing for several minutes and spin down as in step 9.
Repeat step 11-12 two more times.
Take samples of supernatant at each wash step
Resuspend inclusion body pellet in 3% SDS solution and incubate at 60 C in the water bath for 2 hours
I used around 2 ml, but I probably could have used less, because the pellet dissolves well in the heat
Store solution at 4C until further required.
I noticed that after a day in the 4C, the solution gelled up.
According to protocol, storage at temperatures below 4°C may cause precipitation of the detergents in BugBuster reagent. Incubate in a room temperature water bath with gentle swirling to redissolve.
Some Notes
I collected the viscous (potential chromosomal DNA) substance and labeled it S4.
After the second wash step, I tried to remove all of the viscous substance, after which the resulting pellets were much smaller, and difficult to break up even after several minutes of vortexing.
Next Step is to run the different fractions, and the dissolved purified silk on an SDS gel to see if I got any protein.

The product was expected to be purified in the lane labeled inclusion body.
The bright band in the inclusion body lane seems to be around 16 kDA as opposed to the expected 31.6 kD.
Im not sure what to make of this data. Although there is a bright and somewhat isolated band, it is not the right size.
Might have something to do with the fact the that the sample was a few weeks old when it was run.
I will try this experiment again using a T7 promoter system."

We are exchanging and improving
With excellent and lively presentation, all the teams were aroused in passionate discussions and got numerous responses from others, including suggestions on the thoughts of project, detailed Q&A on integrated design and reflection on application. As the unique software team, we concisely described the project we had completed and the improvement in the following work. Many members showed their interests in our project. For Bio101, some asked the DNA storage capacity and the superiority of the algorithm we used. One of the professor suggested us to take subsection coding strategy. Others played the game, Bio2048, and hoped us to help them complete the extra work such as biological game. These precious feedbacks we got from the meetup led us to what we should focus on.
Fig.10. We shared with other teams.
Modern technology makes information transmission more convenient, but there is no other way better than face-to-face communication. iSWU meetup helped the teams acquire reflections, inspirations and enhance efficiency to perfect the projects. Thus it can be seen, the communication will make a significant improvement for all attendees in the Giant Jamboree.

To showcase peptide delivery, we have selected the pentapeptide (five amino acids) opiorphin. Opiorphin is a good example of a bioactive peptide that is not easily manufactured.
This peptide is naturally found in human saliva and plays a role in pain relief and as a natural anti-depressant. The E.ncapsulator's unique peptide production module makes it an ideal chassis for the synthesis of opiorphin.
Opiorphin
Short chain polypeptides have many applications in the field of biopharmaceuticals. Probems arise int he fact that it is difficult to isolate these short chain peptides without the amino acid methionine as the first amino acid in the chain (due to the nature in which DNA is translated into protein, see here for details). As a result these short chain peptides can be difficult and expensive to synthesise and purify.
Opiorphin is a good example of a short chain peptide that encounters these difficulties, and we have chosen it to showcase the possibilies of peptide delivery by The E.ncapsulator. Opiorphin is a pentapeptide (five amino acid sequence) that is naturally produced within the body, and plays a role in pain relief, and as an anti-depressant. The pain killing properties of the chemical are as strong as morphine, although due it's mechanism of action, without the addictive and psychological side effects that come with the more traditional drug.  Opiorphin works by inhibiting the production of an enzyme involved in the breakdown of endorphins within the body. By inhibiting the action of this enzyme, endorphins stay present for longer, bringing about the pain relief associated with these molecules.
Unfortunately the chemical is not widely available on the market due to high production costs. We therefore propose the unique peptide synthesis mechanisms of The E.ncapsulator as a synthesis and delivery platform for the drug. We have included a His tag as part of the removable linker mechanism. This allows for easy purification of the compound.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Policies_-_-_TEXT.html,"-assisted food production. Since our crops are not genetically modified themselves, we had to look past existing legislation for answers.
First, we contacted Barbara Lifton, New York State Legislature Assemblywoman and member of the Assembly agriculture committee. We felt that contacting our local state representative was a great baseline into synthetic biology policy. Assemblywoman Lifton was glad to talk to us, and told us that most genetic modification regulation is based on the federal level rather than the state level. She also emphasized the distinction between legislative and regulatory departments in government. Therefore, we looked into current policy by regulatory agencies such as the  Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [2].
In 2010, shortly after the first “synthetic organism” was produced at the J. Craig Venter Institute, the Obama Administration released a report on emerging issues in bioethical research. One of its primary goals was to describe how oversight of synthetic biology projects would move going forward. The report posited that many cases should be regulated on a case-by-case basis with the FDA and USDA, while others should be generally monitored by the two agencies (as well as the EPA) [3]. Our project would specifically fall under APHIS, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection service. Currently however, APHIS lacks a robust approach to regulating technologies that rely on engineered organisms to assist crop growth. There is ambiguity on how to proceed, as a rule that would allow for the USDA to assess risks and use existing policies to regulate such technology has been stalled for years with no signs to indicate a change in the near future [2].
The EPA and FDA are even less clear on policies regarding our project. It is unlikely OxyPonics would be subject to EPA regulations, given that the only chemicals produced are our enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, which are commercially available and do not fall under the category of “new chemicals” that the EPA regulates [4]. The FDA’s general policy towards GM crops is that they are fine so long as they are “substantially equivalent” to non-GM crops [5]. Despite its jurisdiction, the FDA has unclear policies regarding products that utilize genetically engineered organisms to produce a separate end product, as is done in our project. Our unique approach, which doesn’t modify the crop itself, places OxyPonics in a grey area with the FDA regarding their GM-regulations.
However, we aim for OxyPonics to eventually be used in full scale hydroponic systems. This means we must guarantee our end products follow"

We created devices that produce YFP in response to oxidative stress
Based on our studies of inducing stress promoters with hydrogen peroxide, it seemed that the CCP1 and TSA1 promoters were the most promising ones. In both of these promoters, increasing H2O2 concentrations seem to lead to stronger activation of promoters and thus to more intensive fluorescence signals, as seen from results obtained from microplate reader results where fluorescence is normalized to cell density (Figure 1). The functionality of the promoters was confirmed with fluorescence measurements performed with flow cytometry (Figure 2).
Figure 1. Effect of different H 2 O 2 concentrations on fluorescence as a function of OD in Venus under CCP1 promoter (left) and Venus under TSA1 promoter (right) in SS328-leu strain n=3.
Figure 2. Median fluorescence produced by the different promoters after 2 h induction (left) and fluorescence values normalized to the uninduced values (right) as a function of H 2 O 2 induction concentration.
We managed to produce a phenotype change in yeast by replacing the QDR2 transporter
Using our foam-based visual catalase assay, we managed to prove a phenotype change after replacing the original QDR2 transporter in the S. cerevisae strain SS328-leu genome with the corresponding transporter from strain VL3. This can be seen in increased catalase activity levels compared to the non-modified strain after incubation in different concentrations of microcystin (figure 3). Despite the increase of catalase activity base level, the assay didn’t give definitive proof of the functionality of the integrated transporter, as the observed response to microcystin concentrations in SS328-leu with QDR2 transporter was different than in VL3. However, this response might also be partially obscured by the large margin of error in our experiment.
Figure 3. Relative catalase activity in different yeast strains when exposed to different concentrations of microcystin.
Based on the phenotype change, we assumed that the replaced transporter was functional. However, when we attempted to induce fluorescence of our stress promoters in the strain with the replaced transporter, we didn’t obtain any fluorescent signal compared to uninduced values (figure 4). In this experiment, varying microcystin concentrations did not significantly affect any of our promoters, which we concluded to be due to the inability of the transporter to"

As mentioned, it was possible to assemble the plasmid with CYP79-B1 BBa_K527002 with the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard. The plasmid was proven to work by comparison with a control. The Copenhagen team managed to extract the cytochrome membrane protein, verify it by western blotting and finally show that the cytochromes could produce oximes in accordance with expected. Our assembly standard therefore prove to work excellent in bacteria.
CYP79-A2 BBa_K527001 was assembled with the Standard Assembly of BioBricks, but unfortunately the CYP79-A2 BBa_K527001 was never proven to work in accordance with the control. The lack of function could have been caused by the point mutations that were introduced in order to remove the illegal restriction sites.

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#results#background_-_-_TEXT.html,", in A. nidulans the parasexual cycle has been extensively utilized. Parasexual genetics involves examination of recombination in the absence of sexual reproduction.
The genetic analysis has produced a deep understanding of both the physiology of Aspergilli and the organisation of the genome (13). This research has advanced the study of eukaryotic cellular physiology and contributed to our understanding metabolic regulation, development, DNA repair, morphogenesis, and human genetic diseases (12). Furthermore, the recent sequencing of the complete genome of A. nidulans has created a tremendous potential to obtain insight into important aspects of fungal biology such as transcriptional regulation, secondary metabolite production and pathogenicity (14).
Gene targeting in fungi
Gene targeting facilitates precise genome manipulations, called site directed alterations. They are performed by deletions, replacements and insertions at a target locus. Gene targeting is achieved by transforming fungi with a suitable linear DNA fragment that contains sequences that are identical to the target site in the genome, see figure below. Fungi can integrate linear DNA fragments in its genome by repair of double stranded breaks (15).
Two mechanisms for repair of double stranded breaks ensure that a linear piece of DNA is integrated into the fungal genome; homologous recombination (HR) and non homologous end joining (NHEJ), also called illegitimate recombination (15). HR involves interactions between homologous sequences, whereas NHEJ involves ligation of the ends independently of DNA homology (16). Precise genome manipulation can often be tedious and time-consuming, because fungi appear to favour NHEJ over HR resulting in low gene targeting efficiencies (15).

Hospital Interview
What is reality? Reality is not only the theorem, formula and definition we learned in textbooks. It also not only the report and data we read in papers and journals. It is supposed to be the changes of surroundings and the joy and sorrow of human beings that we can really see, hear, touch and feel. How can our scientific research make some differences to people’s daily life? What we should do first is to discover the reality, thus the doctors’ clinical experience and the patients’ living condition are the reality we are concerned about initially. Answering the doctors’ concerns and doubts about current therapies and meeting the patients’ needs and hopes about current treatment are the goals that we are always pursuing. The next one is to put our idea into reality. We spent the whole summer vacation on the experiments and data analyses hoping to achieve the initial goal. Afterwards, we interviewed doctors again to ask for advice for our preliminary results to improve our project. The third one is to respect the patients’ real feelings and thoughts however positive or negative. We all must esteem the reality.
Why we do such a human practice project? We believe that the meaning of human practice is not only to give suggestions and feedbacks to the laboratory work but also to discover and realize the real world and connect our idea with the people, environment and even the world. When we learn about all the sever problems such as the increasing frequency of cardiovascular diseases, the sufferings of patients, the incapability of treatment, the complaints of medical staff and the tensions of physician - patient relationship, we may just read, learn and forget it some time. However, when you really go to the outpatient clinics to see the doctors heavy work (A doctor in the cardiovascular unit of a major hospital is always seeing 100 or 200 patients from morning till night.) and go to the wards of inpatient departments to see the lean, pale and painful patients who are tortured by the daily treatment, you will be really touched, shocked and desired to spare no efforts to make your project better.
Our human practice may give us not all the positive attitudes and compliment, even more negative concerns and doubts, but we still don’t give up and try our best to achieve our dream, because your project is not only your own"

Talking to experts
We talked with different experts from universities and research centers in the field of biology, genetic engineering, biological modeling and cyanobacterial research. Many of these experts gave us much appreciated information and new aspects to our ideas that have guided our project towards what it is today. As this valuable information gained from the experts has affected the design of our project significantly we are presenting it more deeply in integrated human practices section.
Finnish Environment Institute SYKE
In order to gain more insight into how big problem cyanobacteria in Finland is, we contacted the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. They guided us to the Finnish Environment Institute (Suomen ympäristökeskus, SYKE), where we got to discuss about the cyanobacteria problem and our project with some experts of the field.
We talked to Jari Silander, Senior Research Scientist specializing in monitoring and cost-benefit analysis, and Juhani Kettunen, Program Director responsible for modernization of environmental monitoring activities. We introduced our project and briefly talked about synthetic biology. They found our approach interesting and promising since they have been trying to deal with the blue-green algae problem for many years now. They described the full extent of algae detection problem in Finland and all the strategies used in the past and at the moment to deal with it both in research and industry.
They also discussed with us the business aspects of our project and gave us good advice on how to build our business strategy if we are to bring our algae detection and degradation methods to masses.
Meetings with companies
As we were looking for funding, contacting different companies and organizations, we got a chance to visit a few, tell about our project, discuss about synthetic biology and use of biotechnology in Finland. We talked with ThermoFisher, Algol and LAL (Luonnontieteiden akateemisten liitto) and they showed great interest in our project and helped us with the funding. ThermoFisher was quite generous to even send us different lab kits for different purposes. We will visit some of them to give the final presentation about our achievements after we return from Boston.

We chose to work with a type I secretion system, which is also known as the ABC transporter (figure 4). The system works in a continuous secretion process across both the inner and the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The proteins involved in type I secretion system form a channel that exports proteins from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment (Green, 2016). Among all of the type I secretion systems, the α-hemolysin(HlyA) secretion system is the best characterized, studied and most used. Also, the type I secretion system is able to transport various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20-900 kDa). Because of these two reasons, we chose to use the α-hemolysin(HlyA) secretion system for the secretion of our enzymes (≈50 kDa).
Figure 4. ABC transporter, secretion system schematic representation.
The system contains 4 parts: the HlyA, HlyB, HlyD and TolC respectively. HlyA is a α-hemolysin, which contains a C-terminal signal sequence and is attached to the desired enzyme. The attachment of HlyA contributes to the recognition by HlyB, an ATP-binding cassette. HlyD is a membrane fusion protein linking between the outer and the inner membrane. TolC is a specific outer membrane protein, which forms a long channel throughout the outer membrane and the periplasm, largely open towards the extracellular medium.

For instance, polystyrene, which has hydrophobic surface, is a commonly used substrate. When antibodies are absorbed onto it, the strong hydrophobic force between them lead to the formation of multilayer film. Among all the antibodies that are absorbed, only the top of them can maintain their activities, while the rest would go through conformational changes and become inactivated. This would result in low sensitivity and a huge waste of reagents.
Scientists have always tried to find new method of surface modification to improve substrate properties, such as three-dimensional surface modification of glass or use gold membrane to replace the ordinary substrate. However, these methods show either complex operation or high cost[1].
A very interesting characteristic of assembled Janus is the amphipathic nature of the coating. By changing the hydrophobicity of a surface the binding of various molecules and cells can be manipulated [2]. In view of this, Janus could find use in substrate modification applications.
Our Goal
Based on previous experience, we use Janus to modify protein chip substrate so as to optimize it. In the process of our experiment, Janus acts as a medium in antibody-fixing by electrostatic force [3]. Compared to the traditional methods, this fixing method not only ensures the activity of the antibody, but also improves the detection’s accuracy rate. Additionally, it can greatly reduce the cost of chip’s making [4]. The most important thing is that this method enables us to use antigens in very light concentration, which can save a lot of samples.
Our Design
In our experiment, we used two kinds of Janus-inJanus and sJanus. inJanus generate more stable assemblies compared to sJanus. We use hydrophobins from two categories on purpose of studying the differences between them in aspect of surface modification.The serum levels of tumor markers are directly related to the state of cancer. The quantitative detection of them in serum will be valuable for clinical research and early diagnosis [5]. In our experiment, we chose CEA, AFP and CA15-3 and their respectively antibodies as samples. Levels of CEA can be associated with lung cancer, and AFP - liver cancer, CA15-3 - breast cancer. In fact, there are a large number of tumor markers that associated with cancer, but the markers we chose are more representative and easier to purchase.

Uncontrolled Release. Can we anticipate how our Genetically Engineered Machine (GEM) would behave if released? What would be ideal conditions to grow and could they potentially be met? Can we anticipate any interactions with any form of wildlife? What would be ideal conditions to grow and could they potentially be met?
Misuse. Can we think some steps ahead and imagine a potentially harmful usage with our open-source GEM?
Benelux meetup
The Benelux teams were invited to meet and present their ideas at the Benelux meetup and receive critical feedback from other teams, experts in the field and an iGEM HQ representative. Teams also participated in workshops to immerse ourselves in the shareholders perspectives and debate safety issues. The meeting was hosted by the Wageningen team.
European meetup
The European iGEM meetup was held in Delft this year. The meet up started with a talk by Cees Dekker, a well-known physicist. It was quite interesting to hear about the common ground between physics and biology. After the break a lecture was given by Denis Murphy, he is involved in palm oil research. Palm oil is used a lot for cosmetics in richer countries, and for sustenance in poorer countries. He expanded on a specific application for genetic engineering for making sustainable palm oil plantations. The main event of the day was, of course, the poster presentations of all the iGEM teams. We walked around a lot, talking to pretty much every team at least once. It was very pleasant to see all the Dutch teams again here after we had previously met them during the Dutch iGEM meet up in Wageningen. During the entire event we ""infected"" other teams with our 3D printed bacteriophages. The last part of the day consisted of a BBQ with some drinks. We left together with some of the other teams and talked more about how our respective projects were progressing.

In the acronym name iDPI, “D” stands for dedication, “P” stands for passion, and “I” stands for inspiration. Our hope is that with the establishment of iDPI, every iGEMer at ShanghaiTech would bear a strong social awareness in minds, to yield profound contributions and achieve social values.
This year, iDPI collaborated with Shanghai Coordinate International School, holding an iGEM Lab Open House Day on Zhangjiang campus. The activity took place in the early September. At noon time, along with another iGEM team at ShanghaiTech, our iGEM team members warmly welcomed the visiting delegation from Shanghai Coordinate International School at the conference room. Leaded by Teacher Gordon, a leading science teacher at the Coordinate, the delegation consisted of 8 high school students from different grades.
An introduction speech to the ShanghaiTech was first delivered by the team member Haolong. Then he continued to further talked about the background of iGEM as well as synthetic biology. After that, delegates from two of the iGEM team conducted a brief presentation on the iGEM project subsequently. Finally an open discussion session was held, where the high school students demonstrated strong interests about synthetic biology and actively asked questions about the iGEM and our projects. Some of them even showed strong willingness to participate in the iGEM in the following year. As we responded at the meeting, we would be very happy to try to provide all sorts of assistance they may need to build up their own high school team for the iGEM. Also, if any of they were interested in real experience of hand-on lab operations, our iGEM lab was always open to them to visit and explore. Additionally, last week we were just informed by Teacher Gordon that their school would be very likely to build up their first-ever high school iGEM team; hopefully they may officially participate in the competition in the following years. We would keep providing them sufficient assistance and support as long as necessary.
After the speech and discussion, a lab visiting was scheduled as the second session of the Open House Day. Our team members paired with the visiting high school students, guiding them around the research center at school. We introduced the equipment to them one by one, from the cell disruptor to the ultra-centrifuge, from the FACS to TEM, explaining the mechanisms behind in popular and easy-to-understand language. Part of our lab results were demonstrated as well, so as to help them build a better understanding"

The CBD is part of the CBM3 family . This CBD has been used in many application: in fusions with cell adhesion peptides to enhance the properties of cellulose as a cell-growth matrix (Andrade et al 2010a, Andrade et al 2010b), fused to enzymes to remove contaminants from water (Kauffmann et al 2000) and fused to an antimicrobial peptide (Ramos, Domingues & Gama 2010).

CBDcenA with C-terminal linker
This CBD is from the Endoglucanase A (cenA) gene from Cellulomonas fimi and also contains an endogenous C-terminal linker. The cellulose binding domain region occurs at the N-terminus of the cenA gene (UniProt P07984 link to http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07984) and is from the CBM family 2
The linker sequence (PTTSPTPTPTPTTPTPTPTPTPTPTPTVTP) is Pro-Thr box which has an extended conformation and acts as a hinge region (Gilkes et al 1989). The endoglucanase CBDcenA has 50% homology to the exoglucanase CBDcex ( BBa_K863101 ) and the linker is highly conserved in both, but the order of the catalytic, linker and cellulose-binding regions is reversed (Warren et al 1986). It has been shown that CBDcenA has the highest binding affinity for crystalline cellulose out of the C. fimi CBDs (Kim et al 2013).

Algorithm
The users of our software are all innovative researchers who are interested in utilizing Synthetic Biology to tackle many different real-world problems. The purpose of our system is to recommend the most related genetic parts to the users based on users' research interest detected by our system.
The information we use to make recommendations is based on a database powered by NLP and Random Walk, which contains scores between each keyword and each genetic part. Formally, it is a matrix consisting of the number of keywords and the number of Parts. The element at the row and column is the score between the keyword and genetic Part that can reflect the connection between them. (Higher score suggests stronger connection).
The overall strategy of our system is Collaborative Filtering, i.e. we first search similar keywords in our database of the unknown word offered by users, then recommend genetic parts which are highly related to those keywords that are suggested for users.
How to find the most similar keywords in our dataset of a given unknown word in an accurate and efficient way? Here is our general solution: To quantify the semantic similarities between words accurately, we use techniques in Deep Learning to convert words into numerical vectors and the cosine similarities between each vector can represent the semantic similarities between words. To search the similar keyword efficiently, we use the KD Tree Algorithm, a speedy algorithm based on the binary tree, to implement the K Nearest Neighbors strategy.
Network Analysis
Search analysis
At scientific journals, keywords are often required for publishing articles. Keywords can be used for indexing or searching, and offer a faster way for readers to browse the content of a project and find their interests.
In fact, in 2015, iGEM try to collect some keywords by asking teams to submit.
This year, a new data format is created and its keywords enable our network analysis. First, We used Microsoft Text Analytics Service to extract keywords from wiki texts of previous projects. Only the most frequently used keywords will be focused. By using machine learning, those keywords were converted to word vectors base on a semantic database. A network profiling relationship among keywords, projects and parts data is built and stored in the S-Din database. When searching, related information will be provided based on the network analysis, which would spark a brand new idea unexpectedly.

<img src = ""
"" class = ""figure"" />
X and Y are substances that both are required to activate PX&Y promoter.
Before arabinose induction, PTet and PConst express  Y and crRBS-sigma. After arabinose induction, PBAD becomes activated and TetR and X are expressed. X binds to Y and the transcription of taRNA from PX&Y occur, which leads to counting. At that time, expression of Y is repressed by TetR and the amount of Y, which has short half life, decreases rapidly. Thus, PX&Y is again repressed, the amount of taRNA decreases, and the counter never counts more than 1. You might be afraid that PX&Y also begins transcription of taRNA when the induction ends; however, supposed degradation of X is faster than that of TetR, it will not occur. When the induction ends, X first degrades while still a lot of TetR remain and Y is not abundant. Since PTet has a sigmoidal transcriptional response, the production rate of Y will change little even if the concentration of TetR decrease a little. When TetR degrades so much that it finishes repression of Y, most of X have already decomposed, and PX&Y will not be activated to begin transcription of taRNA.
We modeled this construct to test if it can be realized. We did not model resetting this time, either.

What is modeling
The model should be sufficiently detailed and precise so that it can in principle be used to simulate the behavior of the system on a computer.
In the context of molecular cell biology, a model may describe the mechanisms involved in transcription, translation, gene regulation, cellular signaling, DNA damage and repair processes, homeostatic processes, the cell cycle, or apoptosis. Indeed any biochemical mechanism of interest can, in principle, be modeled. At a higher level, modeling may be used to"

Elux: Design & Development
To demonstrate the usage of our non-canonical amino acids 2-nitrophenylalanine we aimed to construct a purification column that can induce the elution of the target protein by irradiation with light. In the development process, our column went through different design stages. Here we document the evolution of our column from the first idea, via different models we discussed and improved over the time, up to the final version we tested and presented to experts in order to get an idea of how our system could be used properly in the future.
The six steps in the development process of the purification column A) BSA-coated micro well plate, B) Hollow cylindrical column, C) Biotinylated microscope slides, D) First flow model, E) second flow model, F) future concept of a microfluidic like column.

Threshold Regulation
Threshold limitation
In the early days of radio, AM transmitters were vulnerable to overload by an input signal of too great a magnitude.  To protect the transmitter from damage, a limiter circuit was employed to attenuate signal peaks while allowing all subthreshold signal to pass through unchanged.  We have designed a genetic circuit that behaves similarly.  Our gene network reacts to the level of transcription of a gene of interest, limiting it to levels above or below a user-defined threshold.  In our proof-of-concept, we use synthetic transcription factors to limit the expression of an inducible reporter.  In practice, these modular transcription factors can be used to regulate any endogenous gene with a known promoter and transcription factor DNA-binding domain.  Extremes of gene expression can damage living systems, while normal expression is healthy.  Our limiter could react to the level of a gene's expression within individual cells, correcting problems only where and when they occur.
