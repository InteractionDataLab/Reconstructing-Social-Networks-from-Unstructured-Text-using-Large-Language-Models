Through this research, we learned on biosafety matters regarding synthetic biology and we raised self-awareness on the globalization of this discipline and how it becomes more accessible every day to acquire and implement its tools and methods, for example, for biohackers. We understood the importance of biodiversity, bioethics, regulations, and dialogue as well as we raised awareness of the scopes of synthetic biology understanding the importance and the need to adhere not only to its local and national guidelines but also to the international.
Trough this research we evaluated the possible risks of releasing GMOs into the environment like for example, the risk of genetic information transferring from one GMO to a non-GMO. We acquire knowledge of an international framework directly related to our project and necessary to fully understand the importance of the next activity described in this United Nations section.
Beekeepers
The world of beekeeping is much more than what appears in texts; no research could have compared being in the field with a beekeeper sharing knowledge, getting to know his community and their needs. Our main reasons for approaching them were to be informed about Beekeeping in their region, their opinion on our project and validate technical aspects of it. We wanted to choose with their help, the optimal application method for our product into the beehives, investigate the presence of American foulbrood and European foulbrood in their regions or countries as well as current existing treatments, their benefits, and risks.

Wisconsin-Madison,2009,Team:Wisconsin-Madison#Significane_-_-_TEXT.html," have particular promise as fuels for transportation. Biofuels created from agriculturally grown crops are known as agrofuels, and include: sugarcane, corn, soybean, and switchgrass. Additionally, biofuels can be synthetically produced by engineered microorganisms; increased use of these engineered microorganisms is one aspect of our project.
Biofuel Process
The biofuel process is ideally a carbon neutral cycle since any carbon dioxide released in the combustion of the fuel is recaptured by the next generation of fuel sources (Figure 1.2.1). Figure 1.2.1 (12)
Figure 1.2.1 (12)
Corn Ethanol is a Current “Solution” in the United States
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set a goal of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by the year 2022 (13). Our project will help to provide an alternative to corn ethanol in helping to meet this goal. Such processes are encouraged through methods such as government subsidies (13). Corn ethanol is the current approach to reaching this goal. Unfortunately, corn ethanol has several disadvantages. It is debated whether corn ethanol results in fewer greenhouses gas emissions than gasoline or even if it is energy favorable. A study at Cornell University states that corn ethanol costs 30% more energy to produce than the actual energy it contains (14). A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences states that there is some 25-40% energy favorability in corn ethanol production (15). Ethanol production has drastically increased the demand for corn and in 2008 corn prices more than doubled between January and July (16). One of the major limitations of this approach is that only the starch contained within the kernel of the corn is used to create ethanol; the rest of the plant is not converted into fuel.
Cellulosic Biofuel: A Step in the Right Direction
Cellulosic biofuel production uses cellulose as well as starches and simple sugars to create biofuel. This process should result in increased production efficiency (over corn ethanol) since a higher percentage of the plant is converted into fuel. Cellulose is the most abundant carbon source on the planet, accounting for about 33% of plant matter (17). A cellulosic approach to biofuels has a greater variety of possible sources to better fit specific regions or methods. In his State of the Union address on January 23, 2007 former President George W. Bush set a production goal of 20 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol a year by 2017.

After extensive washing and deprotection of the α-amino group, the synthesis of the tag-specific region was performed automatically using an Invatis AG ResPep System. Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Ile-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Met-OH, Fmoc-Phe-OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Val-OH and Fmoc-Ahx-OH were used for this purpose. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was added to the solvents increasing the solubility of the amino acids and prevented precipitation in the machine.
Figure 2: Mechanism of the coupling reaction
The processed product was cleaved from the resin and unprotected from their side chain protection groups using a cleavage solution consisting of 670 mg of phenol, 450 μl of water, 450 μl of triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) and 9 ml of TFA. The resulting peptides were precipitated in cold diethyl ether and lyophilized overnight. Purification was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the resulting product was checked by mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization (ESI).

Objective
The focus of this years' projects is to question the central dogma of biology. This is the commonly held belief that information flows from the ordering of the bases within a cell's DNA to the ordering of the bases within RNA. This information can then be translated to the order of Amino Acids that make up proteins. We are currently working on projects that question aspects of this dogma.
Project 1: Codon Optimization
Project Overview
All of the proteins around us, with few exceptions, are made up of 20 fundamental building blocks - Amino Acids. Different arrangements and combinations of these basic building blocks gives us the diversity of proteins that we see, but to make these we need information. We need to know the order of the bases. This information is held within the order of a messenger RiboNucleic Acid's (mRNA) bases; Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, and Uracil. (mRNA is in essence a ""photocopy"" of DNA that codes for a gene. <p/> <p> Since there are only 4 bases in RNA and there are 20 Amino Acids, there are not enough bases to directly code for all of the Amino Acids. Nature has a solution for this - codons. Codons are groups of three bases that sode for a single amino acid. There are 64 possible combinations of codons (4 x 4 x 4 = 64). These combinations are degenerate, meaning that you can have more than one codon code for the same Amino Acid.
Proteins are assembled by ribosomes, which read the mRNA and catalyze the binding between Amino Acids. However, they cannot read the codon code themselves, and require the help of tRNA (transfer RNA)."

Utah_State,2014,Team:Utah State#Results#Chlorophylasse_-_-_TEXT.html,"ume hood overnight.  The chlorophyll was resolubilized in 1 ml of acetone.  Concentration of chlorophyll was found using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at a 1:100 dilution.  Absorbances were read at 663 nm and 646 nm.  The concentration of chlorophyll in the dilution equals 0.01776 X A646nm + 0.00734 X A663nm.  Molarity was calculated using the molecular weight of chlorophyll, 839.5 g mol-1.  The stock was stored in a -20 oC freezer.
We extracted 43.14 ± 8.93 uM of chlorophyll from six spinach leaves that was later used to test the activity of our produced chlorophyllase.
Activity Assay
Chlorophyllase was tested using a chlorophyllase activity assay.  Chlorophyll A in acetone, 0.14 mM, was mixed with MOPSO buffer, 20% v/v.  Purified protein, 0.1mg, was added in a 1.0 ml reaction volume at 25 C and shaken by hand for 10 min.  The reaction was quenched with a 4:6:1 (v/v/v) acetone:heptane:KOH (1 ml).  After mixing the reaction tubes were centrifuged for 10 min. and 2,500g to separate phases.  The aqueous phase containing the chlorophyllide reaction product was recovered and absorbance measured at 667 nm using a UV-vis spectrophotometer.  Using an extinction coefficient of 76.79 mM-1 cm-1 was used to determine chlorophyllide concentrations (Arkus et. al., 2008).
The results showed an increase of 3.527 uM in concentration of chlorophyllide over the control.  If the reaction runs well enough, a visual may be seen of the green color changing locations from the organic phase to the aqueous phase, after centrifugation, because of the cleaving of the phytol tail. The photo below shows two layers in each tube, the top organic layer and the bottom aqueous layer. Because the phytol tail makes the chlorophyll molecule nonpolar, it resides in the upper organic layer. Once the chlorophyllase cleaves this tail, it becomes soluble in the aqueous phase and then resides in the lower phase of the tubes shown. Left tube shows before addition of"

Taiwan, although with GDP of 489.21, however, it is experiencing a steady GDP annual growth rate of 3.47% in 2013, and 3.38% in 2014. Egypt and South Africa both have a significantly larger population than Taiwan and Japan, yet they only have one iGEM team each. Looking into their GDP value, Egypt had a GDP of 271.97, with a decline of GDP annual growth rate. South Africa’s GDP was 350.63, with a low GDP annual growth rate.
Another factor that contributes to the number of iGEM teams is education. This year the United States has a total of 60 iGEM teams. California with nine teams, along with New York and Massachusetts, both with six teams, are the three states with the most iGEM teams in United States. On the contrary, Oregon, Colorado, and Illinois each only has one. By comparing this data to the major universities distribution in United States (see Appendix A), the three states with the most teams – California, New York, and Massachusetts – all have a high distribution of major universities. While Oregon, Colorado, and Illinois with only one team have no major universities. The positive correlation of prestigious universities and the number of teams shows how education is an important factor.
Growth of iGEM Teams
Over the past five years, there has been a growth of iGEM teams throughout the world. Two major factors for the growth of iGEM teams are the development of synthetic biology and the quality of education. USA has been the leading position of synthetic biology R&D ever since the early 2000s, meaning it has the most synthetic biology institutes in the world. As a result, USA has the most iGEM team every year. Other countries with advanced synthetic biology research such as Germany, France, Japan, and UK have more iGEM teams than the other countries in their regions. In fact, countries in the top ranking on GERD (gross expenditure on R&D)—US, Japan, Germany, China, and UK respectively—all have more iGEM teams than other countries do: China and Japan have the most teams in Asia; Germany and UK have the most teams in Europe in the past five years.

Image of the two options in Site-specific recombination: Inversion and Deletion. (4)
In our journey to find proteins with new features, we found the Marburg project in 2012(4). This project proposes the use of an invertase from Phage Mu to generate random deletions and thus create diverse phenotypes. The invertase in the phage recognized the GL (gixL) and GR (gixR) sites, inverting the called G-segment that contains two genes in which those have been expressed by the same promoter but with a different conformations.
The invertible G-segment of bacteriophage Mu (4)
In simple words, our idea is looking forward to a have constitutive expression of a resistance cassette to use it as a selection marker in transformations but the design of the construct implies that the resistance in the CDS will be flanked by Gl and Gr. Those regions are going to be recognized by the invertase enzymes. Therefore, when the induction of the invertase has taken place it will remove that undesirable region from the plasmid and the resistant bacteria will be converted to non-resistant bacteria expressing another reporter protein which represent a less biosafety issue like a fluorophore.
The idea is presented in the following diagram.

PmrA-PmrB two-component system is native to Salmonella enterica and in its native state the system is responsible for chemotaxis. PmrB is a transmembrane protein with iron binding peptide on its extracellular loop. When PmrB binds iron (III) iron, the intracellular domain gains kinase activity and phosphorylates PmrA, which subsequently binds to pmrC promoter and induces expression of chemotaxis CheZ protein. In this part iron binding tag on the extracellular loop was exchanged with a lanthanide binding tag (LBT), to allow PmrA-PmrB two-component system to respond to lanthanide ions.

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State_-_-_TEXT.html," protein synthesis can be lifted.  Traditional methods in E. coli rely on the preference for certain codons across the entire genome, yet this is not the only possible approach.  In this project, novel criteria for codon optimization were employed to design and create variants of a reporter gene that was then characterized in vivo. Results show that the new criteria for codon optimization, for example the statistical correlation between a degenerate codon and its presence in highly translated parts of the genome, are feasible for use in future projects. This leads to new theories about the mechanics of translation, and will allow researchers to optimize genes at the codon level with greater fidelity.

Testing Promoters
We conducted a fluorescence test in order to determine which promoters were inducible in rhizobium and what level of expression was obtainable. Before testing the promoter-citrine constructs in rhizobium, we first tested them in E. coli. In E. coli, we were able to obtain fairly high fluorescence readings for the lac and tac promoters as well as the constitutive Anderson ones. MelA and bacA are promoters specific to rhizobia, so we did not expect those to work well in E. coli. When we tested the promoters in rhizobia, we found that out of the inducible promoters, tac had the greatest expression and out of the constitutive promoters, Anderson Medium resulted in the most fluorescence. The incorporation of the promoter-citrine constructs in our organisms of interest was confirmed by sequencing.

Biofilm formation on surfaces is an issue in the medical field, naval industry, and other areas. We developed an anti-fouling peptide with two modular components: a mussel adhesion protein (MAP) anchor and LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide. MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-3,5-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genetically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.

The results of fluorescence intensity are as follows.
Fig 2 Fluorescence intensity before and 1 hour after adding H2O2.
As the experimental result of other parts, we added 2% galactose into                         medium, and added 1μl H2O2 before testing fluorescence intensity. We                         believe that the data after one hour of processing is the most reliable. We chose four                         promoters later, which were the strongest one, trr1p, the weakest one, glr1p, and                         two mild, sod2p and glr1p. We confirmed the promoter in next step of the                         experiment.
Construction of dCas9-sgRNA plasmid
We respectively replaced the original promoter of dCas9 with promoters                         mentioned above and transformed them into yeast cells. We observed that the yeast cells with                         promoter trx2p grew fastest so we decided to choose trx2p as the final promoter.                         We tested the inhibitory effect through growth curve. We used the ndi1/yno1 overexpressed strain and obtained growth curve through its OD600. As shown by the growth curve,                         the growth of the strain with the dCas9-sgRNA plasmid was similar to that of the original                         strain, and superior to the strain overexpressing ndi1/yno1.This result proves that our                         feedback part works well.

Safety
Over the past few months, our team worked primarily with E.colis, which are ranked in the organisms of Level 1 risk group. We attempted to utilize our engineered bacteria to help treat IBD, so we considered as much as we can to ensure the safety of our entire project--not only the design of our therapeutic methods, but also our lab work.
Safe project design
In addition to non-virulent strains of E.coli, none of the new BioBrick parts that we constructed raises any safety issues.
At the end of our therapeutic schedule, we introduce “ Kill Switch ”, which is in charge of terminating these engineered bacteria. With the loss of control, we considered, this kind of engineered bacteria may cause the horizontal gene transfer, especially in complex environments such as intestines. Thus, we design two kind of kill switch to make sure that our bacteria cause less side effects. Meanwhile, this strategy makes our project more complete as well.
How did we solve the niche vacancy after we turn on the kill switch? Our solution is “ Warship ”, a bacteria constraint device designed and constructed by ourselves. As expected, we found out that this container can guarantee the protective effects in both sides through a series of experiments.
Safe lab work
All students received related safety training. We must study the course called “The Experiment Safety” before we start doing the experiment. In this course, teachers introduced us the matters needing attention and strategies in dealing with the unexpected incidents through various cases.
To keep ourselves and our samples safe, we wore proper personal protective equipment (in the form of gloves and a lab coat, as well as eyewear when necessary) at all times in the lab. As our project mentioned, our team did nitric oxide related experiments. We dealt with NO producing chemicals (sodium nitroprusside) in a fume hood.

Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," of the transcriptome may be subjected to miRNA-mediated control (Lau et al. 2001) . The broad regulatory scope of miRNAs underlines their key roles in a wide range of biological processes including proliferation, apoptosis, hematopoeisis and oncogenesis (Bushati and Cohen, 2007) . The expression patterns of miRNAs in different cell types, tissues and developmental stages of a cell vary highly, but remain relatively constant within a certain single cell type in a certain stage (Brown et al. 2006 , Gangaragu and Lin 2009) . The special properties of miRNA binding sites and the inhibiting character of miRNAs are excellent devices to be exploited for gene therapy. Not only the fine-tuning capabilities of varying miRNA binding sites but also tissue specificity can play an important role (Brenecke et al., 2005).
A combination of random and rational design of binding sites could become a powerful tool to achieve a narrow range of resulting gene expression knockdown. To ease in silico construction of miRNA binding sites with appropriate characteristics for its target, we wrote a program - the miBS designer. Using all of our theoretical models gives the user the opportunity to calculate knockdown percentages caused by the designed miRNA in the target cell.  The miBS designer allows for in silico construction of binding sites but also rational design is possible. The readily constructed binding sites can then be introduced into the miMeasure standard plasmid. This plasmid has been engineered to enable the easy input of synthetic microRNA binding sites behind one of two fluorescent proteins while the second is used for normalization. Expression of regulated reporter and control from a bidirectional CMV promter guarantee faithful and reproducible measurements in any kind of cell. The fluorescence readout can be used to quantify the regulatory efficiency of the binding site in knockdown percentage. Once the properties of a synthetic binding site are elucidated, they can be used to manipulate and accurately fine-tune gene expression in vitro and in vivo.
After having characterized the binding sites via fluorescent measurement they can be used in our synthetic miRNA Kit. This guarantees at least for individually modifiable but still ready-to-use constructs to interfere genetic circuits with synthetic or endogenous miRNAs. We preciously show, that gene expression can thereby by adjusted - tuned - to an arbitrary level. The miTuner (see sidebar) allows on the simultaneous expression of a synthetic miRNA and a gene of interest that is fused with a designed binding site for this specific miRNA. Our modular kit comes with different parts that can be combined by choice,"

    In the field of biodetection and bioremediation, despite numerous proofs of principle, most bioreporters and bioabsorbents have remained confined to the laboratory (van der Meer and Belkin). Also, bacterial reporters and absorbents are NOT rational enough in design and NOT complex enough in function (Chakraborty et al., 2008; Diesel et al., 2009; Sharon Yagur-Kroll, 2010). Additionally, we notice that genetic manipulation in this field is in need of streamline methods (Hansen and Sorensen, 2000) and it's time for a series of issues on the field application to be taken into consideration (Kuppardt et al., 2009).

Fig2. Our heavy metal decontamination kit consists of a bioreporter system and a bioabsorbent. Bioreporter system acts as a sensor for certain heavy metal and will report the presence and extent of heavy metal pollution in water by a quantifiable and naked-eye recognizable output signal. When heavy metal detected, bioabsorbent will be put to use. Bioabsorbent is genetically engineered bacteria which is capable of absorbing heavy metal from water significantly and will auto-aggregate and sediment after water detoxified.
    Based on the principle of Biological Network Control and Reverse Engineering (Chikofsky and Cross, 1990), we engineered our bacteria to resolve these hard truths mentioned above. MerR family transcription factors (TFs) were exploited to construct a series of biorepoters for heavy metal detection and bioabsorbents for heavy metal decontamination (Fig.2 and Fig.3, Hobman, 2007; Hobman et al., 2005).

Inactivation above a given temperature: thermosensitive protein
The wild-type lambda cI repressor is efficient at 42°C, however a temperature-sensitive (Ts) cI repressor mutant, called cI857 was isolated and has been widely for temperature-controlled gene expression in bacteria. At low temperatures cI857 retains its wild type property, whereas at nonpermissive temperature (42°C), the repressor is unstable and is not able to bind to the operator of the PCI target promoter (Fig. 3). The Ts repressor which is available via biobrick BBa_K098995 can used to prevent a repressor activity on PCI above 42°C (T2).
The reporter system
Numerous reporters genes can be used to monitor gene expression. We chose a coloured reporter system based on the production of lycopene. Bacteria expressing the lycopene biosynthesis genes have a red color.
Figure 3:  The different steps and the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lycopene.
The genes crtE, crtB and  crtI encode three enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lycopene that convert the colourless farnesyl pyrophosphate to red lycopene via the intermediates geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and phytoene (Fig. 3).These enzymes are naturally expressed in tomatoes and carrots .The crtE, crtB and crtI genes has been assembled by the Cambridge team in 2009. They  are available via the BioBrick BBa_K274100 (Fig. 4).
Figure 4: BBa_K274100
Experimental system
Biobrick BBa_K274100 is a composite biobrick which contains the lycopene biosynthesis genes (under control of the arabinose promoter); the color red will be the reporter of promoter cI-dependent transcriptions of the four following constructs:
We propose to substitute the arabinose control by the cI repressor control (part of biobrick BBa_K098995). In the presence of the wild-type cI repressor (from biobrick BBa_C0051), the expression of the lycopene biosynthesis genes is repressed and the bacterial cells will be white regardless of their growth temperatures. This construct tests the efficiency of the repression by cI

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

Determination of Noise Levels in Constitutive Promoter Family Members
Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry revealed that a strong constitutive promoter was suitable for the expression of the photocontrol device.
To assess which of the constitutive promoters would be suitable for a uniform expression of the photocontrol device, BBa_K519030 , and the antitoxin RelB, BBa_K2449028 , the expression levels and the noise of four different members of the Anderson promoter collection and their RFP reporter systems, were studied by fluorescence microscopy. These were, in increasing promoter strength, BBa_J23114 , BBa_J23110 , BBa_J23106 , and BBa_J23102 .
Additionally, the change in RFP expression levels and noise during growth were tested for the promoters with the highest and lowest relative promoter strength by flow cytometry and qualitative analysis by fluorescence microscopy. Combining these two techniques, the expression and noise levels for the promoters were determined as follows:
The weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , exhibited a relatively low expression of RFP, indicating low gene expression and an increasing high level of noise throughout growth.
Both medium strength promoters, BBa_J23110 and BBa_J23106 , displayed a moderate level of both noise and protein expression of the RFP reporter.
The strong promoter, BBa_J23102 , exhibited a comparatively high expression of the reporter RFP and an increasing high level of noise throughout growth.
For further information about the experiments and a proposed cause for the increasing noise level, read here.
As the strong constitutive promoter exhibited the most uniform expression, this was chosen to regulate the expression of the photocontrol device genes. With the modelling results in mind, it was decided that the relB gene should be regulated by a tightly controllable uniform promoter, thereby ruling out the constitutive promoter family members as a possibility.
Expression Level of the Mnt- and Penl-Regulated Promoters
The PenI-regulated promoter was chosen to control the expression of the photocontrol device, as it mediated a stronger expression than the Mnt-regulated promoter.
The cloning of the strong constitutive promoter, BBa_J23102 , and the photocontrol device, BBa_K519030 , emerged problematic. For further information about these difficulties, read here.
Consequently, the applicability of two different promoters was studied. These were the PenI-regulated, BBa_R0074 , and the Mnt-regulated promoters, BBa_R0073 , whose repress"

BLAST results
BLAST+ provides 18 output formats, in order to simplify the procession, we choosed the tabular format. Here is part of the BLAST results:
Table.1.BLAST results
Important values in BLAST
Score -- sum of the scores in the traceback process of alignment, it directly indicates the similarity of two sequences. Higher score corresponds to higher similarity.
Evalue -- the expected number of HSPs(high score pairs) with score at least S. It’s the main threshold that can be used to limit the BLAST output. The smaller the evalue, the less the number of HSPs, and correspondingly, the higher the similarity of the two sequences.
Fig.1.BLAST parameters
Calculating: \(E=Kmne^{-\lambda S}\)
Where: m and n are the lengths of the sequences aligned. K and lambda can be thought of simply as natural scales for the search space size and the scoring system respectively. [2]
pident -- Percentage of identical matches, besides which is the mismatch area and gaps in the alignment area
length-- Alignment length
qlen-- length of query sequence
Screening the BLAST results
Problems
Protein coding sequences is a big category in iGEM parts database, which contains 8454 parts(the total number of parts in the database is less than 30,000) and has longer sequence than other kind of parts on average. It’s both important and difficult for us to BLAST.
when doing BLAST between iGEM parts database and uniprot database to match the high similarity items, we’ve set the evalue to 1e-6. However, by artificial validation we’ve found that many of the matched pairs in the BLAST output is in low similarity in function or even have nothing to do with each other, which means the match is misleading.
Despite all of the matched pairs has evalue pretty low(most of them are far lower than 1e-6),but the ‘pident’ of them are varying from 19% to 100%, and the value of length/qlen is varying from a very low number to 100%--which badly needed filtrating.
There are several facts important for analyzing the BLAST results:
1. Homologous:
According to the theories of evolution, similarity of DNA sequence between different organisms is very common, and the level of similarity is related to the evolutionary distance; hence, the similar sequence identified by BLAST may be the homologous gene in two different species"

Detection Module
S. pneumoniae σx promoters Module
Detection Module
Overview
The two-component regulatory system in S. pneumoniae, consisting of the receptor ComD and its response regulator ComE was to be used in detecting the       autoinducer molecule, competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) and so detect S. pneumoniae populations correspondingly. The activity of the comCDE operon      promoter (PcomCDE) is induced by phosphorylated ComE. In order to facilitate characterization of PcomCDE, we use the phosphorylmimetic ComE       mutant, ComED58E, in the pKHS plasmid which was kindly sent to us by Martin et al., from the Université de Toulouse. The characterization of       PcomCDE is for the purpose of linkage to the σx promoters module by regulating expression of the sigma factor.

The C-terminal metal binding domain and the N-terminal DNA binding domain are likely to be modular for each other. (To Read More…)
    Previous work shows that artificial MBP chain still kept the in vivo metal-binding ability comparable to dimeric, full-length MerR[8], while it comprises less amino acids and will cost less for large-scale expression. Since our ultimate goal is to design a high-performance and less energy-consuming bioabsorbent, the MBP will be an excellent candidate for the absorbent effector. MBP was then fused with DsbA, a periplasmic expression signal protein, and OmpA, a membrane protein, to construct periplasmic MBP and surface displayed MBP, in order to maximize the bacterial capability of mercury binding. Finally, mercury MBP was constitutively expressed on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli cells via carefully designed genetic circuits, to guarantee the maximum of Hg absorption.
Figure 3. Scheme of MBP construction and the predicted MBP structure. (A) Linear structure of MerR coding region. (B) Construction of MBP. The MBP was constructed by fusing two copies of metal binding domain of MerR in tandem with a flexible SSG bridge. Blue bars indicate the dimerization helix in the metal binding domain of MerR, and gray bars indicate other α-helices of MerR. The red line indicates the SSG linker, and the blue and green lines indicate the loop after the dimerization loop and the region after the loop, respectively.

    Hg (II) ions can enter the bacteria cell by diffusion through the outer membrane [9], however, the hydrophobic inner membrane prevents them from passing through the inner membrane. To guarantee the binding efficiency of our bioabsorbent, we also designed the facilitation module to assist the MBPs to chelate enough Hg (II). MerT is a transmembrane protein which can import Hg (II) ions from periplasm into cytosol with the help of MerP; while MerC can directly transport Hg (II) into cy"

Documentation team: The team was responsible for documenting and marketing the team in any way possible. The documentation team was responsible for preserving significant and awkward moments to be able to describe the
process from the beginning. The documentation team was responsible for producing the group's videos, short documentation and ongoing blogs, photos, videos, articles and more .. The documentation team has been active in all
social networks: Google +, Facebook, Twitter and even Instagram. Their aim is to spread the idea and to maintain the process.
Site and writing team: in charge of the wiki site construction. Their work was very important for the transfer of information passed on to them from all the other groups, the translation from Hebrew into English, and looking at website design that attracts the eye. The writing team documented in words and images the events that took place in the classroom ever since the decision to participate in the competition was made.
Presentation Team: The face of our Team. Members of this team will represent us in any event related to the spreading of the project and the competition itself. Team members were interviewed by the local press and met with donors. They meet frequently with Dave and work on their English language accent and way of speaking, yet ultimately; they are the ones who are supposed to represent us in the competition in Boston and speak professionally and proficiently and to
represent us with dignity.
Logistics Team: running and working overtime behind the scenes to take care and make sure everything is, that no group is not missing anything everyone is working consistently and nobody gets stuck in the back, they push the team forward and take care of all things great and small alike. This team has produced all the classroom activities, for example, coordinating meetings, writing and distributing surveys and more.
It is important to note that all groups are necessary to carry out the process and think equally, without the contribution of each
member the entire project would have been in vain, and so each and every member has to give his 100%. Most students took part in two teams.
After the exposure of the project to financers, scientists and academics from across the country the Team travelled to represent us at several conferences: The Annual Manufacturers Conference, International Science Day at Tel Hai College and the annual scientific meeting at Tel Hai College.

The experimental results showed that the antibody concentration was responsive at 1000 ng/mL                             and                             1500 ng/mL, and the results were obvious. Among them, the method of dropping antigen is more                             stable.
The Influence of GA and APTES
Time:
19 Sept: The influence with or without APTES and GA.
Since the previous results were more pronounced, we then explored the impact of GA and APTES                             on                             the results. We skipped the steps of immobilizing the antigen and dropping the antibody,                             directly performing the GA addition step after self-assembly of the slide, and exploring the                             effect of GA (shown in Figure (7)a). The impact of APTES is to observe the observations made                             after self-assembly (Figure (7)b).
a. APTES inquiry results
b. GA inquiry results

It can be seen from the results that APTES and GA are negligible for liquid crystal                             disturbance.
Hydrophilic Experiment of Slide
In order to investigate how hydrophilic the slides were before and after antigen addition, we                             conducted a measurement of the contact angle experiment. Among them, we will self-assemble                             the                             upper and lower slides, and the upper and lower slides will be dried at 110℃ for 1 h,                             changed to                             be dried at 80℃ for 1 h. The method of immobilizing the antigen is to adopt a soaking                             method.
No antigen was added, and the contact angle of 50 ng/mL antigen with 500 ng/mL antigen was                             shown                             (Fig. 8 (8) a, b, c).
a. Unfixed antigen
b. Antigen concentration 50ng/mL
c. Antigen concentration 500ng/mL
Figure 8 Results of the hydrophilicity test of the lower slide
It can be concluded that as the concentration of the immobilized antigen increases, the slide                             changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic.

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," extremely challenging for synthetic biologists to incorporate this process into their workflow.
The two primary advantages that TERRA has over this system are flexibility and cost. TERRA costs less than $400 and is manufactured via accessible means such as 3D printing. TERRA accomplishes this low-cost price point by taking a DIY approach to automating microfluidic experiments. While the LHS system is more precise, TERRA is designed for researchers to perform a wider array microfluidic experiments. In terms of chip flexibility, TERRA can run a wider variety of both microfluidic experiments and types of microfluidic chips by way of the TERRA adapter. Therefore, chips with fabricated commercially as well as the MakerFluidics workflow can be integrated into TERRA. This increases the design space for microfluidic experiments for synthetic biologists.
TERRA’s largest flaw is the complexity of dispensing a wide variety of sample volumes. Currently, continuous flow microfluidics is the most compatible with our system. Using our current size tubing of (0.0625 inches or 1.6mm) , the average droplet dispensed is 48 μL, so volumes that are multiples of the average droplet size are easy to dispense. If the desired volume is smaller or in multiples of this designation, droplet-based microfluidics must be used to dispense that volume accurately. Through this method, the 48 μL droplet that dispensed from the nozzle is part sample and part mineral oil. The proportions of these liquids can be manipulated through flow rate and microfluidic chip design to achieve the desired volume.
Though our modeling experiments were able to discern that changing either the diameter or material of the tubing should also change the size of the droplet dispensed from the nozzle. Given more time, we would have provided TERRA with the functionality to allow the user would have greater control over their experiment by choosing certain nozzle tubing based on combinations of material and diameter. This type of control would be similar to selecting end mills or drill bits in machining.
Impacts of TERRA
A major impact of TERRA is how it both automates and incorporates microfluidics into pre-existing workflow of synthetic biology experiments . Once a microfluidic experiment is set up on TERRA and the UI, it can be left to run unattended, leaving the researcher free to work on other projects while the chip is running. This combined with the flexibility and wide range of microfluidic chips compatible with TERRA make the system easy to incorporate into different workflows.

Tsinghua,2012,Team:Tsinghua#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in the signal transmission module. The concept of positive  feedback is also applied in this module, making it possible to intensify signal  strength and avoid attenuation.
We constructed our own positive feedback loop  in E. coli with several different parts. LuxI, with the function of expressing  AHL synthase, was inserted downstream of RFP in the aforementioned basic  module. Thus, once external AHL is received and RFP expressed, AHL would be  further synthetized in the same bacterium. As a result, AHL molecules  synthesized after RFP could affect the E. coli itself, synthesizing even more  AHLs and completing the positive feedback loop; alternatively, it could travel  across membranes to other bacteria nearby, and start the activation of  identical modules in those cells. In other words, information received by the  initial bacterium is transmitted to its neighbors, and they would respond the  same way and pass the signal on to other cells, just as domino tiles would pass  the mechanical force on to other tiles. Furthermore, the expression of RFP  would spread to the whole community over time, and accumulate in a certain time  period. Both the positive feedback loop and the enormous population of bacteria  could serve for the purpose of signal amplification.
3.2 Complex modules
3.2.1 Logic gate-like  information processing:
When different signals meet in the same cell, the state of the cell would shift from “transmission” to “processing”. The conventional dominoes can be arranged to function as logic gates, which inspires us to design similar information processing circuitries with our system.
Figure2. An abstract of  domino tiles to complete logic gate-like functions, which are also realizable  with our biological system.
Here we designed a simple part to achieve a logic gate-like information processing. When only signal B (3OC12HSL) is present, RFP is expressed and can be seen. But if signal A (3OC6HSL) is added with signal B, cI repressor is expressed and then inhibit the expression of RFP.
 
We also designed a system to accomplish the information processing. In this system, there are some fixed parts such as Plac, Plux, and some alterable parts like R1 to R4 (protein coding genes) and PA, PB (promoters). In order to make one logic gate available, we can just change the R1 to R4 or PA, PB.
When R1, R2, R3, R4 and PA, PB in figure above  represent different protein coding gene or"

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," chest X-ray is used today to scan for tumors. The scan can indicate the position and size of the tumors. Despite being a non-invasive procedure, it is accompanied by limitations such as cost, time and expertise. Due to these limitations X-ray is not suitable for mass screening of lung cancer [4]. Therefore, there is a demand for new diagnostic tools with mass screening potential.
One of the most promising approaches for early diagnosis is the use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as biomarkers. Some specific VOCs can be detected in higher concentrations in the breath of lung cancer patients compared to healthy individuals, since the cancer cells have an increased oxidative rate that results in oxidative stress products. The low concentration of VOCs, pmol/l,  however has provided a challenge in using this approach for detection and no efficient screening method is yet available [5].
Studies have shown that there is not only one compound that can be used as a biomarker in the breath of cancer patients [5]. An optimal diagnostic tool would therefore be able to detect multiple VOCs in order to decrease the number of false positive diagnoses. One example of a diagnostic tool is a biosensor, which is a biological-based system that can detect the presence of a target analyte and convert it into a signal. A biosensor can be developed with many different species, antibodies or enzymes. In this case, a yeast-based biosensor is a suitable approach where some of the advantages are the ease of genetic manipulation, as well as the cheap and easy cultivation [6].
To create this novel, non-invasive diagnostic tool, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be used as a biosensor. The yeast cells will have two xenogeneic olfactory receptors incorporated. These can bind the biomarkers that are present in the breath of lung cancer patients, opening up for the possibility to detect the cancer before any symptoms appear.
BREATHtaking
The biosensor BREATHtaking is designed to detect lung cancer in the breath of patients and is built as an AND-gate in S. cerevisiae, dependent on mating between the two mating types α and a. The biosensor is divided into three parts; detection, switch and output, see Figure 1. Recombinant G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) detect butanone and n-octanal, two of the VOCs most commonly found in elevated levels in exhaled air from lung cancer patients [7,8]. Detection of n-octanal and butanone is the first part of the biosensor and leads to both expression of mating genes in the cells and initiation"

BGHpA ( BBa_K678019 )
eGFP+k_GOI ( BBa_K678007 )
The fragments will be frozen and later purified.
We still have not succeed to make BioBricks pyrG and pyrG-DR (used as a marker in fungi), despite different PCR attempts with a high annealing (59°) and low (56°) temperature.
Work for iGEM Copenhagen team
We have established collaboration with the iGEM team from Copenhagen University. We will costumize a number of their BioBricks to use with our Plug 'n' Play system. This is a great way of showing how easy it is to costumize the Plug 'n' Play system for any application, and the Copenhagen team will save a lot of time.  Today we transformed competent E.coli cells with some of the standard biological parts from iGEM, BBa_R0010 , Bba_B0015 and BBa_J52034 , and later we will make them fit the Plug 'n' Play with DNA system.

We got a new delivery of primers from IDT today. They are to be diluted and stocked, before use.   We have had some difficulty with obtaining 5 of our new biobricks; SV40+ori, SV40 pA, LacZ, pyrG and pyrG-DR. We ran a touch PCR program, where the annealing temperature ran from 55° to 65° for each sample in each cycle.
The PCR reactions were successful, and following biobricks are ready for Plug'n'Play:
SV40 +ori ( BBa_K678005 )
SV40 pA ( BBa_K678012 )
LacZ ( BBa_K678026 )
Tuesday
The primers recieved yesterday will be used for amplification of many many many new biobricks today.

Characterization
1. Characterization of movement in xyz
Our printer is like a bike equipped with two different gear wheels to enable changes of the printing velocity. Using a camera, we recorded nine runs of the printhead along a ruler. Using this video data, the distance covered in time steps of 1.0 seconds was measured. The average distance covered in 11 seconds was 6.57 cm.
After changing the gear, the same experiment was conducted now at a lower tip velocity. Here, the average distance covered in 16 seconds amounted to 3.44 cm.
From these data, the velocity during each time interval was calculated and the velocity distribution was plotted in the following graph. The average velocity of the fast gear wheel was 0.6 cm/second.
For the slow gear wheel, we found an average velocity of 0.21 cm/second which is approximately ⅓ of the velocity achieved by the larger wheel. From the graph we can observe that the velocity is 2±1 cm/second.
While the fast gear wheel prints with a velocity distribution of roughly 0.6±2 cm/second, the slow gear wheel prints at roughly 0.3±1 cm/second. Thus, to cover a fixed distance of for instance 0.6 cm, both gear wheels print with the same precision: 0.6±2 cm. However, practical experience showed control of the printhead movement and ink flow rate fine tuning to be easier with the slow gear wheel.
In order to characterise the movement in the z-direction, a similar experiment was conducted: movement of the printer surface along a ruler was recorded with a video camera. Due to the reduced velocity in z-direction, intervals of 3 seconds were chosen this time. The experiment was repeated five times and the average distance covered is presented in the following graph:
The sigmoidal shape of distance covered by the stage is explained by the arm moving the stage being fixed to a wheel. When turning, the increase in z-direction is very little, reaches a maximum after 90° of rotation and then decreases again.
2. Characterisation of the alginate line thickness
In order to be a real 3D printer following the principle of stereolithography, many layers need to be deposited on top of each other to generate the aspired structure. But can we print several layers on top of each other without great losses in precision, thus: how thick will the lines be"

Download and further documentation
We provide the entire software as it is. You can get a copy of our repository by installing git and run in a terminal:
git clone https://www.github.com/iGEMDarmstadt/holopyguy.git
To set it up for running, we follow the getting started section from holopy. If you use a unix based operating system, please run the following lines in command-line:
sudo apt install conda
conda install -c conda-forge holopy
That should set up the production branch of HoloPy. For Windows, the installation process is quite similar. Install Anaconda3 for your OS. Be aware that if you let the box checked in the installer, Anaconda overwirtes the default python interpreter. Then, run the following commands in the anaconda prompt:
anaconda search holopy
anaconda show ralex0/holopy
conda install -c conda-forge emcee
conda install -c conda-forge h5netcdf
conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/ralex0 holopy

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Conclusions and Future Work
Due to time constraints, we lacked the time to characterise these parts into the Sensynova platform within the lab. The parts BBa_K2205024 and BBa_K2205025 , the parts BBa_K274371 and BBa_K274381 respectively as processing units of the platform, were been submitted to the iGEM registry for future work and characterisation by future teams. The intermediate parts BBa_K2205027 and BBa_K2205028 , the parts BBa_K274371 and BBa_K274381 respectively resulted from the ligation to the first part of processing unit of the platform prior to the ligation to part of processing unit of the platform, were also submitted to the registry.

Rationale and Aim
deGFP is a variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). It was initially designed by Shin and Noireaux (2010) for expression in cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems and is more efficiently translated than other variants (e.g. eGFP). Through talks with other biosensor developers (for example, Chris French), and after reviewing legislation regarding the use of synthetic biology outside of the lab environment,"

Mr. Lindemann: A certain aspect of this is of course the financing of everything. We know the organizations, which are able to finance projects like this. The other aspect is as David mentioned are field studies, getting in the touch with people, who can conduct these studies, and get approvals and so on. Could be a fitful collaboration between our two organizations.
Dr. Hutchinson: So often, as in everything, it is who you know.
Dr. Oertel: And make the process efficient. You probably have some other things to do.
Dr. Hutchinson: Can you do evaluation here with the Bernhard Nocht Institute? I do not know and have no dimension. Do you put it in this room and release a load of mosquitoes and see what happens? Is that what you are doing?
[We showed them our planned mosquito experiments and as Mr. Oertel had to go earlier we finalized on the details concerning our cooperation]
Dr. Hutchinson: As follows: Malaria has understandably a lot of emotion behind it, because we hear all about these dying African children, so many per minute. And we multiply that into hours and days and all the rest of it and that is all of course very understandable, but there is out there a huge disease, causing immense morbidity, insect vector borne disease, which is dengue. That is a crippling disease. Not so much associated with mortality and hence the emotion, that goes with it. But it is a real, real problem. So, first things first, walking before one can run, have you considered looking at this against other insects?
Lisa: Not yet.
Dr. Hutchinson: So, can you bare that in mind. Have you made a note on that? Very seriously you should bare that in mind.

Interview with Dr. Andrew Hammond
In the course of our project, we had the great opportunity to interview Dr. Andrew Hammond, post-doctoral researcher at the Imperial College London in the field of malaria control through genetic-based technologies.
Besides giving us a quick overview of the general functionalities of gene drive as a very promising approach to contain malaria, he also gave us an understanding of his substantial publications.

This study having captured our attention, we decided to use mutant HNS to increase flagellar speed and torque power.
PotB59/PomA
The flagella of bacteria is made up of 30 different proteins and at least three different parts. These parts are the basal body, hook and filament. . The basal body is made up of the rotor and stator and is the region responsible for the rotation of the flagella. The stator is the part made up of channel proteins that generate the necessary proton motive force. The rotor is a stable region of the basal body which controls things such as the speed and direction of the flagella and is found in the inner region of the stator. The interaction between the rotor and stator, found in the basal body, result in the movement of the flagella. The filament is the long string-like structure that reaches outwards. . The role of the hook is to connect the filament and the basal body together.
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the bacterial flagellum. The flagellum is a locomotive organelle for bacterial propulsion. The flagellum consists of the basal body, which acts as a reversible rotary motor, the hook, which functions as a universal joint and the filament, which works as a helical screw. OM, outer membrane; PG, peptidoglycan layer; CM, cytoplasmic membrane.
The driving force of the bacterial flagellar rotation is an ion concentration gradient between the two sides of the membrane. The energy needed to rotate the flagella is generated by the majority of bacteria as a H or Na ion concentration gradient. In proton(H)-driven motors, the rotation of the flagella is carried out by the MotA and MotB membrane proteins. These proteins are actually H+ channels and when H+ moves through these channels depending on the concentration gradient, the necessary energy for flagellal rotation is created. This system that uses H+ is used by E. Coli and many other bacterial strains to generate energy for flagellar rotation. Other bacterial strains rely on Na+ to power their flagellar motor.  These include Vibrio spp. (V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus ve V. cholerae) and alkaphilic Bacillus species.  These bacteria, in place of MotA and MotB proteins, use"

Chitin Deacetylase COD, BBa_K2848001
The BioBricks BBa_K2380044 and BBa_K2380043 (TU Darmstadt 2017), chitin deacetylase COD, were improved by adding a His6-tag to the C-terminus. As already proposed by the Darmstadt Team 2017 ( ChiTUcare ) this modification simplifies the purification of the protein by affinity chromatography. The resulting BioBricks are BBa_K2848002 and BBa_K2848001 , respectively.
Additionally, the deacetylase COD ( BBa_K2848002 ) was fused to the chitin synthase NodC ( BBa_K2380002 ) to obtain BBa_K2848001 . With this BioBrick E. coli should be capable of producing chitosan carrying only a single plasmid.
Pre-Nisin A, BBa_K2848004
The Biobrick BBa_K1365000 containing pre-Nisin A was improved during our project. Two distinctive tags were added to this BioBrick, resulting in BBa_K2848003 . The first is a His6-tag which can be used for purification via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The second tag is the self-designed YAAY-tag consisting of Tyrosine-Alanine-Alanine-Tyrosine. Since nisin contains no tyrosines, this tag enables the link to other molecular compounds if a tyrosinase is used. Both tags are placed after the leader-peptide, which gets cleaved off after the processing of nisin. Thus, these two tags maintain their function even after processing of nisin and enable different downstream applications."

D.                  Cessation of light causes the LOV domain to return to its dark state, dissociating LovTAP from the DNA and reinstating contact between the LOV domain and shared helix.

Where iGEM and LOVTAP Meet
EPFL
LovTAP was initially cloned into a BioBrick and characterized by the EPF-Lausanne 2009 team. Strickland et al. measured only a 5-fold change in DNA-binding affinity from dark state to light state in LovTAP. Though this change is relatively small (in biological scales), the EPF-Lausanne team found that there is a significant change in transcriptional output in response to 470nm light.
Using molecular dynamics simulations, the EPF-Lausanne team found two mutations that were predicted to improve LovTAP’s function by increasing the stability of the light state and decreasing the time it takes to flip from dark state to light state.
UNAM
A new LovTAP part was synthesized by the UNAM 2010 team via the alteration of EPF-Lausanne’s LovTAP. Primary changes include the removal of two 2 PstI restriction sites from the coding region of LovTAP and the addition of one of the point mutations that was proposed by the EPF-Lausanne team.
 
 
Etch-a-Sketch's LOVTAP
Our Project
For our circuit we will be using UNAM’s modified LovTAP, K360127. For the trp promoter and operator, we will be using our own ptrpL, based on ptrpL K360023.
Possible issues
The UNAM team appeared to not have nearly as much success with LovTAP as the EPF-Lausanne team. Whether this was due to the mutation that was introduced or some other factor is unclear. We hoped to study UNAM’s LovTAP and possibly introduce other mutations to improve LovTAP’s function. For example, Strickland et al. identified mutations that increased LovTAP’s dynamic range (i.e. the difference in repression in the dark state vs. the light state) from 5 to 70.
Another issue is that the conformational change of LovTAP in the presence of light is relatively unstable. Upon removal of the light source, LovTAP quickly returns to a conformation in which the Jα-helix binds to the AsLOV2 domain, inactivating the trpR DNA-binding activity"
Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Project#Intellectual Property_-_-_TEXT.html," of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

There are clear bands at all the six annealing temperatures, so the PCR worked well.
DpnI Digestion
We did a DpnI digestion overnight of the quik change products.
Day 2
PCR-Clean-Up
We made a PCR-clean-up of the DpnI digested products to prepare them for transformation in E. coli Dh5alpha.
Transformation in DH5alpha
We transformed the purified SDM product into E. coli DH5 alpha and plated them on LB + Amp plates.
Day 3
Transformation Results
The transformation was successful.
Overnight Cultures
We made overnight cultures of 4 of the grown colonies in 5 ml LB + Ampicillin.
Day 4
Plasmid Isolation
We isolated the plasmids of the quikchanged subtilisin E in pTEF-MF overnights.
Nanodrop
We measured the concentration of isolated plasmids via nanodrop:
1.  912.6 ng/µl
2.   910 ng/µl
3.   866 ng/µl
4.   660.4 ng/µl
Sequencing
We sent the four samples of isolated plasmids in for sequencing with YP0007, YP0008 and YP0009.
Day 5
Sequencing Results
All four samples showed the right sequence.
Results
We did not continue after this step as the subtilisin E expression did not work.
Test Expression
As our previous efforts did not produce usable results, we did not reach this point.
Expression of Synthetase
In order to incorporate our DMNB-serine into the protease we aim to produce, we have to provide the organism with an orthogonal tRNA/Synthetase pair specific for this non canonical amino acid. We found that this has been created by the Schultz lab and contacted them. We were grateful that they agreed to send us their plasmid and thus made our work possible in the first place.

Previous in vitro experiments (FRET) have shown that CpxR dimerizes. Currently little in vivo information about CpxR’s dimerization is available. To  characterize our stress responsive bacteria, we had to confirm that CpxR dimerized in vivo as well as elucidate CpxR’s dimerization orientation.
We synthesized four constructs with combinations of the split IFP1.4 fragments fused to the C or N terminal of CpxR.  As seen in the graph below, induction of IFP1.4 signal by 50 mM KCl was done at t=24min. We clearly see that the construct with IFP fragments on the C-terminal immediately responded to stress by emitting fluorescence. In fact we observe a 3 fold signal increase in 2 minutes. On the other hand, the three other orientations were non-responsive to KCl stress.
This 30-fold signal increase in little time from the baseline allows us to assert that only the strain synthesizing the IFP fragments on the C-terminals of CpxR responded to KCl stress. For a further analysis of this experiment check out this link!
Signal induction by various concentrations of KCl & signal shutdown by centrifugation
Having confirmed that KCl was a good inducer for our signal, we tested different concentration of KCl to modulate the signal and better characterize our biobrick. We also aimed to shut down the signal by centrifugation and medium change. The signal was measured on a plate reader 20 minutes, before the addition of KCl. After 2 hours of measurement we centrifuged the cells for ten minutes and replaced the medium with PBS to be able to get a shutdown of the signal.
We successfully showed that increasing"

Denver_Biolabs,2016,Team:Denver Biolabs#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the       short half-life and need for refrigeration of the life-saving drug oxytocin. We have begun work on this       aspect of the project in several ways. First, we researched E.coli strains capable of folding human proteins,       and ordered BL21. We also began testing different competent cell protocols to maximize our transformation       efficiency of this strain. We also requested a part iGEM HQ       submitted by the Lethbridge Canada 2013 iGEM team .       The Lethbridge part included the oxytocin gene and its precursor molecule nueorphysin-I. The goal of the Lethbridge       team was also to create a longer-lasting form of oxytocin by adding precursor molecules to slow the hormone's degradation.       We are working to improve upon their part by experimenting with different secretion tags to facilitate easier       precipitation of the resulting protein.
We are still working on this aspect of the project, researching possible mechanisms for producing       the human oxytocin protein using yeast, and exploring possible temperature regulation mechanisms to       mitigate the instability of this essential medication.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Above mentioned competent cells were transformed with plasmid pSB4K5 containing construct pBAD/AraC crtE::Jazz Blues::crtB crtI::Zif268. Competent cells from these transformants were prepared and transformed with pBluescript plasmids containing different programs for biosynthesis. As these cells were grown in media containing three different antibiotic the growth was very slow, which slowed down the testing of biosynthesis carotenoids.

Experiment: 3A of genes w. camV Terminator:
Based on the Gel Tuesday, we isolated the C3, C5, H2, H4, G3, G4, G7 and G8 cultures, I wanted to confirm the construct we have made. Given the differing migration lengths from the 27/8 gel electrophoresis, we are currrently not sure whether it is the C1 or the C3 that is the successful assembly of P. CaMV-amilCP-CaMV term or whether any of them actually are. Likewise for G3, G4 and G7.
In this experiment I am to verify the sequences by amplifying the gene regions overlapping two adjacent gene fragments.Tomorrow the products from this PCR will be run on a gel, to hopefully either verify or disprove the existance of expxected gene fragments.
The PCR used a ONETAQ polymerase. The PCR was run with an anealing temperature of 49C and a elongation time of 1 min.

1. Luminometer training and sample measurements –
— We used Dan’s parameters already programmed in the luminometer.  Both the LAR II and Stop&Glow substrates had the same parameters of 80 uL volume, a delay period of 2 seconds before measurement (allows reaction to take place), and a integration time of 10 seconds (measurement time).
— Gaussia sample was supernatant from HEK293T cells.  The supernatant was undiluted and in the fridge at 4C since 5/11/11.

The sRNA Spot42 has like many other sRNA two distinctive functional parts, a recognition and a scaffold sequence. The recognition sequence binds the mRNA, while the scaffold sequence interacts with Hfq, an RNA binding protein. The sRNA-Hfq complex play an important role in the function of sRNA translational regulation.  (Holmquist, 2012)
Figure above. Panel A shows the secondary structure of scaffold
Spot42 and panel B shows a MMB generated three dimensional of
the Spot42 scaffold. HP1 and HP2 shows the positions of the two hairpins.
The secondary structure of the scaffold of Spot42 (figA) is known. However, no 3D structure of spot42 has been solved to date.  We have generated a 3D structure from the information in the secondary structure with molecular dynamics software MacroMoleculeBuilder (MMB) [1] and the 3D structure of Spot42 scaffold is presented in figure B. MMB allows the user to have full control of the biomolecule (DNA, RNA and/or protein) by applying forces between atoms, constraints and flexibility to different parts of the biomolecule.  [3]
To gain better understanding of the mechanisms of small RNA translation inhibition we have made 2D models of all our synthetic small RNAs. The 2D models were calculated in CLC main workbench using adapted versions of maximum free energy algorithms developed by [2] and thermodynamical parameters of Mfold version 3. IntaRNA, an RNA-interaction prediction software adapted for sRNA and ncRNA interactions [5] was used  to predict the sRNA-mRNA interactions of the candidate sRNAs.
The sRNAs were isolated, sequenced and analyzed to find the hybridizing base pairs. The sequences of the sRNAs that showed downregulation of YFP mainly had matching sequences in the 5’UTR of our target mRNA, although some of the sRNAs was shown to hybridize at the SYFP2 coding mRNA region. Two of these were further studied and modelled. At last, a prediction of the structure between the sRNA UU17 and AAC(6’)UTR mRNA was modelled.
Candidate sRNAs

As you can see below, our sRNAs that downregulate the SYFP2 and the antibiotic resistance gene also seem to hybridize at the region close to the RBS and the start codon. This supports the idea that many sRNAs prevent the ribosome"
