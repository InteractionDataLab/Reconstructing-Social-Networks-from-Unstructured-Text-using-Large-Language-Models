Surfactin has the formula C53H93N7O13 and is composed of a 7 amino acid cylic peptide with a hydrophobic fatty acid chain (Glu1 – Leu2 – D-Leu3­­ – Val4 – Asp5 – D-Leu6 – Leu7 – β-OH-C13-15) [4]. It is natively produced by Bacillus subtilis NRPS and in addition to functioning as an antibiotic it has detergent –like surfactant properties, antiviral and antifungal activities, and the capability to lyse red blood cells [5] making it another interesting candidate for a oligo-recombineering library creation.

Experimental Work
Tyrocidine was first detected in our native DMZ362 Brevibacillus parabrevis strain using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Initial experiments were done to develop an extraction method for the compound of interest using the DMZ362 Brevibacillus parabrevis as a positive control, Bacillus subtilis as a negative control, and an analytical standard, Tyrothricin, which contains tyrocidine A-E purified from Bacillus brevis. After testing for the compound in both the agar media and biomass, an extraction protocol was developed for use with future tyrocidine antibiotic libraries.

However, if you can somehow spray your bacteria on the area the night before and this method would make the bombs clearly visible, it would be a great method.” Furthermore, Lt Col Bergman indicates that our method is well suited for screening of, for example, building sites.

Visit to PAX
Summary: Ms. Suzanne Oosterwijk, Programme Officer Security & Disarmament of PAX, has explained us how due to social initiatives like the ICBL, the use of landmines has decreased. There is however still a need for novel landmine detection methods like our ELECTRACE system.
We visited PAX, a Dutch peace organization which was until recently known as IKV Pax Christi. Here we met with Suzanne Oosterwijk, Programme Officer Security & Disarmament. With her, we discussed the “soft” side of the battle against landmines and cluster munitions, in which PAX is an important player, and the landmine detection module of our project.
PAX is one of the founding organizations of the Cluster Munitions Coalition (CMC) and has until very recently been a governance board member of the ICBL-CMC (merger between the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and CMC). PAX is still closely involved with the activities of this organization. “These coalitions are very diverse,” Ms. Oosterwijk tells us, “You have organizations involved in victim assistance, clearance and also organizations that are more focused on lobbying and research, all working together to create a world free of landmines and cluster munitions.”
“Our main focus is cluster munitions. We are very active in a disinvestment campaign, Stop Explosive Investment, which aims to prohibit the investment in companies which make cluster munitions. We also focus on the monitoring of compliance to the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) and universalization of this treaty.” PAX has had particular success with their disinvestment campaign in the Netherlands: as of January 2013, investments in companies making cluster munitions are prohibited. “In the CCM, assistance to companies making cluster munitions is prohibited. In our view, investment is also assistance, but this is not explicitly stated in the CCM. We try to"

Remember to celebrate milestones as you prepare for the road ahead
- Nelson Mandela
In the given time frame, we achieved important milestones that will pave the long way that is ahead of us for the successful development of the Key. coli system.
1. Promoter library with a wide expression range
We employed 5 different promoters previously tested in E. coli (p1-5), alongside a promoter sequence with modified TATA boxes (pE) that would serve as a negative control. These were combined with strong and weak versions of suitable ribosome binding sites, expanding the library to 12 possible expression signals. The promoter library was tested with RFP.
The expression signals employed yielded different degrees of fluorescence, spanning a wide range over all time points assayed. The wide expression range is an advantage for the Key. coli system, introducing a desired degree of variability.
In future embodiments of the Key. coli system,  the promoter library can be further expanded to include more expression signals with the aim of pushing the boundaries of the expression range observed here even further.
2. sgRNA-promoter pairs with varying repression efficiencies
We employed 5 different sgRNAs (sgRNA1-5) with SEED sequences complementary to the chosen promoters (p1-5) and a sgRNA0 used as a control, unable to target any of the five selected promoters nor the E. coli genome.
We demonstrated that dCas9 RNA interference is feasible, efficient and specific as the constitutive expression of both dCas9 and each of the tested sgRNAs led to loss of the red colouration of colonies on the plate or reduction of red fluorescence in liquid culture; this is a qualitative proof of effective interference in RFP transcription.
Nevertheless the degree of  interference was different between different sgRNAs. As expected, there was no significant transcription interference when each sgRNA was combined with the null promoter pE, suggesting that the interference is specific to the target region. Interference was also quantified with a fluorescence assay.
The combined use of promoters of different strengths and sgRNAs of varying repression efficiencies has generated a greater range of expression profiles.
The proof-of-concept of CRISPR interference demonstrated here allows us to envision its"

NEAU-China,2015,Team:NEAU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," old friends last year. By sharing our lab life and experimental progress. we had a great fun with other IGEM teams. With lots of exchange of ideas, they were so nice to give us their suggestions about our project.
We treated the good opportunity to communicate with different universities having various backgrounds and school generations. So we tightly communicate with several IGEM teams to improve our idea and we appreciate their work.
During the poster session here, Tsinghua-A team members majored in automation gave a warm welcome to us and gave us pieces of advice of our circuit modeling. With their help, we modified the basic idea of modeling and showed them how to do it with MATLAB. The discussion ended with good results and we had a lot of fun as well.
When explained our content of poster to other students, we directly pointed out our disadvantage——the small blank corner of our poster, as a result of our slow experimental process. To our surprise, they had the same problems with us. It's true that experimental process is always full of difficulties.
Scientific camp
We gave a speech about IGEM to high school students,and we drew up posters with pictures and illustrations to let people understand easily. Also we had some conversation with them to know whether they could understand our explanation or not. It engaged the seniors to get first hand experience on what it is like to work in a synthetic biology lab, which made synthetic biology and our project approachable and transparent.
 In detail, first, we make more students become familiar with synthetic biology and IGEM Competition. And what makes us surprise is that they showed a great interest in the synthetic biology and some of the high school students plan to join us to participate in the college competition. In addition, some of them are trying to contact the headmaster to join the competition of high school level. Secondly, when we shared some good examples to them, they asked a whole lot of inspired questions. Some of the questions even could apply in our project.
Ultimately, we lead them into IGEM lab, and show them our experimental process. After the lecture and conducting experiments themselves, the students actively participated in a discussion and had a meaningful evening discussing of their opinions in research and synthetic biology.

Induction of expression of CaDXMT1
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the start of the expression of CaDXMT1. This is the third and last gene, neccessary for caffeine- synthesis (previous transformation experiments did not work).
Operational sequence:
First of all, the OD600 of the over night culture was determined: 4,42 (0,442 at 1/10 dilution). Next, 200ml of SC-U 2% galactose medium were inoculated with an adequate amount of the over night culture (has grown in SC-U 2% glucose). Note: Not the whole amount of the calculated over night culture was centrifuged down. Thus, about 12 ml of glucose medium were given to the galact"

However today, the technology has been converted into using ultrasounds that MRI machines and CT scans that are used in hospitals today. Challenging tasks, such as creating a sustainable environment on Mars, demand unique and innovative inventions that can potentially improve our society through spin-off technology.
Professional Interviews
Our team contacted businesses and institutions involved in Mars expeditions, agriculture in rough conditions, perchlorate contamination, as well as environmental contamination in general. We had also been in contact with Astronaut Shawna Pandya, however, due to her busy schedule, we were unable to interview her.
Thanks to the generosity of staff, researchers, and students at the University of Alberta, we were able to ask for public opinions on the colonization of Mars.
Would you go to Mars as a first-wave colonist?
If I had some skill or use that I could contribute that nobody else could, then yes, I would probably go in the first wave. I think it’s very important for humanity to colonize Mars. If I was going as a tourist with others, however… then no.
Tyler Hrynyk, member of the AlbertaSAT team
My worries about that one-way trip to Mars is that you're attracting people who, conventionally, would be considered to have mental issues… if you’re coming and going, you want risk-takers, you want people who absolutely believe that they can handle any problem that faces them. But here, you’re saying that there’s a problem and there’s absolutely no way to fix it. If it was [a] one way [trip] and you were giving me sufficient technology to… set up a self-sustaining colony and be able to live out a normal life… that’s a different story than if you say, “we’re giving you food to survive on Mars for 8 months and then you’re going to die”... Guaranteed death versus a high-risk pastime; those are two completely different personalities… Risk can be appealing because it is challenging, but inevitable death… not so much.
Dr. Warren Gallen, PhD, Biological Sciences
A special thank you to Dr. Ross Lockwood who granted us an interview and took us on a tour around the University of Alberta! Dr.Lockwood holds a
PhD
in condensed matter physics, having primarily studied quantum physics dots. He has also participated in the NASA-funded HI-SEAS Mars stimulation.

The buildup of the ammonia and carbonic acid act as a buffer from the lytic acid of phagolysosomes, further prolonging the length of time that P. mirabilis can survive in the urinary tract.
The fimbriae of P. mirabilis are what allow the bacteria to attach to the walls of the urinary tract, making it difficult for urine to flush out bacteria. [1] Once these bacteria have attached here, they can form flagella that allow them to move further up the UT towards the bladder and kidney.

Quick facts:
Gram (-)
Facultative anaerobic
Extracellular
Type of infection that it causes:
Vibrio cholerae causes the diarrheal disease, cholera, which has a mortality rate of 100,000 deaths a year.  This bacterium resides in aquatic areas and gets transmitted to its human host via food or water that it has contaminated.  Once consumed the bacteria make their way to the epithelium of the small intestine (SI) to start colonization.   
Virulence factors: 
V. cholerae have several virulence factors that allow them to survive the process of getting to the SI epithelium.  The first obstacle is the low pH of the stomach.  Unless there are 10^11 free-living V. cholerae cells (which is perhaps unrealistic) entering the host, not enough will survive in order"

Implementing this in MATLAB caused difficulties for us as we were still new to MATLAB. We reached out to John Marken of the William and Mary iGEM team. With his great help he offered, we made some progress, however, the delay waiting for our final experimental cell growth data to run the optimization, set us back in our modeling schedule. Our attempts with MATLAB to solve the iterative optimization problem is below. We will continue to work on implementing this nonlinear optimization problem in MATLAB.
Future Modeling
To model the ceiling tile plant closer to reality, the model must incorporate both the yeast and the bacteria that are in the process water and are competing for the same nutrients and oxygen. For this, an extended model will be developed. However, the cell growth model developed here also works for bacteria with the only difference being in the model parameters. Bacteria model parameters will be estimated from experimental data to represent the bacteria prevalent in the ceiling tile process water and wastewater. Other factors not included in this model are variations in pH, temperature, and DO. Moving the model to include these variable will be a next step. The ultimate goal of the model is to support the design and development of an implementable solution.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page. Check out part BBa_K404003 for an excellent example of a highly characterized part.
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.

Last but not least, this system can be readily automated and will be extremely useful to make high-through-put directed evolution in microalgae chassis.
B- Combinatorial assembly of synthetic retrotransposons
The end goal of our design is a modular system that can be used to optimize and improve the system itself. We can imagine to change the reverse transcriptase with greater error rate’s mutant. Thus, it will allow to increase the library. Another use of the modularity will be to construct a more “aggressive” synthetic retrotransposon. With the help of automation, we can systematically test every LTR/integrase couple to select a combination that will allows a better integration rate. This combinatory construction of the synthetic retrotransposons will only be possible by the use of Golden Gate assembly and MoClo standard.
In the same spirit, MoClo standard will allow to “tune” the expression of the retrotransposon by changing the inducible promoter. Combinatorial strategy will allow to test numbers several promoters in one-pot assembly. Like that, it may be possible to adapt the number of mRNA and then the number of integrated cDNA copy into the genome.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Judging criteria
no dates online yet
we have to select three tracks -> which ones?
our favorites (until now):
- Manufacturing - foundational Advance - environment
project description can be adjusted until wiki freeze (but is no judging criteria): make it more lurid (abstract as well) and integrate synthetic biology better
Freiburg constructs
characterize constructs? => Help another Team criteria
but these are eucaryotic constructs
check on different cell lines, media and digests
critical because incubator could be contaminated by us -> disastrous for Di Ventura group
we have no cell culture -> send cell lines to Freiburg instead
we have to fulfill one of three gold medal requirements (Parts debugging, characterize other parts, essay on safety/environment/effects of proeject)
characterize SFP? Has not been submitted -> cannot do it -> re-submit pptases
essay backup solution
Plan for Tomorrow (Meeting with Roland Eils)
Milestones
Short lab update
Indigoidine [as a new reporter system; try all suggested T-domains; show benefits of software for Indigoidine project]
Software [set up criteria, which describe similarity of modules, e.g. by literature research, Nikos will ask a member of König group, who worked with t-domains, for help]
Tyrocidine [detection: Wombacher group; in-vitro/in-vivo in parallel; maybe his-tag?; HPLC before? -> enrichment of fragments; CPEC as alternative for Gibson (worked for Ralf); e. coli lysate (e.g. in-vitro translation); do some literature research on how other groups detected NRPs; non-proteinogenic amino acids for labeling; concentration gradients native <-> transformed; contact Mr. Lehmann]
Del H [wait for results (tomorrow)]

Questionnaire for XJTLU-iGEM
Survey for synthetic biology, bio-safety, global warming and our project
Method for Survey: Questionnaire
Starting time：2015-8-1
Ending time：2015-8-31
People were chosen randomly from internet
Data analysis：
Question 1
Have you ever heard about synthetic biology before this survey?
您在这份调查之前是否听说过合成生物学的概念？
The iGEM competition is an annual, world wide, synthetic biology event. This question is aimed to find whether synthetic biology is well-known in China or not and let more people know about this area. According to this result, only a quarter people heard about bio-synthesis before our survey. Over half of people did not know about synthetic biology before. Also, 16 people were not sure that they had a clear idea about synthetic biology. We considered that most of people did not have biological background. Furthermore, industries working on bio-synthesis have just been developed recently in China so that it is not popular right now. Therefore, we should provide some associated information for public. If people chose ‘B’ and ‘C’, the definition of synthetic biology would be displayed. Additionally, we found that they were also willing to search synthetic biology on internet and wanted to learn more about this novel area.
Provided definition: Synthetic biology is the design and construction of biological devices and systems for useful purposes. It is an area of biological research and technology that combines biology and engineering, thus often overlapping with bioengineering and biomedical engineering. It encompasses a variety of different approaches, methodologies, and disciplines with a focus on engineering biology and biotechnology.
Question 2
Which conventional industries will be replaced by synthetic biology?
你认为以下哪些传统产业会被合成生物学取代?
As we know, synthetic biology can be applied in many area and even replace some conventional industries. We asked Dr. Liu, a biologist in our university, for which area could be replaced by bio-synthesis. She made a list including agriculture, metallurgic industry, cottonocracy and oil industry. Hence, we asked people this question to find if they knew the application of synthetic biology. Result was that most of people considered that conventional industries such as agriculture,"

1.3 Pneumatic Control and Mutual Exclusion
1.4 Master Slave Synchronization
1.5 Robust Design to enable Multiple Plug-and-Play Modules
Technical Challenges and Complexities of this Project
This project looks deceptively simple superficially, because it is built using Lego Mindstorms, the same pieces that middle school students often used in competitions like the FLL (FIRST Lego League).  The fact that the sole developer, Gabriel, is only 11 years old might also create a wrong impression that this project is simple. However, looks are extremely deceiving and the external industry experts and advisors on this team can also testify to that.  Please take a look at Gabriel's bio and you will agree that he is no ordinary 7th grader.
There is an extremely vast difference between this project and other Lego Mindstorms Robot projects, in terms of technical complexities, which we will explain below.
Overcoming Limitations of Lego Mindstorms
Our team has chosen to use Lego Bricks as our hardware platform, because it is easily available, and replicable. However, Lego Mindstorms NXT uses integer math which does not give us the level of precision needed to position the pipette head accurately at each of the 96 wells or control the pump to aspirate a few microliters of liquid. Hence we replaced the Lego NXT firmware with RobotC firmware that is developed by Carnegie Mellon University Robot Academy. RobotC provided us the needed precision using floating point mathematics.
Another limitation of Lego Mindstorm is the programming environment. The simple drag-and-drop iconic interface from Lego Mindstorm might be sufficient for a typical middle school student, but does not give us a enough flexibility to develop the highly complex sophisticated programs that is needed for this project. We have selected RobotC which provide us complete freedom of programming style using a “C” like language, with rich feature sets.
Computing reverse triangulation in 3-D space
Determining the position of a point accurately in 3-D space using a constrained 3-D Polar Coordinant System can be difficult. Here, any position on or above the well can be described in terms of x, y and z"

Overview
Kompala et al model
Kompala et al simulations
Keasling et al model
Kremling
Rationale
This model is important for several reasons (stated earlier). Since the secondary sources we are using are in the lactose family, we will inevitably switch on the lac operon, which could be involved in the changes we see in bacterial metabolism.
Reviewing what we have previously seen:
In a glucose-lactose rich medium, consumption of glucose is energetically more favourable because extra energy is required to make lactose enzymes (permease and b-galactosidase)
This model includes:
lac operon transcription and translation processes
glucose and lactose transport
Inducer exclusion
Catabolite repression
The assumption of constant growth rate in diauxic growth models no longer applies: It is only valid in the exponential phase. Normally growth rate is time dependent.
Model assumptions
Volume of glucose and lactose in the pool is infinite, so densities are kept constant.
They also assume in a second experiment that glucose and lactose constant but they can vary densities of glucose and lactose with time.
Model Predictions
Lactose growth:
When lactose is the only carbon source, the graph has a sigmoid shape: For different extracellular lactose concentrations, it saturates around 4mM so adding 40mM outside will not make a difference.
Growth in a mixture of glucose and lactose:
Now there will be two growth phases, where one nutrient will be consumed first and then the other.
In switching from consumption of the primary source to consumption of the secondary source, a lag period will be observed, which is found in experiment to last around 36 minutes.

Introduction
The overall design was too complicated for the time and resources available so we devised a proof of concept Brick which represented an input node from our full design. This Brick demonstrates that it is possible to transfer two-component peptide sensing from one strain into another and have it function as it did in the first strain. We took the subtilin two component system from Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 and integrated it into the chromosome of B. subtilis 168, the typical laboratory B. subtilis strain at the amyE locus.
The wet lab work involved:
Cloning the synthesized Brick from pUC57 in E. coli into our Bacillus integration vectors (with GFP and mCherry respectively downstream of the Brick)
Validation of the integration vector
Transformation and integration into the chromosome of B. subtilis 168 at the amyE locus
Validation of chromosomal integration
Characterisation of the integrated parts and their response to subtilin.

Figure 1 shows the construct which contains:
spaRK promotor
spaR (subtilin peptide antibiotic Regulation) - the 220 amino acid product of this gene usually regulates the downstream production of subtilin antibiotic. It has an N-terminal domain that can be phosphorylated and a C-terminal domian that has DNA binding properties [1]
spaK (subtilin peptide antibiotic Kinase) - this gene codes for a 325 amino acid histadine kinase peptide that phosphorylates the N-terminus of spaR [2] . This activates the DNA binding ability of the C-terminus of spaR, which in turn initiates transcription of the downstream gene. In the case of our construct, this gene is gfp.

Washington,2013,Team:Washington#LightSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," varying intensities for a range of expression levels. The 96-well format allows for the testing of many different constructs at the same time, greatly increasing the potential experimental throughput.
Our proposal of a ‘hot-swappable’ designer Biobrick will allow researchers to exchange sfGFP with any custom output desired. For example,  a LacZ reporter could be used with the to create conventional ‘Coliroid’ images. Additional fluorescent outputs such as RFP and CFP could be used to create separate and distinguishable signals. This will allow us to extend testing of red and green light sensors together on the same plate.
Additionally, we would test the tablet app using a blue light inducible construct such as the LovTAP system presented in 2009 by EPF-Lausanne. Our app allows simultaneous expression on three separate chromatic channels that are compatible with blue light systems. Ultimately,  these three signals could be used to create trichromatic output using RFP, GFP and CFP to recreate a full color image, from black and white Coliroid to vivid color bacterial photography.
Finally, we are testing the tablet for its capacity to be used as a portable incubator and expression system based on its heat output. Because of the high cost of purchasing a new incubator, we foresee this will be a boon to any iGEM team just starting out. It will allow more teams to enter the competition and make synthetic biology more accessible to high school programs. The tablet also reduces the space requirements to run both educational and high-throughput expression experiments, and could be utilized in resource-limited settings to induce and record data from biosensors in remote locations. The fact that many people already own a mobile tablet device allows them access to an inexpensive incubator by downloading the app from Google Play.

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," We connected with both students and teachers, both of whom emphasized the need for more hands on learning in order to help students learn about the applications of concepts learned in class. One teacher even said:
“Excellent workshop! Practical lab skills with a lot of support. I only wish I could take all my students to this to reinforce their learning.""
Not only were we glad to hear this positive feedback from one of the educators, it also gave us an opportunity to begin discussing how we could implement these workshops in high schools in our community. Perhaps we could design similar workshops to help young students in high school learn more about the scientific process, develop important skills and help enforce the important learning that happens in classrooms.
Through this event, we were able to successfully showcase value and applications of synthetic biology, taught practical lab skills to students who otherwise would lack access to equipment and training, and hopefully inspired students to explore different paths in science. We look forward to implementing workshops and other events in our community to help students bridge the gap between knowledge learned in the classroom and the practical applications of this knowledge.
The feedback was overwhelmingly positive for both our workshops! We are glad that both the students and teachers enjoyed and learned valuable skills. Here is what some of our attendees said:
“Mentors were amazing and it was a great opportunity for students to ask questions. The hands-on experience in the workshop was so valuable to them and they gained some really great lab skills.”
“Was made to be very fun. I learned a lot as they explained the concepts very well. I really enjoyed that we got to take a picture of the various DNA samples home”
“Presenters were extremely well-spoken. Very interesting and hands-on. Build upon concepts I had learned in school and really expanded my knowledge. Exceeded my expectations. Excited my interest in iGEM and programs I would not have considered earlier.”
This experience has allowed us to better understand how to effectively teach lab skills and their applications to young students. We look forward to continuing these workshops both at Discovery Day and and at local high schools in order to help foster a collaborative environment, to share the potential of synthetic biology and to help develop the next generation of leaders in Science!

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#FutureResearch_-_-_TEXT.html," biological parts that can be used to extend the uses of our construction and further validate it. We hope that the contributions we made with our project will prove useful for the creation of this new generation of whole cell biological reporters.
Why are we so interested in whole cell “intelligent” biosensors? We believe that these organisms will prove useful in a wide variety of situations. Initially our purpose was to develop these sensors in order to detect toxic chemicals in water, soil or any other natural habitat. In this field, biological sensors have proven to be a great and inexpensive way to assess the presence of a specific pollutant; for example, if you wish to know if a lake is contaminated with a heavy metal you can just take a sample of that lake’s water and use a biological sensor to analyze it. The results can be measured relatively fast and without the need for expensive equipment, you just have to check for the presence of the reporter molecule. With “intelligent” bacterial reporters, it is easier to estimate the concentration of the substance of interest in the system.
Even though the environmental applications are the most obvious and easy to implement, we began to explore different uses for our “intelligent” biosensors. One of the great advantages of these “intelligent” biosensors is that they respond differently depending on the concentration of the target compound, so we began to think about situations in which it would be useful to have an organism that is able to respond differentially depending on the concentration of a compound. We realized that there were a lot of situations in which we could apply these types of mechanisms that are not necessarily related to environmental science. For example, they could be used as simple medical alternatives to expensive tests.
However, there was an alternative application for our genetic frame that we found even more attractive. Instead of producing a reporter molecule with the sole objective of indicating the presence of a compound, we could produce an enzyme or another biological component that reacted in some way with the target compound. An application for these types of systems in the future could be the detection of glucose in blood and if the concentration of sugar is low, the reporter molecule produced would be glucagon, but when the concentration is high the molecule produced would be insulin. Industry could also benefit from these types of systems, for example in the implementation of chain reactions within a bioprocess. Instead of detecting different concentrations of a compound, the sensor could detect different compounds and produce a specific enzyme depending on the compound detected. The possibilities are endless and these are just two examples that we imagined when we were brainstorming about possible applications for our “intelligent” biosensor.

After looking for the above-mentioned table, we find that our product has many advantage. Not only does our project has no side effect, but it can also be used for everyone. However, all the products have to pass the examination of legalizing, if they want to hit the market. That's why we visited FDA.
Conclusion
After everything, it finally comes to a conclusion.
It took us quite a long time to reach a consensus on the position of our project, since we had been asked a similar question when having a meetup with NCKU_Tainan, “Aren’t you guys supporting the world to consume more sugar?” After all, there’s no denying that there ARE problems about social values that should be concerned. After a fierce argument between our teammates, we repositioned our project and have the reflection as well below :
 
Indeed. Avoiding eating sugar is definitely the way that gets straight to the point the most. However, it’s just like the reason why most people prefer Mosquito-repellent lotion to wearing long sleeves and trousers when hanging out with friends in a hot day. You don’t like to sweat and become smelly, so you make the choice. Let’s have another example. If you have motion sickness, the most simple and direct way to solve it is get off the car, but that’s too inconvenient. As a result, you take motion sickness pills instead. The two examples convey the same meaning. Sugar is not merely an essential nutrient in our normal life, but it is also added into snacks, afternoon tea… and so on that people enjoy for relaxation. That is, avoiding eating sugar may probably not be very efficient to reach the goal of losing weight. At this moment, our bacteria come into use.
But here comes a question. Eating sugar without absorbing it? People will definitely run into sugar’s hug rather than resist the desire.  
         Yes. Thus, instead of the medicines put on the shelf that everyone can purchase, our product will be prescription medicines for assistant purpose. Whether patients can take it to help control their weight or blood sugar depends on the doctors’ judgments. The customer base we set as target is mostly those who need to lose weight. By doing so, our product won’t be the permit to the heaven of sugar. In addition, as what the experts once said, excess is NEVER a right thing. The consequence will take its toll on the one who doesn’t cherish their body.

Microfluidics and synthetic biology
Microfluidics is an efficient tool for biological experiments. Its fields of applications go from gene regulatory network analysis to antibody screening. Several laboratory techniques can be adapted to these devices, such as DNA amplification, protein separation or cell sorting.
The chips are generally fabricated from elastomeric materials, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and contain micron-sized channels with integrated micromechanical tools (mixer, valve, pump…). This allows massive parallelisation as well as great modularity of the experiments.
Most soluble reagents can be used, including DNA, proteins and small molecule libraries. As we focused our work on E. coli and S. cerevisiae, our experiments included on-chip culture of these species. We first used the MITOMI chip which was invented in the lab of our supervisor Pr. Maerkl. We then designed new chips that were more adapted to stress the cells by pressure, as needed to implement the final “BioPad”.
The major benefits of using microfluidic chips are:
Low volume required (microliter range)
High-throughput
High precision and sensitive detection
Low cost
Wide range of applications
Safe, enclosed environment (for more information go to the safety page )
Some examples of microfluidic experiments:
Transcription factors – DNA interactions
Protein – protein interactions
On-chip gene synthesis: protein expression from coding DNA
On-chip chemostat chambers: can be used to trace the fate of a single bacterium or to grow bacteria/yeast
Antibody characterisation
Why use microfluidics in our project?
As we went on with the conception of our BioPad idea,"
uOttawa,2017,Team:uOttawa#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," yeast and is not introduced to the wild strain.
Regardless, we follow the following stringent confinement strategies:
Molecular: The components of the system are not adjacent. dCas9 is in a plasmid, while the gRNAs will be integrated directly to the yeast genome. Study is performed on a mutant strain, not a wild strain. No genetic parts are produced commercially. We use homologous recombination to construct our entire network.
Ecological: Study is performed in a sterilized and confined laboratory environment, outside the habitable range of the host organism. The area contains no potential wild mates.
Barrier: Our transformations are performed in sterilized, low-temperature environment. Because our project does not consist of a gene drive, neither does our BioBrick.
Experience with dCas9
Our lab setting has previous experience working with synthetic gRNA networks. We have undergone necessary biosafety training from the Office of Risk Management - Environmental Health & Safety (ORM). We have thus fully assessed the project and have concluded that it is safe. Lois Sowden-Plunkett, Assistant Director, Biosafety, Radiation Safety and Laser Safety, whose contact information is given below has allowed us to proceed with the project. We are also in contact with Miles Gander, expert on dCas9-involving circuits and author of ""Digital logic circuits in yeast with CRISPR-dCas9 NOR gates"" (DOI: 10.1038/ncomms15459) from the University of Washington.
Conclusion
Despite using dCas9 to construct a NOR gate, no gene drive is created. By following the due process, we were able to design a project that is safe for the lab team and the greater community. Furthermore, by thoroughly understanding the established safety procedures we were able to gain insight into the policy surrounding research. uOttawa iGEM has an ongoing commitment to promoting safe research environments for the students and community.

The binding kinetics are assumed to be of Hill type with values found in the literature [2,8]. The initial concentrations of Fus1 and Cre recombinase are assumed to be zero. The time courses for Cre/Fus1 are shown in Figure 2b. Notice that we now have about double the Fus1/Cre recombinase amounts for the lung cancer patients compared to the controls. The Cre recombinase will flip a constitutive promoter PTEF1 flanked between two LoxP sites. This will in turn activate transcription of the gRNA for ADE2 disruption in one mating type and transcription of the protein Cas9 in the other. Since the production rate of PTEF1 is unknown, we set it to an arbitrary value of 1mmol/min/L. Setting an arbitrary production rate does not allow us to make any quantitative predictions about the gRNA/Cas9 levels. However, due to the fact that the original yeast parameters are used for the receptors, quantitative information is lost anyway. Although we can still estimate relative concentrations of these species between our patient groups.
The mating rate in this model is assumed to be proportional to the amount of haploid cells in the culture and the Fus1 concentration. Given an initial 1000 haploids, we produce the corresponding amount of diploids for each patient group, shown in Figure 2d. For the concentration of activated Cas9-gRNA complex per diploid cell we assumed it to be proportional to the amount of haploids, the gRNA concentration in each cell and the Cas9 concentration in each cell. The result from this simulation is shown in Figure 2e. After 24 hours there is about a 50% increase in Cas9:gRNA dimers compared with the controls. This increase will in turn promote deletion of the ADE2 gene, causing the cell to"

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#Inclusivity_-_-_TEXT.html,"meaning they are included in a superficial manner for the sake of appearing inclusive) and ask that no one treat a group or particular person this way!
Aim to make a safer space
First of all we would like to acknowledge that it is impossible to make a perfectly safe space because there will always be aspects of a group that make individuals uncomfortable. However, we believe that all iGEM participants should aim to make their teams a safer space. Before we can create a safer space, we need to look at what a safe space is, why it is important and how to make a safe space. [4] [6]
What does a safer space look like?
As Judith Shuleviz puts it in her New York Times article “safe spaces are innocuous gatherings of like-minded people who agree to refrain from ridicule, criticism or what they term microaggressions… so that everyone can relax enough to explore the nuances of, say, a fluid gender identity.” [3] This means that a safe space is quite simply put a place where everyone feels welcome, free to be themselves, express themselves, and speak their minds. They do this knowing that the group has an agreement to be respectful of each other, and to disagree in a healthy way. An important part of establishing a safe space is also having a diverse group. This starts by being a group that is trying to break down barriers which may prevent people of diverse backgrounds from joining the group.
In the status quo, many spaces in society are not safe spaces. Team UAlberta does not believe that iGEM is actively making a safe space. We believe that we can and should do better.
How does this apply to iGEM?
As a STEM competition, iGEM faces the stereotype of not seeing safe spaces as a valuable goal to work towards. However safe spaces are very important in every field. This is particularly true in science for two reasons. Firstly, it allows all members to speak without worry that they may be attacked, allowing people to more comfortably share their knowledge, suggestions, and perspectives. This provides a greater breadth of information from which a better project can be made. Secondly, it allows for more diverse groups of people to be present on your team. With a diverse group comes diverse perspectives which inherently betters the quality of a project.
How do you make a safe space?
At this point hopefully you are thinking about how to make a safe space. But how do you go about making a safer space? There are many ways, but different things work differently for different groups of people. So, we encourage everyone to do their own research and build a"

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#ANDGate_-_-_TEXT.html," from E. coli DH5α to the strain DH5α-Z1. As described in the Methods section strains table, DH5α-Z1 contains an overexpressed version of the lacI gene, along with constitutively expressing tetR. These two genes allow for strict control of the lacI and tetR regulated promoters, which should be tightly repressed until the addition of their respective inducer molecules; IPTG and aTC (Anhydrotetracycline).  Overnight cultures were prepared of the N-term, C-term, and Full Split-GFP AND-gate constructs; each in both DH5α and DH5α-Z1 strains. The following day these cultures were diluted 1 in 100 with fresh L-Broth, prepared along with a range of inducer and co-factor final concentrations. These conditions are detailed in Figure 7. 200 ul of these culture and inducer combinations were placed into wells of a clear-based black-sided 96 well plate. The prepared plate was then incubated shaking at 300 rpm within a BMG FLUOstar Omega plate reader, where cell growth (absorbance at 600 nm) and fluorescence (excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm) readings taken at 1-hour intervals for 8 hours. 1 mM MgCl2 was added to the dual-inducer inductions as a cofactor which has been shown to improve the reliability of tetR-regulated promoter responses.  As shown in Figure 7, no significant change in fluorescence between time 0 and 8 hours was detected in the full AND-gate construct, nor the individual modules. The fluorescence emission reading at 530 nm for the hour 0 timepoint was subtracted from the subsequent reading at the 8-hour timepoint. No noticeable difference in fluorescence can be observed between DH5α or the Z1 variant. A fluorescent response would have been expected in any of the 8 conditions containing both IPTG and aTC, in either strain, but this was not observed.
Figure 7:  No fluorescence is observed from the split-GFP AND-gate during a wide array of induction conditions. Strongest induction would be expected in the 0.1mM IPTG, 100 ng/ml aTC condition.
Cell growth data was also analysed as with Figure 7, which showed that all cultures grew as would be expected, reaching a stationary growth phase by the 8-hour timepoint (Data not shown).

Stakeholder analysis
Summary
On different levels, policy-, competition-, and user level, we investigated the values that our design had to meet. How we translated the values of the stakeholders to design requirements can be found in the figure about the Hierarchical Nature of Values (figure 1). Even though some norms were contradictory (as can be seen figure 2, summary values and norms) , we aimed to meet all the norms and values as good as possible.

Summary
Interview summary
Sjouke Hoekstra is a chicken farmer who has been battling salmonella for a long time. A new policy set up to tackle antibiotic resistance problems says that chickens that test positive for Salmonella have to be slaughtered immediately. In an attempt to prevent salmonella from spreading, Sjouke has spent a lot of money on different cleaning methods. However, the underlying, fundamental cause of the salmonella problem was never really looked into. Sjouke believes that his chickens were infected via their food, which is derived from the Yucca plant.
Sjouke recommended us to dive deeper in the salmonella problem. For this purpose, he referred us to the company AVINED. Furthermore, we could contact the slaughterhouse, to which the diagnostics centre is connected.

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaDynamics_-_-_TEXT.html,". Additionally, it is possible that the primers were designed for the pSB1C3 rather than the pSB1A2, but that should have little effect due to the similarities on the ends of the two plasmids. A simple digest and ligation should be able to move the part from the one plasmid to the other. We also wanted to put a IPTG inducible (BBa_K091111, LacIQ) metA gene after a GFP. The PCR for the MetA gene and the GFP plasmid were successful (although the GFP plasmid appeared as a fairly weak band on the gel), but the PCR for the LacIQ promoter failed. The initial DNA for this PCR was added directly from the parts distribution kit, and as such the composition and concentration of exactly what was added was unknown. The PCR was repeated as a cPCR on the genome, so as to at least get a usable part with the right overhang.
In an effort to see how much amino acid each type of cell in the co-culture will produce, we have been harvesting supernatants of our normal cultures as per the protocol in Kerner et al. Once we have supernatants of the cultures at various ODs, we are going to grow the auxotrophs in this supernatant, and then look at the growth rate and final OD. The list of which supernatants we have can be found in the lab.
Joe has found inconsistent results with his fluorescent proteins on the various promoters, and we have plans to standardize the promoter and rbs for the fluorescent proteins that will be used. Additionally, there is some overlap between YFP and GFP that is proving difficult to account for, so we are going to try to switch one to either BFP or CFP.
We also wanted to grow three of the consortia together to see what sort of final OD they reach, and have been monitoring it sporadically for the past 24 hours.

August 13
Having harvested the supernatant of the various cultures at various ODs, we filter sterilized it with a 0.2 uM filter to remove any cells that may have still remained. Now that we have the sterilized supernatant, we are going to follow the protocol in Kerner et al 2012, and add 1/5 5X M9 media, and grow different auxotrophic cultures, noting the OD and growth rate. From this, we will try to calculate, or at least approximate, the amino acid export rate of the cells.

Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U_-_-_TEXT.html," Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells.
The burgeoning field of Synthetic Biology is the culmination of the previous thirty years of research into recombinant DNA and biological engineering technology. It is fundamentally about the union of biology and engineering, thereby encouraging the collaboration of geneticists, molecular biologists, biochemists, and biomedical, chemical, and computer science engineers.  Researchers in this field mainly seek to A) design and construct new biological parts, devices and systems or B) re-design existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes.

These can make iGEMers have a                                             opportunity to expand their                                             horizons instead of always cringing in your own corner and doing your                                             own                                             things. During the                                             conference, several challenge has been occurred, including the cost of                                             our                                             material. While, after                                             several time of discussion and interchange, we found that this is one                                             of                                             our critical problem. We                                             very appreciated for the suggestion of all the participants of Asia                                             Pacific Conference.
In these 4 days, we exhibited our project for all the                                             iGEMers to interchange our ideas and take                                             suggestions from others. We also found that other teams possess unique                                             projects that may advance                                             our new ear of technologies. We really appreciated for what we have                                             learn in                                             these 4 days and we                                             hoped to see them in the Giant Jamboree!

Syntehtic Biology Panel
Our team has planned a panel discussion on genetic engineering in agriculture, to be held on Wash U’s campus on Monday, September 21st. The panel is open to the Wash U community and will feature 4 area experts on genetic engineering. The following panelists have kindly agreed to participate in our discussion:
Dr. Elizabeth Haswell is an associate professor in the Wash U biology department. Her research focuses on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the perception and transduction of mechanical signals in plants. She has taught Plant Biology and Genetic Engineering here for the past four years.
Dr. Dan Haybron is a Professor of Philosophy at Saint Louis University. His research focuses on ethics and the philosophy of psychology, with an emphasis on well-being. Although it is not his primary area of research and publication, Dr. Haybron is interested in environmental issues. He sees an important connection between well-being and environmental problems, and regularly teaches a course on Environmental Ethics at SLU.
Dr. Dmitri Nusinow is a principal investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, which is a not-for-profit organization. His research focuses on understanding how the circadian clock is integrated with environmental signals to control growth, physiology, and development in plants. He has long been interested in genetic engineering.
Dr. Jeff Seale is a senior research scientist & Associate Science fellow at Monsanto. He is the Molecular Cell Sciences Platform lead. Much of his research has focused on protein structure and folding. He is passionate about the role of agriculture in helping to eliminate extreme poverty and works as a Congressional District Leader for the ONE Campaign—an international organization that works to end extreme poverty.
We hope to have an interesting and nuanced discussion of the topic and to provide perspectives to attendees that they may not have considered.

2. pBAD::mKeima ( BB_K2060001 ).
We aimed to grow these biobrick-containing bacteria in the presence of arabinose to induce expression of each construct and then measure the fluorescence and bioluminescence of the bacteria to assess:
1. Whether the proteins were correctly expressed by analysis of the appropriate spectra
2. Whether there is a change in light output when different bacterial cultures were mixed prior to analysis of appropriate spectra
Initially we sub-cultured overnight bacterial cultures (1/10) and grew for 3hours prior to induction of gene expression by addition of arabinose at various concentrations for approximately 6hours.
Following induction we used a Cary spectrophotometer to measure fluorescence and bioluminescence across appropriate spectra. The LUXoperon has been previously shown to emit light at 488nm whilst the emission wavelength of mKeima is 620nm. We also used a non-biobrick construct expressing pBAD::sfGFP as a control, for which  the emission wavelength is 510nm.
Results
Firstly we grew biobrick-containing E.coli overnight and after sub-culturing (1/10) grew for 2hr before induction with mM concentrations of arabinose.
Figure 1 shows that at these concentrations (5-20mM) of arabinose, bacteria containing the native LUXoperon showed a predicted bioluminescence spectra. However none of the other bacteria were bioluminescent.
Figure 2 shows that at these concentrations (5-20mM) of arabinose, bacteria containing sfGFP showed a predicted fluorescent spectra. However none of the other bacteria showed any fluorescence across the range of tested wavelengths.
Previous work has demonstrated that mKeima expression under the pBAD promotor was best at lower concentrations of arabinose. Therefore we grew bacterial sub-cultures for 6hr in 100uM and 250uM Arabinose (Figure 3 and 4). Unfortunately this did also not show bioluminescence or fluorescence that was suggestive of mKeima expression.
Finally we attempted to stimulate expression of the mKeima-containing biobricks BB_K2060001 and BB_K2060002 by growing bacterial cultures overnight and spiking in arabinose at 10mM for 2hr before measurement.
Figure 5 demonstrates that the LUXoperon-mKeima gave a bioluminescent blue-light output, indicating that the LUXoperon is working correctly"
METU_Turkey,2013,Team:METU Turkey#safety.html_-_-_TEXT.html," of it too. What we expect and what we could argue from literature is that having p-coumaric acid is in all cases preferable. Maybe exceeding levels could cause increased energy consumption and maybe even acid accumulation, a decrease in tyrosine(a precursor of p-coumaric acid) etc. What most probably will happen (and what we actually hope for) is that the natural feedback mechanism will be triggered and control the process. But you are right, a inductive system would have been prettier
 
4) P-coumaric acid is mostly produced by plants. Even vanilla production and cinnamon flavour begins with p-coumaric acid. Many plants produce p-coumaric acid so p-coumaric acid exposure should not cause any harm to them. Besides, p-coumaric acid will be produced in the midgut of the bee, so it is unlikely for p-coumaric acid to find its way directly to the plant.

Aim: Purify PheA-Arc1p-C-2x on a small scale
The cell culture from 14.26 was centrifuged (17000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) and the pellet resuspended in 3 mL buffer A. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL and incubated on ice for 30 min. Afterwards the cells were lysed using ultra sound (2x 18 pulses, 30 s on ice inbetween). To clear the suspension of cell debris it was centrifuged (13000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was purified using QIAGEN Ni-NTA Spin Columns. An SDS-PAGE gel showed that the protein is produced and can be purified using Ni affinity chromatography.

Having been through a happy period in Hong Kong, we get our certification to MIT. Every team worked so hard, and everybody are all so friendly. Of course it is important that we get a gold medal and the certification to go to American, but what really matters is what we saw, who we met, and what we had been through. The whole competition had become a great celebration for every member of iGEM and synthetic biology.
Before our team was founded, we heard that a great deal of energy and money has been consumed in fermentation to cool down the fermenter. There are almost 100,000,000 Yuan wasted every year all around China. So, we planned to design a chassis host which can work in higher temperature with the production of heat controlled.
We have extracted new heat shock proteins (HSPs) from thermophilic bacteria. Then we combine it with an RNA thermometer, letting the HSPs be translated at a suitable temperature to release the burden of the cell in its logarithmic phase.
BIT-China is founded in 28th Feb and our slogan is ‘for one green earth’. To settle the problem of energy consumption of cooling system in fermentation, we set up two artificial systems with the method of synthetic biology.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry.

Fig.1 positive clones of mutated promoters containing RFP
Then we selected the positive clones, incubated it at the tube, and measured the RFP intensity. Under the same condition, the fluorescence intensity of original promoter was 5000, and the PTet-1, PTet-2 and PTet-3 were about 200, while the selected No.25 was about 500.
Fig.2 RFP intensity measurement results. The original PTet has highest activity, while the strength of mutant PTet-25 is about 1/10 of the original one. Other mutants has considerably low activity.
Compared with the original promoter, the promoter activity after mutation was sharply decreased while the difference was obvious between the testing group (data over 200) and the negative control (data below 100). Since we employed PTet to control the expression of toxin proteins, it’s better that we can reduce the background expression as much as possible. The sequencing results confirmed the successful mutation of four mutants.

Through measuring the RFP intensity, we selected four mutants. They can be used to control the expression of toxin proteins.

As is displayed in the figure,the red light sensor works under the dark circumstance,binding on PompC and make it work.So with the presence of red light,the promoter is shut down.However,we actually need it to express gene,when red light appears,so we add an Not Gate tetR-PtetR downstream the part to make it work properly.

This consists on adhering    your construction to gold or tungsten particles. After that you    will shot them to your algae culture (in agar plates) at empty    conditions.
Bullets will: - Fall and not hit algae. - Kill    algae. - Break through algae. - Hit the chloroplast and transform    it. As with all chloroplast transformation methods the    introduction of desired DNA will be done by homologous    recombination.
Future
This opens the way for further research on    eukaryotic chloroplast transformation that can lead to the    development of glowing trees on boulevards (see Team Cambridge    2011).
The last experimental step would be the    transformation of Tobacco plant cell with psbA-lux cassette and    development of a protoplast. The protoplast can be grown into a    callus, from which we can finally obtain a bioluminescent plant.

The day after, the control plate (digested vector without insert) showed a notable number of colonies, suggesting a large number of self-ligated plasmids. 10 colonies have been randomly picked up and cultivated. Then the DNA was extracted and digested with EcoRI, in order to visualize those with the probe (expected at 96pb).
Figure 11: Left: 1kb Plus DNA Ladder. Right: Agarose gel 2% of the digested plasmids extracted from the bacteria transformed with the product of the first insertion. M=1 kb Opti DNA-Marker. N.D= Plasmid J04450 Non digested. Wells 1 to 10 = insert:vector mass ratio 3:1. P.ND = Probe non digested
None of the 10 colonies that were screened showed any insert. The vector J04450 probably closed on itself without the probe, before being transformed.
2.2.2 Second attempt: molar ratios
To increase the chances of success, different molar ratios insert:vector were tested: 1:1, 3:1 and 7:1. Each one of them was calculated thanks to NEBBioCalculator. The end of the protocol was the same than the first assay.
Figure 12: Left: 1kb Plus DNA Ladder. Right: Agarose gel 2% of the digested plasmids extracted from the bacteria transformed with the product of the second insertion. M=1 kb Opti DNA-Marker. Wells 1, 6 and 9= insert:vector molar ratio 1:1. Wells 12, 15 and 17:= ratio 3:1. Wells 21, 23 and 27= ratio 7:1. Pl ND = Plasmid J04450 non digested. P.D= Probe digested.
Yet, even with these new molar ratios insert:vector, same results were obtained: no probe was inserted because of the same self-ligation issue.
2.2.3 Third attempt and success: Multiple dephosphorylations
As the phosphatase efficiency was unsure, the next experiments were realized with a new phosphatase than the kit’s : a calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP).
To ensure the plasmid to stop close on itself, 3 successive dephosphorylations of EcoRI digested plasmid J04450 were done.

Created new deep well plates with LB + Carb
Picked three new colonies from each of these plates
Incubated reference plate and deep well plate overnight
Saving a Gel (There was an incorrect number of wells in a gel we made so: )
We tore up the gel and put it into the iGEM gel erlemyer flask
Microwaved the 100mL of gel for one minute until it was melted
We re-added the ethidium bromide
We re-poured the gel

WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Host a meet up
At the early stage of our project preparation, when we have just decided on our project’s goal, our team -- CIEI-BJ -- invited BIT-China, BFSUICC-China, USTBeijing and The Colorful Ladies together to exchange ideas and have a discussion at the University of Science and Technology Beijing. We also invited a journalist from China Science and Technology Daily to report on the event and interview some team members. As the host, we were honored to have team mentors and professional instructors point out our advantages and weaknesses.
During the meeting, we listened to the presentation by team BIT-China about “Who Can Get an A” at first. Then, BFSUICC-China shared their topic “Biological Toolkit for Lead Detection”. The Colorful Ladies showed us their project which was about the treatment of diseases related to LPL. Finally, we as the organizer talked about our project which is about detection and degradation of aflatoxin.

We have received valuable advice about the adjustment of experiment scheme, the ways of human practice at the meet  up. After the summer meet up organized by our team, we often communicated with the members of BFSUICC-China through Wechat or telephone. During our experiment, we needed to use chromatograph to measure the amount of aflatoxin. During BFSUICC-China’s experiment, they needed to use plate reader to measure fluorescent intensity and OD 600. We often discussed with each other on the Instrument usage and procedure. Mary Du often communicated with Xiaoxia Qu about part requirement, part submission, wiki editing and so on.

Bordeaux,2018,Team:Bordeaux#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"The European meeting organised by the IGEM Munich team took place from the 20th to 22th of July. The organizers welcomed             4 of our members (Yasmine, Jean Clément, Anaïs and David) in a good mood, offering them badges and goodies.
We then attended lectures given by Friedrich Simmel and Kristen Jung, researchers at the University of Munich. Afterwards,             the members of the Munich team were kind enough to show us the city and we finished the evening at the English             Garden with all the other teams.
The following two days we were able to share our experiences during various workshops and games. We had the opportunity             to present our poster to the other teams during these 3 days. This allowed us to get feedbacks on our project,             on our experimental approach and on the way our project is presented.
On the last evening we shared dinner followed by a few drinks with our new friends from various iGEM teams. This meeting was definitely worth the trip!
Marseille:
The mediterranean meetup took place in Marseille on the 9th and 10th of August, 2 members of iGEM Bordeaux attended             this meetup (David and Estelle). First of all we had a presentation of the project of each team in 180 seconds,             a very interesting and challenging training. The afternoon was supposed to be booked for the Marseille tour, but the weather             did not agree. However many discussion between the teams and the general good mood saved this afternoon and we spent             the night in some pubs with many teams to continue sharing our feelings and experiences about the competition.
The second day we attended several workshops about bioethics and after iGEM, those workshop were very interesting. The             afternoon we had a poster session with some guests, all researchers at Marseille University. We received many great comments, a perfect way to keep our motivation             . Overall it was a wonderful meetup full of good people and relevant workshops."
BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#MikeyNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," worked on speeding up the initial rendering of the chromosome bar. The chromosome bar may contain tens of thousands of gene objects. As a result, it was important to get the rendering of the individual gene objects as fast as possible. By analyzing different methods for rendering the genes, I was able to reduce the total rendering time from fifteen minutes to thirty seconds.
We also hooked up the backend data source. This step went off without a hitch. We had previously agreed upon an interface that the data store had to follow and we used a mocked version while waiting for development to finish. When Megan finished the backend, we swapped the mock version and the real version and the application worked!

The usability study was completed without the app crashing! After the study, the lab met to discuss changes to be made to the application in preparation for testing the application at BU. Most of the changes focused around consistency. All the sequence/publication/translation views needed to look the same. There were also a couple of performance issues. Some of the longer operations, such as running BLAST, were tying up the main UI thread. We ran these operations in a separate thread and showed some sort of loading message to the users.
