Yeast escape
-Many of us are concerned about what could happen if our genetically engineered yeast escaped into the environment; for this reason we have taken precautions to keep our yeast contained, and intend for them to stay contained in bioreactors
-Disrupting microbial/ fungal ecosystems (brings up issues of scientific uncertainty since these ecosystems are poorly characterized – we might not even be aware if we had disrupted them!)
What if RVC is wildly successful?
-Unforeseen consequences of shifting production – possible destabilization of economies.
-Possibility of putting current (more sustainable) producers of cheese out of business.
-Could cows go extinct?!
-The more popular RVC, the more impact our decisions about where to source ingredients will have on the environment. Highlights need to identify and use sustainable sources from the start (palm oil problem)
Risks to humans (health and safety)
-Our cheese might lack some of the nutrients of regular cheese (like B vitamins). We could add them back in but it doesn’t seem feasible to do this for every nutrient…and the more we do this, the more complicated our product gets, the more sourcing concerns are likely to arise
-Does casein cause cancer? (we don’t think the evidence suggests this)
-Possibility of transferring antibiotic resistance to other organisms (like gut bacteria)
-Possibility of creating a more allergenic protein (through site-directed mutagenesis)
Access
-Access: can our project contribute to making healthy food more egalitarian? Healthy foods are often more expensive or inaccessible to a majority of people. Localized food and cheese making could be more possible by way of local labs.

Fudan_China,2017,Team:Fudan China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of cellular memory devices
The ideal cellular memory devices are able to record stimulus exposure in the DNA circuits of the cells and express desired gene. This feature gives much potential to the cells.
The cellular memory devices can record transient conditions and embed them in the circuits permanently to express genes. Once activated and stimulated, the cells are capable of storing the information to be accessed later. Some tough environmental detection tasks can be carried out in this way where the subject or target environment is harmful to humans or impracticable to place detecting machines. Also, some biological pathways and feedbacks deserve to be analyzed in vivo to better understand the human body, such as cell differentiation, tissue formation and malfunction of some organs.
In addition, information stored stably in the DNA circuits enable the cells carry out certain functions. In the biotechnical industry, cellular memory significantly reduces the consumption of inducers by a large scale, and maintain producing proteins for a longer time. Moreover, we can use the cells with stable memory to treat some diseases. The cells will be triggered by biomarkers of the disease and produce functional proteins chronologically.
Project overview - Developing the concept of cellular memory
It seems that a new era of highly developed cellular information processing methods is approaching. It is so exciting that existing memory devices are diverse and useful in various conditions, but we find that they can only record the static state at the instant the recording action happens. Therefore, they are unable to monitor the dynamic changing process of one signal.
This year, we want to develop the concept of cellular memory, and to realize the monitoring of one changing signal.Namely, we want to record the different concentrations of one single inducer at different time periods.  So, we designed a unique memory device, MemOrderY , with sequential memory structure using integrases. After measuring the orthogonality and efficiency of our recombinases, we try to engineer our E. coli population to record several static states of the target signals at different time points (Fig.5 a).

Data recorded is shown; c, overview of our two-signal system circuit, details shown on the Two-signal system page.
Inspired by the work of making cellular counter13, a more sophisticated circuit is designed to achieve our goal (Fig.5 b, c). This circuit contains three parts: logic gates, sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules. The logic gates sense two signals. One is the signal we want to"

Part 2. Add anti-cold gene ( cspD2 )
    According to previous research, we know that cspD2 can express cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria. Therefore, we obtained the cspD2 fragment by in vitro synthesis, and constructed the cspD2 overexpression strain. Verify the cold resistance performance of the recombined bacteria with nisin as inducer.
Part 3. Demonstration
    Because we use nisA as promoter to express our parts, 0.5 ng/mL of Nisin is required to induce cell expression in all the following steps.
    Demonstration of msmK gene
    Copy msmK gene from Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 gene group with PCR. Construct msmK overexpression strain L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK with electrotransformation. Take strains L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK and L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149 from glycerin tube kept under -80℃, dilute 1/25 in 2 x 10 ml fresh medium (30 °C). Grow until the OD600=0.4. Count their number of colonies per ml at pH 4.0 (More details can be seen in protocol).
    We can get the following results:
Fig 3 Number of colonies at acid stress (pH 4.0).
Fig 4 Survival rate at acid stress (pH 4.0).
    The result shows that msmK is an effective anti-acid gene, which can make the recombinant strain has 213-fold higher survival rate than parent one.
    Demonstration of composite part msmK-cspD2
    It has been reported that cspD2 can effectively exert anti-freezing effect in the recipient bacteria. CspD2 was ligated to the pNZ8149/msmK plasmid by one-step cloning (seamless ligation), and the recombinant plasmid was introduced into the constructed L. lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmk-cspD2 strain using electroporation.
    The gfp gene was inserted as a marker gene, and cell viability was characterized by fluorescence intensity. The strain was tested for acid resistance and freezing resistance using a flow cytometer. The process of acid stress and cold stress is similar with the above demonstration process.

iGEM Development Environment
We have collaborated with the 2017 UK Bristol iGEM team this summer in order to use and test their new tool called the 'iGEM Development Environment' also known as 'IDE'.
 
The IDE is a local testing environment created by the Bristol iGEM team. The environment would allow users to deisgn and upload their entire wiki pages after fine-tuning to the users desired end product. The IDE also has an in-built feature that avoids unwanted interactions between the users navigation bar and  iGEM's own navigation bar. This environment was perfect for our purposes!
 
The IDE was very useful to our team since our team members are proficient in many coding languages... except HTML coding! This was just our luck, however, once the Bristol team had contacted us via Skype we quickly realised their software is just what we needed for our main wiki editor (Jake) to get going with our wiki design.
 
We were not able to use the IDE to upload our entire wiki to the iGEM website as intended since we had already started when the Bristol team had contacted us. Nevertheless, we were able to use it to design each page of the wiki.

Freeze-dried Cell Revival
In September, we sent our freeze-dried cells out to Groningen and Sheffield in order to see how reliable the fluorescence from our keys can be read after revival using a set method.
 
The Key. coli key will contain freeze-dried cells that will produce a specific fluorescence spectra that will be compared to the ""lock"" colony in order to gain access to the locked appliance using our own software. Before this, the freeze-dried cells must be revived.
 
This was a very important collection of collaborations because we will need to know the required time to obtain sufficient fluorescence after revival as well as how easy to follow our revival protocol is for potential users. To see the results that Groningen and Sheffield collected for us, have a look at our results page

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of our product from a general treatment of autoimmune diseases to focusing on IBD. A more specific focus while developing the treatment allowed us to produce a device that has a greater focus on gastrointestinal inflammation. A probiotic has a very localised effect in the intestine, this means it will have a greater and more immediate impact on inflammation occurring in the gut. This is why we have specifically chosen Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis with the belief that our treatment will have the greatest improvement over current therapies.
Dr Hannah Chen
Translational Gastroenterology Unit, University of Oxford
Dr Chen gave us guidance about the treatment of Crohn’s disease and other inflammatory diseases of the gut, highlighting the fact that the symptoms and cause of Crohn’s disease are heterogeneous. Her insight made us consider the range of inflammatory markers that vary in individuals with Crohn’s disease, prompting us to undertake further research into biomarkers for Crohn’s disease. Dr Chen recommended reading about certain research studies, and this enabled us to find evidence to demonstrate that luminal NO is a suitable biomarker for Crohn’s disease, as well as providing quantitative data for use in modelling. Dr Chen also discussed the importance of the microbiome and the general lack of understanding among the public, which encouraged us to create an information leaflet about probiotics and the microbiome, you can find this in the public engagement section.
Dr Tony Cutler
Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics
We met with Dr Cutler, an immunologist specialising in Type 1 diabetes and autoimmune diseases, to gain knowledge of how autoimmune conditions occur. He provided us with an invaluable insight into the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and how anti-inflammatory molecules may have the potential to have therapeutic effects. We met with him during the early stages of the project, he encouraged the use of IL-10 as it has beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in individuals suffering from autoimmune diseases. He highlighted the importance of safety, and encouraged research how a GM probiotic may be accepted in clinical settings.
Professor Chris O’Callaghan
Nuffield Department of Medicine
Professor O’Callaghan’s knowledge of biomarkers of inflammation and immune functioning provided us with important advice in the use of biomarkers in our design. He highlighted key studies involving biomarkers, such as evidence to show that exhaled NO is correlated to disease severity in asthmatics, to demonstrate the potential of developing an NO-based treatment method. He introduced us to the idea of altering the structure of IL-10, such as by conjugation to another molecule, to increase the transport of IL-10 to sites of inflammation. He"

Lytic phage can also infect a population of lysogenic bacteria, however upon entering the cell, phage genome gets destroyed by the CRISPR-Cas9   system delivered by the temperate phage. Similarly, a temperate phage can infect a lytically infected bacteria before it gets burst, however this has no effect on the bacteria as will be discussed further (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Mapping of interactions between phages and bacteria in a new model. XS – susceptible bacteria, XL – lysogenic bacteria, XI – bacteria infected with a lytic phage, P – lytic phage, PT – temperate phage.
Models by Levin et al. (1977) and Qiu (2007) set the foundation for a new model presented below. The consumption of resources is described as before in both models using Monod equations by all populations of bacteria.
Population of susceptible bacteria decreases as it gets infected by either of the phages proportionally to their absorption rate constants (Ki for a lytic phage and KiT for a temperate phage) and the concentrations   of phages and bacteria.
Population of lytically infected bacteria increases upon infection of susceptible bacteria with a lytic phage and decreases as cells infected T time ago lyse.
The population of lysogenic bacteria rise with the infection of XS with a temperate phage or via normal cell division similarly to XS. As described in Qiu (2007) these bacteria can be   induced at a rate q to leave the lysogenic cycle and enter the lytic cycle leading to cell lysis. We also incorporated the removal of induced bacteria from the chemostat before lysis as well as the time latency (TT)   between induction and lysis using DDEs as described in Levin et al. (2007).
The population of lytic phages increases as lytically infected bacterial cells T time ago lyse, releasing the phages. The population of lytic phage can infect all populations of bacteria, of which only XS will result   in an outcome by rendering cells into XI. To highlight the essence of the proposed two-phage strategy, upon infection of lysogenic bacteria with a lytic phage, the CRISPR-Cas9 system inside lysogenic bacteria cuts the lytic   phage genome, thereby protecting the bacteria from its viral genes.
The population of lysogenic phage increases proportionally to the induction rate and the concentration of lysogenic bacteria that were induced TT time ago. Similarly to P, PT is able to infect"

Our project
In order to make more people aware of our idea, we planned various integrated human practice activities. There are three major routes that we took to achieve this goal. For “SURVEY”, we got feedback and comments from both professional experts and general public on the feasibility and acceptability of our Leijuvant product, respectively. For “EDUCATION”, we investigated public awareness of vaccination and educated them on the significance of vaccination. For “COMMUNICATION”, we set up academic exchanges with other iGEM teams all over the world and collaborated with them.

Investigator: Daniela
Aim of the experiment: Getting the right concentration of protein for the western blot.
The preparation of the samples was already described on August, 8th.
12 % gel
6 µl Unstained Protein MW Marker (Thermo Scientific)
12.5 µl sample
Mass of enzymes:
PAL = 76.880 kDa
4CL = 61.053 kDa
CHS = 42.713 kDa
OMT = 39.265 kDa
APT = 45.481 kDa
The enzymes of the coumaroyl pathway were not detectable within the other proteins. However the gel looks good, therefore the same concentrations were used for the western blot.

We assumed 63% of the cancers we detected would be in stage 1 as in the National Lung Screening Trial [18] We then assumed that the detection of the other cancers would be evenly distributed through stages 2-4. This is unrealistic for a mass screening programme, as cancers not picked up in stage 1 would likely be picked up in stage 2. This would decrease the cost per QALY as the probability of cure in stage 2 is higher than the average of stages 2-4 and treatment in stage 2 is cheaper than the average cost of stages 2-4. [19] Therefore our model would underestimate the cost effectiveness of our sensor.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

Sensitivity was taken as 100%, as with appropriately set cutoffs our tool would identify everyone with NSCLC. This is likely to prove untrue were our test to be validated with miRNA levels in a large patient cohort - though sensitivity would still be very close to 100%. Therefore, P(False negative) = 0. However, we included it in the calculations anyway, as later we show that even if sensitivity was significantly less than 100% our test would still be cost effective. We assumed as a lower bound that false negatives will not survive - in reality, some will be detected at a later stage and survive - but were we to have included that, it would have resulted in additional QALYs gained not due to our sensor, meaning we chose to exclude them.
The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]

ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," fitted curves of AiiA. GFP fluorescence was measured 7 hours after induction with various AHL concentrations. Values for the apparent KM values are given for both cases as mean fluorescence value with n=3 ± SD.
AHL degradation by AiiA shifts the curve by five orders of magnitude towards lower sensitivity, i.e. a higher KM value. We calculated the apparent half maximum substrate concentration for both cases: with (106 nM) and without (9.983 nM) AiiA. The characterization of AiiA provided by these results indicate that the KM of Plux can be tuned over a big range of concentration by adaption of the expression levels of AiiA, since in our experimental setup we  are comparing the absence of AiiA with a high level of AiiA , leaving a lot of freedom to adaption of the levels of expression.
Upon comprehensive modeling of our system including the parameters gained from this study we could show that AHL degradation may solve our problem of leakiness of AHL production encountered in our system. However, to overcome the AHL degradation at high levels of AiiA, our cells would have to produce very high levels of AHL as well, which will be impossible in practice due to the limited number of bacteria in our singel cell analysis setup . Lowering the levels of AiiA would allow for sensitivity in the desired range of AHL. However, it will prevent the buildup of high enough gradient in AHL levels between bacteria colocalized on a cancer cell as opposed to E. coli cells floating freely in the bulk. We therefore decided not to rely on AHL degradation for our final system. Instead, we focused on the optimization of our AND gate .
Tightness of the AND gate between lactate module and AHL module
Overview
The ultimate goal of our system's setup is to receive a binary signal combining two independent indicators of CTC presence. The biggest hurdle in this was the leakiness of the quorum sensing system around LuxR. We therefore decided to arrange our two modules (the Lactate Sensor and the AHL module ) in a sequential way in our system .
Results
We are working hard on last minute results!
Establishing a system for display of Annexin V on E. coli outer membrane
Overview
We conceptualize our Microbeacon system to rely on bacteria binding to cancer cells as a detection signal. The solution that we propose is to use Annexin V expressed on the outer membrane to bind cancer cells. Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine ( Leventis, 2010 ), which is a membrane lipid usually found in the inner"

During the hot summer of July, BNU iGEM team went to Gaomi, Shandong Province. This place is the hometown of Moyan, China’s first Nobel Literature Prize winner. He is famous for whiting the stories in rural China and his hometown is in peanut agriculture zone. We visited the peanut bean field and talked with the local farmers about peanut planting.
On August 1st, 2014, we went to Gaomin and interviewed four farmers and 3 fertilizer & pesticide sellers. According to Miss Deng, when they sow the peanuts seeds, they will use fertilizer and pesticides together. The fertilizer will give peanuts enough nutrition and the pesticides will be kept from rot.
The price of nitrogen fertilizer is about 100 yuan per 100 jin ($32.68 dollars per 100kg). However, potash fertilizer should also be applied. The price of it is 250 yuan per 50 jin ($163.40 per 100kg). For every mu (666.67 square meters), 200 jin (100kg) nitrogen fertilizer, 50 jin (25kg) potash fertilizer and 150 yuan pesticide should be used. When autumn is near, they can harvest peanut kernel 300~400 jin (150~200kg) every mu according to weather condition. The price of peanut kernel is 3.5~4.5 yuan per jin (1.14~"

This will create the plates (B1) and media (B2) for the repressor tests because it makes TRP and URA dropouts.  Note the decision to include methionine within the plates but not within the media.  The rationale is that the plates will be used simply to allow for successfully transformed yeast to grow, while the media will be used to test different concentrations of methionine as needed.

Throughout the years, synthetic biology has received more and more attention from the general public. In order to help create even more awareness we participated in organizing the Discovery Festival and taught high-school students about the wonders of synthetic biology. For both events, we encouraged the participants to share their thoughts on the iGEM competition and come up with with new ideas for upcoming competitions. By showing visitors of the festival and school children what can be accomplished within the world of biotechnology we hope we inspired them, sparked their interest and helped them view synthetic biology in another light!
Discovery Festival
A photo of our brainstorm session in Utrecht with the other Dutch teams.
Together with the iGEM teams of the VU University Amsterdam, the University of Amsterdam, the Wageningen University and the University of Groningen, we will attend the Discovery Festival in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven on Friday September 28th.
The Discovery Festival is an annual festival in NEMO Amsterdam and is organized for the first time in Erasmus MC Rotterdam and STRP Eindhoven this year. We expect over 5000 visitors during the night where science meets art. The festival starts at 8 p.m. and ends at 5 a.m. Also, during the day, 300 high school students will also visit STRP Eindhoven.
We will take our visitors on a tour in our provisional laboratory, where they will learn about the process of genetic modification. We want to give people a feel of how synthetic biology is performed, from ordering a perceptible characteristic in the form of a BioBrickTM, to observing this implement feature in bacteria. The visitors participate alone or in a group up to four persons."
Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in the sample. To avoid the leakiness of the promoters we have decided to split the LuxI gene so each part will be regulated under a different promoter (of the same type). This way the probability for leakiness of the two promoters in the same cell and assembly of the two parts of the protein is very low. That way LuxI will be produced only when the cell detects a toxin.
To screen for the positive colony with the positive RNA splint and the functionality of LuxI, the detector strain assay will be done (the same screening method from gate 1)
LuxI-Inspiration
RNA splint: bridges between A protein RNA and B protein RNA. The splint enables the ligation of two RNA molecules. In order for the ligation of the 2 RNA molecules to occur a T4 RNA ligase is needed. T4 RNA Ligase is the enzyme from the phage that makes this ligation between two RNA molecules, it recognizes a specific site (this will be addressed later on). This is the preferable method.
The design using luxI:
CM Resistance
RNA splint is an in-vitro method described for the ligation of 2 RNA molecules. (M.R. Stark, J.A. Pleiss, (2006)
For a simple and robust screen CM split is preferred over the split of luxI
Some background about the components needed for the described system
• Role of T4 Ligase in nature: to repair tRNA damage during the invasion of the bacteriophage (maybe cause of different anti codon usage in the phage) (“Thus, reprocessing could be yet another T4 device to adapt the translation apparatus to post-infection codon usage”) (Amitsur et al., 1987)(C. Kiong Ho, Li Kai Wang 2004)
• Problem: Ribosome will get stuck because of the double strand RNA
Solution: RNA Helicase-exist in E-coli K-12
• The 5’ of the mRNA is phosphorylated - it is important for the ligation
• The terminator should be removed from the first part of the CM resistance, or else it will be translated in the middle of the gene-will be done by Hammerhead  Ribozyme
• Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is the protein for the resistance - There is a His residue in the C-terminus that is important for the mechanism of the enzyme so it is possible to knock the activity out by splitting the sequence
• We used Rnl1 for this ligation (ligates tRNA)(T"

Lycopene is a kind of carotenoid pigment with a bright red color. It can be found in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables. In photosynthesis, Lycopene plays a role in absorbing sunlight (from the wavelength about 460nm to 500nm)12 and transferring the energies to Chlorophyll through electrons. It can also protect Chlorophyll from the damage of sunlight. The structure of Lycopene makes it a potent antioxidant among various common carotenoids. In Ames test, referring to testing whether a given chemical would cause mutations in the DNA, Lycopene shows its great ability to trap singlet oxygen and reduce mutagenesis.13 Numerous studies have also shown that Lycopene has a significant contribution to prevent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and cancers (especially prostate cancer).  We expect that producing Lycopene in cyanobacteria will enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis, therefore, leading to the increase of biofuel. Moreover, Lycopene can provide additional values in human health as we mentioned above.
In order to retain Lycopene in cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. PCC7942, our chassis organism, we used the strategy－“Gene Knock Out”. Through our studies, we found that Lycopene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis pathway of beta-carotenoids in cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. PCC794214 There is an enzyme, called Lycopene cyclase3, converts acyclic hydrocarbon Lycopene into the bicyclic Beta-carotene. Once we can knock out the Lycopene cyclase gene (CrtL), the Lycopene cyclase won’t exist. If the lycopene cyclase doesn’t exist, the Lycopene will remain and not be transformed into other compounds. With the accumulation of Lycopene, meeting the goal of our project is anticipated.
We construct a plasmid to knock out the Lycopene cyclase gene (CrtL). The plasmid contains the “upstream of CrtL” (we call it “Lycopene-US”), the downstream of CrtL(we call it “Lycopene-DS”) and Ampicillin resistant gene(AmpR). First, we used PCC7942 as"

Our controls consisted of plating the cells that contain only the reporter gene, and hence only have chloramphenicol resistance, on both chloramphenicol plates and plates with both antibiotics. As expected (Fig. 3)
Figure 3: Results of the double-transformation using our reporter and repressor genes. Cells that were double-transformed with both reporter and repressor genes produced white colonies when plated on plates containing both chloramphenicol and ampicilin antibiotics (B and C). Competent cells transformed only once with the reporter gene served as the positive control when plated on chloramphenicol plates (A), and as a negative control when plated on chloramphenicol and ampicilin plates (D).

For the larger batch, cell culture      was grown for a longer period of time and purified via      liquid-liquid extraction. Still the quantity of      rhamnolipid was too small to detect. We decided that we      should use supercritical fluid chromatography mass      spectroscopy (SFC-MS) to increase sensitivity for      measuring rhamnolipid quantity.
Freeze Dry
We repeated the freeze dry experiments using different      storage times: immediate and 3 days. In addition to      calculating survival rate, we also calculated the      bacterial survival ratio. The paper we were using as a      model reported an 80% ""survival rate."" In reality, the      survival rate they reported was a different metric called      bacterial survival ratio. This difference in terminology      explained why we thought our experiment was not      working. We had a 2.26% survival rate which corresponds to      an 82.34 bacterial survival ratio, which is the number the      paper reported. Thus, our results are on par with the      paper.
PhaC Knockout
We ran a PCR on the PhaC gene in knockout P. putida from      Spain against PCRed PhaC gene of WT P. putida to confirm      if a transposon was indeed in the PhaC gene. Lengths of      the PhaC gene in both strains were the same, indicating      the transposon was not in the PhaC gene.However, a PCR      product created from transposon-internal primer sequence      provided in the paper existed for the knockout but not WT,      indicating that the transposon was somewhere in the      knockout.We will do a full sequence of 200 bp upstream of      PhaC gene to 200bp downstream PhaC gene in the knockout to      get clearer picture of what is going on.
Mouse and Mosquito Experiments
We began the process of IRB approval and spoke with      Dr. Christiano who suggested we speak with Dr. Owens about      establishing the IRB. We also registered for lab safety      training using mice. We met with a lab member from      Dr. Owen's lab, Rong Du, to discuss the IRB in more detail      and gave her a copy of our experimental protocols. We also      improved our protocol upon discuss with a graduate      student, Lekha Nair, from Dr. Christiano;s lab.

Distributing the postcards on both campuses of Göttingen, we came in direct dialogue with students of, for instance, economics, medicine, mathematics, law, philosophy, and school teaching. We invited them for discussions about genetically modified organisms, challenges, risks, and necessities to use GMOs to solve severe problems of our world. Many of them had an approximate idea of biotechnology, but were indeed surprised, that Synthetic Biology might be such a clean and effective alternative to traditional applications. A great example: Although knowing that cheese can be fermented with microbial rennet enzyme, several vegetarians were not aware of the fact that it can only be produced by GMOs. After all, we see that most educated people have an idea of it, however, we see that there is still a lot of potential to strengthen the awareness of the importance of Synthetic Biology.
We think that this postcard campaign was a big success, because using postcards as a medium, we also reached people with many different educational backgrounds. Furthermore, combining it with engagement work, we reached people directly.
Stop Motion Movie
Based on the motto “Lean back for the next three minutes and enjoy our project description in an easy form”, we created a stop-motion movie, in which our project is explained in an easy to understand and entertaining manner. Our explanation is supported by EriC, our model organism and, meanwhile, also our mascot. We hope that people finally want to learn more about the B12 synporter and Vitamin B12 in general.

GZMB Summer Symposium
The Göttingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB) is a joint initiative of more than 30 research groups of different faculties of our university. It arranges a summer fest every year, which involves a colloquium with talks from scientists from Göttingen, and also guests from other universities, and a social get together with a big barbeque.
The opportunity to be heard by scientists as a student was great for us, and the excitement was big. Moreover, also students from various different biological disciplines were there to listen to our presentation, and asked a lot of questions we answered.

Biological Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM. I've mostly been helping out the undergrad supervisors with their arbitrary needs, so I've been a part of the TALEs, Ferritin and Linker teams. I've loved the opportunity to work in a lab, this is my first year doing so independently. Later in life I hope to become an optometrist, looking into people's eyes is one of my favourite pastimes. When not in the lab though, I am doing other fun activities like reading, hanging out with my friends and soaking up as much vitamin D as I can before winter comes!

I am studying vaccine design and antigen engineering against the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningococcal disease. As an iGEM newcomer, I’m amazed at how everyone functions on so little sleep, but I’m doing my best as I help with the protein expression and purification side of the project. When I’m not running in circles around the lab, I can be found playing volleyball or squash with friends, sliding down a mountain in an attempt at snowboarding, or hanging out at home with a glass of wine binge watching entire TV series with my cats.

I then nanodropped the four purified products (each one was split into two tubes, because there was too much volume to fit into one spin column). The results were very low or negative again. We are trying to figure out why this happened, but aren't sure yet. We ran the four products on a gel, and all showed that there was indeed DNA in the products, so we don't know why the nanodrop isn't giving good values. (See ""Gel 6/30/14"") Professor Medvedik found that the L3 buffer used to dissolve the gel fragments causes issues with the nanodrop, so they have to be washed in a certain way. When we do this, I will type up that protocol.
I autoclaved 3 bottles of LB agar and poured two of them as 50ug/mL chlor plates and the other one as chlor/amp (50ug/mL and 100ug/mL) plates.
I inoculated 50mL each of UV+pACYC184, GFP+pBR322, HSP+pACYC184 colony 1, and HSP+pACYC184 colony 3, so I could do midi preps on all of them tomorrow.

PcelA ( BBa_ K1379002 ) and PcomFA ( BBa_ K1379003 ) construct
Backbone pSB1C3 was used for PcelA and PcomFA construct. PcelA / PcomFA gene was fused with BBa_E0240 , which contains a medium RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), GFP ( BBa_E0040 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ). The purpose of this GFP generator is to indicate the functionality of PcelA and PcomFA in the presence and absence of σx. BBa_E0240 was obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit. The bacterial strain of E. coli used is DH10B.
PCelA / PcomFA gene
Identifying the Possible Promoter Regions
To date (12 Oct 2014), the core/minimal promoter region of PcelA has not yet been experimentally defined. In locating the promoter region required to initiate transcription, iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST team attempted in making educated guesses based on relevant information available from the literature. The Com-Box promoter consensus sequence “TACGAATA” was BLASTed for targets in the Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes of strains R6, D39, ATCC7699 and NCTC7465 in the NCBI database. Genome of strain NCTC7465 was particularly given attention because its gDNA was available for manipulation. A list of loci with annotated genes returned. σx was known to turn on late competence gene and therefore loci containing any of those genes documented were favored and filtered for. Those loci were then manually checked for consensus among the 4 genomes mentioned above. A sequence of 67 base pairs stood out as a promising target because it was 1) upstream of a late competence genes celA (encodes competence protein CelA), and 2) was identical across the 4 genomes. This 67 bp region has varying upstream sequences and the potential promoter region can reach as far as 200bp. Different truncations (67, 100, 150, 180, 249, "

Collaboration with team SHSBNU_China
August 11th, 2018, our team’s modeling group studied the principle and basic techniques with team SHSBNU_China. We met online and communicated with each other on WeChat and voice calls. Both of our teams see this opportunity as meaningful, because we not only learned a lot about modeling and its significance, but we also gained valuable friendship with peers that have the same interest.

Collaboration with team BNU_China (and RDFZ_China)
During the experiment period from the start of July till October, we shared the same laboratory with BNU_China and partly with RDFZ_China. Members from BNU are mostly undergraduates who have more experience and knowledge than us, and they taught and helped us a lot. Thanks to their patience and enthusiasm, we were able to adapt to the days in the lab quickly. After some times, we were able to help them with some basic operations that could save time and resources. VHb is used to improve the growth ability of the engineering bacteria in our project, and when we discussed it in the meeting room near the lab, it turned out that this information could be helpful to their (BNU) project, too. There is much space to improve. We were really glad that our ideas could be able to collide and work out something beneficial for both of our teams. In July, together with BNU_China, we finished our interlab experiment using the microplate reader offered by Peking. After that we discussed our data together, seeking a better way to modify the inaccurate part in our experiment, leading both our teams to a better state.

Discription
I Introduction
As stated in the orthogonality test in experiment part, we failed to find the orthometric gene circuit of two warriors. We could only find an orthometric gene circuit for one warrior. That is, we can put LuxI, RhlR and Prhl inside the warrior II, and let warrior I secrete C4HSL. From the experiment results, we know that warrior II just response to C4HSL secreted by warrior 1, but not 3OC6HSL secreted by himself.
 
Discripton1
However, it is hard to determine which receptor and promoter should be put into warrior I. Since from the experiment results, we can see once the receptor-promoter combination response to 3OC6HSL, it will also response to C4HSL. [Fig. 2]
Discripton2
Therefore, what could we do to construct an orthometric gene circuit?
II Design of orthometric gene circuit
The problem now becomes how to block warrior II's response to C4HSL secreted by himself. An intuitive answer to this question is that we could let C4HSL inside warrior I specifically stimulate the expression of an inhibitor, and then the inhibitor can inhibit the promoter of LacI.
Considering this design principle, we design the gene circuit of warrior I and warrior II as follows. [Fig. 3]
Discripton3
Combining with the experiment data [Fig. 2], we can find C4HSL can specifically bind to RhlR and then the complex bind to Prhl so that"

I am a second year microbiology student and my role in the team is wet lab and inter-lab studies. I wanted to join the iGEM team to gain more experience working both as a team and individually in a lab as that is where I love to be. I love to travel and am competitive by nature so being part of a global science competition allowed me to combine many things that I enjoy. An interesting fact is that I contracted an illness in hospital just after being born so working on C. difficile (a hospital acquired illness) seems very appropriate for me.

In the end, we were happy to welcome four experts: Prof. Dr. Michael Bölker (Biologist and Advisor of the iGEM Team Marburg), Sascha Karberg (Scientific Journalist), Dr. Anna Deplazes-Zemp (Biomedical Ethics) and Dr. Günter Strittmatter (Representative for economy; Leader of the institute for plant breeding of KWS).
The event starts with a warm welcome given by Bianca and a short introduction into the iGEM competition, BioBricks and our project by Anna. This presentation was given in a manner that every citizen could follow. Afterwards Bianca introduced the experts to the audience. The first talk was given by Prof. Dr. Michael Bölker. He was talking about Synthetic Biology presenting the founders like Craig Venter and some applications of Synthetic Biology ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbEbEu-e3Vc ). Sascha Karberg as the second speaker of the evening gave a critical talk about Synthetic Biology. He pointed out the possible risks and also showed some interesting excerpts of articles he was confronted with the topic Synthetic Biology ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqjqZPP9_GU ). The last talk was given by Dr. Anna Deplazes-Zemp. She presented the ethic and moral questions scientists have to ask themselves working with controversial discussed organisms and methods ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDBpW0fy13w ). The audience, as well as we, got a versatile and interesting view into different aspects of Synthetic Biology. After a short break where the audience and experts could refresh themselves with homemade cakes and cookies, fruits and coffee, the panel discussion started. Erik was the leader of the discussion asking Bölker, Karberg, Deplazes-Zemp and Strittmatter questions. The discussion was well coordinated with the results of the survey presented by Niko ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tZbxotJ_c8 ).

Miniprep
Hannah and I miniprepped 2 tubes of K200021 (LacI promoter), which we are going to use as our vector, and one tube of K137113 (RcsA, colanic acid encapsulation gene).
Concentrations from nanodrop:
K200021 A [138.6 ng/uL]
K137113   [207.2 ng/uL]
K200021 B [91.4 ng/uL]
Digest of LacI A and RscA parts above:  Want 1.5ng for 50uL Rxn, for 2 hours at 37C in water bath.
For LacI A vector, I digested with SpeI and PstI. For RscA, I digested with XbaI and PstI. This will make a scar with SpeI and XbaI and the two PstI will create a PstI site. This will keep the four biobrick site intact to clone in the next part.  The vector length should be 3.2kb and the insert length should be 625 bp.
Gel Extraction of the two parts:
Ran 2 cut products (digest product) and 2 uncut products (miniprep product). The gel was run at 75V for 45 min. After a couple of minutes I notice it was going towards the negative electrodes (it was about 2mm past the wells). I had accidentally switched the electrodes in the machine, even though the chamber direction was correct, but it seemed it didn't effect any of the bands.  See gel picture below.

Safety
Before we began working in the labs, we were given a safety induction by the lab manager. The induction covered topics such as the correct use of PPE (wearing lab coats & safety glasses at all times whilst in the lab and also wearing gloves when required), what to do in the event of an emergency (such as a fire), and the correct disposal of waste (what went in each of the different bins).
Whilst working in the labs we were to wash our hands when entering and leaving. When using the equipment, we had to ensure that we were following the correct procedure so that we didn’t damage the machine, as well as to minimise the risk to us and others in the vicinity.
For our project, in all experiments we are using laboratory strains of E. coli and Serratia marcescens, neither of which pose a substantial risk to a healthy individual. S. marcesens is a category 2 organism, so in respect to this all the appropriate health and safety procedures/precautions were followed.
None of our synthetic parts or BioBricks contain toxic genes or elements directly harmful to the environment. Additionally, we maintained containment of all genetically modified organisms and genetic elements to our lab by following all health and safety precautions relevant to the category 2 standard lab we were working in.
In terms of environmental safety, we thought of adding our bacteria to a water bottle that contains a filter. The filter would prevent our bacteria from being ingested by whomever drinks from the bottle, but it would allow our small RNA to pass through (meaning that only the sRNA would be ingested). The bottle would also have to be designed so that our bacteria could not accidentally be released into the environment (a possibility is to add a kill switch into our bacteria so that it would become harmless if released). In practical terms, transport of our bacteria would be carried out in dehydrated containers where the bacteria could be recovered upon addition of water with killswitches should they escape in to the environment. These containers would be easy to handle and dispose of, if and when necessary."

A sterilized plastic loop was used to gather 10-12 large (2-3mm in diameter) colonies from the plate. Inoculated to 150mL of SOB medium in a 1L flask and grown overnight at 18-22°C, 200-250 rpm.
A600 readings were between 0.2-0.8 when harvested. Cells were in mid log phase with A600 ~ 0.5.
The flask was placed on ice for 10 minutes after being removed from incubator.
Culture was transferred to a 50mL centrifuge tube and spun at 2,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Supernatant was discarded and the tube was placed on ice.
Cells were resuspended in 1mL of ice-cold TB buffer, ensuring no clumps of cells remained and kept cold.
Cold TB-buffer was added to bring up volume up to 1/5th of the original culture volume (~30mL) and mixed gently and inverted 3 times.
Tube was incubated on ice for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 2,500 x g for 7 minutes at 4°C and the supernatant was discarded.
Cells were resuspended in ~1/20th of the original culture volume of ice cold TB-buffer.
930µL of cell suspension was added to pre-chilled 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes.
70µL of DMSO was added to the 930µL cell suspension and mixed gently while placed on ice.
100µL of the competent cell/DMSO mixture was added into fresh microcentrifuge tubes, labelled and snapped frozen with liquid nitrogen.
Steps 10-12 was repeated to the remaining for the rest of the suspension from step 9."
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," undergraduate college students knowing prions(405 out of 559 =72.4%) is much higher than that of bachelors(75 out of 396 =18.9%), masters(31 our of 72 =43.1%) or even doctors(23 out of 38 =60.5%). Even the percentage of people with high school or below education knowing prions(41 out of 204 =20.1%) is a little higher than that of bachelors. Maybe you can comment that the number of masters and doctors we research is too small to make the conclusion, but the data for hundreds of bachelors and undergraduate college students can reveal the strange phenomenon.
We find two explanations for this phenomenon. The first one is that the change of education theories and courses in universities and high schools may cause the students nowadays to know more about subjects out of their own majors. Nowadays many colleges in China expect their stuents to learn general knowledge of all kinds of subjects to equip them with basic comprehension of these fields and help them make correct decision when choosing their majors. Even high schools are trying to lead  students to learn more in the subjects they are interested in. However, universities in the past encouraged students to learn more about their majors as they can and become proficient in their fields, thus resulting that students who don't major in biology know little about prions and this can explain why there are less percentage of bachelors(graduate students from univiersities in the past) know prions than undergraduate college students and high school students. Another explanation is deviation in choosing our samples. Since we spread this questoinnaire on the Internet and many of our team members major in biology, their classmates or friends in the same major may be more likely to have connection with them on the Internet and willing to answer these questions about their interest. This may cause the invalid statistics of the group of undergraduate students.
Now let's see the relationship between people's attitude to the application of prions and their knowledge of it.
We can conclude that answerers haven't know about prions are more likely to be worried about the application of them in industry than those who know something about them while yeast prions are impossible to infect human beings. This result can explain why it is important to           popularize general scientific knowledge to the public to avoid misunderstanding.
In question 5, we try to explain that yeast prions are safe enough for application and scientific research, after which we could see the changes of attitudes of the answerers.
After our providing some knowledge about yeast prions, we are glad to see these who haven't known pr"

Characterization of Toehold and Toehold+Trigger for ATOMS_Turkiye
In the search of collaboration with the ATOMS_Turkiye, we have agreed with the Turkish squad for us to characterize two of their parts. We conducted a protein isolation and yielded results.
5 ml cultures containing the Toehold and toehold+trigger parts were incubated at 37 C for 16 hours. 1mM of iPTG was added at the end of the 16. hour. Another 4 hour  incubation was conducted. The proteins in the incubated cultures were then isolated. A flurometric measurement was conducted at 473 nm of emission and 510 nm of excitation values. The difference in between the measurements for the protein isolates of the two parts can be seen below:
For more information on the two parts and the characterization, please visit the following links:

Wiki Coding for the ATOMS_Turkiye Team
Our team coder and our mate Alihan Celikcan helped the ATOMS_Turkiye form their team wiki template. Together with Muhammed Fatih Aktas of the ATOMS Team, they prepared the initial draft of the wiki and the main functional features developed in the wiki.
SynBioDay
For a meeting of all the teams of Turkey, hopefully participating in this year’s jamboree, a Synthetic Biology Day was conducted. Our team, with also the teams ATOMS Turkiye, METU Ankara and METU HS gathered in the campus of Turgut Ozal University to present their projects, discuss ideas and establish roots for future collaborations. Many other people also participitated in the event to make an exiting day of SynBio for everyone!"

Overview
Background
Two years ago the Michigan Software 2014 team began development                of ProtoCat 1.0. Like many innovative ideas, ProtoCat began because of a problem. Studies have estimated                that only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible.  A 2014 survey conducted                by the Michigan Software team confirmed that the repeatability problem exists in synthetic                biology, with every scientist surveyed reporting prior struggles with replicating protocols.                The majority of these scientists indicated unclear language and missing steps are the greatest                contributors to the irreproducibility of synthetic biology protocols. A second study conducted by the 2015 Michigan Software team only further confirmed the sentiments of the first study. These issues are what ProtoCat has been designed to solve.
Solution
Every respondent of the second survey indicated that they                would use a database to browse and download protocols, with over 85% indicating that                they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed. ProtoCat 4.0                is a free database of crowd sourced protocols designed to make existing protocols more                repeatable and enable more accurate computational models of biological systems. We believe                this can most efficiently be accomplished with a commitment to open source protocols and a                broader more active community of digital troubleshooters. ProtoCat 4.0 works to establish                such a community by giving anyone with an internet connection or smartphone access to a                repository of synthetic biology protocols collected from all over the world. Additionally,                ProtoCat 4.0 encourages the development of higher quality, more repeatable protocols by                allowing users to document, rate, review, and edit existing methods.
ProtoCat 4.0
ProtoCat 4.0 is optimized for collaboration among users and offers the best user experience we have developed. Features like Protometrics, visual protocol history and protocol favoring each help achieve the best version of a protocol. ProtoCat 4.0 now provides quantitative metrics and a visual representation of branch history in order to provide researchers with feedback and allow users to easily locate versions of protocols. Users can also favorite protocols they like to identify the best ones and quickly relocate them.
The user experience is another aspect that has been improved in ProtoCat 4.0. We've added features such as threaded comments, notifications, group accounts and a new chat system called ProtoChat in this year’s version of ProtoCat."
Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html," trois équipes venant d’Allemagne. Le projet de l’équipe d’Heidelberg est dirigé par le professeur Roland Eils de l’université d’Heidelberg et du centre allemand de recherche sur le cancer (DKFZ).
La biologie synthétique est un nouveau domaine scientifique qui associe les technologies génétiques classiques avec une approche d’ingénierie. Comme pour la construction d’un avion, la biologie synthétique assemble des blocs simples composés de gènes aux fonctions élémentaires pour former des systèmes complexes ayant de nouvelles fonctions. Ces blocs de constructions sont rassemblés par iGEM dans une base de données et peuvent être utilisés par tous les participants a la compétition. La base de données possède à l’heure actuelle plus de 1000 blocs de construction géniques accumulées grâce au développement continu de nouveaux blocs au cours des dernières années. Cet été, les équipes ont travaillé sur des projets élaborés par elles-mêmes qu’elles présenteront début novembre au cours d’un rassemblement de toutes les équipes a Boston. Plusieurs prix seront distribués dans différentes catégories.
L’équipe d’Heidelberg est composée de 15 étudiants de l’université d’Heidelberg et un étudiant de l’université technique de Darmstadt. Ces étudiants ont suivi différents parcours scientifiques, biotechnologie moléculaire, biologie ou mathématiques. Ils sont encadrés par des membres du groupe de Victor Sourjik (ZMBH ; Universite d’Heidelberg) et du département de Roland Eils (Université d’Heidelberg et DKFZ). Le travail est effectué dans un nouveau centre : le Bioquant, centre d’analyse quantitative de systèmes biologiques moléculaires et cellulaires.
L’équipe d’Heidelberg développe une machine biologique capable de détecter et tuer de façon spécifique des pathogènes voire des cellules cancéreuses. Comme preuve de concept, l’équipe conçoit génétiquement une lignée de E. coli sous forme de prédateur et une sous forme de proie.

Two versions of the synthetic promoter were implemented, one with direct-repeat targets and one with inverted [1] . The idea is that in the presence of acetaldehyde, AlcR will bind to the operon and block the binding of the RNA polymerase. This only works if the mechanism of AlcR transcriptional activation is based on acetaldehyde induced DNA binding and does not just involve conformational changes. When implementing the SmoColi genetic network, an additional inverter (TetR) is added in front of the bandpass, so that the acetaldehyde signal is passed into the bandpass in a positive way. Thus the AlcR promoter (PAlc) is cloned in front of the TetR repressor to introduce the bandpass.
Figure 3: Circuit operations for SmoColi with acetaldehyde sensor, AlcR works as an repressor, therefore a inverter (TetR) is introduced to convert the repression of the input to an activation.
Acetaldehyde is reduced by the native E. coli enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, generating a concentration gradient in our tube. At the position with the required concentration of acetaldehyde for the bandpass-filter, GFP is expressed, at all other positions it is repressed, resulting in a single GFP band. By tuning the input of acetaldehyde in the tube, we get the GFP band at different positions. Thus, with constantly increasing acetaldehyde concentration, we get a moving band from one side to the other side of the channel. Finally,if the acetaldehyde concentration exceeds a certain threshold, the whole channel turns red, due to the quorum-sensing based RFP expression.
Xylene Sensor
Where it comes from...
The xylR gene in Pseudomonas putida encodes a 566 aa regulatory protein that activates the degradation of toluene and xylene. In P. putida the complete upper Tol pathway is under the control of the toluene-responsive promoter PU. In the presence of xylene, XylR hexamerically binds to PU promoter and activates it [5] . This activates expression of the  xylene degradation cassette xylC-xylM-xylA-xylB-xylN, where xylC encodes for the benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, xylM and xylA for subunits of the xylene oxygenase"
Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," functional production of a protein if translated fully (resulting in excess amino acids in the polypeptide), the incorporated ribozyme portions remove them before the translation phase of gene expression so that a functional protein is produced. For example, Cry proteins, which account for the insecticidal activity (toxicity) of Bacillus thuringiensis, could be the fusion protein produced for a particular insecticide. Using our experimental design, the sequence containing the code for the Cry protein (at the DNA stage) is split by ribozyme segments containing a recombination site. In this case, the recombination site is the regulatory sequence that will be removed once transcribed into RNA. At the DNA level, recombination (shuffling) will occur, exchanging DNA strand segments. Therefore, when the shuffled DNA sequence is transcribed into RNA, the recombination site is spliced out of the sequence with the ribozymes, and the resulting RNA code is different than that of the un-shuffled code. Consequently, the translated Cry protein is different. This system would oppose pesticide resistance among the target organism.
1.1 A Little Bit About Group 1 Introns
All group I introns in bacteria have presently been shown to self-splice (with few exceptions) and maintain a conserved secondary structure comprised of a paired element which uses a guanosine (GMP, GDP or GTP) cofactor. Conversely, only a small portion of group II introns have been verified as ribozymes (they are not related to group I introns) and generally have too many regulators to easily work with. It is mainly the structural similarity of these introns that designates them to group II. We will mainly be working with group I introns, such as the Staphylococcus phage twort.ORF143.
Group I introns contain a conserved core region consisting of two helical domains (P4–P6 and P3–P7). Recent studies have demonstrated that the elements required for catalysis are mostly in the P3 to P7 domain. They are ribozymes that consecutively catalyze two trans-esterification reactions that remove themselves from the precursor RNA and ligate the flanking exons. They consist of a universally conserved core region and subgroup-specific peripheral regions, which are not essential for catalysis but are known to cause a reduction in catalytic efficiency if removed. To compensate for this, a high concentration of magnesium ions, spermidine or other chemicals that stabilize RNA structures can be added. Thus, the peripheral regions likely stabilize the structure of the cons"

Approach
Introduction
E. coli does not have a naturally occuring integron system so it lacks an AttI site and also does not express the integron Integrase. For our system to work we need to introduce these components into our cell which will then allow cassettes to be integrated.
AttI Site
The choice for an AttI site in our project came from what was available and often used in the lab. The AttI site used was on a plasmid with Streptomycin resistance (referrenced as pUS44) which fit well with the rest of our experimental set up.
Controllable Integrase expression
The design of the controllable integron integrase was based of the Paris-Bettencourt 2010 araC-pBAD Integrase BioBrick. We started with araC-pBAD in pSB1C3 which had been previously prepared by an Honours student in the lab, Sam Ross, from araC-pBAD provided in the iGEM kit. The integrase gene was was ordered as a gBlock with the sequence for that coming from pUS2056. The Integrase gene is highly conserved though so this choice was mainly out of convenience. The gBlock was inserted into the SamR construct to give us a controllable Integrase system in a proper format for submission. This plasmid is referenced to as pUS203 throughout the wiki.
Low-Copy Backbone
While the integrase was in a controllable system it is believed that a high concentration of integrase is toxic to the bacterial cell. As such we also needed a low-copy chassis into which we could insert the controllable Integrase system created previously. We decided that it would be best to improve on the pSB6A1 low-copy plasmid provided by iGEM by adding in the BioBrick prefix/suffix and terminators from pSB1C3. This low copy plasmid is referenced to as pUS201 throughout the wiki. This part would then have been inserted with the controllable Integrase system from pUS203 and would have allowed us to carry out experiments for the activity of the modified Integrase gene.
Gene Cassette
The final component needed was a gene cassette. The template for the cassette was a gBlock"

Figure 2: Base editing reactions
After having listed out our reactions, we then defined our differential equations using mass action-kinetics:
Figure 3: Base editing differential equations
How do we find appropriate kinetic parameters?
One of the key challenges to any rule-based, biological model is finding a functional set of kinetic parameters. Often it is difficult or impossible to directly measure the rate constants for every single step, and so these values are instead obtained by fitting the model to experimental output.
Still, we began our search by pouring through the literature for previous kinetic estimates. The full table of values is shown below:
Figure 4: Literature values for each kinetic constant
One of the biggest issues that we noticed with these estimations was that they were made for normal cas9 and not our specific base editor. Additionally, many experiments were conducted outside of bacteria, instead using only the isolated molecules of interest. We suspected that consequently many of these estimates were too fast, which was supported by  initial model runs producing much higher base editing rates than experimental data had suggested.
Previously, teams have used regression and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods to converge on their parameters of interest. However, these techniques fail to fully take into account process and measurement noise, resulting in issues when trying to fit sparse and error-prone biological data [Lillaci, X. Liu]. Markov chain monte carlo (MCMC)  methods fair better, but still are limited computationally, as they must generate a full numerical ODE simulation for each step they make through their parameter-space.
By using recursive bayesian filters, we were able to quickly update our estimates with each new measurement, despite using relatively few and noisy data points. This technique provides other notable benefits as well. In particular, the filter allows for A) the fusion of multiple measurement types B) testing for assumptions about the model itself.
Recursive Bayesian Filters
Recursive Bayesian filters (also known as Sequential Bayesian filters when applied to time series data), have been heavily studied for applications in robotics and control systems. More recently, researchers such as Lilacci and Khammash have transferred the techniques to the biological domain [Lilacci et al].
Both versions (Extendend Kalman and Particle Filters) of the recursive bayesian estimator work by treating the biological system as a hidden markov model, in which the next state of the system (in this case a vector of all element concentrations) is only dependent on the previous state. It is assumed that an outside observer cannot measure these states directly,"

Riley Broth Testing In order to test the capability of RB to sustain bacterial growth, we performed a simple overnight culture using an inoculant of DH5α cells. This strain was selected based on our usage of it as a chassis for recombinant gene expression. Five conditions were then established to test RB’s ability to sustain E. coli growth. A total volume of 5 mL was used for each condition. Luria broth was inoculated with 10 microliters of DH5α culture to ensure viability of the cells, as well as to provide a reference for normal overnight growth, as is shown on the rightmost side of the image (Figure 8.) To ensure the sterility of the medium and to observe any possible change in optical density of RB over time, one condition was composed of RB with no inoculant. Next, three experimental groups were established, which contained increasing amounts of RB. These groups contained RB diluted in water ¼, ½, and undiluted (Figure 8, central three cultures moving from left to right). Each of these experimental groups were inoculated in the same manner and grown at 37 °C overnight before measuring each sample’s OD600 (600 nm). The optical density at 600 nm was used to estimate the total amount of cells present in each culture following overnight growth based on a standard curve.  Measurements of optical density were taken after normalizing the spectrophotometer with a “blank” sample, which contained only fresh media.

Data Collection
Discussion
Our experimental results demonstrated that showed that RB media can facilitate the proliferation of E. coli cells at a rate that is comparable to LB. The cell count measurement collected in undiluted RB (4.40 x109 cells/mL) grown overnight is quite close to that of undiluted LB (4.40 x 109 cells/mL) grown under the same conditions. Although this was only performed as a single replicate, the dose-dependent increase in cell count observed upon adding RB from the ¼ dilution (4.5 x 108 cells/mL) to the undiluted RB culture demonstrated that the growth of E.coli in the RB cultures was in fact dependent on the contents of the RB medium. Further replicates of these growth experiments, as well as an increase in the number of time points analyzed, will allow us to more rigorously compare the growth potential of our RB medium.
We can conclude from this experiment that a suitable substitute for LB media can be prepared through the use of canis"
Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," activity of TORC1.
From the figure above, we found that the amount of mTORC1 is greatly increased after FAP are added in. In previous situation without FAP, the steady amount of mTORC1 is about 0.2872, however, when FAP are added in, after a period of oscillation, the amount of mTORC1 is about 7.9 .
When FAP are added in, the total amount of proteins that have the same function with initial TORC1 can be 0.39+7.9=8.29, of which 95% comes from mTORC1. This substantially proves our gene circuit is able to work in the environment with inhibitors.
From the amount of pCIT2*, we can also draw the same conclusion with that on mTORC1. An interesting thing is that an obvious oscillation appears in the early period.
Taking another look at our ""four level structure"" mentioned before, we consider this kind of topology as a feedback loop with two nodes, which can account for all the phenomena.
As we know, topology with two nodes wouldn’t give rise to long last oscillation, but a final steady state after a period of fluctuation. In our project, after 2500 seconds' fluctuation, this circuit leads to a steady state.
To evaluate the characteristic of our mutant Tor2 precisely and comprehensively, I conduct further analysis towards mutant Tor2's sensitivity to FAP. In the simplified model I just show above, the sensitivity of Tor2 to FAP has been greatly decreased from
to
. Then questions are raised: what if only three of our four mutant base work? What's the situation if mTor2 with a larger or smaller sensitivity to FAP? Then I try 10 constants of
to see the tendency.
Then we get the following figure from book above:
From the figure above, we discover that When
, the amount of mTor2 in cell reach a maximum. In this situation, the sensitivity is deceased only to a certain degree. Then question is raised again: why don't we just choose the mutant Tor2 with
?
We discover that as the constant of
decreased, the response time decreased, which means that the time for system to reach a steady state. Although system with
=10 has a maximum of amount of mutant Tor2, but the response time is longer. The reason for this fact is that mutant Tor2 with a smaller

The therapeutic plasmid
The therapeutic plasmid function is to express the therapeutic gene wich responds to the targeted pathophysiology.
It must have two essential characteristics: To  be encapsidated into the cell vector , the lambda phage, and have the ability of reach the nucleus of the target cell.
You will be able to discover in this chapter, what were the strategies implemented to address these issues.

The Encapsidation within the cell vector [1,2,3,4,5,6]
During the assembly process of lambda phage, the encapsidation of the genome within the capsid is ensured by the ends of specific sequences called Cos sequences . These sequences are placed on the therapeutic plasmid. And to ensure that it is the only encapsidation in the cell vector , these sequences were excised from the phage genome. Thus, if the cell vector infects a bacterium of the organism, it will not lead to its destruction and will not cause any infection. The cell vector , incorporating only the therapeutic plasmid is not replicative and therefore does not possess any pathogenicity  to the commensal bacterial population.
The sequences Cos are composed of three specific sites: CosN, CosB and CosQ.
CosN corresponds to the cleavage site of the terminase (a produced enzyme during the lytic phase) on the DNA concatamer, which will generate the cohesive ends of mature DNA ( Cos sequences ) and initiate encapsidation of the genome (CosB being the binding site of the terminase). CosQ is however necessary as an arrest sequence of encapsidation, it acts in line with the sites CosN and I2 (a sequence located between CosN and CosB).
It has also been demonstrated that the initiation of the cut at Cos"

We selected a big reading list so that course could be taught on the undergraduate and graduate level. By no means is this list complete and it will likely have to be updated on a yearly basis.

Brixells modeling (University of Warwick)
iGEM Matchmaker and LabSurfing (Technische Universität Darmstadt)
I. Brixells modeling (University of Warwick)
Team Warwick has shown interest in our offer to help in modeling and quantitative analysis that we have posted on the iGEM Matchmaker . Team Warwick is aiming to provide precision control over spatial arrangement of cells by designing a tool that enables drawing and building with them.
Zinc finger proteins are intracellular molecules which recognize and bind unique dsDNA sequences. We have engineered these proteins to be expressed on the surface of an E. coli cell, such that dsDNA can be used as mortar to cement cells together. Team Warwick plans to demonstrate this principle by assembling fluorescent cells onto a 2D surface and producing microscopic images, with the ultimate goal being to build complex 3D structures comprised of different cell types. This level of control over cellular localisation is useful in multiple fields including research into cell-cell interactions in microbial communities, multicellularity, and the construction of 3D cell structures in tissue engineering.
The collaboration focused on two elements:
Calculating the probability of formation, including the probability of E. Coli bonding correctly.
Calculating the effect of arm length on structure changes increases. This has been motivated by the observation that the longer the arms the higher the likelihood  that the e.coli cells can attach because they are less closely packed and such wouldn't get in each others way.
There are many methods to look at this kind of problems, but the most realistic may require huge computational resources. So it is necessary to find an approach that is experimentally relevant, computationally tractable, and reflecting the biophysics underlying Brixells.
We, Team NTNU Trondheim have offered ideas, modeling frameworks, software simulation, and data analysis to answer these questions, based on information theory and thermodynamics. For Problem 1, we have suggested an approach in terms of binding affinity and specificity where the information entropy is used as a measure of specificity. For Problem 2, we have suggested a thermodynamics approach using the Poisson-Boltzmann theory where the zinc fingers and E. Coli are approximated by"

2. Addition of agar and plating
i)Top agar was warmed/liquefied by microwaving.
Microwaving doesn’t see to work so well, a better alternative would be to use a warm water bath.
ii) 5mL of liquid top agar was added to test tube; mixed well with phage + bacteria solution
iii)5mL of the mixed solution was transferred to the LB plate. The top agar was spread to from a uniform layer.
iv)The same process were repeated the test tube 0-6.
3. Check up on phage + bacteria viability in 24-48 hours
Amber - T2 Arick - T5 Darren - T3
V) Results
We ran into several problems while doing the titer. After we had completed the titer, we found out that the pipet tips we had used were contaminated. When preparing the top agar, we had to melt it in the microwave which caused it to boil over. This could have caused some contamination. While filling my -5 plate with top agar, there was only enough to put in 4mL of agar instead of the 5mL that was called for in our procedure.
None of the plates had any phage. There was just a lawn of bacteria growing. This could either be because of the problems mentioned above or because the source of phage were bad. Seeing as nobody was able to grow any phage we believe that the source was old.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," existing design should work and suggested looking into the design of his B-series of Zika virus toehold switches to improve our existing switches. We did so, and modified our design to base them on these switches which have reduced system leakage. They have shorter loops and no-refolding domain which helped increase sensitivity. Based on his feedback, we also increased the loop size for the 15b-5p switch design. This compensates for its long stem (which reduces on state activity), increasing dynamic range. With his help, our switches were optimized for their application as a diagnostic tool. Read more about our first series switches on our design page .

iGEM EPFL
After speaking to several experts who highlighted the importance of reducing false positives and false negatives (see applications section below), we began to explore ways to improve the design of our toehold switches. We spoke to iGEM EPFL - another team working with toehold switches. We explained the issues we had with homologous miRNAs that reduce the specificity of our sensors. iGEM EPFL suggested that we design our switches to utilize the mechanism employed in “Ribocomputing devices for sophisticated in vivo logic computation”. [1]
Based on this advice we designed a second series of toehold switches that can distinguish between miRNA sequences with one nucleotide differences. This improved our design , effectively reducing false positives, a crucial part of any diagnostic method.
With reduced cross-hybridisation, we could create an effective multiplexing assay: multiple switches that each regulate the production of a different reporter protein with a distinct emission peak. This would drastically increase the efficiency and scope of the test. As the second generation of switches can detect single base mismatch differences the sensitivity and specificity of the entire system would be improved.
Professor David Rubinsztein
Professor David Rubinsztein, Professor of Molecular Neurogenetics at Cambridge University, suggested that we use luciferase instead of GFP as our reporter protein. He explained that it may be able to provide more sensitive readings. We produced 4 composite parts as a result - with 2 being toehold switches containing luciferase. However, the constructs with luciferase were so long that, in combination with our inducible promoter, we were unable to insert them into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone in one ligation step. Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were"

vioD
In circuit B ( BBa_K539461 ), is initiated by Plac promoter ( BBa_R0010 ) but the expression is restricted by 37℃ RBS ( BBa_K115002 ) , which means the ribosome will bind to the ribosome binding site only if the temperature reaches 37 ℃ or higher, and the

Circuit C

The circuit C is regulated by heat-sensitive cI Quad-Part Inverter (QPI) with strong promoter ( BBa_K098995 ). That is why
vioC
( BBa_K539513 ) is translated when over 42 ℃ condition, meanwhile LacI ( BBa_C0012 ) and TetR ( BBa_C0040 )  will also repress the expression of the other 2 circuits above. This way, E.coli will focus on producing VioC instead of wasting resources on non-intended products, and we can even control the pathway as we wish.
Next, we will describe how our mechanism works:
First, in order to accumulate enough precursor of PVA , we set the temperature at 30℃(Figure 5).
Figure 5. By translating
vioA, vioB and vioE
at 30℃ we could obtain PVA as the end product.
Second, we direct the pathway towards the production of Deoxychromoviridans, by simply raising the temperature to 42℃. At this moment, the constitutively produced CI inhibitor ( BBa_K098995 ) will be degraded, therefore circuit C will be initiated and produce VioC, which catalyzes PVA into deoxyviolacein that shows dark purple. At the same time, LacI ( BBa_C0012 )and tetR ( BBa_C0040 ) will also show up and inhibit the production of circuit A and circuit B as"

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Notebook#Microbiology_-_-_TEXT.html," concern was carbon contamination from the soil sample.
To avoid this contamination they inoculated the samples in a SCS (single carbon source) liquid medium. They let it grow seven days at 22°C then use the broth to inoculate a new SCS liquid medium.
This step is repeated two more times. Then the culture broth is plated on SCS plate and the degrading bacteria is isolated.  In these conditions the carbon from the soil is consumed during the first cultivation steps and the bacteria that cannot use antibiotics as a carbon source do not survive during the next cultivation step.
However, this protocol seems to have some issues.
It take 21 days before plating to isolate the microorganisms, this is very long.
Microorganisms that can degrade quercitin without using it as a single carbon source won't be selected.
As we found in several papers, the regular technique to isolate microorganisms from the soil is to dilute the sample on PBS and directly plate on agar. A dilution of 10^(-1) correspond to a dilution of 1g of soil in 9 mL of PBS.
Filtration of the soil sample
A member from the protein group told us that he used a different protocol to isolate a toluene degrading bacteria. In fact, yo remove the carbon contamination from the soil he filtered the sample with a 0.22µL filter. Then he cultivated the filter in a liquid medium before plating. We decided to test this protocol.
We filtrate a solution of soil sample under vacuum.
Then we place the filter (with the microbes stuck in it without carbons sources) in an erlenmeyer with some M9 + Quercetin. And we waited for a few days.
We had the same results as the protocole with soil sample diluted at 10^-3.
And as you can see in the picture, the green color is disappearing and some fungi is growing in the media.
Screening assay design
In church lab's article, they cultivate the bacteria at 22°C and pH 5.5 . We found that pH 5.5 inhibit most bacterial growth so we decided to stay at a neutral pH.
We did not have an incubator that could be set at a temperature of 22°C, after a discussion with our advisors and a microbiologist from Cochin hospital it was decided that 30°C should be sufficient for our experiement. Some bacterial species would not survive at 30°C but a sufficient number would, and they may grow faster at 30°C than at 22°C.
We decided to chose 5"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-N_-_-_TEXT.html," it offers a seamless, single-reaction assembly of DNA fragments (Celinska et al., 2017), similar to GA.
After further research, however, we discovered multiple issues with this assembly technique: our team members and mentors have no prior experience with GGA, the process takes up to six hours, and we would need to insert unique type II restriction sites between our gene blocks, which adds another step to our project (New England BioLabs, n.d.). For these reasons, we ruled out GGA as our cloning method and returned to GA. GA requires that DNA fragments have homologous ends (either naturally or artificially) for assembly to occur. These ends are called Gibson overhangs (GOs). To create homology where it does not occur naturally, we will use primers with GO flags on either end that match the overhangs and homology regions on corresponding fragments. GA shortens the construction process because it does not require the use of restriction sites, can be performed in under an hour, and seamlessly integrates fragments.
Dr. William Belden informed us of his extensive experience with another assembly method: yeast-mediated cloning (YMC). At the beginning of our research, we considered this to be an innovative cloning technique, but we abandoned it due to our lack of experience. Dr. Belden explained that YMC works similarly to GA, but the process occurs naturally within yeast. Similar to GA, YMC requires homologous overlaps between fragments. Because GA and YMC involve similar designs, we reasoned that we could perform both experiments simultaneously without sacrificing much time or effort. Running both experiments in parallel will allow us to experiment with YMC while keeping GA as a contingency plan. We consulted Dr. Kamakaka on our parallel experiment idea, and he offered his support by providing protocols for YMC.
YEAST TRANSFORMATION
We want to integrate our gene cassette into the Y. lipolytica genome so that our construct will be passed on to offspring with each round of replication (Summers, 1991). We investigated a paper on using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to insert pathway genes into Y. lipolytica (Wong et al., 2017) and considered using this system to incorporate our progesterone precursor genes into the yeast genome. In this paper, researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 to integrate a set of two genes into the Y. lipolytica genome, but they used a gene cassette much smaller than ours will be (Wong et al., 2017).

InterLab
The aim of the iGEM InterLab study is to work towards a more reliable and repeatable measurement system to make synthetic biology an engineering biology. All participating laboratories first calibrated their instruments by obtaining standard curves using sodium fluorescein which was provided in our kits. This allowed us to fix settings such as top/bottom optic, gain and type of plate used so that all conditions were the same for our GFP and CFU protocols.
Table 1 shows data for the OD600 reference point.
Table 2 shows data for the particle standard curve (standard curve below).
Table 3 shows data for fluorescein standard curve (standard curve below).
(Blue cells were raw data measurements, gold cells were calculated) After the machine was calibrated fluorescence and absorbance of GFP in 8 different devices was measured using the standardised method provided by iGEM. The results gathered were suggestive of which device had the highest strength of gene expression. The data collection sheet provided converted our raw plate reader measurements into arbitrary fluorescein and abs600 values as well as calculating the µM fluorescein per OD as shown in the following tables.
Tables 4 and 5 show calculated values of µM fluorescein per OD at 0 hour and 6 hour time points. This was calculated from OD measurements we took before beginning the assay.
Tables 6 and 7 show calculated arbitrary values of net fluorescein at 0 hour and 6 hour time points.
Tables 8 and 9 show net values of absorbance of light (600nm) at 0 hour and 6 hour time points.
What did we gain from our InterLab experience?  The InterLab study has allowed us to contribute to making synthetic biology more accurate through providing a series of standardised procedures of calibration and measurement tests"

Link to raw data.
More LB medium was made. E.coli DH5aplha with pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS was induced with arabinose and proteins were extracted. The protein extraction was run on a gel, but the negative controls were forgotten. Therefore, no conclusions could be made. The Cry3Aa protein was concentrated with the help of an amplicon. However, the concentration increases are doubtful. Leaking experiments with this protein sample did not give better results than obtained earlier. pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS was sent for sequencing with the primers:

E. coli DH5aplha with pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS was induced with arabinose. The cell pellet was dissolved in Bper. Leaking experiments with this supernatant did not give any positive results. SDS-PAGE was performed. Together with Linea, for E. coli DH5aplha with pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS and E. coli BL 21 pSB1A3_mutant_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS, the protocol for expression of Cry3Aa-HIS by E.coli BL21 pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS and the protocol for carboxyfluorescein leakage measurement with Cry3Aa obtained from E. coli were followed. On top of that, the pellets were also added to the measurement. SDS PAGE with some protein extract was performed, sadly enough some lanes were forgotten. The pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS was successfully transformed to E.coli BL21. Three more plates with different Cry proteins were measured following the protocols mentioned above. One failed because the quality of the vesicles dropped after thawing multiple times. More solution buffer was made.

We are curious about the effects of different promoters on the expression of toxin proteins and we further explore and created a new BioBrick Part BBa_K2570021 , which has a functional improvement upon BBa_K2120002 . At the same time, our team have added new, high quality experimental characterization data to the wildtype promoter sequence of the E.coli proU operon from 17 CMUQ which functions as an osmolarity sensor ( BBa_K2467001 ), obtained and uploaded the detailed data according to the requirements.
Construction of the mazF expression system combined with proU promoter
      Firstly, we explored the effect of toxin protein expression under the control of the salt-controlled promoter. We set different salt concentrations as experimental variables, and the green fluorescent protein was used as the reporter.       Part: BBa_K2570020 proU+B0034+GFP+B0032+mazF
Fig 1. (A) A schematic diagram of a salt-controlled promoter expressing the toxin protein (mazF) circuit. (B) Fluorescence levels per OD at different salt concentrations. (C) Fluorescence images at different salt concentrations.
      We set the salt concentration 0mm, 50mm, 100mm, 300mm, 500mm (NaCl). In Fig. 1, at the same OD value, the measured GFP fluorescence value increased with increasing salt concentration. In addition, green fluorescence at different salt concentrations can be visually observed, and it is concluded that an increase in salt concentration before 300mM NaCl enhances the expression of a salt-controlled promoter, an increase in the expression of green fluorescent protein, and an increase in GFP fluorescence value. At a salt concentration of 300 mM NaCl to 500 mM NaCl, the fluorescence intensity at the unit OD value is weakened. We speculate that higher salt concentrations have an adverse effect on cell growth and salt-controlled promoter expression. In the experiment, the ideas of quantification and correction of Interlab guided our data analysis.
Construction of the mazF expression system combined with dsrA promoter
      Secondly,we explored the effect of toxin protein expression under the control of a temperature promoter. We set different temperature as experimental variables, and we added green fluorescent protein for characterization.       Part: BBa_K2570021 dsrA+B0034+GFP+B0032+mazF

Our basic Human Practices include the questionnaire, interview and policy survey. We expanded our Human Practices to many other aspects, during which we heard the voice from professors, veteran experts, entrepreneur managers as well as other teams. They represented some different views from the public and authorities, helping us to understand the project from different perspectives so that we could collect the feedback to interpret those results into our experimental design. Secondly, we set up our iGEM club to provide a platform for students to exchange academic knowledge.
Lastly, to improve public engagement of iGEM in China, we designed our own Chinese version brochures and postcards and distributed them to people who were interested in our project, and we received lots of valuable comments.
We conducted a game called “FRET ME”, which was an outdoor group game based on the theoretical support FRET of our project. Apart from that, we have compiled the Chinese version iGEM brochure to let more Chinese people know about synthetic biology and iGEM. We distributed our postcards and badges as souvenirs to members from other teams. As for education, we gave some lectures about the iGEM and synthetic biology inside our school, mainly for the freshmen and sophomores. Also, we help the SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai to build their own iGEM LAB, giving them rough ideas about their experimental design and guided them finish the interLab experiments.
iGEM club
This year, ECUST took part in the iGEM competition for the first time, and there are still many students in our campus who have passion for synthetic biology but have no platform or guidance to participate in such contests. Therefore, to set up an iGEM club in ECUST is of vital significance and necessity and this is exactly where we started.
FRET ME
As the main principle of our project, FRET is an interesting and useful theory. But it may be a bit obscure for undergraduates, especially those who don’t major in biology. Considering that spreading scientific knowledge to non-scientific people is another aim of iGEM, we came up with an innovation activity called FRET ME, aiming at making the concept of FRET easier to understand.
