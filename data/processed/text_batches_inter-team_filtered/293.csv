    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:
        dn/dt=k*(N-n)*fex(t)
        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))
    So the lipid-time function, Slp(t), were found:

Introduction
FBA Analysis
The Idea
Pheromones production rates can be estimated using constrained-based modeling of metabolic networks.This can be useful to know the amount of pheromone that can be produced by the synthetic plant.
Constraint-based modeling
Constraint-based modeling use models of the cell metabolism that are derived from a metabolic network (stoichiometric models) and assume steady-state for the intracellular metabolites. These two constraints are the base of constraint-  based modeling:  the fact that cells are subject to constraints that limit their behaviour [1]. In principle, if all constraints operating under a given set of circumstances were known, the actual state of a metabolic network could be elucidated. So by imposing the known constraints, it is possible to determine which functional states can and cannot be achieved by a cell.
Types of contraints
Constraints can be divided in two main types: non adjustable (invariant) and adjustable ones. The former are time-invariant restrictions of possible cell behaviour, whereas the latter depend on environmental conditions, may change through evolution, and may vary from one individual cell to another. Examples of non adjustable constraints are those imposed by thermodynamics (e.g, irreversibility of fluxes) and enzyme or transport capacities (e.g, maximum flux values). Enzyme kinetics, regulation, and experimental measurements are examples of adjustable constraints. To study the invariant properties of a network, only invariant constraints can be used, because they are those that are always satisfied (i.e, they limit the cell capabilities). If adjustable constraints are used, the elucidated cell states will be only valid under the particular set of circumstances in which these constraints operate [2].
Flux Balance Analysis
Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a methodology that uses optimisation to get predictions from a constraint-based model by invoking an assumption of optimal cell behaviour. Basically,"

TU-Eindhoven,2013,Team:TU-Eindhoven#AnearobicTesting_-_-_TEXT.html," bands which were still to be found on the membrane. The stained membrane can be seen below in .
WesternBlot The same loading system was used for the Western Blot as was used to show the purified samples from the repeat experiments.
When looking at it is clear that the bands of low intensity at approximately 29kDa do indeed correlate with the EGFP protein. The higher and thick intensity bands have completely disappeared, meaning they were not bound by the EGFP specific antibodies. What is of concern is that there is an EGFP band visible in the negative control. This sample was taken from an aerobic expression, and therefore no EGFP was expected.
Fluorescence Measurements
From the purified protein solutions, samples were taken for fluorescence analysis. EGFP emission spectra were desired to have an increased intensity when the samples were taken at later points in time. From this we would be able to conclude that more EGFP was being expressed as the bacteria spent more time in anaerobic conditions. The samples from MG1655 did show the right emission spectra, but there was no increase in intensity between the samples. That the signal was merely caused by scattering was excluded since a shift in excitation wavelength did not result in a shift in emission spectrum. The samples of the XL1-Blue expression, however, did show an increase in intensity. The results are shown in . Here scattering was also excluded. The fluorescence intensities of the peaks at λ = 508 nm are shown in . A comment on these measurements is that the gain was relatively high (187), which is a result of the low concentrations of EGFP formed.
Fluorescencemeasurements Emission spectra of EGFP from the XL1-Blue anaerobic expression samples
Emissionpeaks Values of the peaks of the emission spectra of EGFP per sample
In , the second sample shows a decrease in intensity. This can be caused by the switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism so that the EGFP that was produced can be degraded until the bacteria are fully switched to anaerobic metabolism. Then the peaks increase, caused by higher concentrations of EGFP produced anaerobically by the bacteria. Another reason for this could be that the bacteria continued to grow and that the produced EGFP is background expression.  The intensity of the last sample showed decreased intensity with respects to the peak of around 18-19 hours. This can also be caused by degradation of the produced proteins.
Repeat Experiments
As repeat experiments had been performed, where samples of EGFP expression had been taken and purified it would also be possible to perform fluorescence experiments"
Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," know more current information concerning Chinese plastics industry, we attended the 10th seminar about High technology and industrialization of China’s plastics industry on 31th July.
Figure1.  Prof. Chen’s report
We obtained a lot of information from the seminar. One of lecturers, Prof. Wu, who is devoting himself to producing engineering plastics based on recycling PET bottle, primarily told us about the current situation of recycling waste PET. Prof. Wu said that China recycled about 1000 tons PET bottles last year, half of which were imported. He said foreign countries usually recycle PET waste bottles into PET new bottles, which has mature technology but costs a lot of money while domestic plants usually recycle PET waste bottles into PET fiber and textile auxiliaries, The technology is hard to come out PET fiber with high quality so that many plants stopped their production. And the technology used to generate cotton fabric has been evaluated for performance and found to give good results. The chemicals used during depolymerization and reuse of PET are inexpensive and comparatively less harmful to the environment, which offer advantages in the chemical recycling of polyester waste. Specifically, PET is depolymerized through glycolysis to obtain the virtual monomer BHET in its pure form and then to use it as a starting material for preparing softeners useful for the textile industry [1].

Figure 2. Prof. Wu’s report
Besides, we learned about his leading project aiming at recycling waste PET bottles into PET engineering plastic. In his perspective, the key points of recycling waste PET were lowering the standards of PET bottles’ quality and good performance of recycled products. Therefore, they created unique secondary processing technology to generate engineering plastic which possesses a fine plasticity like metals and can be knocked by a nail like a wood block, aiming at manufacturing engineering plastics PET/PE alloy(special pipe material) ,solving the recycling and regeneration industry of waste PET and upgrading PE pipe industry.
Environmental Impact And Economic Analysis Of Our Project
After knowing about the status quo of Chinese recycling of waste PET, we interviewed plastic-related experts after the seminar in order to seek for experts’ assessment of our project and explore the prospect of its development.
When asked about the significance and the possibility of industrialization of facilitating enzyme degradation of plastics, Prof. Wu directly affirmed that our ideas was of great value and did good to environmental protection. The original intention of our project"

Discussion of aspects like:
Presence of bee diseases in Chile and its implications.
Agricultural and Livestock Service normative.
Can our product help against varroa?
How bee’s longevity varies depending on different production stages.
Detailed Description
Keeping on with our international validation on the presence of foulbrood, its implications, and our project insights, we were able to contact a Chilean beekeeper thanks to our colleagues from UChile (LINK collaborations). Bryan Saavedra dedicates to honey production, pollination, and queen bee breeding and exportation. He has dedicated more than a decade of his life to beekeeping and he counts with more than 1000 beehives.
“Approximately 13% of the Chilean working population is engaged in agriculture, and agricultural products represent about 4% of the gross domestic product (GDP). The fruit sector is very important and includes crops such as grapes, melons, apples, and peaches.1”
After UChile team sent us the beekeeper’s contact we were able to get in touch with him and schedule a video-call. During the meeting, that lasted approximately 35 minutes, we were able to discuss the presence of bee diseases in Chile, its implications and some activities of Chilean agencies in charge of supporting the development of agriculture, forests, and livestock.
Foulbrood occur in Chile as foci of infection,  once  an  infection  is  detected,  which  most  likely  originated
from contaminated equipment, the SAG (Agricultural and Livestock Service) proceeds to burn and then bury the infected hives; the decision of burning the beehives is quite drastic but it is the only effective way to take care of the rest of the Chilean apiculture. The last outbreak of foulbrood the beekeeper noticed about, was in last February; normally the infection comes from Argentina, which is where the disease most often occurs. In Chile, they mostly struggle with varroa and nosema"

When planting rice, we follow the safe regulations of transgene plants seriously, so we have a faith that it is impossible for gene flow comes up under this plant distance.
8. Laws & regulations
The credibility of the policy about ""aSTARice"" transgenic rice project:
8.1 The World Health Organization
In 2002, the World Health Organization claimed ""20 questions about genetically modified food"". So far, all of the genetically modified products in the international market have passed the risk assessment of the national authorities. These different assessments in general follow the same basic principles, including the environment and human health risk assessment. These assessments are transparent and the results did not show any risk for human health.
8.2 The United Nations
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2003-2004 in ""the food and agriculture condition report"" clearly pointed out that the currently existing modified crops and food are all safe and the methods used to test its safety are appropriate. So far, there is no safety accident caused by eating genetically modified crops. Millions of people eat the food derived from genetically modified crops, such as maize, soybean and rape seed, but no safety accident caused by eating them could be found.
8.3 The European
In 2009, the transgenic group of European food safety authority set out an authoritative scientific opinion about herbicide resistant and insect-resistant crops that in terms of impact on the environment and human health, gm is the same safe as non-gm, without any harm to health or the environment.
8.4 The United States
In 2010, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States claimed in ""the influence on American agricultural sustainability "". In general, compared to traditional agricultural technology for American farmers, genetically modification has created huge environmental benefits and economic benefits.
The World Health Organization, The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other international organizations and authorities have said that the current approval of commercialization of transgenic food is safe and edible.
8.5 China
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the management work of the safety of agricultural genetically modified organisms, and has formed a set of law which is suitable for Chinese domestic situation and consistent with international convention of laws and regulations, technical regulations and management system. As a result, it has achieved remarkable results in accordance with the implementation of safety management.

WHAT'S UP? 03/09/15
We are now arriving at the last two weeks of work time before the Wiki freeze, on the 18th of September. While time is running short, lab work is still in full swing and a number of important developments are taking place. Collaboration is a central aspect of iGEM , with teams from across the world helping each other to troubleshoot experiments, work on shared designs and to provide information. Here at Oxford, we have collaborated with several teams; for the Bordeaux university team, we have helped them carry out toxicity assay s on their species including Putida and Rhodobacter. We have also used our extensive PCR experience from earlier in the project to help Warwick obtain their biobrick s. Meanwhile, we have carried on characterising our own bacteria and we have been continuing the crucial process of detecting and quantifying our secreted therapeutics. Additionally, another member of our team has been working on developing our AlgiBeads . These represent an additional method of containment for our bacteria and, along with the catheter and kill switches, allow us to ensure the safety of our bacteria as a therapeutic agent.
The main focus of the final few weeks will be to collect and organise everything in order to present it on the wiki for the world to see. So far our wiki has several pages already live. Several more are soon to follow, including our lab notebook, detailing all the experimental work we have been doing, as well as our policy and practice pages.

In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.

Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Project
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we attempt to apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically.

Exporting protons at the cathode can help neutralize basicity caused by the reduction reaction and would provide more substrate for hydrogen generation. To solve this issue we proposed to engineer the oxygen scavenging  E. coli surrounding the cathode to produce proteorhodopsin, which would act as a proton pumping mechanism inside the cell.
Practical Application of our MEC
In thinking about practical applications of microbial electrolysis cells we determined that our MEC would be the most beneficial when implemented in wastewater treatment facilities. In these facilities there is an abundance of reduced organic material that has the potential to be recycled into energy.

Procedure:
12 overnight biofilms in 35x10 mm Petri dishes were rinsed twice with distilled water and then dried. These were then put into the Typhoon.
Colonies from dextranase, nuclease, and PDP were made into cultures by extracting a colony from each and then putting it into a tube of LB media along with CAM.

Objective: to test the effectiveness of our constructs.
Biofilms:
In a 50 mL falcon tube, 4 mL of LB media, 40 µL of RFP, and 4 µL of KAN were added together. 300 µL of this solution was then pipetted into 15 wells of a 96 well plate. This was repeated 3 more times with dextranase, nuclease, and a combination of dextranase and nuclease replacing RFP. However, 4 µL of CAM was used instead of KAN.

a) Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
Yes. May cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, may affect kidneys. However, E.coli is not considered a human or animal pathogen nor is it toxicogenic. Any concerns for E.coli in terms of health considerations are mitigated by its poor ability to colonize the colon and establish infections.
b) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
The plasmids we designed cannot function outside certain cell lines in the laboratory, And the cell we used is very fragile and it will soon die leaving the culture medium. So it will not bring contamination to the environment.
c) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
All the biological materials used in our lab are safe, and all the products of the coding sequences are innocuous to human, so the risk of malicious misuse is low.
A regular safety briefing and a lecture about the basics concerning of biotechnology and genetic engineering are basic elements of our education at the SCUT. The handling of biological material and safety aspects of chemicals are explained. A safety briefing was held for all iGEM students by Zhenwu Zhang who is the responsible person for our lab safety.

The big question was how to avoid this game being only an “iGEM effort”. The previous team had protected the game with a Creative Common license. We could have tried to publish the game but this would require a lot of time and energy to meet and convince people, and to participate in game events at the national scale. The solution came from contacts we had with high school biology teachers. We shared some games with them and they were very enthusiastic about it, enough to talk about it to their chief Education Officer. He came to visit us and it was decided from there that the game would be part of an educational wallet designed to explain microbiology for high schoolers. It is without saying that we are thrilled with amazing opportunities that is our greatest achievement for Public Engagement and Education.
And if you visit us in Boston or Toulouse, come play with us !
SCIENCE EDUCATION: SCHOOL
Education of the next generation is maybe the most efficient way to educate the public. It is also crucial to create vocations. We chose several approaches with pupils and students to explain our work, understand how young people feel about biotechnologies and microbiology, and to help teachers with their important tasks.

Intervention Report
Introduction
We intervened with 35 CM1 (9 years old) of Belbèze primary school in Toulouse. This course on microbes was a part of the theme “Civic education, morality and discovery of the world”. The purpose of our activities was to allow children to observe, investigate and discover the causes of natural phenomena. For this, we followed a questioning approach on the role of the researcher and the hygiene measures that he must follow.
At first, we introduced ourself, then we introduced iGEM to the students. We separated the students into three groups.
Group 1 : Researcher and hygiene measurement
Equipment :
We brought Petri dishes, plastic beakers, a pear, a graduated pipette, a sterile bulb, gloves, a gown, safety glasses, Eppendorf tubes of different sizes, pee pots, flasks, containers to weigh, displays and distilled water.
Summary :
The research profession was presented through personal considerations from the children who were asked to think about a definition of research as well as the material for studying “microbes”.
An important aspect was to focus on safety with a presentation of the individual protective clothing (glasses,"

Using the assay methodology pioneered by QGEM 2011 (Margie et. al. 2013), worms were placed in a common starting area and their movement in response to a control substance and to the test odorant was observed. With an anaesthetic at target sites to immobilize worms at the end of each trial, the number of worms in the test and control quadrants were counted to calculate a chemotactic index. More details on how this assay works can be outlined here .
Isovaleric acid solutions at 1M, 7:1, and 99% concentrations were used. A total of 38 chemotaxis assay plates were run. The graph to the right shows our results from the standard graph for our chemotaxis assay. According to statistical analysis, there was no significant difference between C. elegans motility response to the control and test samples.

Who is not excited to receive a postcard?
It is a way to share holiday experiences, memories, events and to make Synthetic Biology more popular.  So we were excited to join the postcard campaign by Cologne-Düsseldorf, creating our own postcard and receiving amazing postcards in return from iGEM Teams around the world. Moreover, we distributed these postcards in town, schools, busses, trains, to neighbours and friends.
What a great idea from Cologne-Duesseldorf!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"egrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium.

4. Medical application
a. Diagnostics
Accurate diagnosis plays a decisive role in effective disease treatment. Therefore, a large                                     amount of research effort is put towards its improvement. Particularly, recent years have seen a growing interest in the in vivo diagnostics. Using SSR and synthetic biology,                                     researchers have engineered bacteria that normally inhabit human gut into surveillance                                     machines that sense the gut environment and microbiota. They could potentially be used                                     to record a patient’s past exposure of infections, informing clinicians to prescribe                                     more appropriate therapy.
The iGEM team in ETH Zurich in 2016 has used SSR as a tool to develop E. coli as a surveillance machine to track inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)! Check out their page here: https://2016.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich

Peptidosomes
At a Glance
Motivation:
Development of a selectively permeable cage to encapsulate living bacteria with useful properties.
Approach:
Using the self-assembling properties of Fmoc-FF upon pH-decrease to generate spherical structures.
Achievements:
(I) A robust protocol for Peptidosome formation was established. (II) Bacteria could be encapsulated and were alive and growing inside the Peptidosomes. (III) Reporter strains showed full functionality in Peptidosomes. (IV) Peptidosomes could be functionalized by surface decoration .
Short Description
Peptidosomes are the new fundamental approach for generating and utilizing encapsulated bacteria. By the creation of spherical compartments containing a liquid environment inside, bacteria are still able to grow and fulfill a given task. The mesh-like structure of the sphere allows the selective exchange of compounds via diffusion, but holds the bacteria trapped inside. Therefore, we are able to benefit from the entrapped cells’ abilities, while still ensuring they are not released into their surroundings. Peptidosomes can be further be enhanced by the incorporation of magnetic or biological beads – which themselves can be functionalized with proteins – into their peptide-based fibrillary shell.
Background
Bacteria are omnipresent in biotechnology and applied projects. They can be used as hosts to produce nearly all biological compounds of interest such as: drugs, vaccines, enzymes, antibiotics or even fuels and solvents. Their fast life cycle and comparably low requirements of living conditions highlight their industrial relevance.  Over the last decades, the main focus to increase yields has been on extensive metabolic engineering and optimizing growth conditions.
Yet, there are more aspects which need to be considered when producing a compound of interest. First, where can the product of interest be found; inside of the producing strain or will it be secreted to the surrounding media? Second, what is necessary to separate the valuable end-product from the bacteria? And maybe most importantly, how to assure a safe use of genetically engineered production strains?

However, due to time restraints and lack of accurate kinetic parameters in literature and databases we decided not to pursue kinetic modelling; the information generated would not be applicable for informing our experiment given current circumstances.
Future Directions
In the future we hope to test our phaJC, fadE, and fadD constructs in the lab to obtain data of enzyme kinetics which we can use to adjust our model's kinetic parameters to obtain accurate results.

Collaboration
Every member from our team owns a positive  attitude towards team collaboration. We had enjoyable collaboration with team  SJTU, SYSU and Tsinghua A.
During our initial seek for an idea project, SJTU  provided us several plasmids containing the light system because they have used  similar proteins before. Apart from sharing similar parts with them, we also  invited two students from SJTU to Tsinghua University for a visit when they  came to Beijing in August. They said that they had a good time in the campus  and looked forward to better cooperation with us.
We are also grateful that SYSU later began to  collaborate with us after a conference in Taiwan. They kindly shared their  plasmids encoding recombinase with us. Besides this, we also held a meet-up in  Beijing in August, during which we not only discussed the technical obstacles  we encountered before but also shared useful tips for later experiments. As an  exchange, we spotted out several wrong description or sequencing errors in  their plasmids, which at first might be misleading.
The collaboration with Tsinghua-A was a bit late,  but of great help to us – we provided them a hardware prototype and asked for  their advices, and indeed they provided us very useful feedbacks. Besides,  their senior advisor pointed out a potential problem for us. As the only two  iGEM teams in our university this year, we believe this collaboration is  necessary.

If we see the diffusion of AHL across cell membrane as simple diffusion, the process can be described using Fick's Law, which assumes that the flux of molecules across a membrane is proportional to the gradient concentration.
$$J=-D\frac{dc}{dx}$$
Approximately, this means the change of number of molecules on one side of the membrane is proportional to the difference of concentration across the membrane. In our model, we assume that the diffusion of AHL across the membrane is fast enough so that we can omit the process in which AHL travels within the membrane. Also, it is assumed that the distribution of AHL in the medium and inside cells can come to a steady state in a very short time, which means the system is generally homogeneous when it comes to AHL distribution. Previous iGEM teams have discussed the details of AHL diffusion in the extracellular medium, and we believe these details prove to play insignificant roles in our prospect so they are not included in the model.
3) Diffusion of AHL into the cell
- Event: AHL (outside the cell) $\to$ AHL (in the cell)
- Rate:$v=pr(H_{ex}(t)-H(t))$
- Relevant parameters: $p \Rightarrow$ coefficient of population density.
Explanation: This process is the reverse version of the previous one. A coefficient of population density is multiplied to the gradient concentration, as the number of bacteria in the system would affect how quickly the external AHL concentration changes.
4) Formation of 3OC6HSL-LuxR Complex
- Reaction: 2*3OC6HSL + 2 LuxR $\to$ 3OC6HSL-LuxR Complex
- Reaction rate: $v=2k_1(H(t))^2(R(t)-2C(t))^2$
- Parameter: $k_1\Rightarrow $rate constant of complex formation
Explanation: This is based on the law of mass action. Two molecules of 3OC6HSL binds to one luxR protein to form a complex, which can then activate the transcription of luxpR promoters.
5) Dissociation of 3OC6HSL-LuxR Complex
- Reaction:  3OC6HSL-LuxR Complex$\to$2 3OC6HSL +"

Top 10 - with K274210 insert  OD = 0,044 (100 x diluted)
MG1655 - no insert   OD = 0,007 (100 x diluted)
Mg1655 - with K274210 insert  OD = 0,009 (100 x diluted)
Cultures with K274210 insert were grown in media containing ampicillin. 100 mL cell culture were centrifuged for 5 min at 14000 RPM. The supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 5 mL acetone (99,9%), except the Top 10 E. coli with the K274210 insert, which was resuspended in 10 mL acetone (source of error). The resuspended cells were sonicated for 5 min. Samples were spun down, the supernatant was transferred to new tubes, and cell debris was discarded. A standard curve was made from pure beta-carotene.
The samples at the OD’s seen above as well as solutions of pure beta-carotene with known concentrations were measured at a fixed wavelength of 456 nm.  Known concentrations and their absorbances:

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," much higher than the basal level. Given these results, we can consider a binding model which is almost exclusive (\(J\gg 1\)). However, if the inhibiting site is far from the activating site, inhibition wins. In this case, we can consider the binding of two dCas9-gRNA complexes to the same promoter to be independent (\(J\approx 0\)).
For the case of an inhibiting site close to the activating one (exclusive binding), we observed a diminution of activation of almost 25%. Therefore             \[                 \frac{\alpha_{ai}}{\alpha_b} \approx 0.75 \frac{\alpha_{a}}{\alpha_b}.             \]             In contrast, when the inhibiting site is far from the activating one (independent binding), we observed a very small deviation from the basal level (we have a slight activation):             \[                 \frac{\alpha_{ai}}{\alpha_{b}} \approx 1.25             \]
Because of the experimental differences outlined above, we will consider both exclusive and independent binding in our model, using the extreme cases where \(J=0\) and \(J=\infty\) respectively. Results of these simulations are shown below. We can see that our model is once again able to reproduce quantitatively experimental results.
For exclusive binding we obtain a GFP level which is half of the level obtained for simple activation. This can be explained by the fact that half of the transistors are inactive (no GFP production since \(\alpha_i\approx 0\)) and the other half are active at steady state.
Exclusive binding.
If binding is independent, we obtain levels which are comparable to the basal expression.
Independent binding.
Now that we are able to reproduce qualitatively our experimental results for the transistors, we can put together multiple transistors in order to create a logic gate.
NAND gate in E. Coli
Since our kinetic model is able to reproduce the behavior of our transistor qualitatively, we may use this model to asses the functionality of a logic gate. In particular, we want to be able to validate gate design. A promising behaviour of the gate in silico will justify the effort of experimentally reproducing the design. However, since our model is deterministic, it does not take into account biologic noise: a gate design that works well in silico is not guarenteed to work experimentally.
We here focus on the NAND gate, which has the following truth table (A and B are the inputs, C is the output).

E.D. FROSTI Project description
After stimulation, E.D.Frosti will acquire its desired biological property, i.e. the expression of Ice Nucleation Protein (INP) to induce ice formation, or the expression of a membrane-attached Antifreeze Protein (AFP) to  prevent ice formation. Upon application in the environment at low temperatures, a cell death mechanism will kill off the cells, though the desired biological activity of the proteins on the membranes will remain. This mechanism  ensures that the bacteria cannot overgrow the environment.
Importantly, without any  preceding stimulus, no cell death will be induced at low temperatures, so our  organism can be safely stored in the fridge.
Extended project description
This summer, we are engineering the bacterium E.D. Frosti that induces ice crystallization, using the ice-nucleating protein ( INP ), or inhibits ice crystal formation, using the anti-freeze protein ( AFP ), depending on the given stimulus. These proteins will be extracellularly anchored at E.D. Frosti’s cell membrane. Furthermore, it is essential to create a dual-inhibition system, so that INP and AFP can never be expressed at the same time. To test this system, we coupled the production of a particular color to a specific stimulus given to E.D. Frosti. Finally, as a safety mechanism, we installed a suicide mechanism in E.D. Frosti, whose activity is mediated by an “AND”-gate system: the cell death mechanism is only activated when one of the two stimuli is given, AND a sudden decrease in temperature (a cold-shock) occurs. To construct our E.D. Frosti project, we had to create several mechanisms which will be outlined below.
1. Dual inhibition system
Since E.D. Frosti contains all the genetic information to execute both functions, it is important to make sure that only one type of protein is expressed in one E.D. Frosti cell. We found that a dual inhibition system is a good way to ensure this, as you can see in the next figure.

For the choice of the plasmid we were helped by Rob Van Houdt, from the Belgian                   Nuclear Research Center. Thanks to their huge plasmid bank, we finally had our starting point to develop the project the best way possible!

BIOTECH4CHANGE at the EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 28th of September 2018
Our team UCLouvain 2018 decided, for the first time in our 3 consecutive years iGEM participation, to host an official iGEM Meet-Up! We wanted it to be an inspiring and challenging event, this why called it Biotech4Change! http://biotechforchange.eu/
Our goal? To show to the general public how biotechnologies can have a positive impact in our daily life, especially in the health field!                 Only 100 places were available and they were sold-out in just 5 days!
If we have to describe our conference in 3 words? INSPIRATION, IMPACT and NETWORKING
The event was divided into 3 parts:
A Round-Table event with politicians, entrepreneurs and researchers about Anti-Microbial Resistance (our key-concept) and European Legal Frame
An iGEM pitch part: our team and 3 foreign teams presented in 3 mins their respective projects to the audience. It was an exciting opportunity of networking and exchange!                     Please check our collaboration page for more information https://2018.igem.org/Team:"
Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," focused specifically on hydroponic systems, helped us gain a new perspective on common problems at hydroponic farms. These insights helped us develop a concept of how to design the product that would house our bacteria, and served as a preview into user interviews. We also learned about how we could test our system based on plant immunity and plant science.
Key Takeaways
Affordability is a key concern for hydroponic systems which typically have narrow profit margins.
ROS affect plant growth and differentiation - therefore a ideal balance must be struck between too much or too little oxidative stress.
Ideal testing would require setting up a small-scale hydroponic system in a greenhouse.
Our approach using a biocircuit is innovative and a different way of thinking in the realm of plant sciences.
The product we create cannot be too technically challenging to implement for a farmer. We should aim for the greatest simplicity and ease of use while still achieving the regulation of oxidative stress we desire.
Feedback we received about the design we developed by the end of our project confirmed we have achieved something that could easily be incorporated into a currently existing hydroponic system.

Dr. Neil Mattson
We reached out to Dr. Neil Mattson, an expert on hydroponics and horticulture at Cornell University, to understand the hydroponics industry and intricacies. When we met with Dr. Mattson, he spoke with us at length about some of the problems hydroponic growers face, including high costs from HVAC systems and low margins due to disease and low yield. We realized that our system needed to be affordable as well as effective in increasing yields. From a technical standpoint, Dr. Mattson also helped us design our testing protocol by suggesting we use basil, a relatively easy crop to grow hydroponically that is becoming more and more widespread.

Dr. Adrienne H.K. Roeder
Dr. Adrienne Roeder was in a unique position to help us as a molecular biologist studying plant growth at Cornell University. She spoke to us about the special role reactive oxygen species (ROS) play in plant growth, including their roles in cell differentiation and maturation. She was excited about our project, as her own research had shown that using intracellular expression of oxidative enzymes such as catalase could help reduce oxidative stress for plant and increase blooming in plants exposed to external high levels of ROS. She expressed that there was potential that our regulation of ROS via OxyPonics could be an innovative approach to promoting plant health.

Part:BBa_K542008 - Lumazine Synthase Microcompartment Device
Datasheet for Part BBa_K542008 in E. coli strain DH5alpha.
Introduction
The intended purpose of the Lumazine Synthase microcompartment device is to specifically target proteins that have been tagged with a positively charged oligopeptide into the cavity formed by the microcompartment. Furthermore, multiple unique proteins may be targeted into the cavity (1) for the purposes of increasing the efficiency of a metabolic pathway, to name just one example. This test construct is designed to demonstrate that proteins with positively charged tags can be localized into the cavity of the microcompartment formed by the oligomerization of Lumazine Synthase monomers.
The expression of Lumazine Synthase and the fluorescent proteins are independently regulated by two separate promoters. Lumazine Synthase is regulated by the pLacI promoter and the fluorescent proteins are regulated by the pBAD inverter. Since the two are independently controlled, Lumazine Synthase microcompartments may be formed in the presence or absence of the fluorescent proteins (ie. absence or presence of arabinose, respectively).
Because the fluorescent proteins are tagged with a positively-charged poly-arginine tag and the Lumazine Synthase is mutated with a negative interior (BBa_K249002 and Lethbridge 2009 Modeling), enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) should be targeted into the microcompartments. ECFP and EYFP are a well known FRET pair.
Construct
Part Number BBa_K542008
The construct was made by assembling BBa_K542004 with BBa_K542005.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp_-_-_TEXT.html," on humans. We tried to incorporate a foreign inducible metabolic process into human liver cells; therefore we had to consider how to eliminate possible complications that our project could cause. We approached this aspect by meeting two prominent scientists in Hong Kong society who are currently actively participating in scientific and medical research. They helped us by evaluating our project from their professional point of view and to think about the possible concerns that can arise if we try to transform our project into a product. With these experts we discussed three main topics: application of our project, biosafety and bioethical issues concerning our project, synthetic biology in Hong Kong and in Asia in general.
Bioethics and Biosafety
We went beyond fulfilling the minimum iGEM competition requirement of filling in the safety sheet. Because applying foreign DNA or cells into humans is currently not a widely employed technology, we thought it would be necessary to research these techniques. During the interviews with the experts, gene therapy was mentioned and we did some research to write an informative article about it. In the article, we provided some background information on gene therapy, discussed the bioethical and biosafety issues concerning gene therapy, and thought about if gene therapy could be used as an application of our project.
Provision of Information
The concept of synthetic biology is not prevalent in Hong Kong and in Asia. We thought it was imperative to provide information to the public. We tried to achieve this by making short and informative but hopefully interesting videos and an interactive blog that introduce synthetic biology and our project. We have included translations of our work in Cantonese so that the public in Hong Kong can easily digest the information.  While we were gathering information about synthetic biology.
We observed inadequacy in the amount of information of synthetic biology in Asia. To amend this problem, we have researched information about synthetic biology in different languages such as English, Korean, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Indonesian. We have complied information on synthetic biology in four East Asian countries/regions and one South East Asian country. We believe that this novel approach will help the reader have a more holistic and unbiased view of synthetic biology all around the world.
We also had time to share our experience and thoughts to various people through presentations. We already had semi-formal meetings with the SUSTC and CUHK iGEM teams, during which the teams presented their projects to each other. However we have also prepared delivery of three more presentations, two for HKUST students, and one for the general public in Hong Kong.

Molecular biology is what I like to talk about. If you want to know more about the smallest creatures of life, I am always available for a nice chat. Maybe that is why I am responsible for the outreach of our project. To me the project would be successful if I am able to give an insight into synthetic biology, to all levels of society. Next to iGEM and studying I give guest lectures at high schools and I give tutoring.                      But it is not all about the brain! I also like to play korfball. It is a typical Dutch sport, looks a bit like basketball, but the more fun part is… we play with men and women together.

Our model
In our model , we use Gillespie algorithm to simulate the process of inversion. Here we use   Markov chain to describe the process of inversion. We assume that the state ‘A’ , ‘B’ , ‘C’ , ‘D’ , is the original state , the state after inversion , the  Intermediate state when A forms holiday junction, the Intermediate state when B forms holiday  junction respectively.
(VAN DUYNE G D, 2001)[3]
(VAN DUYNE G D, 2001)[3]
The following are the reactions which are related to the process of inversion.
Then we get the following Markov chain.
Here,
are the probabilities of the reaction in an  Infinitesimal time. According to the property of the Markov chain , we can get:
In the model,

Here we see 1000 genes which are in state ‘A’ as a whole and we get the following results. The concentration of Cre-Loxp ：
The number of the genes which are in the original state and in the state after inversion:
From the above two figures, we can see that the rate of the inversion is proportional to the concentration of Cre-Loxp. And about 50% of the genes keep the original state and the other 50% change to the state we want. The result is exactly what we expected, which clearly demonstrates our system can truly be controlled by adding in external signal molecules (arabinose).

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between MoDeL and SBML.
Standardization
Standardization of MoDeL
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. Knowing the importance, USTC_Software puts a lot of effort on the standardization of MoDeL. We have requested BBF RFC55 for MoDeL, and constructed a beta version of XML schema to describe the XML structure of MoDeL.
BBF RFC55
BBF RFC55: Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) mainly describes the detailed language specifications of MoDeL with concrete examples, which provides enough information for serious database constructors to build up a database on his own. As a highlight of MoDeL, the concept and the syntax of Chain-Node Model are described in detail. The content of document is currently arranged as follows:
Figure 1: Draft document of RFC55 - Table of Contents
The document of RFC55 has already been submitted. You can find it on the webpage of The BioBricks Foundation:RFC . Following are some more previews at the draft document.
Figure 2: Preview at draft document of RFC55
Figure 3: Preview at draft document of RFC55
XML Schema
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. Being written in XML fashion, a Schema is perfect for MoDeL to allow software to perform check on syntax. Following is the preview of the beta version of XML Schema for MoDeL. The Schema can be downloaded at iGaME project page on SourceForge.
Figure 4: Preview at XML Schema of MoDeL
Figure 5: Preview at XML Schema of MoDeL
Future Work
Future work
To promote MoDeL for wide use as a standard, we need to refine the structure of MoDeL definition and extend its content to enable descriptions of more biological process. In the future, the new version of MoDeL will be proposed and new functions of iGame will be added.
Next version of MoDeL
MoDeL is young, to be exact, just born. There must be a long way before he can stand up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:

Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device                                         and enter this information                                         in the Registry.
We improved the parts BBa_K737005 and BBa_K157010 by equipping them with additional tags, expressing them                                         in human cells and further characterizing their function.
Proof of concept
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project.
We successfully demonstrated the functionality of selected (split) proteases and                                         used them to control secretion of the reporter protein from the cell.
Demonstrate your work
How your project works under real-world conditions.
We showed that our mechanosensing constructs coexpressed in human cells allow                                         for a controlled response to                                         touch and used them for our art application, Touch painting .

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," oGEM meeting took place. Bringing together all of the post-secondary iGEM teams, the day allowed for discussion of our projects, our future, our strengths, and our weaknesses. While they were not at the center of the talk, surely but slowly common worries were brought forth, none of them relating to our projects at all but to our own selves: how do we even begin an iGEM team? How do we manage one that exists? How do we continue one that graduating students leave to us?
Throughout the years, this running theme of looking at our iGEM teams not through the lens of our projects and work but through the very essence of them, which is to say the people who make up iGEM in the first place, is something that has oft been pushed back and neglected. At the meeting that day, we realized that surprisingly, none of us were in the same stage of development in our growth as iGEM teams. Two teams just started that year; others had come back after some years of hiatus or had only been established for a number of years. Then, there were the teams that had been established as the forefront of oGEM, having been constants for years in this field. Yet, we all had our concerns about how to manage, grow, and develop our teams to be better. Despite our differences in experiences and years, or perhaps because of that, we came to realize that we could help each other build better, more solid foundations by exchanging the knowledge we had accumulated over the years. Thus, this manual came to be, out of a desire to be able to share and pass down that knowledge to all of us, and to you.
This manual will always remain open to edits, revisions, suggestions, comments, and questions. It is in our hopes that this manual grows as our teams will, and that what we have learned through this amazing journey in camaraderie and synthetic biology will always be available for those who need or want it.
Thank you, and good luck with your endeavours in iGEM. You’ll be amazing.
The Ontario iGEM chapters collaborating on this venture jointly by McMasterU, are: U of Guelph , Toronto , with entry contributions from Waterloo . The finished manual will then be distributed both in print and online to any chapters interested across Ontario and Canada.
Below is a list of the topics covered in the oGEM Manual, compiled by our Human Practices member Aline-Claire Huynh.

Tsinghua-A,2012,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project#Scalability_-_-_TEXT.html," the expression of Y will be under the control of the promoter in this sequence. Combining it with the sequence above, Y will be expressed once A’B’ or AB is true.
Thus, we have realized the transformation of all these 10 kinds of logic relations using this system. The figure below is the whole system.
When deal with N-input system, we use a more clear and modularized design. All two-input logical relations can be divided into AB, AB’, A’B, A’B’, so we have the equation Y = a*AB + b*AB' + c*A’B + d*A’B’(a, b, c, d=0 or 1) Therefore, there is an easy thought building module as follows:
The output of AB, A’B, AB’ and A’B’ depends on these four flip module. For example, if Flip Module 1 is flipped, AB can’t influence the expression of Y. Although we can express all relations in this way, it will cost one more flip module. In addition, if we want to express logical relations with N-input, we will have to build 2^n flip modules. Obviously, it’s difficult to put into application if we need to use more inputs. Comparing with this method, with less flip modules, the previous design is more expected. From the discussion above, we can find that all two-input logics can be expressed and transformed. Now we try to extend our conclusion to N-input logic. In fact, all N-input logic relations can be expressed by N-1 input logic with the equation f(A1, A2...An)=An *f(A1, A2...An-1, 1) + An’ *f(A1, A2...An-1, 1) We can build any N-input modules in theory if we have got all N-1 input modules. Of course, our system has its own limitation. The whole system is too complex. We can divide the system according to our requirement.

Introductory Lab Session: 30th June 2009
Our first introductory lab session saw members of the team make preparations to produce some competent DH5-alpha E. coli cells, which will be needed for the numerous transformations that will take place in the near future. The team started by following the first 'Pre-Culture' step in the protocol given to us by Dr. Phil Aldridge and then proceded to make up solutions needed for future steps in this procedure.
Carrying out the first 'Pre-culture' Step
We got samples of E.coli DH5-alpha strains and plated them into three agar plates. They were placed for incubation at 37°C
Preparing other solutions
Change to protocol - we have made up Glycerol solution with a concentration of 50% instead of 100%
We have created 0.1M of CaCl2 using 5.5 gram of CaCl2. The final solution is 0.5 litres. We placed them into 4 bottles (three 100ml and one 200ml). They have blue covers. We have left them for autoclaving.
We prepared LB solution using 20 grams of LB and water making up a final volume of 1 litre. We put them into bottles and left them for autoclaving.

Grenoble,2012,Team:Grenoble#Human Practice#BSS_-_-_TEXT.html," advised us the same thing as the Edinburgh team, that is to say that we should put a link with what already exists. Because of these feedbacks we managed to revise our project. Indeed our goal is not to set up a concurrent system, but more to improve what already exists. We saw that it would be an utopia to have teams using directly the BSS. That is why we worked on a way to link our idea to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. A way to do it would be to add another tab on BioBrick webpage that could be named Safety. In this part all the information about the way the BioBrick has been used environments in which it would evolve would be listed. In addition, drawbacks and bad effects that appeared would be explained. As it seemed practical, we decided to keep the sheet available for teams, if they need to communicate on what they are doing or using. Therefore other people and especially non biologists can have access to the information. The last feedback was send by the team of Virginia. To sum up they gave to us  following advices.
Consider keyword tagging, so that experts in specific contexts can go to the registry and rapidly find a narrower list of parts of particular interest to review.
Include links to a list of biosafety resources
DIYBio list of biosafety resources (see for example Sandia National Laboratories - risk assessment framework
Include compatibility with relevant safety regulations -- global biosafety consensus? NIH?
Expand and standardize the symbol library on the sheet, at least to match the partsregistry
Potentially look at protein interaction networks to predict non-intuitive implications
These advices came relatively late, so we intend to use them for later.
Why is this important ?
This approach is important because a lot of projects intend to use microorganisms outside laboratories.  it is essential to make research on protection means. But it is even more necessary to know which hazards we should expect. Therefore having information on what would happen makes protections more efficient. Add to this, if we take a look at the number of iGEM teams that have competed since 2006, we notice that it is increasing steadilyand if the raise keeps the same we should have almost 350 teams in 2018.
Considering that each team uses around 10 BioBricks for their project, the number of BioBricks  used each year would easily reach 3500.
Thus, it would become more and more difficult to find the required information about the risk assessment. Last but not least biological systems are more and more complicated and need even more BioBricks. The number of BioBr"

d) Green line: magnetic beads-aptamer-complementary strand complex + EpCAM + incubation buffer.
Comparing the four groups, we can conclude that the non-specific adsorption of complementary strands on the magnetic beads does exist, and the magnetic beads-aptamer complex, like the buffer solution, had almost no fluorescence intensity. Significantly, the fluorescence intensity of the competition group with EpCAM was about 2.5 times larger than that of the non-specific adsorption group, which demonstrated that the fluorescence complementary strand of the competition group with EpCAM was successful, and so was our competition method.
Trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a (Microplate Reader)
It's reported that Cas12a could be activated by ssDNA and has trans-cleavage activity this year, so we hope to use this function in our system to amplify the signal. [3]
We operated the experiment according to the instructions from IDT. We incubated the Cas12a protein with crRNA to form a complex and then added our ssDNA to be recognized. Then, we used the commercial DNaseAlertTM Kit to explore its trans-cleavage activity. We drawed the fluorescence curve over time using a microplate reader, and measured the fluorescence intensity from 30 minutes to 110 minutes.
In order to control variables, we also set up a negative (DNaseAlert) and a positive (DNase I + DNaseAlert) control group. Get more information of our experiment, click here.
Figure 5. Fluorescence time curve image of activation effect of Cas12a.
a) Black line: negative group, DNaseAlert only;
b) Red line: positive group, DNase I + DNaseAlert;
c) Blue line: experimental group, activated Cas12a + DNaseAlert;
We fitted three sets of data points with Gaussian fitting curve in Figure 5. From the fitting results, we could see that the negative group and the positive group were declining, while the Cas12a protein group increased at first and then decreased. This is in line with our expectations, and the reason for the decline was, we suspected, the quenching caused by continuous measurements and the weakening of the fluorescence itself as the experiment proceeds. However, it's enough to prove that Cas12a could meet the expected result of amplifying signals.
Signal transformation by DNaseAlertTM Kit (Fluorescence Spectrometer)
Although we have used DNaseAlert to detect Cas12a, as the last of the three modules we designed, we needed to prove that DNaseAlert was indeed cut"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice"

Lab Notation
On researching previous iGEM policy and practices projects, we came across the Sheffield 2010 teams lab notation which they invented with the intention of standardising how protocols are written to make them easily accessible and understood by all. This was mainly to overcome barriers such as language or degree courses as many iGEM teams are interdisciplinary with some team members with no or very little laboratory experience.
Methods and Results
When we started researching this initiative further, we found it to be very confusing and difficult to understand. We decided to test the notation as it was initially with different members of the team: a science undergraduate, an engineering undergraduate and a science PhD student. We believed these people would cover a range of expertise and levels of background knowledge, which may have been a factor to take into account when gauging understanding of the protocols. We started by testing two different protocols that were written by the Sheffield 2010 team:
We gave each individual a copy of the protocols above with names of the experimental techniques omitted, alongside the original key. On testing with these groups of people, we concluded that the protocol would be better if it was to be targeted specifically at scientists, as they were able to slightly follow it; this was only because they could pick up on the objectives of the different protocols due to their experience. From the feedback after testing we concluded the fundamental problems:
The abbreviations were not consistent
The order in which protocols were written and presented did not flow correctly
There was no grouping on the key making everything confusing and difficult to find when translating protocol to instruction
We thought about how to reduce these problems and created a new, improved notation that took into consideration the problems identified initially:
Through our improvements, we used a colour key to represent actions, materials, substances and ster"

District Agriculture Officer
Joseph Dhikusooka, the District Agriculture Officer for the Iganga District who is responsible for overseeing government subsidies and providing support for farmers, was able to speak to us about farming practices and challenges in the region. Mr. Dhikusooka
Meeting with Mr. Dhikusooka
noted that several challenges farmers face in the district include: climate change, pests such as worms and fungus, and the lack of a consistent driving market. He described how his work includes travelling to farmers in rural regions to enquire about the specific pests and problems they face. Using the information they gather from field camps or their office, they produce “prescriptions” that are distributed to farmers in veterinary shops. He also mentioned that the government will subsidize the use of pesticides when large outbreaks occur. Although less frequent, fungal infections also affect farmers by reducing crop yield by ninety percent in the fruiting stage of growth. Overall, fungi decrease the yield in the district by ten percent each season.
Mr. Dhikusooka
also spoke of the positive impact the increased use of pesticides and fungicides has brought. He cited that when properly used, pesticides can reduce crop loss from 80 to 5 percent. Interventions with fungicide and the identification of fungal infection spots on the leaves of plants allow farmers to reduce the impact of fungal infections.

Bioreactors Research
We have considered advantages and disadvantages of each bioreactor type. The major issue with membrane bioreactor is fouling - the process resulting in loss of performance of a membrane due to the deposition of suspended or dissolved substances on its external surfaces, at its pore openings, or within its pores.
The two runner ups for consideration were hollow fibre immersed membrane bioreactor and stirred tank bioreactor.
Hollow Fiber (HF)
Nano filtration possibility Can provide 99.99% bacterial and bacterial debris removal, near to drinking water quality
Models have been developed without and with aeration
Can be considered/modified as continuous process
Greater area -->  lower flux -->  lower energy requirement
However:
Fouling is a great issue dues to increased crew-time commitment
High bacterial waste due to fouling
Would require spares and consumables
Stirred tank bioreactor + Self cleaning filter in the outflow stream:
Appropriate for anaerobic processes
Assures good mixing of feedstock
Can monitor retention time
Low energy consumption
No aeration required
Advantages of using mechanical self-cleaned filter:
Continuous bacteria removal from the walls and recycling back into the bioreactor
No fouling issues
Low power consumption
It was decided to use the stirred tank bioreactor followed by the self-cleaning filter as the technology for bacterial fermentation, removal and recycling.

Thirst Project | August 25, 2018 and October 15, 2018
Summary Points
The world’s largest YOUTH water organization
Evan Wesley from the Thirst Project
Empowering and informing hundreds of high schoolers
Exposure to Lambert iGEM members to the water crisis
The Thirst Project is a non-profit organization. They strive to provide safe drinking water to communities around the world where individuals do not have immediate access to clean water. Their mission is to “build a socially-conscious generation of young people who END the global water crisis by educating students..."" about it and activating them to rock the clean water cause and build real water projects all over the world”. The Thirst Project collects money and builds self-sustaining wells all across the continent of Africa. The Thirst Project has served for over 13 countries and 330,863 people. They have held projects in 13 countries; however, they are currently active in five: India, Uganda, El Salvador, Kenya.
An integral aspect of the 2018 Lambert iGEM project was to inform the public about the water crisis, the propelling force underlying our project and to empower others to take action. In order to accomplish this, we partnered with the Thirst Project and planned a Thirst Project rally for Lambert High School students. We invited other organizations at Lambert High School such as HOSA, Beta Club, Science National Honors Society, Medical Science Academy, and Key Club International to reach a wider audience.
Women and children walk, on average, 3.75 miles to fetch water. Hearing this, Lambert iGEM strived to inform the public and raise awareness. In addition, hauling water in a jerry can that weighs 44 pounds 3.75 miles can cause countless women's’ health issues. The Thirst Project came to speak to Lambert iGEM students earlier this spring. Aware of the impact that a lack of drinking water can have on women and children, Lambert iGEM addressed the gender gap in STEM fields by creating a doll kit for a local girl scouts troop and running a synthetic biology summer camp for 40 rising 8th and 9th graders.
Lambert iGEM scheduled a video call with Evan Wesley, the Vice President for Student Activation for Thirst Project. “Gathering data is crucial for alleviating the water crisis”. These are the exact words of Evan Wesley. We spoke to Evan about our plans for the future, including our plan to distribute portable kits to non-profits working in targeted areas. He confirmed"

We did not add phycocyanobilin in the preculture here.
Also a negativ control (transformation without plasmids) was prepared.
The transformated cell suspension were incubated for 2 days in a 30 °C shaker at 200 rpm.
Addendum from October, 25th: only in the negativ control the cell suspension was still clear, the rest of the transformated cells were blurred. --> Succesfull co-transformation of both light-switchable systems and reporter constructs

Basic Flip Flop
Experimental Data
Basic Flip Flop. Experimental Data
The most important features of the basic flip flop are the following:
Time of the change of state
Stability when the inducer is retired
So these are the ones that have been studied more accurately in our experiments. Overnight inoculums inducing a condition (adding 0,1 mM IPTG or growing at 42ºC) must be set the day before you want to make the experiment. The morning after a 1/100 dilution is made, and let the culture grow until de optic density reaches 0,2. In that moment the conditions are changed, to test the change between states or just retire the inducers, to observe the stability of one state in a long time.
We made the experiments in two ways:
Qualitative, assessing that the changes actually occur. For this, we use the fluorescence microscope.
Quantitative, with the microtiter reader we can measure how big the changes are and how quick they happen.
It’s important not to use LB media, because it contains cyclic aminoacids which make it fluorescent. For all this experiments we used Minimal Media supplemented with 0,1% casminoacids. Another problem we faced is that RFP is also excited in the wavelength we use for GFP, making our measure a little bit inaccurate. A solution to this may be insert the bistable in the bacterial chromosome, using the Mini-Tn7 based system my team-mate has developed for biobricks. The less copies of the construction, the better the regulation is, because there is more repressors for each copy of the promoters.
Several repetitions of this experiment were carried out, showing a lot of variability when the same conditions were used. We expect this great variation to be reduced in the improved constructs we are developing.
The results of one of this experiments are shown"

General Support
Dr. Howard Salis and Dr. Tom Richard were our iGEM coordinators and were instrumental in development of the big ideas for our projects as well as with troubleshooting specific experiments.
Project Support and Advice
Chiam Yu Ng (graduate student) was an outstanding mentor, helping us to learn design strategies and develop a cloning plan to set our project into motion. When we ran into problems with cloning, Chiam Yu was very patient and helped us to optimize our experimental processes.
Another great asset to our project was Tian Tian (graduate student). Because of her desk’s proximity to Clay’s, she skillfully answered an almost constant stream of questions - on everything from optimizing PCR protocols to tips for plasmid prep.
Manish Kushwaha (post-doc), Iman Farasat (graduate student), Long Chen (graduate student) and Amin Espah Borujeni (graduate student) all provided critical tips for improving our cloning strategy, as well as assistance developing our programs to optimize the GFPs.
Iman Farasat and Dr. Salis were a big help to the Biodetoxification project. Iman assisted us with forming an experimental plan and ordering primers for Gibson Chew-Back Annealing Assembly. They both taught us how to perform a CBA and homologous recombination and offered advice during our project troubleshooting. Tian Tian, Chiam Yu Ng, Long Chen, Manish Kushwaha and Amin Espah Borujeni answered our random questions.
Fundraising Help and Advice
Dr. Tom Richard and Dr. Howard Salis took on the burden of finding funding for the undergrads, and we are sincerely thankful for their work.
Lab Support
We are very appreciative of being able to use Dr. Salis’s Lab space and materials. Iman and Chiam Yu were crucial in the wet-lab success of both projects.
Difficult Technique Support
When we experienced problems with a tricky inverse PCR, Chiam Yu helped us to uncover a critical error in one of our primers. Designing an RBS library with the constraints that were present in our constructs was very difficult and Iman helped"

Team Student Academy:
Repetition of the transformation didn’t change the result. We made a liquid culture of BBa_J04450 , but it did not fluoresce. Searching for mistakes and alternatives. Maybe competent cells are not that good and in case of RFP the lacI sensitivity could be the problem.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
After some empty agarose gels we finally isolated  the laccase gene bpul from Bacillus pumilus ATCC7061 as PCR product with the desired overhanging ends. As template we used the plasmid we got from the Swiss working group.
Wednesday May 9th
Team Activity Test: From the information we collected during our literature research we created a protocol for our first experiments. We decided to check the activity via a photometer. The one we may use here at the Cebitec is a Tecan Microplate reader. Check protocols for further information. If oxidized by laccase, ABTS can me measured at 420 nm. Also we found out that sodium acetate buffer (100 mM / pH 5) would give an optimal environment to our enzyme. So let´s have a look at our protocol:
Initial laccase activity test:
100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0
5 mM ABTS
8 U laccase
ad 200 µL deionized H20
Also we talked about further characterization after accomplishing the first experiments and confirming that the used concentrations are a good choice. We are planning to buy and characterize the laccase from T.versicolor (TVEL0), to have a comparison to our future recombinant laccases. That laccase we are going to analyze in sodium acetate buffers that are adjusted to pH 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. Further we are going to analyze the effect of different temperatures on the enzymes activity. For that we will first do some more research on the temperatures of the waste water in clarification plants here in Germany. Also we found out that an addition of copper does enhance the laccases activity, so we are going"

EGF
Over the past few months, our team worked primarily with E.colis, which are ranked in the organisms of Level 1 risk group. We attempted to utilize our engineered bacteria to help treat IBD, so we considered as much as we can to ensure the safety of our entire project--not only the design of our therapeutic methods, but also our lab work.
Introduction
Human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) is a 6045-Da protein with 53 amino acid residues.  It can stimulate cell growth, proliferation and differentiation by binding to its receptor EGFR both in vivo and vitro. Some people utilize it as cosmetic product because of the potent ability of recovering epithelium.
New treatment of IBD—EGF enema
The study by Atul Sinha etc. in 2003   suggested that EGF enema is an effective treatment for active left-sided ulcerative colitis (a kind of Inflammatory Bowel Disease) . In their experiments, 12 patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis received daily enemas of 5 μg of recombinant hEGF (expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in 100 ml of an inert carrier and 12 received daily enemas with carrier alone. Patients were assessed clinically by sigmoidoscopy and biopsy. After 2 weeks, 83% of patients given EGF enemas were in remission, as compared with 8% in the control group.
EGF expression
We were inspired by the above research and designed a bacterial strain that can secrete EGF in patients’ gut. E.coli. has been chosen as expression strain because it is aborigines in human’s gut and easy to be programing. A signal peptide phoA is added at the N-terminus to facilitate secretion. We engineered two peptide tags, a ph"

Achievements
We have achieved many of the goals we planned at the beginning of our project. These achievements are well distributed between experimental results , theoretical work and human reflection and socialisation . As a team of seven students , we all contributed to all achievements, and are quite happy that we got this far on such a diverse project.
Lab
Quorum sensing crosstalk full characterization
We highlighted 3 levels of crosstalk between Las, Lux and Rhl quorum sensing systems and fully quantitatively characterized all possible combinations of  crosstalk at these three levels.
Characterizing and reducing leakiness in quorum sensing systems
We quantitatively characterized leakiness of the three quorum sensing systems (Las, Lux and Rhl). We have designed a new BioBrick for reducing leakiness of these systems and demonstrated its efficiency for the lux system, which is the most leaky of the three. We improved the signal over noise ratio for this promoter by a factor of 6 while reducing the basal expression by a factor of 60.
Novel millifluidic chip construction method
We designed a rapid prototyping approach for creating millifluidic chips: we use a 3D-printing device to create the mold for PDMS.
Bead to bead communication
We accomplished to produce alginate encapsulated E. coli culture beads . The cells within the beads could survive during the time of our assays and still produce green fluorescent proteins.
Bead to bead communication could be observed by placing a sender bead, containing AHL producing cells, into one well of our millifluidic chip connected to another well containing a receiver"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," are we calling it denitrogenation now??)
This week we received the sequencing results for CarAa and CarAd. CarAd was a match, however CarAa did not match at all and had misplaced biobrick restriction enzyme sites. Due to this we decided to restart the biobricking process for CarAa all the way back to PCR from the plasmid. By the end of the week we had progressed to the point of transforming it into competent E. coli cells, however a thick lawn of bacteria had grown overnight making it impossible to pick colonies. A streak plate was made from this plate to attempt to get less dense growth. Since the sequencing came back positive for CarAd the next step was to perform site directed mutagenesis on its NotI restriction enzyme site using the primers that were designed previously. The PCR was successful, showing very bright bands at 3000 bp, and the PCR product was digested with DpnI to remove parental DNA. Transformation of this product will indicate whether the mutagenesis was successful. We were also able to successfully perform a genomic prep of Rhodococcus erythropolis and amplify the AmdA gene this week. It was ligated into PSB1C3 and transformed into competent E. coli by Friday, and a confirmation colony PCR was run on Friday evening to verify that the gene was inserted. These results will be available by Monday. After many attempts the Ant operon was finally ligated and transformed as well this week. Confirmation PCR showed bands of about 3000 bp which is consistent with the size of the operon. By Friday the successful colonies had been grown up and miniprepped, ready to send for sequencing early next week. The CarAc/B0034 construct was also successfully transformed this week and verified by running a PCR using the B0034 forward primer. It was also miniprepped and is ready to send for sequencing next week. In addition to this work constructing biobricks we also started an experiment to demonstrate the function of the pCAR plasmid in LD2. Strains of LD2 were grown up in LB and then washed and placed in B-N media + glucose and various experimental additions. These additions included carbazole, 4-PBAH (a nitrogen containing naphthenic acid), ammonia chloride, and a negative control with no nitrogen source. Strains of E. coli were also grown under the same conditions to compare growth and ammonia production of LD2 to a strain that does not contain the pCAR plasmid. These results should act as a preview of what we"

iGEM Toolbox
Introduction
We have have done an extensive analysis into iGEM in order to improve the potential of iGEM even further. As part of this analysis, we have asked iGEM teams to fill out a survey about multiple aspects of iGEM, such as science and education. Based on the results of the survey we have among other things noticed that multiple iGEM teams have developed interesting and educative tools. We think that some of the tools would be very useful for other iGEM teams as well. However, currently it is difficult to find a specific tool.
We would like to advise iGEM headquarters to develop an iGEM Toolbox page. Teams that think that they have developed an interesting tool, could register their tool on this page. Other teams can use these tools and it would be especially interesting if iGEM teams could also evaluate the tools afterwards. In this way the iGEM community could for example develop an extensive curriculum, with extensively tested tools,  to teach the public about synthetic biology.
We have made an example Toolbox page that can be used as starting point to develop the iGEM Toolbox page.  On the page you can find a few very interesting education tools, tools that are useful in the lab and policy & practice tools.
Education
Card game - KU Leuven
The KU Leuven iGEM team of 2015 developed a card game about synthetic biology. The goal of this game was to teach children about DNA translation and mutations in a playful way.
Minecraft - Valencia UPV
The idea of Minecraft is simple. You can create your own constructions by moving blocks from one site to another in a 3D virtual world. The team used the concept of Minecraft and implemented Biology inside the game.
BactMan - IONIS Paris
The mobile application designed by the IONIS iGEM can be used to communicate and popularize Synthetic Biology. The applications is available on all Android mobile phones.
Lego Recepto - TU Delft
Lego Receptor Game explains how  receptors can ben activated by a specific molecule.
Science & Hardware
Ligation Tool - TU Delft
A very useful tool is developed to calculate the optimal compound distribution to successfully ligate. Click on the 'Ligation protocol'.
Master Control - Aachen
Every bioreactor comes with control software. However it is difficult to interface with something that is completely DIY. To test and run a bioreactor, they have developed"
