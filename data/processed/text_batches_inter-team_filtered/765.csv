SDU-Denmark
Welcome to the wiki for the 2017 iGEM team of the University of Southern Denmark! Our project this year focuses on green energy through bioelectricity in the form of a bacterial solar battery. This device will be constructed to contain two cultures of genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli). A photosynthesising E. coli will produce a carbon source in the form of cellulose, by fixating carbon dioxide through Calvin Cycle and harvesting energy from sunlight. When switched on, the second E. coli will break down the formed cellulose by secreting cellulase through the cellulase secretion system. Once cellulose is broken down, cellobiose can enter the second E. coli and be broken down to glucose by introduction of periplasmic beta-glucosidase. Electrons will then be harvested from the anaerobic glycolysis of glucose to facilitate an electrical current. The electron transfer will be mediated by bacterial nanowires retrieved from Geobacter sulfurreducens.
Our device will be designed to resemble a leaf, in which way it can contribute to a better city ambience when integrated into an urban environment. For the implementation of our device in an urban environment, we will collaborate with city planning experts, with focus of implementation of our device into our home city, Odense. This way, our device can be optimised to reach its full potential and thereby fulfill the needs for a greener future.
Plant leaves do photosynthesis and are full of bacteria. Our leaf is just like that - except it also powers your phone!
Human Practices
Not unlike the coastline paradox presented by Mandelbrot, our total carbon footprint is hard to measure. Calculating our total footprint is therefore virtually impossible, and we cannot take the following into account: Every single kilometer we have driven, the exact size of our trees and so forth.  The estimated carbon footprint of a flight from Copenhagen , Denmark to Boston, Ma, USA and back again is 3.430 kg/person(kilde). With a team of 14 persons this yields a total of 48.020 or roughly 48 tonnes of carbon dioxide for our team. Just from flying intercontinental. Added to this is the carbon footprint of the Danish trains at 30 g/km/person (kilde). With the same 14 persons and 175 km to Copenhagen from Odense this yields a total of 147 kg. We have been on a total of three trips, one to Langeland, Denmark,"

HNU_China,2014,Team:HNU China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in both yeast and Arabidopsis cells. Recently, a variety of microbial and plant-derived light-sensitive proteins have been engineered as optogenetic actuators, enabling high-precision spatiotemporal control of many cellular functions. The CRY2-CIB1 system has also been successfully applied to enable light-controlled gene expression in mammalian cells in vivo.
3.Our project
Yeast-two-hybrid, the original method to discover the interaction between CRY2-CIB1, is now utilized in our project to enable temporal control of the target gene expression. Fusion proteins on one engineered plasmid, CRY2-GAL4 BD and CIB1-GAL4 AD are constitutively expressed. GAL4 BD is the binding domain of a transcriptional factor called GAL4. This domain can bind to UAS in the promoter. GAL4 AD is the activation domain of Gal4, it can recruit other transcription factors to intiate gene transcription. Under blue light condition, the interaction between CRY2-CIB1 takes place, so that GAL4 AD and GAL4 BD reunite as a functional GAL4 transcription factor to induce the expression of the CASP3 gene down stream to UAS promoter.  CASP3 expression will then induce apoptosis [fig.7]

Primer design
3 enzymes were accepted by Prof. Skerra and could be ordered (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, limonene synthase, ???). We decided to order one primer pair with the consensus sequence and another without to prove whether the consensus sequence is necessary or not.
For those who have to design primers: the region that anneals to the gene should be 18 bases long and should contain 10 G/C’s. Furthermore the overhang should be 6 bases instead of only 5.
Everybody who designs a primer should consider how to detect the enzyme: enzyme assay, antibody detection  (abcam is a supplier of antibodies,you can look there for an appropriate antibody! A search engine exists as well…does anybody know the name???) or detection via tag (strep-tag or his-tag)
Primer purification
Primer that are longer than 60 bases should be purified
Co-expression of multiple genes in yeast
We need detailed information over multicistronic constructs in yeast! How is it done in other labs??? Look for papers and create a word document with sequence information and annotations.
Restriction sites
Restrictions sites inside a gene will be removed by quick change PCR after we proved the proper functionality
Lifetime of proteins
Look for the N-end rule.

Environmental Concerns
Our Project and the Enviromnent
One of the primary concerns of health and environmental organizations is the contamination of fresh water with dangerous toxins including naphthalene and arsenic as a direct by-product of bitumen extraction. Water used in the process of extracting bitumen and the waste sand, solvents, and other leftovers, collectively known as “tailings”, are stored and left to settle in tailings ponds adjacent to mining operations. Water from these ponds is recycled back, causing greater accumulation of arsenic and naphthalene which  are naturally drawn into the water during bitumen processing.
To prevent seepage into the groundwater, the tailings ponds contain groundwater monitoring facilities and containment dykes to recapture and recycle seepage. Unfortunately, these preventative measures are not failsafe. For instance, under escalating pressure from the people and government, the oil sands industry recently launched a new Lower Athabasca Water Quality Monitoring Program in 2011, increasing the frequency of water quality measurements to better assess the effect of oil sands activities.
Clearly, the risk of Canadian watershed contamination remains a pressing issue, and there exists an urgent demand for efficient detection methods of pollutants from tailings ponds.
This year, the Cornell iGEM team strives to meet that growing need.

Proteins would still be produced, consuming resources and decreasing the organism’s fitness. Competition with other bacteria would either kill the mutated organism or lower its reproduction rate.
Other parts in our system include two promoters and transcriptional terminators. The first promoter controls the expression of the hydrogenase and PFOR in hypoxic conditions. The latter regulates the expression of both maturases in a constitutive fashion. If any promoter loses its function all the system is shut down because both the maturases and the hydrogenase are required for hydrogen production. If the first promoter loses its capacity to detect hypoxia, and becomes constitutive, a slight decrease in fitness is expected, since hydrogenase would be produced in an aerobic environment that renders it useless. Any defect in a promoters leads to a reduced fitness phenotype since proteins regulated by the other promoter would be expressed, spending metabolic energy.
As of transcriptional terminators, each construction will contain two of them. If the first one fails or is deactivated by mutations, the second one stops the transcription of our operons. This is very important to ensure that our system doesn’t interfere with adjacent ORF’s and their transcription, maintaining its modularity.
How would the whole device or system change its properties and what unintended effects would result thereof?.
We have analyzed two cases that seem plausible with our system. The first one is our system deactivation. Under this scenario the organism would have a reduced fitness both producing unnecessary proteins that fail to complete the system and consuming metabolites in the produced proteins reactions.
The second scenario is the excessive consumption of metabolites by our system. This would probably kill our bacteria since we will be utilizing reduction potentials, which play a central role in the bacterial metabolism.
What unintended effects could you foresee after your engineered organism is released to the environment?.
It is possible that our strain infects other plant species, harming or poisoning them. However it seems improbable because the interactions between Rhizobium etli and Phaseolus vulgaris are very speciffic and have been affected by co-evolution processes.
Try to think outside the box. What is the absolute worst case scenario for human health or the environment that you could imagine?.
The absolute worst case scenario requires our strain to be very efficient in the bean root infection process. It also requires our strain to be bad at or lack at all nitrogen fixation, and to acquire a great viability in free life. With these assumptions, the infection of a bean root with our strain would kill or exclude other strains from the root and deprive the bean from the nitrogen fixation process. The free"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". Chloride ions, for instance, can expedite deterioration. Our favorite microorganism, V. natriegens requires an almost three-fold higher sodium concentration than the current standard, E. coli. And sodium is mostly added as sodium chloride, table salt. So we came to realize by Prof Dr Zelder’s feedback that this high chloride content of current media formulations may hold V. natriegens back for in industrial applications.
So he gave us the valuable input to investigate ways to reduce the chloride content in our medium by providing alternative chloride-free sodium sources. One such easy method, he suggested, would be to plate out a thick biofilm of a V. natriegens culture on agar plates mainly devoid of chloride and wait for colonies to adapt to the growth condition over time.
Taking this input, we went back to the laboratory to find suitable sodium salts to compete with sodiumchlorid (NaCl). For this endeavor, both regular LB medium and v2 salts were inapplicable since they all rely on chloride salts as the source for the cations necessary for growth. Therefore, we investigated the possibilities for a novel fermentation medium to aid the accessibility of V. natriegens for industrial application.
Experiment design
The goal of the experiment is to identify how well the wild type of V. natriegens can grow without sodium chloride if we provide consistently high sodium levels with an alternative sodium source. Therefore, the essence of the method is a dilution series in small incremental steps.
Figure 2:general layout for sodium chloride replacement
To screen a lot of possibilities in a short time we utilised platereader experiments for high throughput with stepwise replacement of NaCl
Inspired by the successes achieved with our measurement workflow for our Marburg collection we decided on plate reader experiments to achieve the highest possible throughput of combinations.
Medium composition and carbon source
We adapted the composition of common M63 low osmolarity minimal media and made adjustments to our purposes. Due to the slightly higher uptake rate and the general cost-efficiency we elected sucrose as the carbon source for our screening experiments. To simplify the minimal medium to be tested in other laboratories we refrained from adding trace elements.
We encountered troubles when first working with M63 and witnessed a reoccuring percipitate. Chemical investigation revealed that the high magnesia content leads to a formation of an insoluble magnesia phosphate salt. This needs to be taken into consideration when preparing the medium.

Characterization of Mating Switcher
OVERVIEW
After realizing that we need more intuitive characterization of Mating Switcher, we thought of two kinds of gene expression products in different colors, red fluorescent protein and β-carotene. We carried out a reasonable experimental design, and decided to realize functional conversion from yEmRFP to β-carotene by Mating Switcher.
At first, we built expression vector with TEF promoter, which was a strong promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although we obtained results as we expected, it is not so perfect that we decided to change a stronger promoter. Then, we constructed another expression vector with TDH3 promoter. We redid the same qualitative and quantitative experiments to characterize our results.
CONSTRUCTION
In the early stage of the project, we constructed two device parts with TEF promoter: BBa_K2407306, BBa_K2407307. At the end of our project, we also constructed one device part with TDH3 promoter:BBa_K2407314. Among them, yEmRFP is modified from a mCherry mRFP to adapt to the transcription environment in yeast. We did overlap PCR to combine them together. After that, we sequenced these parts, and sequencing result showed that these construction were successful.

Then we first inserted BBa_K2407306 to the Synthetic chromosome Ⅴ of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Through the screening of SC-Ura solid medium and PCR experiments, we obtained the required strains called PVUVC. Second, we integrated the second device part into this chromosome through hom"

Future Plan
Desired Dynamics Input
Q1:
How can we characterize the property of our desired dynamics instead of importing time course? I mean I don't care much on the exact behavior the system perform but some key characters of the dynamics?
A1:
It should be referred to the selection of the evaluation function. One possible solution is to convert the time dependent function from time domain to frequency domain. Fourier transform should be introduced for its advantage of simplifying many of complicated periodic functions.
For other common conventions and notations, see Other conventions and Other notations below.  The Fourier transform on Euclidean space is treated separately, in which the variable x often represents position and ξ momentum.
Instead of comparing with target function in real space consists of substance concentration and time axis, one potential alternative for avoiding dilemmas like unmatched phase in oscillation is to move the score function into frequency space after Fourier Transformation.
Q2:
The desired time course for different node are largely different in order of magnitude? Also, some results of my experiment cannot be expressed as absolute values but relative ones. How to keep the dimension of different species?
A2:
The data may vary significantly in dimension. And it is unfortunately true for most real-case reactions' dynamics/thermodynamics constant. Therefore we consider it to be a worthwhile trial to move all calculations to logarithmatic space to overcome the strong order-dependence of initial values of inputs. Related changes are systematical, from the substitution of variables and functions to the transformation of first order deriatives.
Though we are familiar with working at linear space, here it is more convenient and effective to move all sampling and initialization in logarithmatic space, where the step of calculation can easily jump among different orders.
Restriction Input
Q1:
The input box and steps for users is a little complicated and even have some small requirements for the users to be capable of transform rate equations to differential equations. It has confused me a little.
A1:
In fact this is one of the most serious headache we are suffering for now. On one hand, we have to make the input sound and standard; on the other hand we still feel it an urgent call from our users to cut off unnecessary inputs. So far, this input box is perhaps the simplest one after discussing a lot with our USTC wet team. By proposing many possible solutions, they"

It does this in an intelligent way, such that the drug production meets the individual patient’s needs. And when the patient is cured, Dr. Coli eliminates itself from the body.

Introducing engineering
Quest for parameters
Building the model
The most important assets of our project are the different control mechanisms. Since these are very much dependent on kinetic and other constants, Dr. Coli heavily relies on proper modeling . Our Dry-Lab team has spend its summer setting up a computational model of Dr. Coli to completely simulate his actions. We constructed models of all the subsystems (components) in both CellDesigner and Matlab. All these subsystems have been characterised by their ODE's and have been simulated thoroughly. Together they form our full model of Dr. Coli. These models are only capable of simulating the behaviour of 1 Dr. Coli cell, so we implemented our own Software Tool that can work with multi cellular models .

This year 10 students started the iGEM USTC Software team: Chen Liao, Zheng Wang, Kun Jiang, Jue Wang, Luojun Wang, Yubo Qi, Zhaoyi Li, Zhengda He, Shangyu Luo and Mort Yao. There are only 8 of us in the picture, while the only female team member, Jue Wang was in Beijing engaging for her TOEFL exam, and Shangyu Luo had gone to Hong Kong for studying in The University of Hong Kong as an exchange student. What a pity! But they will join us at the iGEM 2010 Jamboree.
USTC has formed two IGEM teams this year, one wet lab team and one dry lab team. As many students majoring in biology was attracted to the wet lab team, our team consists of students from other departments, such as Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and so on. Thanks to our instructors Hao Jiang and Zhaofeng Luo, with their professional instruction, we are guided to decide the project plan, design and implementation.
About iGEM@USTC
The iGEM Team of USTC are the combination of the exact tradition of USTC and the exact vitality of the young. Rigorous daily schoolwork has provided the team members with a solid foundation of basic knowledge, and an innovative spirit enables us to stand on the frontier of the modern science.
In 2007, Jian Zhan, Bo Ding, Rui Ma, Xiaoyu Ma, Yun Zhao, Ziqing Liu and Xiaofeng Su, guided by Prof. Haiyan Liu, Prof. Jiarui Wu and Prof. Zhonghuai Hou, won the ""Best Foundational Technology Prize"" and a Gold Medal, with the project ""Extensible Logic Circuit in Bacteria"" .

Toggle Switch
Toggle Switch
The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two promoters, each of which is inhibited by the repressor transcribed by the other promoter. We choose pLacI and pTetR as the two promoters, and the repressors are TetR and LacI, respectively. Theoretically, if ratio of LacI to TetR is greater than 1, strong binding of LacI to pLacI repress transcription initiation from pLacI and therefore quantities of TetR will decrease, which in turn relieves its repression to pTet leading to increase of quantities of LacI itself. In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR, whose expression is repressed at an extream low level and the system enters into its 'LacI' state. Similar analysis will do for TetR and the system will enter into 'TetR' state if its quantity dominates. To show transition between the two states, IPTG is added in 1s after the system enters into 'LacI' state completely. The assembling of parts are construcuted as follows:
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli .
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate the state transition:

Exeter and Glasgow iGEM 2016 Collaboration: KillerRed and KillerOrange Promoter Efficiency Experiment
Our collaboration with Exeter iGEM team started when we met them at the UK meet-up organised by Westminster iGEM team. It stemmed from our issues with cloning the parts for our SIM (self-inactivation mechanism) device, in particular the toxin part of the toxin-antitoxin system, so they agreed to help us by sending us one of their kill switches to use in our system. In return, we agreed to test the efficiency of the lac-repressible (and therefore IPTG-inducible) promoter they were using to expression two phototoxic fluorescent proteins, called KillerRed and KillerOrange.
Methods
First, we transformed the plasmids for testing promoter efficiency into the E. coli strain DH5α.Z1:
BBa_J04450 (RFP with a lac-repressible promoter) in pSB1C3
lac-repressible promoter + KillerRed in pSB1C3
lac-repressible promoter + KillerOrange in pSB1C3
Next, we set up 5ml LB broth cultures in boiling tubes with 25μg/ml chloramphenicol for the strains with plasmids, and incubated at 37°C (shaking at 225rpm) overnight. For each of the following we set up two cultures, one with 1mM IPTG and one without:
DH5α, no plasmid
DH5α, J04450-pSB1C3
DH5α, KillerRed-pSB1C3
DH5α, KillerOrange-pSB1C3
DH5α.Z1, no plasmid

Our Vision
Being the first iGEM team from Finland and one of the few groups in Finland actually doing synthetic biology, our goal was to make people aware of the field and its possibilities.
The first part was figuring out how to explain any of it to an audience that isn't that familiar with biology or gene technology. Explaining BioBricks as LEGO bricks and synthetic biology through programming and engineering helped. But our major breakthrough was the invention of Brian in July and the concept of turning bacteria into superheroes. That really resonated with people and it seemed like people started understand what we actually did.
The other part was informing students and researchers in related fields about synthetic biology and iGEM. There's a lot of people with knowledge of gene technology and biotech in Finland, but synthetic biology is hardly mentioned. We aimed to change that, though a major part of that will be recruiting next year's team.
We also took part in the Summer of Startups startup incubator program. It was a great platform for learning to talk about synthetic biology in layman's terms.
We also learned what it means to be a synthetic biology startup and we want spread that information onwards to people who are interested in trying that out.
Our major breakthrough was the concept of turning bacteria into superheroes.

Media
Making Finland Aware of Synthetic Biology
As a part of our aim to make people aware of synthetic biology, we tried to acquire visibility in media; both social and traditional. To be successful in media, we even had one team member allocated mainly to communications. While our main focus was in social media, we also contacted Finnish science magazines and local newspapers.

Zamorano,2014,Team:Zamorano#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," introduced some synthetic biology concepts. Advanced practices were conducted with elementary students, where they had the opportunity to practice with real synthetic biology applications.
In order to complement the education development in the Honduran context, we developed an educational model to improve awareness and criteria in Latin America about Synthetic Biology and modified living organisms. The academic program of Zamorano gives us the opportunity to pass through different modules, where each student puts in practice what they learn theoretically, solving problems and suggesting alternatives to stated problems. We designed a specific module focused in Synthetic Biology. More than 1000 students from all over Latin America will have the opportunity to learn and access technologies that will develop in them synthetic biology skills. The main objective of our model is to give the students new perspectives about biotechnology and synthetic biology, showing them the importance and the impact that acceptance from population will have in the development and growth of this technologies. This will be the first educational model of Synthetic Biology in Honduras, and we aim to promote and spread it in the Mesoamerican region.
The enactment of laws and regulations, and the establishment of committees, is an important component in the development of biotechnology and synthetic biology. The fact that the project involves working with living organisms makes it necessary to conduct biosafety practices, through the conduction of risk assessment before introducing a new organism or technology in the country. In order to demonstrate that Synthetic Biology can be safely practiced, we conducted a risk assessment of the Escherichia zamofordi, a synthetic bacterium created in Zamorano in collaboration with Stanford University, to detect copper residues in water sources. The risk assessment was conducted using the Latin American guide for Environmental Risk Assessment of genetically modified organisms (ERA).
There are many approaches to conduct an ERA. One is the ""Guidance of Environmental Risk Assessment"", developed by the Secretariat of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, as part of the Convention of Biological Diversity. The other approach is an ERA guide developed by a group of 14 Latin American regulators and biotechnologists. Our team has adopted the approach presented in the Latin American ERA guide, as the Honduran legislation regarding GMOs has been developed along the lines of other countries in Latin America such as Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Colombia; which already have experience in the deployment of GMOs.
With this science-based approach, we proved that our project, ""Know your enemy"", complies with established biosafety norms if handled according the relevant regulations.
As an alternate product, we propose this tool as a simpler alternative to elaborate consistent risk assessments for Synthetic Biology practices, complying with national and international biosafety regulations in Latin America.

This new experiment also shows that both induction with 10nM or 100nM of 3OC6-HSL cause the same decrease in O.D. value and that K112808 part alone (green lines) could grow like the negative control, demonstrating that the slow growth of  was actually due to leakage activity of .
Conclusions
We built up a new measurement system to characterize a particularly interesting lysis device, already present in the Registry.
The reported results show that the lysis device works as expected when gene expression of the lysis genes is triggered. The performed experiments showed a genetic instability of this device (which was expected because a complete expression system of lysis genes is introduced in E. coli): in one of four experiments lysis could not be induced (Experiment 2) and in all the other experiments after lysis induction in  cultures showed an O.D.600 decrease, followed by a fast increase, probably due to mutations in lysis expression system.

BBa_R0011 - Plac hybrid promoter
Description
The hybrid lac promoter (BBa_R0011) has been designed taking the Plambda promoter (BBa_R0051) and substituting its cI (BBa_C0051) binding sites with two lacI binding sites.
This promoter can be repressed by lacI (BBa_C0012), which can be repressed by lactose or IPTG, providing a lactose/IPTG inducible system. Differently from wild type lac promoter, this part does not have any CAP binding sites, so its behaviour is glucose-independent.
Even if lacI is not expressed in this BioBrick, strains bearing a genomic copy of lacI can repress this promoter, which acts as a glucose-independent lactose/IPTG sensor. In the other strains BBa_R0011 acts as a constitutive promoter.
Here we provide the characterization of this promoter in E. coli TOP10, which has a lacI genomic copy, constitutively expressed in a weak manner.

""E.coli Pen"": Draw with your own color.
Our team, KIT-Kyoto suggests an “E.coli Pen” as a new Art Tool. This brand-new pen uses no ink but medium in which genetically modified E.coli has been cultured. The Pen is able to express more than four colors in various intensities with single bacterial culture. This will be achieved by constructing plasmids carrying genes coding for four different fluorescent proteins under the control of seven promoters having different sensitivity to oxidative stress. The E.coli carrying these plasmids will produce different colors with various intensities by differentially responding to the gradient of hydrogen peroxide treatment. Different from previous passive BioArt in iGEM, the genetically engineered “E.coli Pen” provides an active and wonderful tool for us to purely enjoy the Art having a feeling for biotechnology.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#notebook 9_-_-_TEXT.html," with Soimort. Discuss ODE solver with Kun. Teaching junior students
how to write DB. Have fun working.
Summary: This is a crazy week for me! Together with Liao, we make huge modifications on the
structure of for at least 3 times! We change the xml structure for storing data, revise the
attributes on each item, and have heated debate on our standard of bio-modeling. At first the
modification process seems endless, but by the end of the week, we have come to agreement on
most of the details. This gives me a lot of hope, and this week has definitely been a big
leap for our DB. This time Liao finally realizes that we are actually making the next-
generation standard of SBML, haha. Settling a brand-new standard of bio-modeling has actually
become the core of our work. As far as I’m concerned, we have made 3 shifts on our goal, UI
-> simulation -> bio-modeling standard, this is poor goal-setting, we didn’t make a clear
map of what we are doing at the very beginning. I talk on DB and modeling with 2 junior
students, they are all confident and eager to learn, I think they can handle it properly very
soon. I just don’t have the time to talk with Soimort and Kun.

Plan: Write note on UI&input, discuss UI&input with Soimort. Discuss ODE solver with Kun.
Settle the final edition of DB. Writing DB of EPF-Lausanne with 2 junior students. Have fun
working.
Summary: Write a detailed note on UI&Input and discuss it with Soimort. I believe it is not
easy for him to understand the whole design of UI&Input and its connection with the database,
I should spend more time to explain the details for him. Kun says he has finished the L2V4
update of ODE solver, he is now working on the boolean value judging module which will be
used in Liao’s code. Liao’s first edition of document on DB standard is done, it’s now my
turn to refine it and fix the bugs. Zhengda He has written part of the DB of EPF-Lausanne

A three-stage algorithm is designed to solve the  problem (workflow is present in Figure 4):  A set of sequences that fold into the S1  structure at low temperature is found.  Sequences  that cannot fold into the S2 structure at the high temperature are screened out.  After these two stages, sequences meet the  structural requirement are obtained.  However,  regulation temperatures of the obtained sequences remain unmeasured.  The third stage is designed to screen RNATs to  meet the temperature requirement.
Figure 4.  Workflow  of designing an RNA thermometer
Verification of the designed RNATs’ secondary  structure
The first step in verification the in silico design is testing the designed structure in vitro.  In-line probing method is adapted to measure  the RNATs’ structure (10).   The results are as shown in Figure 5.
 
Figure 5  Result of the in-line probing.  The sequence of the RNAT is 5’-GAAUACAUGUUAAUUAUGCCAUCCAGGCAUACAGAAGAAGUUAAU-3’ and the regulation temperature of the RNAT is 39.5℃.  RNAT loaded in lane 1, 2, 3 was incubated at 46℃ for 20h, 26h and 32h.  RNAT loaded in lane 4, 5, 6 was incubated at 42℃ for 20h, 26h and 32h.  RNAT loaded in lane 7, 8, 9 was incubated at 37℃ for 20h, 26h and 32h.  The red boxes mark sections that melt when temperature rises.
When temperature rises, sections marked by the red boxes melt thus bands appear.  The results show strong evidence that the designed RNATs can fold into desired secondary structure.
 
Verification of the designed  RNATs’ temperature-sensing regulatory function
Then,  rectification of the temperature-response regulatory function in vivo should be taken in verification of the in silico design.  GFP is adapted as reporter gene in measuring  the RNATs’ temperature-response regulatory function.  The results are shown in Figure 6.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ).

Stage 3
The final stage of the collaboration was having the BostonU team test the final iteration of their chip design. Prior to visiting our lab, they were sent our Microfluidics 101 educational material, assembly protocols and chip usage protocols to review. This was in order to simulate the experience of a synthetic biologist using MARS to understand how our chips work.
Following this, their members practiced assembling and testing two existing microfluidic chips - PCR and DNA Digestion. Over the course of this they were able to feed back on the relevance of the educational material we had provided them with. This feedback was extremely valuable as it came from synthetic biologists with limited understanding of our hardware. Their feedback was noted and then integrated into our existing workflow. Finally, the BostonU Wetlab team assembled, tested and graded their chip design using a preliminary Fluid Functionality checklist. The results they gained through this testing, and the ability of the checklist to accurately represent the failures during the test, have been used to improve our grading system.
The chip design has since been added to the MARS Repository under “Fluorescence” and has been categorized as Quantification. For more information regarding the chip’s design and documentation, refer to its chip page on our Wiki.
Lead Assay Microfluidic | July - September 2017 | WPI iGEM
Our collaboration with WPI involved designing a microfluidic device that could perform a portion of their lead assay. This chip would use primitives designed by the BostonU Hardware team such as metering. Working on this chip emphasized the importance of coengineering microfluidics and synbio.
Stage 1
We first met the WPI iGEM team at NEGEM1, an event hosted by BostonU that invites New England iGEM teams to present their project plans and ideas to other teams. We discussed the potential for a collaboration between our two teams, and soon after we contacted each other via email. During our first Skype call we discussed some potential ideas for their collaboration. We decided that the goal of the collaboration would be to design a chip that could perform their lead assay. With this in mind, they sent us a PDF copy of their full protocol and we began planning a visit to BostonU. For more details regarding this assay, please visit the WPI iGEM team Wiki.

Reporter genes
One of the most fundamental parts required in a new chassi is a reporter gene. Unfortunately, some fluorescent proteins do not work well in Lactobacillus, possibly due to lower levels of internal pH in the cytosol.
One popular fluorescent protein that does work is mCherry. We have created a biobricked version of mCherry, BBa_K1033250 codon optimized for Lactobacillus reuteri, however it should work well in most species in the Lactobacillus genus. The gene has been modified in accordance with the Freiburgh fusion standard 25. Because of time constraints we have not yet had time to characterise it but it has been used in non-biobrick format by other researchers with positive results

Chromoproteins in Lactobacillus
There are many things we take for granted when working with bacteria such as E. coli. An initial problem when learning to work with Lactobacillus is to simply be able to do successful transformations of plasmids, something that is more difficult and cumbersome to do compared to E. coli.  To see if you have been able to master a transformation with Lactobacillus some basic reporter genes that reflects visible light makes the validation process a lot easier.

C4 Carboxylate Antiporter DcuB
Under anaerobic conditions E. coli cells use different alternative electron acceptors instead of oxygen. Partially the bacteria use fumarate respiration, whereby fumarate is reduced into succinate. There are also other potential less-oxidizing substances for bacteria to release their electrons, for example anorganic compounds like nitrate (NO3-) or sulfate (SO42-).( Gottschalk et al., 1986 ) Fumarate respiration leads to succinate excretion through the C4 carboxylate transporter DcuB. It is an antiporter which exchanges fumarate against succinate under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic condition there is usually no succinate release observed. In connection to the carbon dioxide fixation in our second module we planned on working under oxygen limiting conditions, hence effective carbon dioxid fixation is possible. So in case of oxygen limiting conditions, there could occured partial fumarate respiration in E. coli. Besides there was shown activity of DcuB antiporter in the presence of high fumarate concentrations ( Janausch, 2001 ). To achieve an effective electron uptake and prevent any succinate excretion, the C4 carboxylate antiporter DcuB has to be knocked out in our E. coli strain.
We planned a targeted knockout of the dcuB gene in E. coli KRX using the Genebridge Red/ET-System . In the same step we are going to integrate the outer membrane porine OprF ( BBa_K1172507 ) into the bacterial chromosome under controll of a constitutive promotor ( BBa_J23104 ). This ensure the permeability of the outer membrane and avoid a plasmid overload of the bacteria, because for our system the outer membrane porines are indispensable.
Cytochromes
Besides the intention of using a mediator for indirect electron transfer we additionally focused on the electron transfer via cytochromes. Although the exact mechanism of electron transfer by cytochromes is not clarified up to now there are a few basic approaches that indicate which ones could have an important function. The basic idea of this attempt is to bring a periplasmatic cytochrome which is essential for electron uptake in E. coli and use it as an intermediate electron acceptor."

Our key partners
All our partnerships were made to continue our venture, and push it forward after the iGEM contest. As soon as we had identified our vision, we established a very strong partnership with the Belgian Defense (the Military Hospital). Throughout our whole venture we keep in touch and exchanged our result and strategy. This allowed us to design something in regard to the final potential application. They were also part of our round table event at the European Parliament. We will do a large kick-off meeting with them right after the iGEM competition to establish the next steps. We also conclude a strong partnership with the Belgian Red Cross, they helped us to better define the problem we try to solve, and helped to to organize our field trip.
We conducted several meeting with key leaders and potential customers/user. We were helped by the entrepreneurs we met to create a strong pitch. We pitched many partners and sponsors to get money from it. We organized a Skype with Andreas Hougaard Laustsen, PhD, Associate Professor (DTU ) Technical University of Denmark) & Serial Biotech Entrepreneur. He gave us advices to better adapt our approach to the European GMO regulation. We also organized a skype meeting with Jordane Dimidschstein, PhD and Group Leader at Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. We explain us the next step about the preclinical studies and the toxicity test that we will have to manage. We met Thibault Helleputte, PhD and CEO & Founder of DNAlytics. He gave explained us the regulatory path to undergoes and gave us the specific contact to the right institutions. We were helped by Philip Hemme, the CEO & Founder of LaBiotech.eu to find our speakers for our Biotech4Change event, he also put us in touch with Deep Science Venture, a life-science incubator. Beside all these specifics meetings, we also had very enriching continuous feedbacks from our advisory board.
Beside those partnerships, we got in touch with the Ann Van Gysel, PhD and CEO & Founder Turnstone. We contacted her on the behalf of Philip Hemme to moderated our Round Table. As for our other partnerships we built a long terme relation and we have the common vision to organise other sessions.

These promoter + fluorescent protein BioBricks have been characterised following transformation into Escherichia coli and induction by potassium nitrate using methods such as flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and scanning with a fluorometer. The data from these experiments has proved that our promoter works as we expected it to. We have also transfected M-B + eCFP into a human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, and have proved the system is flexible and can be used in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
We believe the promoters we have produced have relevant uses in cancer therapeutics, soil fertilisation and detection of emissions from industries such as construction.

The University of East Anglia hosts many research teams whose work focuses on studying nitrogenous species and the way in which bacteria use and modify those species. One major problem that is faced by these teams involves working with nitric oxide (NO), as NO is highly reactive with a low half life, therefore making it difficult to trace and quantitatively measure accurately. Many of the methods currently used to measure NO levels are unable to distinguish between homogenous species, such as nitrates (NO3) and nitrites (NO2),"

Irritating corrosive substances（i.e. Highly corrosive acid: sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid. Strong alkili: sodium hydroxide, aqueous ammonia)
When these types of substances accidentally drop on your skin, wipe out the substance first and flush the infected area with water.
The reason is that for example concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with water to emit a large quantity of heat and hence washing the affected area with water directly might lead to burning injury. Therefore, wiping out dry first and then flush with water.
Toxic chemical substances (Deadly substance via inhalation: mercury, cyanide, Khun compound, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide etc.)
If the devices containing mercury is broken, do not touch it without protection. All lab members should be evacuated and maintain the room with good ventilation.
Personnel dealing with mercury spills should wear a hat, mask, gloves; you can use a rigid paper roll, tin foil, tape, moist cotton swab to collect the mercury; place it in a sealed bottle; cover its surface with glycerine liquid.                             When the droplet is too little, cover these droplets with sulfur and convert them into mercuric sul-fide. Leave it with few hours and do the cleaning.
Biochemical reagents dye (such as agarose gel EB, dimethyl yellow)
Due to the toxicity of ethidium bromide, we should first purify the EB solution before the                             disposal after an experiment.

NAU-CHINA,2018,Team:NAU-CHINA#testwsq_-_-_TEXT.html," the reverse efficiency of Bxb1 recombinase is higher than TP901 recombinase under the same promoter strength and recombinase concentration. However, if the concentration of recombinase is low, there is no significant difference in fluorescence intensity. The results of the image C show that Bxb1 and TP901 recombinases have a threshold property. So, the proportion of fluorescent cells have a jump discontinuity between low concentration and high concentration of recombinase.
Functional verification of Ubc-Bxb1 recombinase-RDF in HEK 293T cell
Fig.9. Bxb1 recombinase-RDF can recognize and reverse the sequence between recognition sites
(A)Schematic diagram of RDF function verification experiment
(B) The image under fluorescence microscope for 293T cells, transfected with plasmids containing the recombinase-RDF recognition sites (left panel) or transfected with plasmids containing corresponding recombinase-RDF gene together (right panel), are shown.
The results show that the recombinase-RDFs can recognise the sites and reverse the sequence between sites in HEK 293T.
Conclusion
We verified the functions of most parts and most upstream and downstream paths step by step. We verified the function of synNotch, the inhibition of tetR after modification, the reversal function and threshold characteristics of some recombinases and promoter combinations. However, due to the time constraints, we are unable to complete verification of TEV and the combinations of some recombinases and promoters. Moreover, the combination of upstream and downstream circuits needs to be verified by experiments. We will carry out supplementary experiments in the future to carry out a complete experimental verification of our subject.
Future experiments
In a short period of one year, it is not easy to fully realize such a complex idea. Therefore, we have envisaged the next series of experiments to further realize our project idea, combining the idea of continuous feedback between modeling and wet lab to ensure the best system.
1. Optimized functional verification of TEV suppressing tetR Inhibition
As mentioned earlier, since the reporter gene selected GFP, our experimental results are not intuitive. We will replace the reporter gene with RFP to solve this problem.
2. Verification of the combinations of remaining recombinases and promoters
We plan to continue the experiment of remaining combinations that have not yet been verified in order to verify the function and threshold characteristics of these combinations of recombinases and compare the inversion efficiency of recombinases.
3. Construction of a fully functional stable cell line combining upstream and downstream circuits
We plan to finally construct our parts"

[Fig 8]
The lack of a distinct peak here indicates no initiation of blood coagulation, showing that an amplification step is effective.
Promoter Leakage
For this set of simulations, we tried to determine the amount of hirudin produced for a negative test (no Cruzipain) and a positive test. As a biosensor and a diagnostic, it is important that there is a large difference between a negative and positive result. Furthermore, it is important that a negative test does not produce enough hirudin to stop blood coagulation.
This time, we assume all the DNA to be initially unrepressed, as that will give the highest leakage. The initial conditions are:
50 nM of DNA
100 nM of TetR dimer
360 pM of Cruzipain (Positive Test) and 0 pM of Cruzipain (Negative Test)
30 nM of RNAP
30 nM of Ribosomes

TUe Master Introduction
29-08-17
This year the TUe organized a Master Kick-off to welcome all new Master students, this includes foreign Master students as well as Dutch Master students. During this Kick-off, which is a three day event, students will get to know each other, the master’s degree program and they had the opportunity to network with some high-tech companies in the area.
During one of these days the faculty of Biomedical Engineering also had the chance to welcome their new Master students. We as an iGEM team gave a presentation about the iGEM competition in general and also our project, to give the new students an idea of the possibilities to join a student team in the area of synthetic biology.
RIVM Biotech Fair
07-10-17
During the Weekend of Science, the RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) also participated with the ‘Kennisparade’. People could come by to learn more about public health and the environment by visiting presentations and exhibits. For the children, a lab was set up where they could do some small experiments and also an exhibition was present to show people what biotech is and what you can do with it.
At this fair we wanted to raise awareness about the use of GMOs. We did this by showing people several products and asking them whether they thought that GMOs played a role in the production of these products or if GMOs were present in them. Most of the people were surprised that GMOs were already present in several production processes, for example the production of insulin. It was very interesting to talk to people about their opinion about GMOs and also very nice to be able to learn them something new.

It is fine to run the gel slower than this but do not run it any faster. Above 5V/cm the agarose may heat up and begin to melt with disastrous effects on your gel's resolution. If the leads have been attached correctly, bubbles should be generated at the anode and cathode.
Run the gel until the loading dye has migrated an appropriate distance(~ 2/3 the length of gel) through the gel.

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," is measured at 340 nm.
As the graphs show, this verification was successful and indicates that NodB was refolded properly and is present in its active form.  We are thankful for the advise Prof. Dr. Bruno Moerschbacher (also see  integrated Human Practices ) gave us concerning NodB purification and the recommendation to use the acetic acid assay kit from Megazyme. After successfully purifying NodB, we would appreciate having the opportunity to share our results with his research group and eventually optimize our purification process. The many reaction steps of the kit result in somewhat inaccurate data. Additionally, we would need to try different acetic acid assay kits to evaluate the best one for our purpose. The measurement of background from NodB interaction with the assay reactions is another control, which is needed to be measured to complete our calculation.
At some point in the future, mass spectrometry is another point that has to be tackled as well. Retrospectively, hoping to achieve even better purification results, we would like to try to express nodB in colder conditions for about 40 hours  [3] . The expression at lower temperatures enables us to express nodB without the need of refolding from inclusion bodies.
COD -Vibrio Cholerae
Introduction
In order to bring more variability in our produced chitosans, we decided to implement a second chitin deacetylase. Because of its bacterial origin, we picked COD isolated from the gram-negative organism Vibrio cholerae O1 biovar El Tor str. N16961  [10] . It is not part of its pathogenic activity. During our conversation with Professor Moerschbacher, he informed us that the expression of COD in E. coli has been successfully performed by himself and his group. In addition, it was already proven that both NodB and COD could be expressed in the same organism  [2] .
The cod gene is 1296 base pairs long and translates into a hydrolase with a molecular weight of approximately 45.5 kDa  [2] .
The enzyme works optimally in surroundings with a pH of 8 and temperatures reaching 45 °C  [2]   [4] .
As mentioned before, deacetylases target different units in a chitin molecule. Which unit is deacetylated depends on the chosen enzyme. In the case of COD, the second position from the non-reducing end is de"

The Problem
Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) causes severe illness in over a quarter of a million people each year in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011), costing us billions of dollars worldwide in food recalls and treatment (Russo and Johnson, 2003).  From the developing world to North America and Europe, we frequently experience EHEC outbreaks in our water (Okeke, 2009), food (Mermin and Griffin, 1999), and beef (Cross, 2012), causing deaths, hospitalizations, massive economic losses and an overall loss of consumer confidence in food safety. These bacteria normally live peacefully in the gut of cattle, but when they are present in the water, vegetables or meat that we eat, they can result in illness and even death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Because of these dangers, water treatment stations and slaughter houses regularly test for EHEC. Standard industry tests use cell culture and PCR as gold standard techniques but these take between 18 to 40 hours to give a result (Junillon et al., 2012). On top of being time-consuming, current detection only provides data for EHEC levels in samples of meat well after the cattle has been processed. Pre-screening techniques could act earlier and be a promising in preventing the distribution of contaminated meat and reducing the spread of EHEC into water and food supplies.
In the cattle population less than 10% of animals produce more than 95% of the EHEC produced by the all cattle (Chase-Topping et"

1SBa_F2003: Business Plan
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
A business plan will help to understand whether or not the business is feasible in terms of costs and profits.
Once the plan is complete, it can be compared to existing products or businesses to understand and justify why this is a better option.
Limitations
It can be a time consuming task to generate a business plan.
Not all of the important costs and factors may have been considered; if this is wrong, the entire business initiative could fail.

TAS_Taipei,2017,Team:TAS Taipei#Experimental Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," negative control BBa_E0240 (GFP-generator) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth overnight. GFP-generator was used as a negative control because it does not express PR. The cultures were centrifuged, resuspended in distilled water to remove LB broth, and diluted to standardize bacterial population. Then, the cultures were mixed with CC-AgNP solution and shaken at 120 rpm. Every hour (for a total of 5 hours), one tube from each group was centrifuged at 4500 rpm to isolate the supernatant. At this speed, we observed that nearly all bacteria (and bound CC-AgNPs) were pulled down into the pellet while free CC-AgNPs remained in the supernatant, which was measured using a spectrophotometer at 430 nm.
Figure 2-6 Proteorhodopsin traps CC-AgNPs. A) Absorbance of the supernatant decreased markedly when PR bacteria was added to CC-AgNPs; the absorbance did not change significantly when GFP-Gen (negative control) bacteria was added. B) Over the 5 hour period, we observed a large orange region (aggregated CC-AgNPs) in the PR group. Experiment & Figure: Justin Y.
Over 5 hours, we found that absorbance values of the supernatant decreased much faster when PR bacteria was added, while the absorbance did not change significantly when GFP-generator bacteria was added (figure 2-6A). In addition, after centrifugation, we saw dark orange regions in the pellet of PR bacteria, but not in the GFP-generator bacteria (figure 2-6B). CC-AgNP solution is yellow in color, which suggests that the orange regions observed in the PR pellet are aggregated CC-AgNPs. In summary, our results suggest that PR is able to bind CC-AgNPs.
Using data from this experiment, our modeling team determined the rate at which PR binds to CC-AgNPs, a constant which was integrated into their model. Learn more about it here!
BIOFILM
Our biofilm approach was originally inspired by the ability of jellyfish mucus to bioaccumulate gold NPs (AuNPs) and quantum dots through electrostatic interactions (Patwa et al. 2015). A biofilm is a community of microbes embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which consist of different polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids (Donlan 2002). Recent studies show that the"

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Modeling#PAM Flexibility_-_-_TEXT.html," is determined, based on the clustering of the scores by PAM. Mutants highly specific for a particular PAM will be tested in the lab as they are good candidates for Cas9 mutants with altered PAM specificity.
Engineering Pipeline
Combining these steps together, the overall approach to identifying possible mutants for new PAM variants is:
Start with the pdb with crystal structure data for spCas9 bound to the target DNA
Modify the amino acid sequence of the PDB. Mutants will be generate based on the location and amino acid substitution data from Kleinstiver et al., as well as known biochemical properties of the amino acid being mutated.
Once a mutant has been generated, a full set of pdbs with the 64 or 256 different PAM variants will be created for each mutant.
The DNA sequence is docked to the PI domain using PyRosetta, with scores being tracked over multiple runs.
Scores are averaged and mutant specificity to different PAM sequences is determined, based on the clustering of the scores by PAM.
Mutants highly specific for a particular PAM will be tested in the lab.
Model Validation
The first test of our proposed pipeline was to determine if we could reproduce the PAM specificity of wild type spCas9 in silico. The pdb file was run against all 64 possible 3 nucleotide pams. The results of the initial scoring can be seen below.
PAM binding scores for wild type and NGAG-binding Cas9. Empirical scores were derived from literature and molecular scores simulated with PyRosetta. Linear fits show a non-random relation between empirical and molecular scores.
A PyMOL generated image of wild type spCas9. The PAM domain is in yellow, the double-stranded PAM sequence is in blue, and the sgRNA is in red.
The docking scorings of wildtype spCas9 in PyRosetta to the 64 PAM variants
A modification that was made to our intial procedure was to reduce the size of the Cas9-sgRNA-DNA model. Instead of including the entire Cas9 structure, the PDB file was modified to include only the region of the Cas9 structure where interaction between Cas9 and the PAM site occurred. This caused each docking simulation to take less than 100 seconds to run, as opposed to over 1000 seconds with the full model, allowing us to greatly increase our throughput in determining Cas9 mutants of interest.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". ? gave us two important information. The first is when it comes to the biological legalization, an automatic cell factory is forbidden to use antibiotics which is usual in laboratory work. As a result, they have                     to concentrate and separate the solution in order to sustain the recombination strains account for the majority of total strains. This is the central concern of our project. He also pointed out that the most common degradation happens                     when plasmids unequally distribute in cell cycles to let normal bacteria with less burden replace the recombination strains and resulting in the declination of total production.
Prof. Yang Dong
Chinese society of biochemistry and molecular biology
Beijing normal university
After reading numerous papers,we came up with the first idea of self-control system consisting of a series of genes collaboration, and discussed with prof. Yang. In spite of her appreciation of the sophisticate network we designed, she                     regretfully denied its feasibility. Prof. Yang pointed out that a truly valuable plan for practical use must be concise because when we introduce heterologous genes, we add to more variables at the same time, which will greatly increase                     the probability of our potential failure.
But during the discussion, we came to an agreement that fermentation incubator could be considered as a natural field of natural selectivity. In this theory, the core reason of strain degradation is the strain without recombination plasmids                     or the mutated strains could get rid of the burden of heterologous protein while maintaining the same ability to absorb nutrition and growth. As a result, the recombination strains were gradually eliminated in this competition.
This discussion lighted our another inspiration. Since the recombination strains can get growth advantage by losing heterologous genes, maybe it is possible for us to make recombination strains’ growth velocity overcome the normal, and                     reach the target of maintaining genes by converting the evolution direction.
After consulting to the papers, we decided to use TGATG linkage between two genes as our final project.
Bluepha
Dr. Li Teng, CEO
Dr. Li suggested two potential areas about the application of our project. The first is an automatic cell factory that can select beneficial mutations. He also suggested engineering regulatory parts to make the self-screening system capable                     of applying to different substrate and desired products.
We discussed with chief information official Dr. Li model analyzing. He suggested that we can competition model for prediction of sequence candidate performance during screening. The talk inspired us a lot for how to convert our project                     into an application, especially in modeling and designing.

This is a fusion protein of Thioredoxin (BBa_K2382004) and MSMEG_5998 (BBa_K2382001). The ability of degrading aflatoxin is better than MSMEG_5998 alone.
Thioredoxin-FGD fusion protein ( BBa_K2382015 )
This is a fusion protein of Thioredoxin (BBa_K2382004) and FGD (BBa_K2382002).
FOR TEST STRIP
Anti-aflatoxin scFv (with start codon) ( BBa_K2382007 )
This is the single chain variable fragment (scFv) of an antibody that have ability of binding aflatoxin. This part basically shares the same sequence with BBa_K2382011, except for a start codon ATG at the beginning.
6X His tag (Codon optimized) ( BBa_K2382008 )
This part is a codon optimized 6X His tag for E.coli.
Anti-aflatoxin scFv ( BBa_K2382011 )
This is the single chain variable fragment (scFv) of an antibody that have ability of binding aflatoxin. Since bacteria cannot produce the whole antibody, we decide use scFv to replace it. It contains two polypeptide chains linked by a GS linker.
EAAAK rigid linker ( BBa_K2382012 )
A rigid linker that links two proteins to form one fusion protein. It repeats amino acids EAAAK three times to maintain distance of two proteins and preventing from interrupting each other while folding.
RFP with EAAAK linker and His Tag ( BBa_K2382013 )
This is a fragment of BBa_K2382010. We designed a restriction site, BamHI, before EAAAK rigid linker, so future iGEM teams could take advantage of this part to fuse their proteins with RFP as indicator.
This is also an improvement of previous BioBrick Part (BBa_E1010). It encodes an RFP that have the same amino acids as BBa_E1010 and having a His Tag at the end. Therefore, a fusion protein with this part may have red color and the ability to be purified easily.
RFP without barcode ( BBa_K2382014 )
This part encodes a RFP that has the same amino acids as BBa_E1010. The barcode of BBa_E1010 is removed, so this part does not contain stop codon"

Communication With PKU
Six representatives of Tianjin University iGEM 2016 Team arrived Peiking University on a rainy afternoon of 19th August and  had a long lovely dicussion meeting with three other teams, Beijing Institute of Technology(Team BIT-China),University of Chinese Academy of Science(Team UCAS) and the ebullient host, Peiking University iGEM team. On the very beginning of the meeting, each team leader gave a brief introduction on their projects. And team Tianjin's project attracted great interests in the environment problem of PET-degradation. After each team's presentation, we started to share our new ideas and problems we crossed with during the experiment, which was a very helpful and encouraging session where we help each other fix the experimental problems. In a nutshell, this short trip to Beijing is a win-win collaboration.
Human Practive for Questionnaire Collaboration
We team Tianjin contacted Team Pasteur , Team Pittsburgh , Team Valencia UPV , Team Virginia and Team NTU about the collaboration in July. Then we established and led a survey union with the support of them. We asked each team submit two or three questions about their own project and one question about synthetic biology or iGEM, and integrated the questions to the final version questionnaire.
Then, we posted it on twitter and facebook, many iGEMers participated in it and many iGEM teams reposted it on their homepage. We are very delighted to see their enthusiasm which encourages us a lot!

SYSU-CCiC MEETING
It was a great honor to be invited to SYSU-CCiC meeting organized by Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) to share iGEM experiences with other teams. CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) is a national iGEM seminar held by Chinese universities, aiming to promote the communication of Chinese iGEM teams and publicize the conception of synthesis biology.
On the morning of September 2, 2016, we took a flight to Guangzhou from Tianjin. One hour later, we arrived at SYSU. Upon our registration, we exchanged ideas with some teams. At 7 pm, the opening ceremony began and each team made a brief introduction. In the following two days, we simulated the process of iGEM Giant Jamboree, presenting team projects and posters.
At 5 pm of September 4,2016, the seminar was coming to a close. We took a photo together as a reminder. After dinner, we attended the closing ceremony"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

WashU_StLouis,2016,Team:WashU StLouis#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board, the governing body encouraging sustainable farming practices in our area. They invited us to one of their monthly board meetings, where they commented on the usefulness of our project. The crux of excess nitrate runoff isn’t agriculture, they said. Instead pet waste and other urban runoff can contribute a surprising amount of pollutants that aren’t as heavily publicized. As for the runoff that does occur from plants, the popularized notion of “industrial farms” spraying millions of gallons of fertilizer isn’t necessarily true. Most farms in the midwest are privately owned and operated they said, and it is entirely possible to get these farmers to adopt practices that they believe can mitigate runoff. While a GMO may be useful, they thought it wasn’t the only option, and certainly not the most effective.
Next, we reached out to the Missouri Coalition for the Environment. They are a small nonprofit organization that educates farmers on sustainable practices and lobbies for legislation to minimize ecological pollution. Opposed to GMOs, they advocated for other sustainable methods of providing fertilizers to crops – most poignantly, the unused resource of livestock manure that is plentiful in the midwest. They noted that there is little movement in the local and federal legislature to slow the growth of the agricultural companies that pollute the most – therefore the MCE travels all over the country to lobby for the reforms they promote. From this experience, we learned that the runoff crisis stretches further than simply a dearth of new agricultural technologies. While we were still motivated by this original application of our research, we began to seek out new venues for its use.
Industry
Finally, we sought out advisors who could comment on the use of our supercells beyond an agricultural setting. We wanted to know how ATP overproduction could specifically be utilized to produce recombinant proteins, improve cell growth, etc. We began by visiting Monsanto, whose largest research facilities are centered about St. Louis. There, we spoke with over a dozen scientists about our super cells and received comments about potential applications. One suggestion was that our cells could output ATP in a reactor for other cells’ use. In a way, our cells could act as a source of fuel for ATP-intensive processes in other cells. A scientist also suggested we search for ferredoxin and flavodoxin via a spectroscopy analysis. While our lab was not equipped for the method he suggested, we were inspired to use our spectrometer to get a rudimentary idea of ferredoxin and flavodoxin concentrations.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Bacterial Beauty: the Art of Science
Artist Leen van Wijngaarden was fascinated by the colors and shapes of bacterial colonies and decided to make art with them. Not just a pretty picture on a regular agar plate (like this well-known example ), but on a large scale. This should produce nice paintings, which keep evolving. The results were to be exposed during the culture festival ""The Night of Art and Science"" .

Bacterial Beauty meets iGEM
The iGEM team met Leen at the right time: from helping with the setup, iGEM got a bigger role in the project and started to design their own drawings. Because of the microbiological background of many team members, we could help Leen not only during the making of the pictures, but we could also take the oppurtunity to teach the visitors of the Night about the beauty of bacteria, their use, synthetic biology and our project.
But there is more...
Apart from exposing the bio-paintings and the huge ""bio-billboard"", time lapse movies of bacteria growing on a normal plate and microscopic images of bacteria were shown. Furthermore, in aid of explaining about synthetic biology, our team showed some paintings with an overview of our project.
As an extra feature, a ""bacterial wall of fame"" was built, with handprints of ""famous people from Groningen"" was made. People, including some iGEM members, had pressed their hands on agar plates,"

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," The pupils work on a self-chosen project and present their results at regional levels and later at a national contest to an expert jury. Some winners of this competition were invited to Aachen and visited different scientific places. We organized a presentation and a tour through the laboratory for them. It was inspiring to see, what an immense interested and advanced knowledge about science they have already have.
After the presentation, we had a chance to talk about our project and the iGEM competition.
It was amazing to be able to enthuse these promising young people further for synthetic biology.
Writing Competition
In the German society knowledge about synthetic biology is not very widespread: we found out that the possibilities for people to inform themselves about synthetic biology are very limited which causes a mostly negative attitude towards this subject. Many are sceptical and focused more on the dangers than the possibilities. That’s why we wanted to give especially young people an exciting opportunity to get in touch with synthetic biology via a writing and arts competition - submissions of all group of ages were welcomed. Participants were encouraged to deal with aspects of synthetic biology in a creative way and express how they feel about it. Combining their great ideas with this topic led to amazing stories, which built a bridge between the scientific society and open minded people who were inspired to create their own opinion about synthetic biology.
The winner in our iGEM writing competition 2016 was Hannah Lanzrath with her story titled “14. Oktober 2044”.
Figure 4: Prize for the best story.

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html," species, which might become an increasingly relevant discussion as climate change threatens future generations. It is often explicited by Mars colonization front runners such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. According to Olivia Solon, Elon Musk argues that ""Humans must prioritise the colonisation of Mars so the species can be conserved in the event of a third world war"" (Solon, 2018), He furthermore states that the Moon is not far enough from Earth to make sure that it will survive if something should make the earth inhabitable (Solon, 2018). Hawking is equally worried about the future of our species as he states that humanity has to become a multiplanetary species within the next hundred years, in order to prevent extinction (Fecht, 2017). Though it might seem obvious that the survival of our species is a weighty topic, it might not be very central in the daily life of most people. As we have seen with the last forty years of activists and scientist trying to convince people to make actual changes in their lives in order to prevent damaging our planet, most people are not very oriented towards changing their behavior for long term purposes. Therefore this is an argument that might be convincing in terms of intellectual decicion-making, but also might not convince normal people to invest in the project. The argument says implicitly that the human species should be concerned with long term survival and even though that might seem obvious to many people, it could also be questioned. It is quite normal for a lot of species to extinct at some point, we (humanity) have been the course of many species extinction historically - so maybe it is ok that we will not be here forever. While the argument might be intellectually convincing to people who already is accepting the premise that the (very long term) survival of the human species are important and that Mars can function as a new planetary home, it might not make them donate significant amounts of money or vote for a more Mars positive politician.
2. The second argument is answering the claim ""We should colonize Mars"" with the ground ""It is the next step for humanity"", thereby the warrant is ""We want to take humanity to the next step"". This argument is concerned with scientific development and development as a species. It is often more or less implicit and also sometimes links to an argument that implies that going to Mars will enable technological innovation.The argument is e.g. found on the popular spaceblog Astronotes, according to them ""Mars is the next big colonisation step. We've been to the Moon, and there are plans for the Moon in the future, however Mars"

Université Catholique de Louvain
Located in Belgium, at a crossroads between Europe’s major capitals, The Catholic University of Louvain (UCLouvain for short) is headquartered in Louvain-la-Neuve, about 30 km south of Brussels. The town, created in 1971 by the university,           offers a unique living environment. It boasts innovative architecture, a town center entirely free from motor traffic with a variety of social and cultural activities. The university also has six other sites in Brussels and Wallonia.
Ranked 153rd in the 2017-2018 QS ranking of the world's universities, UCLouvain ranks first among the French-speaking universities in Belgium. Founded in 1425, UCLouvain is one of the oldest universities in Europe. Erasmus, Mercator,           Vesalius           are some of the personalities who attended her. Georges Lemaître formulated his Big Bang theory and Christian de Duve was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1974.
