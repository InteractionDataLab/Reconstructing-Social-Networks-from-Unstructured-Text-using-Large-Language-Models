Allow to stand on ice for 10 minutes
Place two electro-cuvette in their wrappers into ice (ensure that the cuvettes do not touch the ice as this could cause sparking)
Mark one cuvette for DNA and one for Control, and add the cells respectively
Before electroporating, use a kimwipe to be sure the cuvettes are completely dry on all sides and bottom
Electroporate at 12.5 kV/cm (pulse number = 10, pulse interval = 500 ms)
Add 1mL of MRS broth to each cuvette for recovery, pipette up and down gently to mix
Transfer the recovery solutions into two separate 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
Place the tubes in 37 degrees for 3 hours
Plate the cells on MRS plates with 8ug/mL erythromycin
Determining erythromycin concentration to allow for growth of L. brevis transformed with pIB184, and inhibit competing bacterial growth
In order to determine the appropriate erythromycin (antibiotic) concentration required for optimal growth of L. brevis, MRS agar plates of a range of concentrations were created. MRS agar favours the growth of Lactobacilli.
A 7% solution was made using MRS agar powder and dH2O
The solution was heated (medium heat) and stirred until homogenous.
The solution was autoclaved for 15 min.
After the solution cooled down (was only slightly warm) erythromycin powder was added to create MRS- erythromycin of concentrations 4 ug/ml, 8 ug/ml, and 12 ug/ml.
Solution was poured into plates.
Two 100uL aliquots of electrocompetent L. brevis cells were recovered (no electroporation) into 5mL of MRS broth.
After 3hr incubated at 30C, it was concentrated (centrifugation and removal of supernatant) and then plate onto the 3 different Ery
concentrations (one plate each).
All plates incubated at 33C for overnight.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," regarding questions. The talks themselves were given in a big room with a great atmosphere, a little reminiscent of a theater, with very comfortable chairs and a several storage gallery.
The presentations started out great and many interesting talks were given, most of them focused on foundational science. The food we got in the breaks was very tasty and together with a nice big coffee, we were ready for the next speakers. When the talks were over everyone met in the lobby and then wandered around looking at the different posters, asking questions and taking notes.
Over the course of four days the conference offered talks and presentations from all corners of the synbio field, ranging from research results and new techniques to ethics, jurisdiction and safety issues. We had the opportunity to talk to many different people, including Drew Endy, Megan Palmer, Tobias Erb, John Glass and the iGEM Headquarter.
❮
❯
We even organized a small meet-up with three other iGEM Teams attending the conference. There we presented our projects to each other and also to interested people, like Richard Kitney from imperial college, who gave us great feedback on our project and our presentational style.
Singapore
But the conference itself wasn’t the only place you could connect with interesting minds. After the talks and the poster sessions, we set out to explore the city and its culture together with a few other people from various countries. From Chinatown and little India to the botanical garden and Orchard Road, this city does not fail to amaze. In the evening we enjoyed the exotic food and talked about the presentations we were most interested in and the possible future of the field.
❮
❯
The last two days were especially exciting, since we had the opportunity, to attend two big dinner events in the name of synthetic biology that celebrated the launch of the SynBio LEAP program and the great success of the SB7.
In the end, Singapore was an amazing chance for us to learn, to network and to grow, not only as individuals but as a team.
Labvolution
From May 16th to 18th  one of Europe's largest laboratory equipment trade fairs, the ""Labvolution"", took place in Hannover. There, companies from all over the world came together to present their latest accomplishments in improving as well as revolutionizing laboratory equipment. Because we think it is of paramount importance to look at and be open to new ideas, this was an event we could not miss! So, six of us took a train-ride to Hannover, which is roughly 3 hours away from Duesseldorf.

Tec-Monterrey_EKAM,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
As useful a tool as synthetic biology is proving to be, it undeniably raises certain concerns for the possible hazards it could bring about in biological systems. Even with the proper biosafety guidelines implemented adequately in research laboratories, the break out of a rogue microorganism is a clear and present threat, especially if pathogenic strains’ potential for bioterrorism is considered. Countries should have the ability to respond quickly and solidly to any microbial outbreak that might occur in the future. An international organization with first-rate specialists dedicated to preserving humanity’s general immunologic welfare should be able to accurately respond to an epidemic by creating effective recombinant vaccines with a minimal response time through biotechnological methods, such as the one used by Dr. José Manuel Aguilar Yáñez for the influenza AH1N1 virus in response to the 2009 outbreak.
As for iGEM, de-activation switches could be developed to be attached to potentially dangerous parts so that they are destroyed or rendered inactive if they are placed outside the laboratory environment. For example, light degradation or perhaps auxotrophy represent potential tools that could be used to keep synthetic biological activity in tight control.

For the wet lab session, the participants were divided into smaller groups and they got to do several experiments such as restriction digestion, gel electrophoresis and beta-galactosidase assay.Through this workshop, we hoped that the participants could gain better insight on both iGEM and synthetic biology. We also wished that in the future, they would continuously explore their interests on both of the above subjects and live up the spirit of synthetic biology.
Education
This year, we had the opportunity to cooperate with an international school in Hong Kong to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to high school students. We had roughly around 30 students from The Independent Schools Foundation Academy (ISF Academy) visiting our school. They were grade 10 students who will be determining their IB subjects in November. The school was eager to expose these students into various areas of studies to allow them to explore their field of interest. Our team’s goal was to introduce these students to synthetic biology as the newly emerging field of in biological study and to give those potential future scientists some inspiration.We delivered a talk to the students introducing the basic concept behind synthetic biology and its real-life applications, as well as the iGEM competition and this year’s project “Finding Pneumo”. We explained the principle behind our construct, and it was pleasing to see the students’ enthusiasm to learn. In fact, we were surprised how much they understood considering they were only grade 10 students in high school! After the talk, we invited students to visit our lab, giving them a look of how a synthetic biology lab in university looks like. Moreover, we prepared a few small lab experiments such as gel electrophoresis and streaking plates for them to try out some hands-on wet lab experience.
Fig 3. Interaction with ISF Academy students
Interacting with these high school students was a lot of fun for our team. We saw their enthusiasm and passion in learning new things. We hoped this workshop would inspire the young generation to pursue and further develop the field of synthetic biology in the future.

Networking
While researching together is not only important but fun, the pleasures of networking should not fall too short.
This summer we enjoyed the privilege to be hosts to two other teams, one being team Wageningen which sent a representative on 2016-06-08. By this, we got the chance to have a personal glimpse on their project and to present ours the first time in front of another iGEM team. We had a lot of fun together exchanging ideas and talking about the iGEM competition!
The other team was team Aachen on the 2016-09-23. We invited them for a BBQ after we got to know each other on the iGEM Meet Up Germany on which we sparked each other’s interests in our projects. While having a great time talking about the innovations we had taken in our projects we got the time for chatting about milder hindrances, mostly in practical work. After some troubleshooting we had, it was made clear that networking is an important part of the iGEM competition.
We appreciate the great days we spent together. ❤
Road trip to Marburg
From August 5th to August 7th we took part at the iGEM Meetup Germany in Marburg. It was a great opportunity for getting to know all the German teams and further the iGEM Team SDU Denmark and their projects and even though Traci from the HQ! We had a fantastic weekend exchanging experiences and having a nice time.
Thank you Marburg for the cordial board and lodgings!"

Overview
Rare, or “orphan”, diseases are frequently ignored by the pharmaceutical industry. They encompass a huge range of disorders from ALS to Tourette’s Syndrome, but individually have a relatively low number of patients. The low patient numbers mean that there is very little impetus for the pharmaceutical industry to research and produce novel, innovative therapeutics. This means that patients are often left with unsatisfactory treatments. Our goal is to produce a probiotic therapeutic to treat one such disorder: Wilson’s Disease.
Wilson's Disease
Wilson’s Disease is a genetic disorder characterised by an inability of the body to metabolise copper. Normally, when copper is ingested, it is taken up by the small intestine, taken to the liver and subsequently transported into the blood or excreted into the bile. In Wilson’s Disease, there is a mutation in the gene ATP7B. ATP7B encodes a copper-transporting protein that is responsible for loading copper onto caeruloplasmin for transport in the blood, and into the bile for removal from the body. In the absence of a functional form of this protein, copper is unable to be removed from the liver after absorption. This results in toxic accumulation, as cuprous ions react with hydrogen peroxide to produce dangerous free radicals that damage tissue. This allows copper ions to leak into the blood and eventually accumulate in, and damage, other tissues, such as the kidneys and brain. You can read more about Wilson's disease here .

Figure 1. Plot of the average experimental droplet volume versus the predicted volume from the static model.
Figure 2. Plot of the correction factors calculate based on the experimental volumes at various flow rates against the average correction factor.
Unfortunately, these experiments did not result in a consistent correction factor that can be used across different flow rates. Instead, the correction factor on average increases across flow rates. While we observed an increase in droplet size as flow rate increased, we concluded that our current model lacks parameters that account for other physical phenomena in droplet formation and that more data was necessary to identify an empirical correction factor. However, we learned other important information to adjust the current static model. Because of this we decided to multiply the static model by a factor of 1.33 to account for the difference between average and static model.

Distance Traveled to Dispense Fluid
In order to accurately dispense the output into the desired wells, the plane needed to travel the right amount of steps depending on the well plate. Therefore we needed to calculate how many steps of the stepper motor is required to move from one well to another. Below are the steps and calculations that went into determining this:
To do so,  we first determined the distance from center of well to next center well for each microtiter plate.
Next, we measured the circumference of our pulley.
After obtaining these values, we found the distance it is possible to travel per step, and finally the steps per well. From the documentation for the NEMA-14 stepper motor, we know it steps 200 times in one revolution and has microstepping features up to 1/32 microsteps.
From there, since we know how many steps is required for 96 wells, we calculate the microtiter plates with different amounts of wells.

The P39K mutant shows in both cases (in vivo and in vitro) no affinity to the Ptet consensus sequence, showing that our results are consistent between the two characterizations.
The V36F mutant either shows a stronger or a similar binding affinity compared to the WT. The differences not being striking, our characterization methods are here again consistent, with the in vitro technique being more sensitive than the in vivo.
Finally, the E37A W43S T141A triple mutant was shown in vitro to have a different consensus sequence that the wild-type Ptet sequence. However, the in vivo experiment only tested the mutant with the wild-type Ptet and shows an affinity in the range of the wild-type TetR. These two results indicate that, althoud a change in specificity, there is still crosstalk with the original Ptet sequence. This mutant is the most promising of the three characterized in our two systems, harbouring a change in specificity as well as DNA binding properties. Still, this is not an orthogonal mutant; more TetRs need to be tested before fully eliminating crosstalk with wild-type Ptet.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," develop a biofilm. If treated with antibiotics, the infectious bacteria will only be exposed to small concentrations of antibiotics and this will provide time to develop resistance. Under these circumstances, the prosthesis should be removed before given any form of treatment. We should be more retained with the use of antibiotics.
“Nature is smart. Humans have only been here for a few millenniums and microorganisms have been here for billions of years. It would be foolish to believe that we could outsmart nature in only 100 years.” - Hans Jørn Kolmos
Does the media highlight antibiotic resistance as a bigger problem than it actually is?
A documentary in danish television called: “When Penicillin doesn’t work anymore.” says that the resistance problem is huge. The documentary shows families experiencing MRSA, and how health care deal with the problem. We asked Mr. Kolmos if the media makes a bigger problem out of it, that it is?  He replied that: No, the documentary gave a realistic perspective of the problem.
Is there any possibility that we could face a dead end in functional antibiotics if we keep the distribution to this level?
Mr. Kolmos stated there is a potential risk for a multiresistant bacteria. If we kept using antibiotics like we do today, we could potentially get a resistant bacteria, that we could not kill with any of our antibiotic resources.
Are there any cases with patients that could not be treated because of an infection caused by multiresistant bacteria?
Mr. Kolmos told us that under the civil war in Libya, the country did not have the resources to treat all the wounded soldiers. Therefore some of them were sent to Denmark. As we treated them, we observed very odd sorts of infections that are not common in Denmark. There were bacterias with other types of resistance than the ones the doctors knew about. The worst were the Gram-negative, ESBL (Extented-Epectrum Beta-lactamase).
He also estimated 30 % of the population are carrier of S.aureus, of these 1-2 % are MRSA.  The resistance problem is not just a problem on the hospitals. It is also a part of  political debates.
Is there any precautions, the ordinary family can contribute with?
He told us that people could get checked if they were carrier of MRSA. S.aureus is often found in human nostrils, but if the patient got in contact with the MRSA bacteria, it could outperform the normal flora. The patient would now be a carrier. The MRSA bacteria can be killed by use of antibiotics, but an ordinary family should"

A circuit controlling the production of the tail fibre assembly (tfa) protein of bacteriophage lambda to prevent toxicity to the cell. The tfa gene operates under a TetR repressible promoter, while a second circuit ( BBa_K1846003 ) produces TetR (tetracycline repressor) under control of a P(Cat) promoter. With the production of the tfa protein under control of a Tet-repressible promoter, the tfa coding sequence will not be expressed due to P(TetR). However, on addition of anhydrous tetracycline (aTc), TetR will preferably bind to aTc molecule, alleviating repression of P(TetR) and allowing the initiation of transcription. The correct cloning of this BioBrick was confirmed through Sanger sequencing and agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 3).
We characterised this construct by analysing the soluble protein fraction of the cell lysate (Figures 4 and 5). Under the TetR regulation, tfa gene is expressed under a tight control, and can be visualised on the gel (tfa protein = 194 aa, MW: 21602.2 Da), (Figure 4, samples 7, 8, 9 and 11, 12 and 13; Figure 5, samples 4, 5 and 6). tfa gene circuit on its own does not appear to produce tfa protein bands (Figure 4, samples 1, 2 and 3). Although the literature suggests that the protein is soluble even with high expression [1], we hypothesise the lack of bands in these samples is due to the protein being highly acidic, and thus toxic to the cell. It may be that due to the toxicity the cells that express less of the protein are selected for in these experimental conditions. Under the regulation of TetR, even when induced, the expression of the tfa gene is considerably lower than when unregulated and hence, we hypothesise, a considerable amount of soluble material can be recovered. The TetR repressor contains an LVA tag for rapid degradation and hence in the uninduced samples 7 and 11 in Figure 4, and sample 4 in Figure 5, tfa protein bands can still be observed.

Biobrick Assembly
Protocol for inserting a construct into a plasmid backbone. In the case of BioBrick this will commonly be pSB1C3. Biobrick has 2 stages, a digestion stage and a ligation stage:
In a PCR tube add 20 ul of water and either 5 ul of your construct or 2 ul of plasmid backbone
To the same tube add 2.5 ul of NED buffer
Add appropriate restriction enzymes. In our case 1 ul of EcoR1 and 1 ul of Pst1
Incubate the tubes at 37℃ for 15 minutes
Then incubate at 80℃ for 20 minutes
Add 5 ul of water to a new tube followed by 2 ul of the digested construct and backbone
Add 2 ul of 10X T"

Bonn,2012,Team:Bonn#Activities_-_-_TEXT.html," at our information booth
We did a Synthetic Biology information day to inform the population about the chances and possible risks that come with Synthetic Biology and to raise awareness for this awesome new technology. We created information posters and did an information booth at the city centre of Bonn. The people who came to our stand were all interested in the topic of genetic manipulation and we informed them about Synthetic Biology as well, a topic which was known only to very few of them. In general the demand for knowledge about genetic manipulation and what scientists really do in their labs was very high. We were able to clarify many myths which were spread about it, by providing neutral information about the topic. We also had our posters, which not only presented Synthetic Biology and of course the iGEM competetion, but also gave some general information about genetics.
The German SynBio Info Day was an effort by us and most other German iGEM teams ( TU Munich , LMU Munich , TU Darmstadt , Göttingen , Marburg , Tübingen and Bielefeld ) to inform about Synthetic Biology.

Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Therefore the overexpression of glgB successfully increased the number of branches.  Error bars show propagation of uncertainty.

With the calibration curve we are able to determine the glycogen concentration of our samples. Error bars show propagation of uncertainty.
K1585312
This is the translational unit of GlgC, the ADP-glucose pyrophophorylase. It creates ADP-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate for glycogen synthesis.
Usage and Biology
The BioBrick is based on BBa_K118016 by Team Edinburg 2008, but was fused with the well-characterized RBS B0034. For expression tests, BBa_K1585312 was cloned into a pSB1A30 expression vector and transformed in BL21 Gold (DE3).
SDS-PAGE of GlgC in comparison to mRFP
glgC was expressed in pSB1A30 and compared to mRFP in pSB1A30 (T7 promoter) expression. After induction with IPTG at OD=0.6, glgC was expressed, indicated by the small arrows pointing to the GlgC bands of 48 kDa. No difference between induced and uninduced was observed. After overnight expression the strong bands were no longer present.
On top of that, the function of the construct was proven by an iodine staining with BL21 Gold (DE3) and BL21 Gold (DE3) expressing glgC in pSB1K30. The iodine staining is performed with Lugol's iodine which dyes glycogen resulting in a brown color. If more glycogen is present, the color of stainend cultures is darker. In the picture below, the brown color of BL21 Gold (DE3) expressing glgC indicates that the enzyme has the expected activity.
Iodine staining of BL21 Gold (DE3) with glgC in pSB1K30 compared to BL21 Gold (DE3) wild type
Iodine staining was performed with LB and LB + 40 mM glucose overnight cultures which were adjusted to the same OD. The cultures grown in medium with extra glucose were darker than those grown on just LB medium. The darker color of the strain expressing glgC in both samples shows that more glycogen was present. Therefore, the functionality of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase"

Not only does conducting experiments in wet lab make her happy, she also enjoys the social aspect of the lab, like keeping others company. Interaction with the other members have given her great insights to the scientific world as well as social satisfaction. Part of that satisfaction comes from watching her other two presenter teammates squabble over Starbucks and everything in general.
Raised multilingually, she gets excited whenever she hears another person speaking a language she knows. Also raised as a true Asian, she constantly has packets of food on her at most times (unless it's been eaten) and thinks that it is unacceptable to work on an empty stomach.

BioBrick-A-Bot Version 2.0 Specifications
Design Philosophy
BioBrick-A-Bot is designed as an easily extensible, plug-and-play system, that is made up of LegoRoboBricks.  Each LegoRoboBrick is a self-contained unit that consist of a single NXT brick connected to 1-3 motors. Currently, the ALPHA NXT brick is the Master Brick and the rest of the bricks are Slave brick that are connected to the Master. All Physical Constants are to be externalized and specified in terms of “Lego Units”. The Lego Unit is defined as the distance between 2 Lego Pins. In Version 1.0, we have 2 bricks, ALPHA and PHI that are mounted on a frame BETA. Version 2.0 will add another brick called MU (Movement Utility). MU will be used to automatically move Petri Dishes and 96-Well Plates. We will also allow user-defined LegoRoboBricks in version 2.0. The vision is that more iGEM teams can replicate our prototype and extend the functionallity by building their own user defined LegoRoboBricks.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html,"5. RNA was isopropanol precipitated and concentration determined by NanoDrop measurements.
Purified RNA was renatured in 40 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.5, 125 mM KCl and 3 mM MgCl2 and 20 % RNA. Proper folding was achieved by heating up the RNA to 95 °C for 3 min and then letting it cool down to room temperature.
Functionality of the renatured Spinach2 was determined using 500 nM renatured RNA, 1 mM of ligand (e.g. ATP) 100 µM DFHBI (Lucerna) and 0.2 U/µL of Ribolock RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Scientific). The fluorescence spectrum was measured using a spectro fluorometer (JASCO). Then following settings were applied to measure Spinach 2 fluorescence: Ex= 460 nm and Em=475-600 nm, high sensitivity and 37 °C.
Thin Layer Chromatography to Analyze ATP Consumption During in vitro Transcription
Thin layer chromatography will be applied to analyze ATP consumption during in vitro transcription. To analyze ATP consumptions during the RNA transcription, ATP is converted to AMP after the transcription process by apyrase. in vitro transcription was performed in presence of 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 1 mM spermidine, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton-X100, 4 mM each NTP, 10 mM DTT, 5 % DMSO and 0.1 mg/mL T7 RNA Polymerase. As DNA template we used the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2. 5 µL samples were taken every 5 min from the reaction and heated up to 95 °C for 10 min to inactivate the T7 RNA polymerase. To convert ATP to AMP 0.01 U Apyrase and 4 mM CaCl2 were added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. 2 µL of each sample was spotted on a fluorophore coated TLC Plate (ALUGRAM®Xtra SIL G/UV254, Macherey Nagel). TLC was run 4 h 45 min 4:6 Ammonium acetat: ethanol and analyzed with a UV lamp.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time"

RHIT,2017,Team:RHIT#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"atey, R.T (2012). B12 Cofactors Directly Stablize an mRNA Regulatory Switch. Nature, 492, 133-137. https://www.doi.org/10.1038/nature11607
This part originated from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. NCBI Blast showed that this riboswitch might exist in the bacteria right before the btuR gene, a gene related to vitamin B12 uptake.
Design of Parts
All the parts were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The synthesized DNA was the sequence of the riboswitch in between the biobrick prefix and suffix. This part was then assembled into the linearized vector pSB1C3 using Gibson assembly. Protocols for the assembly are included in the Lab Notebook section.
Construct
The construct was designed so that the parts could be analyzed relative to other systems. Generally, the construct consisted of a constitutive promoter, the riboswitch - which includes a ribosomal binding site, a reporter, and a double terminator placed within the biobrick prefix and suffix.
The promoter used was from the Anderson library of promoters. The relative strength of the promoter -measured by fluorescence- of BBa_J23106 is known relative to the other promoters in the library. The anderson promoter that all are relative to, BBa_J23100 was set as a basis of one. The promoter used in our construct was known to have approximately 47% the strength of BBa_J23100. The GFP variant used- BBa_E0050 was that used and interlab, and the methods of measurement are fairly standard. In between the riboswitch and GFP were small sequences of the 5’ untranslated region that were found in the literature. These sequences had worked in between the region that functions as the riboswitch and the translated region. The constructs were assembled in the expression vector BBa_J61002.
How they were Created
All the construct were created through Gibson Assembly. The parts that were not already linearized beforehand were amplified using PCR and primers constructed to yield the proper overlap for assembly. Plasmid pSB1C3 was cut with Spe1 and EcoR1 before assembly to yield the full prefix and suffix, not the truncated form that can be found in the linearized pSB1C3.  A transformation using the assembly products was performed into NEB DH5α competent E. coli before the verification of the constructs.

Even as she was not an expert                  in the field of genetic engineering or its related fields, her experience working with nature and the                 people affected by the disasters caused by man, made her a very resourceful person.
Even as Miss Sharma was against the concept of genetic engineering as it was a lot against nature, she                   conceded that it could be beneficial if done safely and keeping in mind that the natural systems are not                   to be tampered with to a large extent or in the future.

Their response to our efforts prompted us to reach out to other groups in 15 more countries to further spread our word and evaluate the need for cheaper, more accessible birth control. We also spoke to family members and friends who have lived or traveled abroad to gain additional perspective outside of women's groups.
Outcome
Through our survey and close conversations with people from several countries, we gained a better understanding of the situations and challenges of women around the world. We received over 56 responses to our survey as well as personal testimonies from people regarding their perspective on birth control in their communities.

Jamie, Pediatric Doctor
Jamie is an Australian pediatric doctor. We asked Jamie about her and her patients' experiences with birth control. According to Jamie, ""one of [her] patients would soak a sponge in lemon juice and place it in her vaginal tract to avoid pregnancy because her husband believed condoms were too socially stigmatized with prostitution”. Though prostitution is legal in some parts of Australia, it is still heavily stigmatized along with condom use. We hope to provide women a safe birth control method not associated with prostitution.

1.   When we conducted our experiments with FsC, the data shows FsC without incubation with Janus performed better, which is contrary to our conclusions before.
2.   We structured many fusion protein DNA, and haven’t expressed them all successfully. 
Protein Extraction Kit
Background
ATPS (aqueous two-phase systems) is a novel technology to purify proteins. The mechanism of this system lies in the partition between two different phases.
Aims
Construct a brand new and standard way to purify proteins based on aqueous two-phase system.
Results
1. Confirm the strengths using aqueous two-phase systems
2. Successfully separate the target proteins from bulk protein phase based on aqueous two-phase systems at a high partition rate.
3. Construct a standard protocol to separate different kinds of proteins.
The experiment of ATPS
Pre-experiment
Process of this experiment
In the pre-experiment, the original concentration of our protein is about 50ug/ml, which volume is 200uL. We designed the pre-experiment just in order to make preparations for our next experiment. We added 5% (v/v) Berol 532 to protein solution. And then, we used shaker to make them mixed at the speed of 250r/min and 20 centigrade working about one hour. Centrifuge was used to make them separated and came into being two phases at the speed of 8000g for about 25min. In these two phases, the upper phase is rich-detergent and the lower phase is depleted-detergent phase. Because of the property of hydrophobin, fusion protein will stay in the detergent phase, and bulk protein stay in the water phase. We put the rich-detergent phase in another centrifuge cubes and added butanol which is 5 times volume of detergent. Centrifuge was used to make them separated and finally in the lower phase (water phase), we got pure target protein. The upper phase contains detergent (Berol 532), which can be recycled.

We observed similar survival rates between cells treated with CBB or water (these data are not shown on figure 16). Thus, the experimental conditions of the chitin binding assay are compatible with the bacterial life.
Figure 16: We don't want to bother you with useless data
2. Binding test using engineered B. subtilis
Purpose
B. subtilis transformed with the binding module should produce a chimeric protein allowing the bacterium to bind chitin. It is composed of the Cell Wall Binding Domain of a B. subtilis protein LycT, and of the GbpA domain 4 of Vibrio cholerae able to bind chitin. The capacity to bind chitin was assessed by bringing together either the WT strain or the engineered bacterium with chitin beads. After several washes, bacteria still bound to the beads were counted.
Results
We measured the quantity of bacteria before the binding assay (Direct), in the eluted fraction of the first (Wash A) and the second (Wash B) washing steps, and associated with the beads. Both bacterial solutions of WT and engineered bacterium used for the binding assay had the initial same concentration before the assay (Direct on Figure 17). There is also no significant difference between both strains after the first wash (Wash A on Figure 17). However, the concentration of cells quantified in the eluted fraction after the second wash was significantly higher for the wild-type strain. This suggests that the engineered strain is more retained on chitin beads. This was confirmed by a 40 times higher number of cells associated with the chitin beads for the engineered over the wild-type strain (Beads on Figure 17).
Thus, we successfully engineered B. subtilis to promote its binding onto chitin.

The WT bacteria or the bacteria with the binding system concentrations have been determined during the different steps of the binding test. The stars represent a significant difference observed with a Student test with p<0.05.

Purpose
We wanted to observe SubtiTree bound on the chitin coated beads. In order to perform a 3D reconstruction showing this interaction, we used confocal laser scanning microscope.

SYSU-Software,2013,Team:SYSU-Software#model_-_-_TEXT.html,"The Regulation Rate of Activator and Repressor
   At first, we consider the computation of the regulation rate of activator.If the promoter is a positive regulated promoter and the promoter is regulated by an activator, we have the following set of differential equations:
   The concentration of activator is a parameter, which would change its value with time. However, with respect to equilibrium state, it is meaningless to consider the change in the concentration of activator. The more important we concerned is the equilibrium concentration. Therefore, we would let the concentration of activator be aconstant,or, but the set of differential equations is still complicated for solving. As what has been done above, we assume there is no rate of change in any concentration when the system is in equilibrium so we can get the following set of equation:
   Thus, the equilibrium concentration of targeted protein is:
   (4)
   Also, we understand that when the promoter is not regulated by activator, its equilibrium concentration of targeted protein should be:
   Therefore, the regulation rate of activator is:
   (5)
   Similarly, if the promoter is controlled by a negative induced promoter and regulated by repressor, the equilibrium concentration is given by:
   (6)
   and the regulation rate of repressor is given by:
   (7)
   where means the equilibrium concentration of repressor for the regulation of negative expressive induced promoter in such gene.
   The Regulation Rate of Corepressor and Inducer
   Applying the same method mention above, we can still find out the situation of targeted protein in the existence of activator or repressor with corepressor or inducer.
   If the promoter is controlled by an activator, which regulated by a inducer and a co-repressor, the equilibrium concentration of targeted protein can be given by:
   (8)
   While, same situation applies but, at this time, the promoter is regulated by an inducer instead of a corepressor, the equilibrium concentration of targeted protein can be given by:

   If the promoter is controlled by a repressor and regulated by a repressor and an inducer, the equilibrium concentration of targeted protein can be given by:

   Similarly, for corepressor regulation instead of inducer regulation, the equilibrium concentration of targeted protein can be given by:

The triclosan resistance gene, FabV, offers no cross resistance to any commonly used               antibiotics. It is also cheaper than conventional antibiotics as lower concentrations need to be used for selection: <1p per litre compared to 56p per litre for ampicillin (prices from Alfa Aesar).
Triclosan is a biocide which acts upon FabI protein in E. coli, an enoyl ACP-reductase involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. We planned to investigate the effectiveness of resistance by two mechanisms. The first is by overexpression of fabI, which gives triclosan resistance as there is so much of the target that no matter how much FabI is broken down, there is still enough for the system to function. The second method of resistance is by heterologous expression of fabV – an enoyl ACP-reductase found in Vibrio species. Research has shown that FabV confers greater resistance than FabI, as it is refractory to inhibition by triclosan.

We create the segments which have complementary ligation sites so that we can introduce plural DNA segments into one plasmid at the same time and arrange them in the way we like. (Figure 4) Learn more about Golden Gate Assembly .
Plasmid backbone BBa_K797013
Before we started assembly, we had to make proper gene segments for Golden Gate assembly. The DNA segments we created had four bp for ligation, one base pair spacer, BsaI recognition sites and four base pair at the both ends.
We amplified plasmid backbone(psB1K3).
After amplification, we assembled these DNA segments referring to the protocol .(See the part of Golden Gate Assembly)
After we confirmed this part has the restriction cites and restriction enzyme cutting sites of BsaI. After this, we mixed DpnI with enzyme-treated plasmid and conducted ligation. Other iGEM teams can use this backbone plasmid for their Golden Gate assembly.

We created software which design primers to create DNA segments for Golden Gate assembly. This software gives you the sequences of primers when you input the sequences of the parts and melting temperature.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," implemented within current regulations on his farm. Furthermore, he said that our do it yourself toolbox has potential as farmers are willing to invest time in detecting resistance genes themselves.
Feedback from farmer Paul
Furthermore, we received feedback on how we can improve our device. Paul stated that it would be better if the test really showed which specific antibiotic should be used for treatment, instead of knowing which antibiotics should NOT be used. We completely agree with this statement; finding out which antibiotic is appropriate to use is more effective in helping to solve the worldwide antibiotic resistance problem. Moreover, he advised us to use larger test tubes for the detection. Currently, we use 0.5 and even 0.2mL eppendorfs in which the detection is done. Paul recommended to perform the detection in larger tubes to increase the visibility and to be more user-friendly.
Lastly, in the protocol we developed there is a step in which the farmer gets external help to purify RNA and measure its concentration. It would, of course, be ideal if the farmer would be able to perform these steps himself. This would require some extra training for the farmer and an improved centrifuge. Also, a way to detect the purity of the RNA has to be developed without having to use expensive equipment. We envision this to be a really cool future iGEM project!
Comparison with other potential solutions
A different solution to this problem, is that the antibiotics test that is currently performed by a diagnostics lab, is performed by the farmer himself. This, however, means that the farmer still has a waiting time of at least 12 hours and that he/she would have to receive special training to be able to handle micro organisms. Comparing this to our solution, we see that we offer a more rapid test that, for the most part, can be performed by the farmer him/herself and does not require an ML-1 environment at the farm.
To what extent does our solution solve the problem?
Two major challenges are identified considering the development of a diagnostic tool. There is low commercial attractiveness as diagnostic tools are not reimbursed in our current healthcare system, which means that they will have to be paid for by farmers or doctors themselves. Also, the use of rapid diagnostics limits the amount of antibiotics used. Therefore, the commercial interests of pharmaceutical companies is low ( van Mierlo 2016 ). Concluding, the commercialization of diagnostic tools is challenging.
A perfect new diagnostic tool would answer the following questions ( O’Neill Commission ):
Is the infection causing the illness bacterial or viral?
If it is a bacterial infection, what type of bacteria is causing the infection?

ATHENS
And now, it is finally time for our favorite collaboration – with Team Athens, Greece. We were incredibly pleased to find out they had invited us to stay with them for a couple of days, so we can properly get to know each other. Not only did we have the unique ability to exchange ideas and tips with another newcomer iGEM team, but also got to tour the beautiful city of Athens and experience it as true Athenians. We presented our project ideas to each other, which we took as an opportunity to practice our presentation skills.  + we presented our project to a foreign team for the first time + measurement kit for InterLab – We were contacted by Team Athens a week or two after our return, because they needed a helping hand. They had already fully utilized their measurement kit for InterLab to get their first results, but something had went wrong and now they needed another kit. We did not take part in this study, so we had the needed materials on hand and decided to help. Team: Athens

Twitter
Similar to Facebook, twitter was a great platform for discussing our project and communicating the advantages of synthetic biology. Majority of our followers on twitter were other iGEM teams. This was incredibly enjoyable as we were able to talk to other teams from across the world, see how they were going, and offer suport, opinions, and advice - as they did for us. Indeed, skpye calls with the iGEM teams from Oxford, Warwick, Exeter, Manchester-Graz, Heidelburg, and Danciger were the direct result of twitter interactions. We would like to thank all the iGEM teams and the iGEM HQ that communicated with us over twitter, shared jokes, memes, images, and progress - it certainly made this international competiton feel a lot more personal and social.
Below are some of our most successful tweets:
Danciger, Israel: Skype and mentoring

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," by our team that hamper the success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Output) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by implementing the biosensor created by the 2017 Evry Paris-Saclay iGEM team into the Sensynova platform as part of our collaboration requirement.
Background Information
This biosensor was designed, made and submitted to the iGEM registry by the Evry Paris-Saclay 2017 team. We chose to use this system as a variant to the IPTG detector module present in the Sensynova platform in order to fulfil the requirement of collaborating with another iGEM team. The image below, provided to us by the Evry Paris-Saclay 2017 team, details the psicose biosensor design. It features the PLac derivative promoter PTAC (BBa_K180000), a RBS (BBa_B0034), the PsiR coding sequence, the terminator (BBa_B0015), the synthetic promoter pPsitac2, a RBS (BBa_B0034), a mCherry coding sequence and finally the terminator (BBa_B0015) flanked by the iGEM prefix and suffix.
Figure 1: Evry Paris-Saclay Psicose Biosensor Design
The inducible system works as detailed in the diagram below. When pTAC is induced due to the presence of IPTG, PsiR is transcribed and binds to the pPsitac2 promoter repressing the transcription of the mCherry protein. When psicose is present, the sugar binds to PsiR, freeing up the promoter and subsequently the colour output.
Figure 2: SBOL Visual Detailing Evry Paris-Saclay Psicose Biosensor Design
Design Stage
In order to implement the psicose biosensor variant to the Sensynova platform, a design was created by replacing the IPTG sensing system in the original detector module with the construct detailed above, creating part BBa_K2205023 . We chose to replace the PTAC promoter with the constitutive promoter present within the platform in order to eliminate the need for induction with IPTG.

After soaking the plastics we noticed a lack of colouration on the PET plastics, an indication that the mCherry did not stick to the plastics in quantities that would make them visible to the naked eye. Further testing would aim to see if soaked plastics were visible under UV light or using UV optical devices.
To test if the mCherry was still present but simply not visible to the human eye, we ran our plastics through the spectrophotometer to check absorbances at 587nm. Our results were compared with the absorbance of pure mCherry, plastic soaked in distilled water, and plastic in lysis buffer and LB broth; all at the wavelength of 587 nm. Compared to the expected maximum absorbance for mCherry, our constructs containing mCherry did not show clear signs of being successfully adhered to either plastic. Our lab is not able to purify proteins; future work will aim to collaborate with a lab that would purify our protein products and repeat these tests to check for evidence of selective binding to PET plastic. Our final results may have been affected by the plastic’s orientation on the spectrophotometer tube and it’s bendable properties. We aim to do future research to explain and prevent those properties to hopefully achieve more accurate results.

These two graphs show our PET and non-PET plastics that were soaked in our four constructs in transformed and untransformed E. coli. The adherence of mCherry was slightly present under the spectrophotometer through the small increase of absorbance of the PET plastics soaked in PET-ase mCherry, compared to the non-mCherry soaked PET plastics. The adherence of mCherry was visible through the spectrometer, because the PET plastic soaked in mCherry PET-ase had a higher absorbance than the PET plastic soaked in PET-ase without mCherry.

These last two graphs show our PET and non-PET plastics that were soaked in our four constructs in the lysed E.coli. The adherence of mCherry was slightly less present under the spectrophotometer than the transformed and untransformed E.coli. We can infer this through the small increase of absorbance of the PET plastics soaked in PET-ase mCherry, compared to the non mCherry soaked PET plastics.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
"
Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," lot of them can be seen. This anticipation is scientific but also juridical (decide about the best legal framework).
Inclusiveness: Inclusiveness and deliberation require to listen to perspectives from publics and stakeholders. Inclusiveness requires to listen to stakeholders, but deals also with outreach and pluridisciplinarity.
Responsiveness: Responsiveness is a good indicator for the efficiency of RRI in the project. It requires to search if the previous dimensions helped to shape the project toward the RRI’s goals.
What did we learn on our project?
Reflexivity
When we chose our project we had different options. We chose to take a fundamental project, risky bet but more original. Stakeholders were essential to help us build our project. They helped us to focus on many points and to put the project in perspective. We thus met many scientists, but also jurists and politicians.  Was our project needed? We thought about the different applications of the project. It was not an easy task because the project is a fundamental one. We were guided by a publication of Olivier Espéli “From structure to function of bacterial chromosomes: evolutionary perspectives and ideas for new experiments”, which said a tool like ours would be useful for scientists (FEBS Letters, 2015). We find that our tool would be not only useful for biologists because of its simplicity, but also for the public health sector. This tool could indeed help to diagnose genetic diseases.
Defining the impacts of our project was complex as we choose a fundamental biology project. Even if we defined the potential applications of our project, other scientists or industrials can invent new ways to use our tool and guessing how they will use our tool is impossible. But the impacts of a responsible project cannot be only transferred to the user and his use in a environnemental or health context; science itself must be responsible.
With this reflexion came the main question the RRI test asked us: how RRI could apply to fundamental research, such as our project on the CRISPR-Cas9 technology? The societal goal does not seem to exist. However, building a responsible research is in itself a societal goal: having a more responsible science is undoubtedly a benefit for the society. The stakeholders of a fundamental project are the ones whose voices are interesting and necessary on science. In other words, the stakeholders are less identified. On our focus on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology we felt necessary to gather stakeholders and tried to draw with them the future of a responsible use on this technology.

Overview
Up to now, we have investigated the public opinion about current energy issues and our project by questionnaires, propagated our project to the community by social activities and promoted education among primary school students, as is illustrated in Human Practice Silver . In order to get more ideas and information about our project and tailor it to the current development, we conducted counselling with experts in hydrogen production who gave us significant guidelines to our projects. We also attended as many as conferences as possible to communicate our ideas with students from other universities and establish collaborations with other teams. These wonderful human practice experiences indeed benefit our project and we also spread the principles and ideas of our project to iGEMers all around China. Therefore, we think we are qualified for the human practices gold medal.

1. Christopher Chang
 
In May, we were very lucky to meet with Christopher Chang from UC-Berkeley and discussed our project with him. He showed us amazing ways to mimic hydrogenase using chemical methods and gave us important suggestions about the background knowledge. After the discussion, we took him to tour around the campus.
 
 
2. Xinghua Xia
 
On the afternoon of July 19th, we interviewed with Prof. Zou from state key laboratory of biochemistry in NJU who is an expert in hydrogen production. He introduced to us new methods for hydrogen production such as biomimetic catalysts for hydrogen production. We also got inspired about some chemistry problems in our project. First, the function of S2- in CdS is to change the energy state of Cd. The S2- that we added in our experiment is different from Cys. Thus we should add the control experiment: no S in the solution, add S2-, add Cys. He also advised us to test the size of bandgap for utilization of visible light. Second, he suggested that we should consider the interactions between S2- and protein PbrR. Third, there are two ways for transmembrane electron transduction. Last but not least, we should consider the choice and optimization of reductants. The interview with him was indeed inspiring because Prof. Zou showed us a broader way to think about problems.

• GTN for the Ribozyme cut, N needs to be purine (but could be any base except G)
• TTC is the loop of tRNA-Lys (UUC) - Needs TTCN for the T4 Ligase
• The first part ends with TTCGTC
• In luxI there is TTCTC so it is supposed to be suitable for the approach
• This is Type 3 Ribozyme.

Azobenzene
Azobenzene Photo-induced Magical Molecule
From NPs Aggregation to Synthetic Biofilm
(1) Our bacterium has two main features - one is a sensor and the second is azobenzene attached to the LPS. When the bacterium detects a substance it changes color by producing green luciferase
(2) The light emitted from the bacterium causes the azobenzene molecules to change conformation to a ""sticky"" form
(3) The azobenzene molecules cause the bacteria to aggregate by forming bonds through azobenzene, allowing fast diffusion of quorum sensing molecules and the rest of the bacteria turn green as well
Azobenzene is an organic molecule which responds to light and selectively"

ColumbiaU_NYC,2016,Team:ColumbiaU NYC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," We will sequence it to confirm the operon and      quantify the amount of rhamnolipids.
Protein Analysis
We ran the gel, but it was unclear and blurred because we      did not purify the gel. However, there were bands of the      right size for RhlA and RhlB. MS showed that rhamnolipids      were detected. So, we decided not to spend the time      purifying the gel.
qPCR
Results show that mRNA is being properly synthesized by      our construct, although our negative controls (wild-type      and empty vector) indicated some unexpected mRNA.
Keratinocyte Experiments
We obtained our cells, but they were highly confluent      during the weekend. We performed experiment testing effect      of different bacterial strains (paK, WT PP, PP+L1+Rham,      and WT PP with 1g/L mixed rhamnolipid) with different MOIs      (10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000) on keratinocyte      viability. Cell survival was testing with the MTS cell      viability assay, which measures the level of live cells      per sample. Keratinocytes were first plated at 3x10^4 per      well into 48 well plates, then weaned off P/S antibiotics      on the next day. The following day, the different strains      were each added with the different MOIs with 3 trials per      situation. Positive control was a ""0 MOI"" situation with      no bacteria added, which should represent maximum cell      viability, and two negative controls were pure media and      pure media with 100,000 MOI of each bacterial strain,      which should give a cell viability of 0. This was repeated      at 2 time points: 3 and 24 hours. Data from the 3 hour      time point has been collected.
Molecular Cloning
We tested the Staphylococcus protocols for miniprepping,      electroporation, and filter-mating with empty vectors. We      also constructed our recombinant pC221+RhlAB+GFP and      pC194+RhlAB+GFP plasmids for transformation into the Staph      strains. To more closely observe the effect of Rhamnolipids on S. epidermidis, we performed a gradient      plate experiment which once again showed sparser colonies      for S. epidermidis with higher concentrations of      Rhamnolipids.

Overview
While scientific advances constantly generate new opportunities and products that once were even beyond imagination, it is a  major challenge for those who root themselves in time-honored moral traditions to think about how these new discoveries should be approached.
Vegans, vegetarians, and eaters of kosher and halal all scrutinize the origins of their food before consuming it. If offered snacks don't conform to the guidelines they live by, they won't eat. The preparation of meat for these groups is particularly tricky, as it either involves careful ritual slaughter, in the cases of kosher and halal, or a prohibition against meat altogether, in the cases of veganism and vegetarianism.
One recent US patent describes six methods for producing meat in a laboratory. The possibility of growing meat in petri dishes has already garnered the attention of groups concerned with the ethical treatment of animals; it would mean that meat could be produced with virtually no opportunity for cruelty or mistreatment of animals. But one salient question has not yet been approached: Is such a product truly meat?
While such questions are, in general, not very useful, when it comes to translating modern concepts into the language of ancient traditions, we are forced to clearly define the objects we are dealing with. As such, we have approached leading thinkers in the Jewish and vegan communities whose expertise includes both the legal aspects of their respective traditions as well as the scientific knowledge necessary to comprehensively consider the issues.
Main Points
Is such a product kosher? Is it acceptable for a vegan?
Is such a product halakhically considered meat? Could it be eaten with milk?
If stem cells could be induced to differentiate as pig cells, could we produce kosher pork, or other non-kosher animals?
Is the method of cell harvest important? How does the prohibition against eating from a live animal impact this issue?
Are cells considered animal by-products like milk or toenails, which would be pemritted or are they meat, which would be prohibited?
Would the relationship of"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
How to create products based on database description?
In MoDeL frame, products are composed of both definite parts and ST parts. The sources of ST parts are defined in component listOfTransferTable. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, A-B, where A and B are both NST parts. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be A and B. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products as expected are connected by the tree node. To find products with correct structure, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.

Testing
We at fishPHARM believe in safety and responsibility for fish above all. Therefore, we have put the fishBIT system through a rigorous testing process to ensure maximum durability and hydrodynamic properties and minimal invasiveness. We have simulated in the lab our fishBIT prototype working under the real world conditions that the device will encounter in an aquatic ecosystem. In doing so, we have proven its effectiveness as well as optimize its design. Additionally, we are constantly fine-tuning the tag and applicator design based off of implementation and feedback from our fish hatchery collaborators .
Ballistics Testing
We wanted to ensure the fishBIT system was less invasive than current methods of tagging fish. We injected fishBIT and standard fish tags (from fishtagger.com ) into a 1% concentration clear agar block to qualitatively assess damage done to fish tissue. FishBIT and the standard tags were applied with their respective applicators. The pictures below represent our first iteration through the design process. Our applicator was able to make a clean puncture and firmly place the fish tag within the agar. Additionally, our fish tag was able to successfully remain inside the agar (more testing about the effect of water flow on fish tag embedding is discussed in the “Hydrodynamics” section). However, as seen by the effect on the agar, both our applicator and tag should be made narrower in order to inflict less trauma on the fish tissue. The conclusions of our ballistics testing are also supported by the feedback from the Rome and Bath fish hatcheries.
We also wanted to make sure our applicator was as effective as the standard applicator in penetrating the skin and scales of salmon. Therefore, we used a diseased salmon and injected both systems into the tissue. Based on our testing on the agar block, we expected fishBIT to not be as effective as the standard tag. However, our applicator was just as effective as the control applicator in penetrating the scales of the fish, and did not cause significantly more damage to the fish tissue. The control tag and the fishBIT tag both resisted a gentle tug on the exposed portion. Tugging gently on fish tags after applying them is standard procedure for tagging fish, and is a good test for the tenacity of the newly placed tag [1]. These figures demonstrate the effectiveness of fishBIT relative to that of a standard tag (in yellow).
Hydrodynamics
We performed hydrodynamics testing in Cornell's DeFrees Hydraulics Lab . We tested fishBIT at the maximum speed of the Tilting Wind"

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the public knew about in synthetic biology.
One such activity included solving problems using various genetic “building blocks,” each labeled with a specific function. These literal blocks represented genetic parts that could be stacked together to make a full genetic circuit to solve the problem at hand. Kids loved this game, as it was very hands on; much to our surprise, many younger kids were very creative, and very open with new ideas, like creating synthetic blood. Another example of an activity that received great public reception was the “golden rice” table, where we showed museum goers a plate of yeast that expressed the gene for beta-carotene, and “golden bread,” baked with this yeast. We were again surprised by how many members of the public were open to such ideas.
We taught the public about microfluidics as well, making the analogy of scientists doing experiments to bakers trying to find the best cake. If the baker only needed a taste to test how the cake came out, why make a whole cake? We described microfluidics as “mini-ovens” in which scientists could make “mini-cakes,” to check if the “cake” came out good. This would save the baker/scientist lots of time and ingredients.
After these activities, we met with the public for a forum on ethics in synthetic biology. This was an amazing opportunity! We were able to sit side-by-side at a table with members of the public; we got to listen to a talk on gene drives as a solution to malaria, and we got to play out an ethical decision making process. In this roleplay, we acted as members of the local public and government in a Zambian community considering to use a gene drive to rid malaria. We got to discuss our plan of action, and we had to come to a conclusion on whether to release GM mosquitoes.
Summer Pathways | 12 July 2016
In our experiences at Building with Biology, we found that most people in the public had never heard of microfluidics. Our next human practice event was educational outreach to young women in high school interested in STEM program.
In order to reach out to young women interested in STEM fields of study, we teamed up with the BostonU iGEM wetlab team to speak at the Boston University-hosted event Summer Pathways. During this event, we were able to teach high school students from areas around New England about basic synthetic biology and electrical engineering principles through interactive activities hosted with smaller groups.

MonoQ chromatography: It’s an anion exchange resin. To facilitate the binding of the fusion protein to the resin, the pH of the buffer was increased to pH8. At the higher pH the protein can interact with the resin, allowing us to utilize its charge as a purification property.
The final proposed process flow diagram for the production of dxCas9-Linker-Tn5 fusion ( BBa_K2643002 ) includes two chromatography steps: a capture and polishing step figure 8.

3.4 In Vivo Functionality of the Fusion Protein
Aim: Develop an in vivo platform for screening the efficiency of the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ).
Approach & experimental design: To visualize in vivo whether a donor DNA sequence is recognized by the fusion construct ( BBa_K2643000 ) and integrated close to a target sequence, we built a strain that harbors the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein ( BBa_K2643000 ), as well as a sgRNA that can guide the complex to a target site of interest.
LacZ is a bacterial gene that encodes for beta-galactosidase, an enzyme able to hydrolyze lactose and to cleave an analogue compound 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal), resulting in formation of a blue colored product, used to verify cloning attempts. Our in vivo screen methodology relies on lacZ disruption through targeted integration. To this extent, the assay makes use of blue/white screening, which happens on medium complemented with X-gal, Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and relevant antibiotics. IPTG induces expression of beta-galactosidase, the lacZ gene product.
For this, the lacZ sgRNA expression cassette ( BBa_K2643010 ) was inserted into the episomal pACYC vector already containing the fusion construct ( BBa_K2643000 ). IPTG-Induction of protein expression then enables immediate loading of the fusion construct with the sgRNA. An additional requirement for activity is a donor DNA sequence flanked by Mosaic Ends (MEs), which can be recognized by the Tn5 transposase domain for cut and paste"

We also still need to look into location of binding sites with respect to affecting transcriptional activity.  We have contaced Richard Freiman with hopes that he might provide some insight.

The main component of our Human Practice was the Public Engagement activity SynBioThon 2016, a synthetic biology competition for university students. It aimed to promote the importance of Synthetic Biology in Costa Rica. The event was attended by around 70 students from three of the five public universities of the country. Some of the short time impacts involved the creation of a Synthetic Biology club in University of Costa Rica and the conformation of a startup. More details are shown at SynBioThon.
Also, we developed a  survey about prostate cancer as Integrated Human Practice, which was answered by 393 people. This allowed us to get involved with the community and redesign our project based on their opinions. This is shown at Integrated Human Practice.
We earned one of this! :)

(a) BBa_K1913022  is a plac-Fixk2 synthetic promoter that contains two typical FixJ boxes (in green) upstream the core element of the constitutive promoter BBa_J23106 (dark red) as well as two extra lacI operators flanking the promoter (b) BBa_K1913023 is a ptet-Fixk2 synthetic promoter that contains two TetR operators in the core element region of BBa_J23106. (c) BBa_K1913024 is a plac-Fixk2 promoter with the ompC promoter core element region (in purple).
Hybrid Promoters Are Activated in the Dark in Presence of YF1-FixJ
In order to test the hybrid promoters, we constructed five composite parts with mRFP gene as reporter ( BBa_K19103027 , BBa_K19103028 , BBa_K19103029 , BBa_K19103030 , BBa_K19103031 ). These composite parts were co-transformed with the light sensor part ( BBa_K19103034 ) into E.coli strain BL21, cultured under dark for 24h and their fluorescence was tested. We included as controls cells that only contained the Fixk2 composite parts. The results (Figure 13) illustrated that hybrid promoter BBa_K1913025 has 5 times significant different compared to control, which suggested that this promoter is the most sensitive one for being induced by FixJ. Hybrid promoters BBa_K1913023 and BBa_K1913024 showed relative higher florescence values than others, suggesting that they have certain leaky expression. Whereas there were no signifi-cant difference between these promoters and their controls, this means that these two promoters have a low sensitivity to induction by FixJ compared to the other promoters.
