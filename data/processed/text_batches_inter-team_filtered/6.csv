Using the treatment protocol for the non-germination spores from Prof. Anne Moir, we performed lab experiments for the two non-germination spores, and concluded that the double-knockout mutant, sleB and cwlJ would be more ideal for our project as it had more colonies growing after treatment, and less colonies growing without treatment, as compared to the single knock-out mutant, cwlD.
We propose that we could use IPTG as a switch for germination.
Bacillus subtilis cwlD mutant
Together with the non-germination spores and protocol for recovery which Prof. Anne Moir sent to us, information on the cwlD mutant was given as well, quoted in the following paragraph.
""The cwlD (Cmr) mutation was transformed in our lab strain of Bacillus subtilis (1620) to create a mutant lacking muramic lactam in the cortex peptidoglycan. As this is a target for the activated cortex lytic enzymes, there is no cortex breakdown, limited rehydration, no gross protein changes in the spore coat, and hence the strain is germination defective.""
From the reference recommended by Prof. Anne Moir, we found that, the mutation in the cwlD gene of Bacillus subtilis is predicted to encode a muramoyl L-alanine amidase, which results in the production of spores containing no muramic lactam. These spores have normally dehydrated protoplasts but are unable to complete the germination/outgrowth process to produce viable cells.[1]
Germination in the presence of lysozyme allows the cwlD spores to produce viable cells with normal heat resistance properties.[1]
Bacillus subtilis sleB and cwlJ double-knockout mutant
The sleB and cwlJ proteins are cortex-lytic enzymes, partially redundant in function, and are required together for effective cortex hydrolysis during Bacillus subtilis spore germination. Enzymic hydrolysis of spore-cortex peptidoglycan is essential for spores to complete rehydration during germination and to commence outgrowth,[2] thus the SleB and CwlJ proteins are important enzymes in normal spore germination of Bacillus subtilis.

[debugging a construct]
◎ BIT-China for Jilin-China
https://2016.igem.org/Team:Jilin_China/Collaborations
This year, team Jilin_China aimed to propose a new way to cure the solid tumor by expressing the TAT-Apoptin. The chassis they chose is Bifidobacteria, which can target the anaerobic region of the solid tumors since the microorganism is also anaerobic.
However, the functional device should firstly be transformed into E.coli to operate the methylation process in case that the devices were digested by the restriction enzymes inside the Bifidobacterium longum. They tried several times, but the results were not ideal. Since our team BIT-China is good at genetic operation on E.coli, we helped them realize the expression of TAT-Apoptin in E.coli.
We transformed four kinds of plasmid provided by Jilin_China into E.coli DH5α. The vector is pUC18, and the fragments are separately listed below:
num
Fragment kinds
1
positive control
2
TAT-Linker-apoptin
3
apoptin and Tmp1 signal peptide
4
apoptin and Sec2 signal peptide
After four kinds of positive clones separately containing these fragments were selected, we activated cells in LB culture medium overnight. We inoculated bacteria into new LB culture medium the second day and used IPTG for induction when the OD600 is 0.6. The induction was processed under 16℃ and 37℃ overnight.
After that, we treated the protein samples. We break cells after enrichment. We obtained the separation products of precipitation and supernatant. Separately, we ran those samples.
We have run the SDS-PAGE twice, here are the results:
Fig.1 Different temperature induced with supernatant
Fig.2 Different temperature induced with precipitation

This year, Jilin_China mainly helped us improve our model.
After constructing the primary model, we met some difficulties in proving the accuracy of these equations, as well as simulating these equations by software"

nitrate-sensitive promoter characterization
Fig. results of nitrate induction are presented. It is obvious that nitrate can induce GFP expression. Additionally, Pyear (nitrate-sensitive promoter) respond ultra-sensitively when nitrate concentration ranges from approximately 0-2 ug/L. And after concentration of 3.5ug/L,GFP expression maintains at nearly 2800 RFU which showcase its maximal initiation rate of promoter. Top10 brand control is presented. We can clearly see the differences.
phosphate-sensitive promoter characterization
Two phosphate sensitive promoters are induced by low-phosphate condition below 100 uM. However, not significant exciting fluorescence can be detected , though we can observe gradually increasing fluorescence with gradually decreasing phosphate concentration in the medium. We suspected that it is the endogenous stochastic noise that leads to the relatively low exciting fluorescence because a major of cells didn’t respond. Additionally, low transcription rate of the promoters may be another factor that leads to low GFP expression.
Preliminary test of phosphate-sensitive promoter
Fig. preliminary test of two phosphate-sensitve promoters,Pugp and PphoB is shown above.The first diagram shows that Pugp(represented in blue) and PphoB(represented in red) can be induced gradually by phosphate whose concentration ranges from 0 to 80 uM.The second one shows sharp decrease of fluorescence when phosphate concentration below 4uM. The third one shows the logarithm of all the data induced range from 0-400uM,which indicates the clear trend
Future work
Phosphate- and nitrate-sensitive promoters have been characterized. It seems that both of them are in need of modification to enhance TCS robustness and reduce stochastic noise. Besides as expected, our experiment has proved that original nitrate-sensitive promoter needs"

Figure 17. Luminescence per OD600 (RFU) of control (transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) with empty pQE80L) and experimental (transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) with pQE80L+HT) group. * indicates significant difference compared to control (p = 0.001).
Table 5 shows net OD600 (after deducted by blank Abs600) and their luminescence after reaction with DT for each replicate, while Figure 17 shows comparison between luminescence per OD600 for control (E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with empty pQE80L) and experimental (E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pQE80L+ HT) group upon reaction with DT. We found that luminescence level in experimental group was significantly lower than control group (p = 0.001). This result suggested that experimental group has lower ADP concentration than control group, which likely to be caused by HT interaction with DiphTox inhibits CheA phosphorylation, ultimately leading to more ATP conserved and less ADP produced. Therefore, upon reaction with kinase detection reagent, less ADP will be converted into ATP in experimental group, causing less luminescence compared with control group.
From the experiment, we did not know the initial ATP+ADP concentration from each control and experimental group. Assuming the initial ATP concentration was 1 mM (mean ATP concentration in E. coli is 1.56 ± 1.27 mM according to Yaginuma et al.), with the help of standard curve from Figure 1, we can estimate that percent of ATP-to-ADP conversion inhibition upon HT-DT interaction was around 1%. This is due to luminescence of standard 0% ADP-ATP mixture was 1.69 x 106, similar with mean luminescence of experimental group (1.55 x 106), while luminescence of standard 1% ADP-ATP mixture was 2.2 x 106, similar with mean luminescence of control group (2.1 x 106). One note to be considered that E. coli cells may have varying level of intracellular ATP and ADP, as stated by large standard deviation of ATP concentration from Yaginuma et al. study. However, we grew and treated E. coli used in this experiment equally, also we created replicates for each group to minimize the possible bias.
Hence, our present result suggested that"

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," A receptor composed of (1) the SERK signal peptide, (2) an extracellularly located effector protein, (3) a linker with a Strep-tag II and a TEV protease cleavage site, (4) the SERK transmembrane domain, (5) a short linker domain and (6) a green fluorescent protein were assembled using the RFC[25] standard. This highly modular receptor was successfully transformed into Physcomitrella patens and stable cell lines were selected. These stable cell lines were used for experiments. The localization of the membrane-bound GFP could be detected clearly on the surface of the moss cells (see figure 1), whereas cells expressing GFP cytosolically in the moss, showed a uniform fluorescence all over. Further we incubated the moss cells with recombinant TEV protease, which diffused through the cell wall, cleaved the TEV site within the extracellular domain of the receptor and liberated the NanoLuc luciferase. The luciferase assay of the supernatant at the beginning of this incubation and after 16 hours showed a dramatic increase in luminescence, which is further evidence that our modular receptor is located in the membrane and - even better - in the right orientation, exposed to the extracellular space. Beyond the possibility to locate an effector protein in the extracellular space, we thought about further applications and found the SypCatcher-SpyTag System to be a perfect tool for our needs [ Zakeri et al., 2012 ]. In this system a peptide bond is formed between the side chains of two protein domains in an efficient manner. With this system it is not necessary to fuse effector proteins to a specific terminus of the receptor any more, it even becomes possible to immobilize effector proteins which are only active as multimeric proteins and it would also be feasible to express a single receptor carrying a SpyCatcher domain at the outer side of the membrane which subsequently binds a set of different effector proteins which are secreted and are immobilized afterwards. Constructs were created with a His-tagged SypCatcher, a SypTag with an N-terminal or C-terminal SpyTag or with protein domains on both termini of the SpyTag. These constructs were produced recombinantly in E. coli. Afterwards the proteins were purified. Protein coupling experiments were performed and the formation of isopeptide bonds was confirmed by pull-down experiments and reducing SDS-PAGE. Summarizing these results, all our intended localizations in Physcomitrella patens worked, empowering the iGEM community to work"

Week 1
MONDAY, MAY 23
Day 1 on the job–the morning began with a tour of Bindley Bioscience Center for the new interns (Barrett, Caleigh, Emma, and Paige), during which Susan (the world’s best receptionist) kindly showed the fledgling researchers around and gave them the run-down on BBC do’s and don’t’s. The remainder of the day was spent working on gene design via Benchling, researching potential assays, and meeting with Drs. Rickus and Solomon. Important topics they raised included the importance of an experimental design plan, the need to begin with the basics (i.e. how do we know a protein is being expressed?) before delving into more complex issues of function, and gene design specifics.
TUESDAY, MAY 24
Nine out of ten genes needed for luxury phosphorus uptake were ordered at the conclusion of Day 2! Throughout the day, genes were restructured for use with 3A Gibson Assembly protocol, and new constituent promoters were added (both sigma70 and sigmaS to arrest growth in P E. coli). Primer design began. Additionally, the hunt for assays continued for both phosphorus and nanowire constructs.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," significant concern for the future of this sector. While developing our project, we saw the enthusiasm of beekeepers for seeing young people interested in the area. Throughout all these months we have shared our project in many places, we have tried to bring the youth to be interested in bee’s importance and beekeeping. For the IV State’s Beekeeping Forum we made an open invitation to different year students of our biotechnology career, encouraging them to attend, to listen  to  the  conferences  and  learn  about  apiaries . By
proudly conducting this project we are directly involving with beekeeping and fostering an important approach to this sector in the young people that surround us in our daily lives as college students.
After all the research made, the ambiguities that were found when doing the evaluation of the presence of Foulbrood in the world and the different conclusions that were given, (some resulting from the video call with FAI presidential staff member Lorenzo Della Morte and others from the video call with MVZ Juan Diego Pérez de la Rosa) showed that there is a problem in the health and statistical assessment studies regarding bee diseases. Many times, beekeepers who have affected hives, do not report it because of the negative implications that this entails; burning of colonies, the need of using antibiotics that disturb the innocuity of honey and finally the risk of losing investment made over many years. Our product promotes this social problem to be resolved; by having a profitable and useful product, which displace conventional antibiotics usage and the burning of hives. It encourages that the beekeeper openly reports if their beehives suffer from the disease having the peace of mind that he will not have to lose large quantities of money or their hives nor he will need to alter their bee products with antibiotics.
By addressing individual concerns as well as general insights such as the problem of statistical assessment studies, throughout the development of our project and the implementation of the product, we seek to address aspects that are often out of the hands of beekeepers, and that may also have an impact on communities outside of the beekeeping sector. Attention to the previously mentioned issues is based on the fact of building an organized society that interacts effectively within itself and with external communities.
The social area covers the ethical and legal aspects:
Ethical
Three of our human practices activities stood out in determining points that led us to reflect and to investigate more in the situation. Is saving bees our duty? Is our project good? Is it worth taking risks involved? Bioethical dilemmas that will be addressed below.

SVA12:  This is a composite part of SVA18 (strong RBS) after SVA6 (ArsR).  Originally intended for SVA3 instead of SVA18, but complications with SVA3 led to use of SVA18 instead.  The RBS was placed after the ArsR domain before adding a fluorescent indicator.
SVA13:  This is a composite part of SVA4 (double terminator) placed after SVA5 (mCherry).  Adding a terminator after mCherry would allow for subsequent ligation to as the indicator behind a sensory domain.
SVA15:  This is a composite part of SVA7 (RBS+aeBlue) before SVA4 (double terminator).  It completes the indicator portion of aeBlue for subsequent addition to a sensory domain.
SVA19: This is a composite of SVA7 before SVA4- it is this same as SVA15.  It differs from SVA15 by using a newer batch of competent cells in attempt to determine why aeBlue yields no fluorescence.
SVA16: This is a composite part of SVA7 (RBS+aeBlue) after SVA14 (LacI promoter).  The LacI promoter was added to aeBlue to verify its functionality as a colorimetric indicator.  The results were unsatisfactory, the aeBlue gene may be faulty.
SVA17: This is a composite part of SVA8 (RBS+eforRed) after SVA14 (LacI promoter).  The LacI promoter was added to eforRed to verify is functionality as a colorimetric indicator.  The results provided the chassis with significant amounts of fluorescence.
SVA20:  This is a composite part of SVA8 (RBS+eforRed) before SVA4 (double terminator).  It completes the indicator portions of eforRed for subsequent addition to a sensory domain.

Team biotin: this week, we worked on the production assay for biotinylated proteins in E. coli. Furthermore, we cloned BirA in the pPIC plasmid and we checked it by digestion and sequencing. After that, we cloned RFP, scygonadin and BFP in this plasmid to produce the proteins in Pichia pastoris.
Team coli: in order to show the efficiency of the second Cerberus head, we needed a Cerberus which has just its CBM3a head and the streptavidin head. We did a directed mutagenesis on the stop codon to create Orthos.
13/08 - 17/08:
Team biotin: we produced biotinylated proteins with E. coli, with and without biotin in the culture medium.
20/08 - 24/08:
Team coli: this week was a particularly busy week. We produced and purified Orthos as well as for Sirius and mRFP1. This allowed us to perform a cellulose pull down assay with Sirius and mRFP1 as a negative control. In addition, we produced Cerberus. To do this, we  co-transformed BL21 DE3 cells with pET28 Cerberus and pEVOL AzF. The cell culture medium was complemented with the AzF unnatural amino acid to allow its incorporation. Cerberus was purified by a cellulose pull-down assay.
Team pSB1C3: we created this new team to start the pSB1C3 clonings. PCRs were performed on our gBlocks. Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to amplify all the gBlocks.
27/08 - 31/08:
Team coli: in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the third Cerberus head, we did a click assay with DBCO-fluorescein.

The palm oil industry is well-known for having a short payback period and is highly productive. If replaced by another sector, the new industries run the risk of being far less economical and efficient. Moreover, the palm oil industry is able to provide a better living for the workers by allowing the government to be able to provide basic facilities for the workers and the families in some properly planned plantations and mills.
Without the steady business for the countries that the palm oil industry provides, and without a real viable alternative to the wealth of income generated through this sector, it is probable that the unemployment figures will rise[10] and the living standard of the people who work in the palm oil industry might drop even lower. Therefore it is imperative to consider the implications of removing the palm oil industry completely from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia before introducing a synthetic alternative to this naturally-occurring product.

Introduction / Abstract
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model unicellular eukaryotic chassis; however when compared with Escherichia coli the available synthetic biology tools are lacking. To remedy this problem the 2010 Washington University iGEM team has introduced a synthetic alternative splicing tool, as well as designed and produced new BioBricks parts to ease transformation of synthetic constructs into S. cerevisiae. A mutually exclusive exon splicing system was formulated in which Sex-lethal interacts with the native splicing machinery to affect splice site choice. Two vectors have been designed to facilitate simple bacterial BioBrick manipulation and subsequent chromosomal integration into the yeast genome. A yeast positive selection marker BioBrick has been produced for the first time. Chromosomal integration with positive selection will stabilize and streamline BioBrick transformations into S. cerevisiae. A synthetic splicing assembly will allow for new synthetic biology techniques such as isoform engineering of proteins or combinatorial logic.

Nitrogen fixation is not easy. Hydrogenase is used in Nitrogen fixation, but its enzymatic activity is greatly diminished upon exposure to oxygen, thus decreasing efficiency.

Substrate selection
Fermentation by anaerobic bacteria of burnt waste matter from cities is too big of a scale
Wax seems to be the ideal substrate.
Group 3
1. Auto-inducible and auto-lytic system using quorum sensing
Quorum sensing gene: amplified with PCR(a PCR that increases rate of mutation)
Addition of Magnesium ion to a PCR reactant mixture(error-prone condition)
As PCR proceeds, gene mutations occur and these genes are replicated. Affinity difference between inducer and promoter becomes clearer and the concentration at which transcription begins changes. By screening the replicated genes’ affinity, we can obtain a library, and by inserting a GFP gene near a promoter, degree of expression can be determined. Differentiate genes based on time of GFP expression, measure their affinity, and select desired bacterial species.
Testing: Upon contacting the desired cell OD, is the target gene expressed? (Inducers differ in the concentrations they recognize.)
2. Basic tool: wax synthesis
Should the wax synthesis directed toward the cell interior, exterior, within the media?
- Directing it towards the surface of the media will be the most convenient method. Following synthesis, wax will float on the media which we simply will pick up.
Involvement of wax esterase and EtOH?
- The problem is, wax esterase is a dimer, making it difficult to display. On the other hand, making the microorganism secrete FA is too complex a task. We then came up with the idea of flipping the FA transporter.  If that’s difficult, we can try storing and stacking wax as layers within the organism, or try producing alcohol.
Instead of supplying substrates manually, inducing the microorganism to synthesize its necessary compounds may be possible. In doing so, we should not interfere with the beta-oxidation pathway. Altering such crucial pathway may result in cell death.
Using Atfat is an option."

Motivation for Igem Participation
I joined this team in a hope of further increasing my understanding of biotechnology, it has always interested me, and although it is not directly related to the degree I am aiming for (BSc Hons Medicinal Plants) it is a very important part of the world we live in today and its contribution to society is only growing larger each year. With endless possibilities, I felt that I needed to be a part of this community in some way, and I hope to make a large contribution to my team and also hope that my team makes a valuable contribution to scientific community.
Another reason that motivated my participation was the invaluable contribution that this opportunity would add to my CV, and the experience that would be gained in several of the laboratory techniques which will undoubtedly help me in my scientific career. In short, it is an amazing opportunity, and I am honoured to be a part of such an extraordinary team.

Motivation for Igem Participation
I have been exposed to science since a young age. My father is a virologist of the University of Pretoria and specializes in plant pathology. As a youngster I frequently accompanied to him work where I recall being fascinated by pH indicator colour changes, electron microscope images and the cabinets packed with arrays of chemicals. Growing up, my interest evolved from rocket science to (more realistically) chemistry and I finally settled on biology, specifically the molecular aspects.

Our Contribution
Through Project MARS, the BostonU HW Team has provided three key contributions towards increasing ease of accessibility and use of microfluidics in the synthetic biology community.
MARS Repository
The MARS repository benefits the greater synthetic biology community through hosting the designs of nine chips that are designed to perform essential synbio procedures.
These chips are:
Fabricated using a standardized rapid prototyping system
Separated into three categories (isolation, modification and quantification) which come together to replicate complex synthetic biology protocols
Provided to the user with full documentation and usage protocols
This provides a highly accessible and relevant platform for synthetic biologists to access, fabricate, test and integrate microfluidics into their lab workflow.
While these microfluidic devices have only been tested with colored water and oil, they provide a framework that can be built upon by future iGEM teams to allow for biological testing and optimization.
Fluid Functionality
Our fluid functionality checklist allows synthetic biologists to grade microfluidic devices fabricated from the MARS archive or designed using our software workflow. Through creating and introducing a standardized method of analyzing device functionality, synthetic biologists interested in utilizing microfluidics can quantitatively and qualitatively rate their chips prior to utilizing them in laboratory procedures.
Microfluidics 101
In order to overcome the knowledge barrier that exists between synthetic biology and microfluidics, MARS hosts a variety of educational materials aimed at synbio researchers interested in using our workflow.
Microfluidics 101 focuses on:
Increasing ease of access to basic educational materials regarding microfluidics
Providing clear and relevant material regarding our continuous flow microfluidics devices
Including detailed video tutorials and written protocols outlining fabrication using Makerfluidics
All three components of MARS come together to help make microfluidics a more accessible and practical tool for synthetic biology labs.
Our End Product
After 560 hours in the lab per team member working on:
Over 100 design iterations
85 milled and tested chips
340 fluid tests
80 hours editing video and written content
We are proud to present our project MARS in its entirety. Please feel free to navigate our Wiki to learn more about each branch of the project and how it"

Duke,2009,Team:Duke_-_-_TEXT.html," after denaturation, both single-stranded vector and inserts overlap with each other by end sequences and extend by using the other as the primer in a typical PCR reaction. After complete circular plasmids with one nick in each strand are formed, the relaxed plasmids are transformed to competent cells and sealed as closed plasmids. CPEC strategy is not only suitable for the cloning of an individual gene but also for gene libraries, combinatorial libraries and multi-fragment plasmid assembling. With its simplicity, cost-effectiveness and high transformation efficiency, CPEC has become the most convenient, economical and accurate cloning method at the present day, especially for cloning applications with high complexity.

Figure 1b. Multicomponent Biobrick system spliced into vector simulatenously using CPEC
One-Step Construction of a Bioplastic Production Pathway using CPEC
We applied CPEC in the construction of a multi-component  pathways in a single reaction. The proposed multi-way cloning mechanism is shown in Figure 1b. First, we constructed the biobrick parts containing genes involved in this pathway. Then we used multi-way CPEC for construction of  a metabolic pathway for synthesizing a biodegradable plastic, poly(3HB-co-4HB) in E. coli.
Biodegradable Plastic Synthesis Pathway in E. coli.
Figure 2. PHA granule production in bacteria
Recently, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) have received a lot of attention for their potential use as bioplastic. They are naturally occurring biopolymers – under low nitrogen, phosphorus, or oxygen conditions, many bacteria produce protein- and lipid-coated granules of PHA for energy storage, and these granules can then in turn be harvested in large quantities as bioplastics (Fig. 2). Bioplastics not only help reduce the reliance on petroleum-based plastics, but also have a wide range of applications in the agricultural and medical fields because they are biodegradable and biocompatible. The most common PHA is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), or poly(3HB), which is produced by the bacteria Cupriavidus necator. Three genes – phaA, phaB, and phaC – make up the phaCAB operon that synthesizes the enzymes required for formation of poly(3HB), which is not elastic enough for general plastic applications. But when phaCAB is expressed with cat2, a succinate degradation gene"

Genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is responsive to voltage signals at a transcriptional level.
Using our specifically designed CRZ1 binding elements in tandem with fluorescent reporter genes, we characterized calcineurin-CRZ1 mediated calcium response pathway in yeast. In doing so we have taken the first step in creating an interface between cellular systems and computers by allowing cells to respond to voltage signals, the language of computers.
Possible applications:
We see large scale applications in synthetic biology, for the integration of computer controlled voltage signals into gene expression control. We want to create a system where genes can be turned on and off with voltage signals that be delivered at precise and arbitrary intervals by computers, without having to deal with a hundred different and potentially costly chemical reagents. In effect, we want to make biology more easily engineerable.
We are looking into inducing the URA3 gene (required for uracil synthesis) in a URA3 null mutant to create yeast cells whose growth is dependent on a voltage signal. For example, this might take the form of a system whereby an SMS ""text"" message could be sent to a computer, which would stop electrostimulating cells, turning off uracil synthesis.  This way, a text message could effectively ""turn off"" cells without the need to even come into the lab!
We imagine that a voltage activated transcriptional response might be very useful in cardiovascular research.  For example, it might be used to model arrhythmias in cardiac tissue, because using our system of voltage (or calcium influx) activated transcription it might be possible to weed out cells displaying action potentials, like live muscle cells that are contracting. We hypothesize this could be done by causing a selectable transcriptional response to the calcium influx of the action potential.
We believe that the concept of voltage controlled transcription in yeast might have large industrial applications, specifically in the field of fermentation. By designing yeast that are taken in and out of the growth cycle by simple voltage signals we would be able to dynamically control, for example, yeast population density and hence fermentation rates in bioreactors. In theory, however, this voltage control could be tuned to modulate nearly any cellular behavior in any organism with a nucleus.

Rather than confuse them with unnecessary information, we boiled our project into a few short, easily understandable sentences, and spent most of the time on applications of the project in various fields including medicine and conservation biology. We were still able to have meaningful conversations with all of the attendees and hearing their interests in the potential in vivo application of our project confirmed our choice to switch from a chemical inducer system to a temperature sensitive inducer as discussed in our IHP .

Organisation
Our student team leaders Annabel, Nicole and Rick always managed to maintain an overview over all the different parts of our project. They introduced a proper team structure, met with university authorities to receive academic sponsoring and reminded us to meet all the important deadlines. Also, they planned and organised the team meetings and reached out to various people like professors and iGEM alumni who provided us with valuable advice to bring our project forward.
Johannes K. supported our project through networking in his position as a member of the student’s council of the faculty of biology. In the application process for academic sponsoring he provided us with valuable information about application forms and represented our financial request.
Wet Lab
Nicole, Rick and Annabel planned and conducted the first experiments for establishing our self-designed primers in a qPCR setting. They tested the designed primers with synthetic DNA templates and DNA from some cultured Plasmodia. After that Nicole and Rick tested primers for our qPCR for P. falciparum. They established the right parameters for our qPCRs to detect the DNA of Plasmodium and especially P. falciparum. Later they tested more cultured Plasmodia strains and made a multiplex qPCR with both primer/probe pairs.
The submission of the template as a positive control for our qPCR as a BioBrick was done by Nicole and Rick. They planned these experiments and managed to organise all the materials needed in the lab.
Annabel completed the Safety Form with the help of David and our PI Jochen Bodem.
Looking beyond the proof of principle towards medical application, we are curious if our proposed diagnostic device is able to detect Plasmodium in patient derived samples as well. To receive the permission to work with actual human blood samples requires a special agreement by the institutional ethics committee of our university. The applications, associated forms and documents for the use of patient derived blood samples involved the commitment of Susanna, Rick, Nicole, Annabel and David.
Special thanks to Andreas, Maria, Corinna, Bente, Frederick and Susanna for helping us to conduct our first GFP transfection experiments.

Groningen,2010,Team:Groningen#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html," production of vitamins in the plant. In exchange for these metabolites they plant will maintain the energy needs of the bacteria by  supplying them with  sugars from photosynthesis. This would be similar to the interaction that plants already have with some nitrogen fixating bacteria. These plant would be much more nutritional than normal crops.
Environmental
Bacterial solar cells Making a multistage solar energy converter using the battery bacteria of the havard team of 2008, by using three groups bacteria. The first would perform photosynthesis storing the solar energy in to simple metabolites like sugars. The second bacteria using these sugars to convert them into the specific nutrients the Harvard bacteria need. Last the Harvard bacteria would convert the products of the second metabolites into electricity.   Using Photosynthesis to produce energy in the form of electrons or pH gradient of some sort to transport the energy out of the cell to a circuit ( http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ises.conf....2S , http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Highlights/?section=2002&highlight=2002-08 )
Deacidifying bacteria The acidification in the oceans due to the high levels of co2 in the air have become a threat to lots of marine life especially coral reefs that are largely made of calcium and are threaded to dissolve in the increasingly acidic oceans. Bacteria with pH sensitive channels (MscL) sensing acidity and that are able to produce a base to counterbalance the acidification.
Bacteria that do not produce methane to replace methanogen bacteria in cow's rumen Isolated microbes in the animal's stomach which allows them to eat grass and plants but without producing the flatulence common to European livestock. Even though kangaroos have a similar system for utilising plants to sheep and cattle, they have evolved independently over many millions of years and so the microbes are extremely different. Rather than produce methane, kangaroos produce acetate which aids digestion.
Oil spill response - Bacteria cleaning it up. After oil spills the oil which is not removed mechanically is mostly degraded by bacteria (bioremediation) so far only adding fertilizer seems to help, the addition of living bacteria has mostly not shown any effect. I can think of three ways to use bacteria in order to improve bioremediation, 1: Nitrogen fixing bacteria could be added instead of fertilizer, Nitrogen fixing bacteria already exist, but I don’t know if they can life in oily environments.  2. Bacteria which can metabolize the compounds which so far can not be degraded by bacteria 3. Bacteria which are actually better at degrading"

    As the first time to participate in iGEM, we lack experience.             In order to be more effective in preparing for the competition,             we actively contacted with other excellent team, visited their             school to ask how to prepare for iGEM. These teams include: Peking, HZAU-China, HUST-China, FAFU-CHINA, WHU-China (2015).
We took photos with Peking team for memorial after the visit.
     In addition, we also participated in the 2016CCiC (Central China             iGEM Consortium), and exchanged ideas with the participants of             the 30 other teams, receiving a lot of valuable experience and advice.
All the participants took a group photo after the closing ceremony
     In view of the overall design and experimental design of the project,             we contacted with Jiang Huifeng, a researcher of Tianjin Institute             of Industrial Biotechnology of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Kang             Peng, a Proffessor of Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry CAS.             And we went to the laboratory to study the related mature theories and             experimental techniques of Blue Leaf.
As a Beginner, Be a Communicator.
    Because it is             the first time for us to participate in this competition, the             students around and teachers from other schools of our university             do not know much about synthetic biology and iGEM. In order to             promote iGEM and synthetic biology, we conducted three preach             activities. On the one hand, it attracted students from other             schools look down upon biology. On the one hand, it also letted             the teachers and students around us know that we are participating             in a very meaningful competition.
     At present, the high advancement of the Internet makes             information dissemination and exchange become fast and             convenient. In recent years, the rise of the network             video broadcast, makes three-dimensional exchange become             vivid, more time-sensitive. This year iGEM also called             on each iGEMor to ""Be Social"". As the sponsor and the main             planner, we jointly organized ""Talk with LanZhou, Talk about             i"

TU_Eindhoven,2014,Team:TU Eindhoven#Safety#Kill Switch_-_-_TEXT.html," work? First, the bacterium is induced with IPTG outside the human body. The plasmid in the bacteria has to be IPTG inducible. The IPTG can turn on an IPTG sensitive promotor and then turns up the lambda suppressor (CI) concentration in the cell which will increase exponentially [1]. A Spo0A gene can be implemented behind a promotor that is sensitive for CI. The toggle will activate Spo0A when it reaches the set concentration of CI.
Timer
An increase of phosphorylation of Spo0A (Spo0AP) can cause pulses with an increase in amplitude within every pulse [2].  When reaching a certain concentration of Spo0AP, a Spo0AP sensitive promotor will initiate the cell death.
Figure 2. Phosphorelay gene circuit
controlling sporulation initiation.
Adapted from Levine et al. (2012).
Spo0AP
Controlling Spo0A activation includes a lot of interactions shown in Figure 2 . Histidine kinases including KinA, transfer phosphates to Spo0A and autophosphates Spo0A through a phosphorelay consisting of Spo0B and Spo0F [2]. However the total level of Spo0AP is reduced by phosphates for instance phosphates from the phosphorelay  are drained by rap through Spo0F and Spo0E dephosphorylates Spo0AP [2]. A high level of Spo0AP can induce sporulation in B. subtilis [2]. But in our case a high level of Spo0AP will be necessary to initiate cell death.
Pulses
The increase in amplitude of pulses is caused by a positive feedback loop [2]. The Spo0A activity pulses activate kinase transcription and this will increase the amplitude of the Spo0A pulses and an increase in kinase activity increases de Spo0A activity pulses shown in Figure 3 [2].
Figure 3. Here is shown that in each cycle the peak
amplitude (gray) increases. In green the pulse growth
in a hypothetical trajectory is shown.
Adapted from Levine et al. (2012).
Conclusion
This kill switch idea is not yet complete for our project and is still a concept. One issue is that the Phosphorelay gene circuit controlling sporulation initiation is found in B. subtilis, which is a gram positive bacterium and not in E. coli which is a gram negative bacterium. Therefore it is hard to implement this system in E. coli. Another issue is that our plasmids are IPTG induced just like this kill"

We will also be checking team Nottingham’s freeze dried bacteria to check for their growth.
Team Peshawar helped in us in the area of Human Practices by speaking to clinicians in Pakistan about the issue of antimicrobial resistance and about how a device such as ours can benefit them.
We supported the iGEM teams of Westminster, Warwick and University College London by attending the UK iGEM meetup
https://2017.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/Collaborations
Human Practices
The team started off with the idea to build a cheap, DIY well-plate reader that could be used in a range of different applications - in medicine, research and academics. Whilst exploring the role this device would play in each of these fields, meetings with healthcare professionals and GPs in the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Northern General, Royal Liverpool Hospital as well as international diagnostic labs in Cyprus, Poland and Sri Lanka the team discovered that the most pressing problem our device could address was AMR.
The team also met with a lab technician in the undergraduate teaching labs at the University of Sheffield who informed us about the different experiments that our device could be used in and also gave us some feedback on areas of improvement.
We met with Dr. Lynda Partridge, senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield, who provided us with guidelines on how to ensure that our research was inline with the data protection act (1998) and common law duty of confidence.

After this step, we cocultured confirmed transformants in a 10mL LB medium and extracted the plasmid with the 〖E.Z.N.A.〗^TM  plasmid mini kit I (produced by Omega Bio-tek). The plasmid was transformed into JW3379 and 48 single clones were picked. JW3379 chemically component cells were prepared by the following protocol. This library was named after sweet pressure part RBS library in this iGEM project.
Figure. 10 mutation rate measurement induced by our engineered mutD mutator
In this week, we also measured the mutation rate increase induced by mutD mutator. The basic protocol was provided as attachment “mutation rate measurement”. To be brief, strains E.coli JM109 carrying vectors pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP, pBAD_B0032-mutD-sfGFP and pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFP were cultured in LB medium and induced by 1g/L arabinose and the specific fluorescence of sfGFP (excitation 488nm, emission 512nm) (fluorescence to OD600) was measured. Thus, we made sure that pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP, and pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFP have relatively higher mutD expression. Thus, only the mutation rate of pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP, and pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFP were measured in the condition of arabinose induction by 1g/L and strains carrying pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP without arabinose induction and wild type JM109 were set as negative control. We followed the protocol provided and found that pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFP could increase the genome mutation rate up to 10 times compared with negative control. The results were shown as the figure below.
Week8（8.14-8.21）
In this week, we tested the performance of our constructed tetA based selection pressure circuit. We were trying very hard to finely tune the culture condition to make our system have desired tryptophan dependent property. However, we only obtained very weak such property. First of all, we cultured E.coli JM109 carrying pTrc99A_trp sensor_RBS_tetA series of plasmid in"
Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#outreach#policy_-_-_TEXT.html," came to the fore such as the use of mutated micro-organisms in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense stricken countries as a mode of biological control.
The discussion emphasized that a biological control agent re-engineered using synthetic biology is superior in several aspects: the specificity of the production of the fungal growth inhibitors upon fusaric acid detection and the self-termination of the biological control agent when the inducer is no longer present. Two components synthetic biology can offer to reduce the impact on the environment. Policy regarding synthetic biology was also discussed and several questions raised. How do you stimulate innovation but maintain a level of control and safety? What form should the public discourse take on a national level? To what extent would the BananaGuard application be accepted and legal in Europe? Though none of these questions could be answered in the given time the groundwork for a push in handling these issues has been laid. Concluding; a lot of the work still lies ahead of us, not just on a technical level. The event was fruitful and given the prospect of a yearly cooperation between the Dutch iGEM teams and the RIVM the future looks bright.
The report of the RIVM can be found here.
Team members Max and Bob during the poster session and discussion afterwards.
Future Impact
Wageningen approaching the RIVM in this manner has paved the way for a long term cooperation between the Institute and iGEM students. As it stands the symposium will be repeated next year with the Dutch iGEM teams of 2015. The yearly cooperation means a genuine impact can be made regarding the policies that will be developed over the coming years. By elaborating on our individual iGEM projects, government employees and policy makers can be updated on the current status of synthetic biology. Aspiring synthethic biologists can have an open dialogue in which both the technical and societal limitations of their prospective field can be discussed. In a sense the experience of iGEM can be shared through us with those determining its legal boundaries.

Human Practice
This year, we also had close collaboration with USTC wet team on human practice, for the simple reason that none of us is biology major and we had to resort to biology major fellows for professional advice. Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together. The collaboration with them not only enhanced the quality of our work, but improved the biology knowledge of our own.

Construction
We based the mathematical construction on the physical structure of ALPHA.
From the top to the bottom:
A circle centered at the origin with radius TR, named O
Make three lines A1, A2, and A3 such that:
The lines Ax are perpendicular to a tangent of O and a radius of O,
The angle between the radii of A1 and A2 is φ1, and
The angle between the radii of A2 and A3 is φ2.

They are on the circumference of P,
The angle between the radius which touches P1 and the radius that touches P2 is φ1,
The angle between the radius which touches P2 and the radius that touches P3 is φ2,
The ray from the center of P to Px is parallel to the ray from the center of O to the point which is on Ax and O 's circumference, for all x.
Construct three line segments CA1, CA2, and CA3 such that:
CAx is in the same plane as Ax, for all x,
The length of CAx is CA, and

UEA-JIC_Norwich,2011,Team:UEA-JIC Norwich#UKConference_-_-_TEXT.html," was the chance to meet other teams. We felt that interactions between teams would be of vital benefit. We ourselves had been wondering where we stood in comparison to other teams; whether we had progressed as far as we should have; how outlandish was our project in comparison to others; and lastly but certainly not least: had we bitten off more than we could chew? The conference allowed all of the UK iGEM teams the chance to ascertain the answers to all of these questions during the short, twenty minute presentations we organised to be held by each team. All of these were fascinating, and have been uploaded onto our WIKI for the viewing pleasure of other teams, both those that participated and other teams from further afield. These presentation videos offer the chance for all UK iGEM teams to analyse their performance when presenting and therefore provide practice for the European Jamboree.
We also arranged a series of talks by presenters we felt would be interesting to other teams. Our own Supervisor, Dr Paul O Maille, of the JIC/ IFR (institute of Food Research) gave a talk: ""Biosynthesis and Synthetic Biology"", which revealed much about his work on Turpene structure, evolution and applications, as well as sharing his views on the idea of Synthetic Biology as a whole, still a much disputed concept. Baojun Wang, of Imperial College London, gave a talk on ""A robust, orthogonal and modular genetic logic gate design, forward engineered for digital-like Synthetic Biology"". His presentation delved into the engineering perspective of Synthetic Biology, a viewpoint that, while often mentioned, is not necessarily always acknowledged. We sought Baojun's views as we felt they were vital to the iGEM competition, which focuses heavily on the marrying of Engineering and Biology. ""Design, characterisation and imaging tools for engineering genetic circuits"", was another fascinating talk delivered by James Brown, of the University of Cambridge. This talk showed clearly the importance of proper characterisation of Biobricks, as well as demonstrating several methods of doing so. Lastly we saw a talk from Andy Bulmer, of the University of Manchester: ""Beyond the survey...What is human practices for?"" This was an especially useful presentation on an often neglected topic, in which Andy highlighted the importance of a philosophical approach to the science we, as an iGEM team, were conducting.
The conference was not all work, however! We took care to ensure that it was an enjoyable experience as well as a valuable one. We arranged an evening's entertainment at the JIC, with catering provided by Papa John's pizzeria of Norwich"

Ligation was performed for the following: RBS + crtE (from pC13J) into pSB1AK8 to create pAK13CQ, RBS + crtB (from pAK13CR) into pSB1C3 to create pC13CV, ctrB (from pC13M) into pC13BG to create pC13DP, RBS + crtI (from pC13L) into pSB1AK8 to create pAK13CS. We transformed T7 + hph (pC13BV) into BL21 cells and plated on chloramphenicol plates. Unfortunately they arced, so we will need to repeat that with clean electroporation cuvettes. We poured more CYM plates.
We set up the PCR to append KpnI and BamHI cut sites to pC13F again with different annealing temperatures and ran a gel to test the PCRs. Ran Gibson for pC13AI. A large Q5 PCR was done on fluorescent constructs pC13BQ with pC13AT, pC13BQ with pC13AU, pC13BR with pC13AU, pC13BR with pC13AT, and pAK13AO with pC13F. We ran the gel for pAK13CR from yesterday. We ligated the following: RBS + crtE to make pAK13CQ, RBS + crtB to make pC13CV, ctrB + pC13BG to make pC13DP, RBS + crtI to make pAK13CS. We attempted to transform pC13BV into BL21 E. coli, but failed. We then poured CYM plates.

We ran through our slides for the full team.  We received a lot of good advice, and we still have a lot of work to do, but most of it will have to wait until after tuesday so we don’t fail our orgo exam! The main suggestion would be to change the theme of the presentation as the baby blue and serene green are too subtle to captivate attention. In addition, there are little glitches to the images.

Day 1 (25/06/14): 
After a meeting with our advisors yesterday, we came into the lab this morning and began learning how to prepare competent cells.  
We prepared: 
100mM CaCl2 – autoclaved 
100mM CaCl2 + 30% v/v glycerol – autoclaved 
100ml LB media (1g Tryptone, 0.5g Yeast extract, 1g Sodium Chloride) - autoclaved 
 
E.coli was added to 5ml of LB and incubated overnight at 37° 
Pipette tips, conical flasks, bottles etc were also autoclaved ready for tomorrow 
Also discussed possible project ideas and booked a room in the library to discuss theses as a group tomorrow.  
 
Day 2 (26/06/14): 
Today we carried on with the preparation of the competent cells. 
E.coli that had been incubating overnight was inoculated into LB and grown at 37°C until the OD600 reached 0.4. Cells were then cooled in the cold room and then centrifuged at 3000rpm, 4°C for 8mins. Pellet was resuspended in 100mM CaCl2, incubated on ice and centrifuged again. Pellet was again resuspended in 100mM CaCl2, 30% v/v glycerol and divided into 33 x 100µl in eppendorfs and stored at -80°C.  
We began to prepare 100ml of LB agar (1g Tryptone,   0.5g Yeast extract, 1g Sodium Chloride, 2g agar), this was autoclaved   but we then discovered we had no Chloramphenicol so could not continue   preparing the plates.  
We also spent a few hours discussing parts and looking through the registry, and discussing different ideas. 
 
Day 3 (27/06/14):

Parameter ka is introduced in the model considering the influence of the previous choice of C. elegans on the following one, and parameter kb represents the extent of their preference to certain chemicals.
Comparing the experiment statistics with the simulation result, we come to two conclusions:
It is feasible to simulate the choice-making process of C.elegans in the Gaussian Plate.
The turning side of the first step increase the possibility of choosing the same side at the next step by 30%.

Model for Neuron Network
This model is built to select neurons which may have signal connections with neurons AWA and AWB and to determine the specific promoters to express gene in them.
After we successfully integrated Odr-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry and Str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP fusion genes in C. elegans( Caenorhabditis elegans ) respectively, we can train worms by stimulating neurons AWA and AWB. After that, we hope to focus on the neuron network change due to new learning behaviors. For example, after the worm is addicted to alcohol, will the neuronal activation pattern surrounding the AWA, AWB neuron also change?
Fig.3 The purpose of this model is to select promoters used in neurons which have greatest probability to be lighted on when AWA and AWB are active.
To achieve that, the optogenetic design will be applied on the downstream neurons of AWA and AWB. 2 steps are considered:
Select the neurons that are strongly connected with AWA, AWB.
Select specific promoters to express GEM-GECO in the neurons.

Georgia_State,2015,Team:Georgia State#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," issues surrounding cannabidiol, our team decided to be proactive to avoid bringing any negative attention to GSU or iGEM. We first began by seeking approval from our university's biosafety committee by submitting our Institutional Biosafety Committee form. After we received their approval we began drafting a legislative handout about our project so that we could inform legislators about what we were doing and discuss the legal aspects. We then compiled a list of representatives to contact, and contacted their offices about scheduling a time to meet with the representatives. So far we haven’t been able to talk to any representatives directly about our project, but we are hoping to be able to reach several representatives before the Jamboree.
Legislative Handout
This handout was given to Georgia legislators that are members of the GA Legislature. A meeting has been set up with Representative Matt Hatchett on September 22nd, 2015, to discuss the purpose of our research and how research such as this can be beneficial to the GA economy.

Improved Part – BBa_K2868028
4xCBD Fusion Protein Expression System T7 promoter, a salI cut-site, then a start codon then a Flag, Lumio, 6x polyhistidine tag, followed by BBacillus circulans chitin binding domain, flexible linker, S. griseus chitin chitin binding domain, then another linker, followed by Bacillus circulans chitin binding domain, flexible linker, S. griseus chitin binding domain, stop codon, a bglII cut-site, and finally t7 terminator.
This composite part contains all the biological DNA machinery to constitutively express the fusion protein 4xCBD when functional T7 DNA polymerase is inside the cell with the plasmid carrying the composite part. The fusion protein is four chitin binding domains fused together with flexible linkers. Our rationale was that four chitin binding domains would allow each protein to bind strongly to chitin than a single chitin binding domain alone, and also allow for the linking of two different chitin surfaces when pressed together with this protein acting as a glue in between them. This is an improvement upon the basic part BBa_T2028, which is a single B. circulans chitin-binding domain. Our fusion protein includes two BBa_T2028 B.circulans chitin binding domains, and an additional two chitin binding domains from S. griseus. We diversified the chitin binding domains to allow for easier DNA printing of our part. This whole linked structure also incorporates a 6x polyhistidine tag for the purification of the protein product.
We were able to successfully express this construct in the BL21 derivative E. coli cell line T7 Express from New England Biolabs, purify this protein using Ni-NTA spin columns for his-tagged protein purification, and test it as a bioadhesive on mycelium (as the fungal cell wall incorporates chitin) and cardboard substrates. Although it actually bonded cardboard together slightly stronger than it bonded mycelium together, it"

Elevated ALT levels may be due to other factors (such as muscle inflammation or myopathies), whereas elevated levels of miRNAs are specific to acetaminophen overdose induced liver injury. [33] Therefore miRNAs again show great promise as future biomarkers to aid in diagnosis of DILI.
MiRNAs as biomarkers are also applicable to other conditions from myocardial infarction [36] to pregnancy [37] and associated complications like pre-eclampsia. [38]
The specificity of miRNAs is key - their restricted expression profiles gives them great potential to be used as biomarkers for specific tissue or stage specific diseases. [13] However, it is important to note further studies with larger patient cohorts are needed for clinical tests to be developed for the examples mentioned here.
Our method of quantifying miRNAs cheaply and effectively has the potential to diagnose and screen for a myriad of diseases. Our sensor could save millions of lives through the early detection of cancer and helping diagnose other diseases.
Applications in developing countries
Professor Sam Janes, Professor of Respiratory Medicine at UCL, said that for less economically developed countries, our test could be the ‘the biggest life saving intervention on the field.’ Dr Daniel Pregibon also emphasized this could be one of the main applications of our project.
Aapproximately 58% of lung cancer cases in 2012 occurred in less developed countries. [39] Solid household fuels for cooking and heating are prevalent in one third of South African households and a significant proportion of (8.7% to 34.6%) males in Benin, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone and Swaziland are moderate smokers. [40]

The low cost of our sensor, combined with its relative simplicity (specialists are not required to interpret the results) means it could complement emerging healthcare systems in these less developed countries. Cervical cancer screening programs have been beneficial in developed countries. The World Health Organization, state the main reasons why screening tests aren’t implemented in less developed countries are (the same reasons would be true for NSCLC): [41]
The various competing health needs such as HIV/Aids in Sub-Saharan Africa, communicable diseases and maternal or perinatal complications
A lack of developed infrastructure for traditional diagnosis after screening such as high-quality cytology labs, transportation of samples"

Prototype Results
Aiming to build a Tristable Switch which could successfully show three main features: distinct and steady signal outputs with rapid state-switching ability, we carried out the characterisation of our prototype to see if the construct could fulfil all our needs. This could also provide us with some intuitions in the way of fine tuning the whole construct in order to ameliorate the"

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," Experts in the topic of biotechnology were invited from the field of science and industry. The iGEM team from Darmstadt could get Dr. Maurer for the panel discussion, who had worked 25 years for Henkel and became new Director of Business Development of AB Enzymes. Prof. Dingermann from the Goethe University in Frankfurt took part as a scientific representative for the red biotechnology. Prof. Warzecha of the TU Darmstadt was proponent as Instructor of the iGEM team as well as a representative of the green biotechnology. For the ethical and moral issues in the field of biotechnology, the team from Darmstadt got Prof. Nordmann, who deals with the philosophy of Synthetic Biology. At the beginning of the event, Prof. Warzecha conducted a presentation on biotechnology. He gave the audience a short overview of biotechnology and its applications in today's world. He spoke to the fears of the people and tried to clarify them. This was followed by the presentation of the project of the iGEM team by Arne Wehling. Afterwards was a ""get-together"", in which the audience could talk to speaker and members of the iGEM team. The audience had the opportunity to write down questions on flipcharts that should be answered in the upcoming panel discussion. In the subsequent discussion were the issues of the flipcharts discussed with the audience and the experts. The panel was moderated by Henrik Cordes, who also brought in the discussion as a representative of the team. The event officially ended after three hours, but enough guests remained until late in the evening with the experts and students to discuss about the pro and contra of biotechnology and also Synthetic Biology. It was a good step of the iGEM team of Darmstadt to organize this interactive panel discussion, as it allowed reaching the people. The event shown young scientist, which concerns prevail in the human and which misinformation need to be clarify.
25th August 2012 ""Umweltbörse Darmstadt""
At the 3rd Anual Meeting of Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+ the eleven German iGEM teams agreed to a common event throughout Germany on Synthetic Biology. This took place on 25th August in the respective cities. The TU Darmstadt iGEM team was particularly lucky, because at this time the environmental agency of the city of Darmstadt organized an environmental event on the Ludwigs Platz in the heart of Darmstadt. This meant that the iGEM team got the opportunity to explain their project to people from small to large in more detail"

Add 600 µl of 10% arabinose to the culture to cause the induction of the λ-Red genes. Incubate for 15 minutes at 30°C.
Chill the culture in a water-ice bath. Transfer to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 4600 x g for 7 minutes in a centrifuge cooled to 4°C.
Add 30 ml of ice-cold water to the pellet. Swirl gently to resuspend the cells. Centrifuge again as described in step 5.
Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of cold ddH2O. Transfer it using a 1000 µl tip to a pre-chilled sterile EP tube. Centrifuge down at 10.000 x g for 4 seconds in a chilled tabletop centrifuge. (Note, due to speed-up time, doing a quickspin up to 10.000 x g and then letting it slow down is usually good enough) Carefully pipette out the supernatant.
Repeat step 7.
Resuspend cells in 200 µl of chilled ddH2O. Keep on ice until ready to transform.
Transformation
Using a 1-mm transformation culture, electroporate 100 ng of pTargetTet plasmid and 400 ng of linear donor DNA in 50 µl of competent cells (Note: when using an ssDNA oligo instead of dsDNA linear donor DNA, transform 100 ng of the plasmid with 100 ng of oligo). Recover the cells at 30°C for 1 hour in SOC medium then plate on LB-Tet-Kan plates. Incubate the plate at 30°C overnight. (Note: it often takes up to 48 hours for colony to show up).
Screen transformant by colony PCR to identify correct clones.
Plasmid curing
To cure the plasmids, resuspend a colony in 2 ml of LB-Kan to which 10 µl of IPTG 0,1 M are added (Final concentration: 0,5 mM) and the culture is grown overnight at 30 °C. In the morning, the colonies are plated on LB plates and incubated at 37°C O/N to cure them of the pCas plasmid.

Helpful Notes
Numbers in brackets and with green background.
Primers: Oligonucleotide primers are generally 20-40 nucleotides long and ideally have a GC-content of 40-60%. The final concentration of each in a PCR reaction may be 0.2-1mM while 0.4µM is recommended.
PfuS DNA polymerase concentration: recommended use of 1 U per 50 µl reaction. However, the optimal concentration of PfuS DNA polymerase may vary from 0.5-2 U per 50 µl reaction depending on ampicon length and difficulty. DO not exceed 2U/50 µl reaction, especially for amplicons longer than 5kb.
Keep the denaturation as short as possible. Usually 5-10 seconds at 98°C is enough for most templates. Note: The denaturation time and temperature may vary depending on the ramp rate and temperature control mode of the cycler.
The PfuS DNA polymerase has the ability to stabilize primer-template hybridization. As a basic rule for primers >20 nt, anneal for 10-30sec at a Tm +3°C of the lower primer. For primers <20 nt use an annealing temperature equal to the Tm of the lower primer. Calculate Tm for matching sequence with IDT Oligoanalyzer
Extension time depends on ampicon length and complexity. For low complexity DNA (plasmid, lambda or BAC DNA) use extension time of 30sec per 1kb. For high complexity the extension time can be extended to 2min per 1kb.
Final Extension is an optional step which usually does not influence the outcome and can be skipped by default.
PCR purification can be skipped, depending on the buffer which is used during PCR. Dpnl is not active in Phusion HF-buffer from NEB.
Incubation time can be increased up to overnight for completely digestion.

Fitting to Experimental Data
Simple Binding Model
Our first approach was to solve a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) resembling the transcription and translation of a gene activated by the DNT-sensitive promoter. The ODEs were derived from the following system of reactions:  $$ P_{R} + \ DNT \ \overset{k_{on}}{\underset{k_{off}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \ P_{A} \tag{1}$$  $$ P_{A} \ \xrightarrow{s_{A}} \ P_{A} + \ mRNA \tag{2}$$  $$ P_{R} \ \xrightarrow{s_{R}} \ P_{R} + \ mRNA \tag{3} $$  $$ mRNA \ \xrightarrow{s_{P}} \ mRNA + \ R \tag{4} $$  $$ mRNA \ \xrightarrow{d_{M}} \ \emptyset \tag{5} $$  $$ R\ \xrightarrow{d_{P}} \ \emptyset \tag{6} $$  In these reaction equations, \(P_{R}\) and \(P_{A}\) indicate respectively repressed and active promoters. DNT indicates DNT molecules, mRNA stands for an mRNA molecule transcribed from the gene behind the promoter and R is the reporter protein which is translated from the mRNA. \(k_{on}\) and \(k_{off}\) are the rates at which a promoter goes from the repressed to the active state and vice versa. \(s_{A}\) is the transcription rate from an active promoter. \(s_{R}\) is the transcription rate from a repressed promoter; this is also referred to as leakage. \(s_{P}\) is the translation rate. \(d_{M}\) and \(d_{P}\) are the mRNA and protein degradation rates.
Reaction (1) describes the activation and deactivation of a promoter in the presence of DNT. We assume that the activation mechanism can be described as the binding of the DNT to the repressed promoter, with the resulting complex being an active promoter. Reaction (2) describes transcription. Reaction (3) described transcription through leakage, i.e. transcription from a re"
