Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#IntroductoryLabwork#9 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,"The gel displaying the three marker bands - the cyan, dark blue and yellow marker bands
We need to get ourselves familiarised with conducting DNA gel electrophoresis. We shall be doing this by preparing and then inserting the plasmid DNA (extracted from the 10 colonies of cells) into the gel. At this stage, the plasmids will be inserted as uncut objects because no restriction enzymes have been added yet (the analysis of cut plasmids comes at a later stage). Thus we won't be proving that it is the BioBrick which is causing the bacteria to display the properties seen so far. We will be proving that the bacteria have taken up plasmids.
This procedure will see the team:
Prepare the DNA electrophoresis equipment by preparing the gel, administering buffer and ethidium bromide, etc
Prepare the plasmid DNA for gel electrophoresis.
Apply the DNA to the gel and conduct electrophoresis
Capture an image of the gel using UV-scanner.
Experiment procedures
Melting of the 0.8% agarose gel
Pouring of TAE buffer + ethidium bromide
The protocol we used for this practical can be found ' here .'
Preparing the gel
A premade stock solution of agarose gel (0.8% agarose) was taken and heated in microwave for 3 minutes under medium/high power initially. Short 30 second bursts were required to completely liquify the solution
Gel was then removed from microwave and left on bench to cool
Preparing the buffer
Premade solution of 1x TAE was used - took volume of this and added to flask
Added 8 microlitres to the TAE buffer
Preparing the gel electrophoresis equipment
Trays and comb were cleaned and provided for the team, thanks to the lab staff!
Inserted comb into groove nearest the edge of the tray and placed in proximity of the electrodes.
Pouring Buffer and Gel
Placed the 1x TAE buffer (plus ethidium bromide) into the tray (with gel comb inserted in groove nearest negative electrode)
Agarose gel solution placed into tray and bubbles removed using a pipette. After this, lid placed over the gel electrophoresis equipment.
Preparing DNA samples
Jane extracting dye to be added to plasmid DNA
Removed 10 Eppendorf tubes (containing the plasmid DNA for the 10 colonies of E.coli) from the freezer and defrosted them briefly. In the meantime, 10 fresh Eppendorf"

Overview
The Purpose under Every Deed
We define Human Practice as a progress of evolution, which transforms our project into a better situation by receiving and giving back. By looking to our past and teasing out the most important threads--the experience we've had, the people we've been influenced by, the lives we've touched and the highs and lows we've faced, we've indeed made our project profound and meaningful. In brief, it's about ""Sharing, giving and mutual interaction"". Thus, we categorized our Human Practice into three major pieces “WHY-WHAT-HOW” for highlighting the importance of these roles. ”While most people plunge through their lives focusing on the what and how, they rarely takes the time to identify the one purpose, cause or belief that is at the heart of who they are.”, written by Simon Sinek, and indeed, we’re now following its steps to find out a practical guide for us to discover the purpose for every deeds we’ve made. We are going to guide you through our work-of-art, realizing that what we value the most are nothing more than “Sharing and Reciprocity”. We created integrated work and dialogues from human practices, education and public engagement. We also learned SWOT analysis and marketing our product through entrepreneurship.

Part 1 Sense Fatty Acids: We investigated four different sensing mechanisms using: 1) fatty acid metabolism regulator protein (FadR), 2) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) 3) liver- fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) and 4) binding immunoglobulin protein, HSP5 or glucose regulated protein (GRP78). The four sensing mechanisms were measured and compared.
Part 2 Introduce Glyoxylate Shunt: We introduced two key enzymes of glyoxylate cycle: isocitrate lyase (ACEA) and malate synthase (ACEB), which allow plants and bacteria to use fatty acids as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Here, the amount of fatty acids was measured to compare fatty acids uptake rates of cells expressing glyoxylate shunt.
Integration of Parts: The integration of sensing mechanism and glyoxylate shunt allows inducible glyoxylate shunt, in which the high levels of free fatty acids in the medium increase fatty acid uptake rate of glyoxylate shunt.
Although the problem of malnutrition may remain unsolved, the inducible glyoxylate shunt introduced to mammalian cell increases consumption of fatty acids, lowering the risk of excessive fat accumulation that presents risk to health.

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 is also needed. The co-culture system itself could provide this since the production organism is using the carbon excreted by the cyanobacteria, closer calculations are however needed to evaluate the balance in this reaction. Another possible solution is to couple a production facility such as this to a fossil carbon burning power plant and capturing the released CO2 and feeding it into your bioreactors. Furthermore, the transparency of the culture is important to maintain lighting conditions for the cyanobacteria; this severely limits the biomass concentration achievable in the culture. A possible solution to this problem is separation of the two organisms by a permeable membrane or even into separate reactors with a shared volume of media circulating both cultures.
It is clear that a viable chemical production industry based on biosynthesis still has many hurdles to pass. However, with the rapid progress the field of synthetic biology is making we are confident these problems can be solved; and as discussed previously in this section the need for them to be solved is great, and growing quickly.
Viewing possible futures to find our own
The science of synthetic biology can arguably be described as one of the most powerful technologies that humankind has ever conceived. Granted, this technology is still in its infancy, but as many other branches of science it carries the burden of incredible destructive capacity. But in contrast to many other scientific fields, the tremendous potential for productive and life-saving uses are even more evident in the field of synthetic biology. With both of these potentials follows several ethical and philosophical questions on how to advance the frontier of this technology.
Its destructive capacity is, in our opinion, undeniable, but equally so is its potential for good. Both of these are of course dependent on how the technology is applied and used and just as with most of our modern technology, it can be abused. The question is, can we allow tremendous good to be held back by an imaginary situation where the technology is misused? How do we balance its creative power with its destructive ability?
Like many questions it comes down to people. Do we trust the character of ourselves as people to handle this powerful tool? One could also look to history: Have we done so in the past with other scientific discoveries? One could argue that our track record is questionable to say the least.
But what about the future? Of course learning from the future is hard since we do not know it, but imagining it can help us find out where we want to go.
To try to encourage reflection and debate around these questions, our team has applied speculative design into our integrated human practices. In contrast to science, which aims to describe how things are, the purpose of speculative design"

Calculating promoter strengths
A brief discription of how some of our promoter strengths were calculated follows:
The paper ""Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using an in vivo reference standard"" published in the Journal of Biological Engineering makes J23101 their reference standard, giving it a strength of 0.03 POPS.
We can directly compare the strengths of all the J series constititive promoters using other promoters in the above paper and the promoters in the standard registry of parts website. From this page we can calculate that if J23101 =0.03 pops then our original LuxI and LuxR promoter J23107 has a strength of ~0.018 POPS and our ammended model LuxR promoter has a strength of ~0.01 POPS. We also find that our constitutive Antiholin promoter has a strength of ~0.0066 POPS
LuxR promoter polymerase per second (PoPS)  The following
BioBrick F2620 defines the LuxR responsive promoter. This has been assessed as having 6.6 PoPS promoter activity, i.e. 6.6 RNA polymerisation events per second.  However, this seemed unlikely;  the most active promoter in E.coli has about 2 polymerisations per second. At the iGEM meeting in Edinburgh this year Dr Stansfield attended on behalf of the team were he met Barry Canton, the actual experimenter who deduced the 6.6 PoPS.  When questioned he stated that he measured the PoPS value in PoPs per cell;  the LuxR promoter/GFP construct was on a ‘15 copies per cell’ plasmid, thus there were 15 copies of the LuxR promoter."

SURAJ (Sue-Ruj) MOHAN
Suraj is sophomore entering Biological Engineering with a specific focus in the Cellular and Biomolecular track. At first, he was hesitant on whether this major was right for him, but after spending time and working with his fellow iGEM family, he now realizes where his passion is and is determined to do the best he can to succeed in what he loves. Although extremely awkward to meet in the beginning, Suraj loves to make people laugh and is willing to go the extra mile to help out his friends and family in need. After all, he is happy when they are. Suraj enjoys cooking, binging on Netflix, and contemplating the vast complexities of our universe in his head (even though he may look derpy while doing it). Some of his special talents include not being ticklish, being a good listener, and being able to clap his hands at breathtaking speeds."

All of the images show the peak at around 8.4min.
Because the machine is not enough sensitive to the samples(the concentration of TC is too low), so there are no peaks in the images. And the altitude of 0.0001mg/ml is very low, so we predict that it can only detect the concentration above 1ug/ml.

Bacteria has urea channel which is regulated positively by protons, opening at acidic pH values to allow more urea in to buffer cytosolic and surface pH, and closing at neutral pH to avoid over-alkalinization [1].
Ammonia (NH3) buffers the cytosol and periplasm, and creates a neutral layer around the bacterial surface[1].With this surface created by bacteria, protects itself against low acid coditions of the stomach.
Figure 1: Helicobacter Pylori Environment.
Autoinducer 2 (AI-2)
Such as many gram-negative and gram positive bacteria has the quorum sensing (QS) molecule, H. Pylori has this molecule too. QS molecules are specific, low-molecular-weight signal molecules which used by bacteria to regulate expression of genes in response to changes in population density.[2]
H. pylori has Quorum Sensing molecule “Autoinducer-2 (AI-2)” which is produced depended on the activity of the LuxS enzyme [3].
Based on the information given above, we expect to find ammonia and Auto-inducer 2 molecules in the existence of H. pylori. Thus we aim to sense both of these molecules to find out if H. Pylori’s presence.

In the presence of NH3 this press will be eliminated and Toehold will be produced. Lsr transcription factor represses pLsr promoter which produce Trigger mRNA. In the presence of AI-2 (Autoinducer-2) this press will be eliminated and Trigger mRNA will be produced. In conclusion Trigger mRNA opens the toehold system and TEV-Protease will be formed.

Bacteria use nitrogen which is present in nearly all macromolecules such as proteins, carbonhydrates and peptidoglycan.

I thought that our bacterial strain with the Lambda lysogen, TT9907, might recognize cholera's autoinducer, and perhaps that might trigger Lambda.  I streaked a line of TT9907 next to cholera and then away from cholera.  No bacteria grew next to cholera, but the strain did grow away from cholera! Now, we need to show that it is indeed lambda that is killing the cell and not some toxin from cholera.
We designed an experiment with 6 bacterial strains: 2 without the lambda lysogen, 1 with the lambda lysogen, and three that may have the lambda lysogen.  The latter three strains are each from single colonies that grew following an electroporation procedure to get TT9907 to take up the plasmid pIG87.  Amazingly, top agar lawn assays with a drop of hydrogen peroxide added to stress lambda into lysis show that after electroporation, there are no plaques.  Either Lambda gets out during electroporation or TT9907 loses its susceptibility to lambda. Anyway, we took these six strains and streaked a line of them next to a patch of cholera and away from the patch.  Depending on how the bacteria grow we'll be able to say if cholera (perhaps some toxin) kills TT9907 or lambda kills TT9907.

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," for us.
Prof. He was surprised by our visit. He said it was commendable for us to consult biosafety problems. Half an hour of happy communications, Prof. He patiently answered our confusion, and gives a lot of new aspects to think about the perspective of bioethics.
Prof. He emphasized the signification of biosafety awareness, and the real biosafety is supposed to be reflected in each step of the operation. As a development team for biology software, it is our responsibility to remind the users to follow safe and reliable design principles and to warn the users of dangerous operations. This proposal from Prof. He gave new inspiration to us.
Inspirations on our project
After the consult to Prof. He, we realized that we have more responsibilities of biosafety warning and guiding. What’s more, it would be better if we establish a way of communication with users. We’ll finish this goal by improving our interactive interface with users.
Figure 5: Group photo with Prof. He Zhumei.Thanks for giving advice on biosafety.
Consulting Microsoft staff about Information security
Motivation
We developed a software this year. The software may collect users’ information of interests, account, and activity on the website, and use the information for further functions. It’s our responsibility to protect user privacy. So we need to learn and follow relevant policies.
Practices
We consulted Mr. Li Yuzheng for related software policies and practices. Mr. Li majors in software, and has worked in Microsoft Research Asia. He told us that it is necessary to write a software statement, and show the statement to users when they first use our software. Only when users agree to provide their private information can our software collect and use it.
Figure 6: Photo of Mr. Li Yuzheng. Thanks for giving advice on software statements.
Inspirations on our project
According to Mr. Li's advice, we checked our software again, made sure that we never collect users' private information without agreements, and wrote a software statement with the help of legal professionals. See statements .
Consultation on intellectual property issues
Motivation
In our project, we hoped to collect and show some excellent iGEM projects posted on igem.org and research papers published in academic journals, in order to enrich our integrated database and offer better resources to users. Although we’re non-profit all the time, we are still supposed to consider intellectual property issues.
Practices

Introduction & Acknowledgements
      This is our first time to participate in iGEM. We are completely novice, so the collaborations with other teams help us a lot in the process of carrying out experimental projects. This summer, we received a lot of teams’ help when we encountered straits from the project preparation to the experimental development owing to lack of experience and support. We would greatly appreciate these teams, SCU-China, SCU-WestChina, TMMU-China, UESTC-China, Peking, Shanghaitech. Furthermore, we also do our best to help other teams, striving for better results through mutual cooperation.
 
SiCAU & iSWU
      We joined the iSWU in 2015 which brings together all iGEM teams in Southwest China and some teams interested in iGEM. Members of the union include TMMU-China, UESTC-China, SCU-China, SCU-WestChina and so on. This year,the iSWU meeting was held by SCU-WestChina in April 2017 for each teams exchange views on the displayed projects. We had a more profound understanding of the project after participating in this exchange. The teachers gave us numerous inspirations of design and optimization the project after showing the initial project on cancer detection.It is also the intention of holding the southwest conference in the early stage, in order to discover the deficiencies and limitations of the project through communication, and improve it before the experiment is carried out. In terms of entry matters, we lack the experience of iGEM due to we are the first time to participate in this competition. iSWU gave us a lot of useful assistance, such as how to register, introduction of the schedule, experience of visa processing and so on. In a nutshell, iSWU played an vital role from our project preparation to complete the experiment. Thanks for the iSWU , the relationship of each team is closer.
 
SiCAU&SCU-China /SCU-WestChina

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
One minute tour! :)

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. What compartment does the product locate in if the two product templates locate in different compartments? A reasonable solution is to halve the quantities of the product and add it into both compartments. Another problem is that the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. The source of the two problems is essentially the same: how to describe intra-molecular reactions in framework of MoDeL language definitions. At present, it is not supported. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans to refine our MoDeL language.

Bordeaux,2014,Team:Bordeaux#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," genetic engineering. In my opinion, it is really awesome to think that a common bacteria could purify water, create polymers or some other crazy projects that iGEM had gave birth to. So, when I heard about the iGEM, I though it was a great luck to start to work on synthetic biology. This competition was a unique opportunity to work in a real lab, in a team, and to bring our project the further possible.

Ismael Mullor Ruiz (5th Year of License in Biotechnology at Universitat Politècnica de Valencia (Spain))
Taking part on this contest was almost mandatory for me. As Former 2012 Valencia iGEM team member, I had previously had a very positive experience with the contest: it was one on my first contacts with the reality of the lab working, the variety of ideas that we had and those we observed on the rest of the teams was trully mind-broading and mind-bending and I also made some of my best friends ever during that experience. So I thought that taking part again on the contest (in an unplanned manner I have to admit, since it was the last thing I expected to do during my Erasmus) trying to have the best of that experience with some extra experience would be positive- so it has been. About the current project I have to admit that the first thing about it that fascinated me was the multidisciplinarity of the approach, its implications on the green chemistry field and its potential applications for tissue engineering scaffolds.
Amir NAAR (First Year of Master in Bioinformatics)
The iGEM is a worldwide competition involving students from all across the globe. They meet each year to defend their project and I wanted to be part of the team that will defend the project of Bordeaux. I am a student in bioinformatics passionate by new technologies and at the interface of these two fields. I find it particularly interesting all the applications that hard sciences can bring to the world of living sciences in order to understand them better. The iGEM is a formidable human adventure gathering teamwork, collaboration and solidarity. Each team member can bring a brick to build the whole edifice, and it is also a very original and efficient method to learn more while following a real research project almost from scratch.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

TEAM MASCOT
The Koala in the Lab coat: ""Fluoro Lou""
Although also short for Louis, our mascot has been called Lou as a play on words for the two letters: Lu
These letters form the beginning of the Latin words Lumen, Lux and Luz all used as names for Light.
Lou is a Koala, one of many distinct Australian animals, he sports a lab coat which shows he's ensuring his personal protection in the laboratory whilst creating a fluorescent bioligical lighting system that he has used to decorate the Eucalyptus leaves he is grasping.

Warsaw,2012,Team:Warsaw#Wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmid. We decided we need to make 100% sure if the sequence of our parts didn’t mutate somewhere along the way (during all the PCRs, digestions, ligations, cloning, transformation, and all), so we prepared samples of our parts with pJET primers and sent them to Oligo – a company sequencing DNA, which is also one of our sponsors. We prepared digestion of RBS, GFP and plasmids pSB1K3 and pSB1C3. Then of course ligation of our parts: RBS+GFP+pSB1C3 and RBS+pSB1K3 and TOP10 transformation. We isolated plasmids from cultures of transformants.
Week 8 (13.08-17.08)
We sent some more samples to sequencing and checked the concentration of the last week PCR products. Thanks to Kaja, we were able to run PCR of pCEP4 – a mammalian plasmid which contained oriP, but not in BioBrick format. We designed primers which would help us to eliminate illegal restriction site in the sequence. We also ran PCR to check whether our RBSes on pSB1K3 have correct sequence and set some more digestions and ligation of RBSes with pSB1C3, RBSes with pSB1K3, and RBS+GFP+pSB1C3. To check if our RBSes works in E. coli we also ligated them with promoter for this bacterium. Then we ran transformation of TOP10 strain of E.coli with our ligation products. We also ran PCR to confirm correctness of our ligation samples with Phusion polymerase. Unfortunately, after running electrophoresis, we had a very unpleasant smear on the gel, and we decided to repeat the PCR with Taq polymerase. Our freezer ran out of competent cells, so we prepared another set of E. coli TOP10 strain. This time we had 90 eppendorf tubes. Unfortunately, our pSB1K3 stock ended - we decided to cut it with XbaI and SpeI of a sample of RBS+pSB1K3, then ran electrophoresis and gelled out empty plasmid. We also ran another set of ‘no template PCRs’, this time with Phusion polymerase, as well as checked concentration of our today’s isolated plasmids on NanoDrop – they were pretty much satisfactory. We didn’t want to waste our time so we set digestion and ligation of RBSes"

PBAD Leakage
Leakage was observed for PBAD promoter in DH10B. Although the RPU was relatively higher compared to that of other two strains, DH10B showed leakage at no arabinose  induction. The RPU was around 0.16 for DH10B which is quite significant if we want to have a non-leaky system. For BW25113 and DH5α the leakages were below RPU of 0.1.  The lowest leakage was observed for DH5α. The low leakage in DH5α, once again, could be explained by the additional copy of araC in the genome. The low leakage BW25113,  however, is harder to explain. Nonetheless, if we want a low-leakage system that can reach relatively high RPU upon arabinose induction, out of the three strain we have used,  BW25113 would be the best option.
3-D graphs for DH10B and DH5α
We also tried to produce a 3-D graph. We, however, had some changes from the genetic context that Groningen 2011 used. At 3’ of the PBAD promoter, instead of using BBa_E0840 (GFP generator), we used BBa_E0240 (GFP generator). We also used a  low copy pSB3K3 plasmid as the backbone instead of the high copy pSB1C3. We also could not take measurements every 15 minutes interval because we had to measure the fluorescence at  each time point manually. Fluorescence was instead measured every two hours. Lastly, OD600 was also monitored and graphed (Figure 4. A and B)
Figure 5. Fluorescence and OD600 measurements of DH10B and DH5α induced in different arabinose concentrations.
Triplicate of DH10B and DH5α samples were inoculated in deep well 96 well plate overnight in M9 minimal salt medium.       Arabinose was added to match the final working concentration from 0 to 1.0 % (w/v) with 0.2% increments. Fluorescence and OD600 was measured every       two hours for ten hours.

PT7, T7 promotor; RBS, ribosome binding site; 2TM, double T7terminator; birA, the biotin ligase gene; accA, the α biotinylated subunit gene of Propionyl-CoA carboxylase; pccB, the β subunit gene of Propionyl-CoA carboxylase; sfp, the phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene.
Here, we use T7 promoter and terminator to stay the same with our plasmid pSB1C3 carrying the genes encoding DEBS1 PKS so that they will be co-expressed under the same condition. RBS is placed between every two genes in order to ensure the transcription of every gene. Since the sfp gene knocked into the prp operon was frame shifted, we worried about whether it works as expected. Therefore，we constructed two chassis, of which one carries sfp(chassis 1) while another(chassis 2) doesn’t, and we will verify the activity of the sfp by transforming them into the E.coli BL21(DE3) separately with pSB1C3 carrying DEBS1 at the same time and see if there will be any difference between these two strain of E.coli BL21(DE3) under the same condition.
Construction
Since we didn’t have much time to buy Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) to get gene accA and pccB from it by pcr. Besides, the Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL23338 we already had is not suitable to provide the two genes we needed[3], we chose to synthesize them. Meanwhile, we gained sfp and birA by pcr from E.coli BL21(DE3) and optimized their sequence by site-specific mutagenesis. Then, we constructed the pSB4A5 chassis by digest and assemble them step by step.

Human Practices for August 20th 2009
Today, I continued to work on the ethics paper. I started reading literature on the environmental, legal and societal issues surrounding Quorum Sensing and I found a lot of interesting information that I can add on to the ethics paper. I will continue to work on the ethics paper over the next couple of days and try to improve it further.
I also contacted some companies that were on my marketing list.  Most of these companies were Oil and gas development companies. I will do a follow-up with these companies next week.

Setting up the V. harveyi MM32 AI-2 Assay and Testing Experiments in Second Life's Virtual Lab
Using a 96 well microplate, AI-2 isolated from Salmonella typhimurium 14028 supernatant will be tested. V. harveyi reporter strain MM32 (luxS- and luxN-) will luminesce in the presence of AI-2.  Controls used in the experiment include S. typhimurium SS007, V. harveyi BB120 and E. coli DH5a.  Overnight OD600 and luminescence (CPS) readings will be taken by a VICTOR (thank you Surette lab, especially Margot!).
Preliminary testing was done on the bacterial transformation and genomic DNA isolation activities in the virtual lab.  Additionally, I now have transparent wings which glow.

I recently remembered that I will have to start making cleaning scripts for a lot of the equipment in the lab to prevent clutter for easy maintenance. I started to make these and added them to bacterial transformation, the sequencing station and DNA extraction. It is not imperative that these be completed immediately since this type of abuse is not expected for testing.
Added rho termination, but I am not satisfied with it yet and will continue to change where objects travel too although the pushing part looks satisfactory I need a better place for the mRNA strand. I have no idea how I am going to do the hairpin termination at this time but it will probably mean I have to fiddle with rotation again. There is now a complementary strand of DNA that will change its bases when an avatar makes changes to the template strand (the bottom one strand in this animation) so that the two strands will"

All the strains seem to be growing fine, with quite consistent ODs, Luminescence has fallen off in all of them by now and seems to have leveled out. Three wells, however gave a massive spike at the start, much brighter than all the others. 'Which one?', I hear you ask, 'is it K, the master of quiescence, R, the loveable knockout, or G, the old champion?' For now, imagine the plate reader hanging off a cliff...
Can our cells overcome the repression and shine brighter than they ever shone before? Will science happen? Are hns-mutants shite? Tune in to watch the exciting conclusion of Plate Reader: The Reckoning!

Paul: ""You've got 5 minutes"" Bill: ""I'll do it in 2""

And now:
(dedicated to the lives lost in transformation)
At the start, K28 seemed a bit disoriented and didn't shine very bright. R28 made and honest effort, but neither could step out of the shadow of G28, which surged to a peak of 3.7 million units of pure awesomeness after a few hours.
But soon after that, G28's btightness came crashing down. K28 still hadn't quite got to grips with the situation - while growing happily, it didn't seem into the whole glowing business. But what is that? Even though only half as bright as G28 at the start, R28 takes a stand against the fall and maintains its luminescence at a respectable level of 1.7 million Somethings.
G28 hadlong fallen into darkness, but R28 is still going strong to this hour. K28 went to get a coffee...
Right, like any season finale this gave more questions than answers. My take on all of that would be that H"

It further involves freezing the sample, as well as two subsequent stages of drying9. Freeze-drying with 20% trehalose is a method of further increasing the stability of the enzymes10.
An adaptable design
Whilst Edinburgh iGEM 2015’s biosensor may leave a great legacy in improving drug safety, we hope the impact it has does not end there. Our biosensor is a fluid and adaptable model that can be easily manipulated to serve a range of analytical purposes, bringing synthetic biology to the forefront of detection sciences.
Through exchange of standard biological parts, the device can easily be produced with different enzymes by switching the genes in our backbone. This allows our biosensor to be important not only as a harm reduction tool for drug users, but as a proof of concept with much wider applications. Exchanging the enzymes in the biosensor could allow for our device to test for a multitude of compounds, be they drugs, contaminants or counterfeit-pharmaceuticals. (Find out more in Future Applications- link to future applications).
Our device is far more than a tool to improve the safety of a small group of user; its user-targeted design and enhanced biosafety allows our biosensor to bring synthetic biology out of the lab and into society in ways that have not been possible before.

I'm a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology at Uppsala University.  My research pertains to transcription factor regulation of gene activity in the bacterium Escherichia coli accounting for the effects of the major events of the cell cycle, such as volume expansion due to growth, gene dosage variation due to replication, molecule partitioning at cell division and cell aging. Employed in this interdisciplinary work are state of the art experimental and theoretical methodologies. Experimental methods are focused on the molecular cloning and genomic integrations of global regulators fused with various fluorescent proteins and subsequent fluorescence microscopy affording the detection and imaging of single regulator molecules in live bacterial cells. Experiments are complemented by modeling and characterization of deterministic and stochastic mathematical descriptions of the molecular control systems, specifically addressing challenging issues of biological complexity such as oscillatory behavior due to time delays in regulatory circuits and spatial considerations of one-, two- and three-dimensional diffusion search modes of molecular regulators.
Engineering genetic circuits and molecular pathways is the most demanding for the descriptions in molecular biology. The team has shown considerable ability in designing and implementing their original idea. Making accessible fuels such as ethanol and buthanol from sunlight is an inspiring notion that deserves the attention of scientist and engineers worldwide. The team has therefore broken important new ground for others to follow in the future. Coaching the team has been a very rewarding experience.

Introduction
During brainstorming, we brought up a lot of creative solutions, which the world should have, but from our point of view, is yet still not ready for. Hence we devoted our attention to a more present concern: tissue-engineering. In this area of expertise, a three-dimensional scaffold for the cells to attach is, amongst other things, essential. Since the origin and construction of these matrices is still a problem, new solutions are required. Currently, most of the preparations work in layers (for bone and cartilage material) or use nano fibers and textile technologies to generate a scaffold [ 1 ].
When thinking about this problem, we thought of a quite new approach on building three dimensional structures. What if we could just print tissue, bones or other stuff? How could we do that?
One of us had the idea to try something like the subsurface engraving of glassblocks, but instead of breaking small glass strucutres we wanted the bacteria to produce certain products like color [ 2 ]. So how can we activate our bacteria with laser, forcing them to express a protein without bursting into thousand tiny pieces?
Because of the seemingly limitless opportunities in optogenetics, it was chosen as Method of the Year 2010 by Nature Methods and is titled as one of the breakthroughs of the decade [ 3 ]. The hallmark of optogenetics is the introduction of fast light-activated channels and enzymes that allow temporally precise manipulation of electrical and biochemical events in bacteria. One can use channels derived from bacteriorhodopsin, photosynthesis associated complexes, like phycobilines in algae (for our red light sensor) or use existing light sensory domains already in E.coli (like our blue light promoter). Thus optogenetics provides an elegant way for us to convert a light signal into protein expression.
When thinking more carefully about the idea, we knew that we would need to immobilize the bacteria somehow to make sure that we can target certain spots. For this reason we have chosen a matrix named gelrite which can be passed by light with only little refraction. In addition to this fact, our used M9-medium only contains a minimum of (potentially light-absorbant) nutrients to enable and regulate growth and thus protein synthesis.
Optogenetical AND-Gate
To achieve bacterial constructed three-dimensional structures by using light induced gene expression it was necessary to come up"
BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#project Fine-regulation circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html," family. Bxb1 could be divided to two parts, gp35 and gp47. The gp35 part could recognize specific sequences, called attB and attP, and then integrate, invert, or excise dsDNA depending on the orientation of recognition sequences. When it inverts DNA sequence, the attB and attP sequences are changed into attL and attR, as other DNA recombinases do. Another part called Bxb1 gp47 binds to integrase-DNA complex and this complex flips DNA back into original sequence by regenerating attB and attP sequences. So the efficiency of inversion mediated by Bxb1 is half and half [42].
According to the function of Bxb1, we design the second type circuit to regulate the environmental pH(Fig.11)
Fig.11 The gene circuit of Bxb1-mediated recombinase system
This circuit is applied when the functional acid and the alkali are both strong. In the primary state, the bacteria also produce alkali. Since the alkali is strong, the pH of environment could reach the responsible range of P-atp2 easily. It can lead Bxb1 to work. The promoter J23119 could be inverted persistently until the inversion efficacy reaches half and half. In this process, the bacteria produce the acid and the alkali at the same time, it can create a wave-motion of pH. And the pH of environment will be stable finally. The final pH is influenced by the promoter sensing pH and the strength of acid and alkali.
3)FimE circuit
There is another condition. In this condition, we use the assemble of the strong acid and weak alkali, or strong alkali and weak acid. We use FimE to achieve the fine-regulation. This is our gene circuit of FimE-mediated recombinase system. (Fig.12)
Fig.12 The gene circuit of FimE-mediated recombinase system
FimE is different from other kind’s recombinase. Its recognization sites on the upstream (IRL) and downstream (IRR) are not same. It means that after the recombination mediated by FimE happens, the sign sites would be exchanged, so that the new sign sites couldn’t be recognized by FimE again. Thus the recombination mediated by FimE is irreversible.[43]
Granted that the bacteria produce the strong alkali in the primary, the environment would turn alkaline quickly. So P-atp2 can correspond the change of environment and start the expression of FimE. FimE recognizes IRL and IRR"

Meetup with SKLBC IGEM high school team
In the next few weeks, the IGEM high school team will embrace their first presentation under the world’s attention. At first, two girls form the high school team introduced to us how they think about their software as a social medium to collaborate people’s efforts in finding biobricks. With increasing public engagement in Wechat, a widely-used smartphone app through China, they thought that maybe they could grasp that opportunities and provided the services of presenting biobricks to the users. More importantly, the idea of making full use of social media distinct them from other teams that concentrate more attention on disciplinary knowledge but pale due to a shortage of more advanced knowledge. Then, a boy who was mainly in charge of the app gave a speech about how he developed that app. We surprisingly found that despite lack of experience, he displayed app skill of high level and uttered his determination for better.
In the end, we share our stories in IGEM and found how much we have grown with the help of other IGEMers. Thanks to the platform-IGEM, we strives for better in the years to come.

Part Documentation
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#characterization#mls_-_-_TEXT.html," Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin for ImageJ image processing, scatter plots of the green intensities (y-axis) and red intensities (x axis), Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's correlation coefficient were generated.
Result
Figure 1. MLS directs GFP into mitochondria. When MLS is added to the N-terminus of GFP, the GFP was directed to the mitochondria in the cells, giving patches of GFP signal that overlapped with the signals from MitoTracker®. When MLS is not added to the GFP, the GFP signal can be seen scattered all around inside the cell. Scale bar = 10µm.
Figure 2. Scatter plots of fluorescence intensities of green (y axis) and red (x axis) by construct. It showed that the BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial MLS-GFP construct had a linear relationship of green intensities and red intensities while the GFP generator alone had no relationship. Pearson's correlation coefficient (rp) and Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) were determined using the Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin (French et al., 2008) for ImageJ with a threshold of 0 and listed for each image.
Figure 3. Calculated mean Pearson's (rp) and Spearman's (rs) correlation coefficients for each construct. The coefficients were generated using ImageJ software and specific plugins. For every batch of transfected cells, four samples were used for quantification. Experimental BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial MLS-GFP: coefficients were close to 1, good colocalization; GFP: Coefficients were close to 0, poor colocalization. Error bars show standard deviation.
Conclusion
The result shows that the colocalization of GFP signal and mitotracking dye is high for the experimental construct of MLS BioBrick. It can be concluded that the MLS can function well and successfully bring recombinant proteins into mitochondria.

1.5 Why we need a delay?
Oscillation is more than just a feedback. In order to keep oscillating, the system should introduce a delay part to avoid a steady result.
Suggest a two-node system without a delay part, and write ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the interaction as follows:
dAdt=α∙Bn1k1n1+Bn1-μ∙A …...(1)
dBdt=β∙k2n2k2n2+An2-μ∙B …...(2)
set:
dAdt=0 …...(3)
dBdt=0......(4)
then we get a simplified equation:
1μ∙B-1β-1β∙k2n2∙αμ∙Bn1Bn1+k1n1n2=0......(5)
with (A0, B0) as a steady-state solution, the system is incapable to oscillate.
Figure: the improved network
Now we realize the importance of delay. Therefore, an auxiliary state B2 is introduced to the improved system, as a delay part. Moreover, B2 enables an access to maneuver the system.
1.6 What more can we achieve?
In our expectation, ECHO is not just a single oscillator. Three parameters that determine the property of an oscillation is the amplitude, the period and the phase, and we hope to maneuver each of the three independently.
The amplitude represents the intensity of the fluorescence. It’s not a hard work to amplify it by increasing the expressing rate of the GFP/ RFP gene. The period of the cycle is up to the accumulation of AHLs, so both the producing and the degrading will help. As for the phase, we design an extra circuit to generate AHLs under commands, in order to accelerate the process of accumulation before reaching the threshold, shorten a certain cycle and thus change the phase.
2. Project_Design
Two E.coli populations (CELL-A & B) regulate each other to realize oscillation under the QS modules, LuxI/LuxR together with LasI/LasR.
The constitutive promoter p1 in CELL-A produces LasR, a transcriptional regulator, who maintains its high concentration within the cell.
Then, an acyl-homoserine latone (AHL), 3OC12HSL from LasI in CELL-B"

Tokyo-NoKoGen,2012,Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen#Project#lux operon_-_-_TEXT.html," light by catalyzing oxidization of luciferin. Oxidized luciferin, oxiluciferine, has high energy. When the oxiluciferin transits from high energy state to low energy state, light is emitted.
On the other hand, fluorescence substance, such as GFP, absorbs the light and becomes high energy state. And when the fluorescence substance transits from high energy state to low energy state, light is emitted.
If the luciferase exists near the fluorescence substance, Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) occurs. BRET is a phenomenon that can be observed when a fluorescence substance is excited by obtaining energy from the bioluminescence. This only happens when the wavelength of bioluminescence is the same as the wavelength that excites the fluorescence substance.
The wavelength of bacterial luciferase from Lux operon (497 nm) is close to the wavelength that GFP excites(501 nm).
We considered that BRET might occur between the bacterial luciferase and the GFP, so we designed the construct of Lux operon with GFP.
Method
Construction of biobrick
The construct of Lux operon with GFP is produced by joining the Lux operon and GFP biobrick part.
Evaluation
Transformed E coli. TOP10 was precultured into LB medium and incubated at 37℃. After incubating for 12 hour, precultured solution was diluted with LB medium to the point that OD660 became 0.6, then applied into 96well microtiter plate. After adding arabinose(0.25% f.c.), the plate was shaken at 20 ℃ to express the lux proteins. The spectrum of the light and intensity was measured by plate reader once in an hour.
Result
1.lux+LumP
We could observe the shift of wavelength from 488 nm to 478 nm (Figure.a). The changing color can clearly recognize by the photograph(Figure.e). And we also achieved to enhance the light intensity. Maximal absorption of Lux+LumP is about 3-fold, comparing to that of lux(cloned).
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the lumP part(Edinburgh 2009, BBa_K216007) could work with the Lux operon from Photobacterium phosphoreum kishitanii strain.

Charlie carried out another run of the Kill Switch Proof experiment after the previous one produced unsatifactory results. Sam carried out PCR on miniprepped J04450 DNA, as well as a digestion and ligation. Overnights were made of the backbone, supercompetent E. coli and our AMP E. coli to obtain repeats of the Kill Switch Proof experiments, as well as make glycerol stocks for storage.
Day 5:
The modelling had a look at differing ranges of the transcription rates and used a logarithmic y-axis to scale all concentrations onto the same graph to see if there’s a ‘switching on/off' behaviour. Chris looked into the stats and read up on trialing the data in basic histograms to explore any underlying correlating behaviours. Max read up on animation software to create something for our wiki.
Day 7:
Charlie made overnights of supercompetent E. coli and E. coli with our AMP gene.
Week 9 - 05/09/11
Day 1:
We had our bi-weekly meeting with our advisors. Sam did a PCR and ran a gel of it to check if it worked and it didn’t. We decided to repeat the reaction. Ogaga prepared overnights of supercompetent E. coli and E. coli with our AMP gene as there was an error in the one made the previous day. Max worked on animation of the biological system. Chris went to meet Will Cresswell and had a run through of converting the data from SPSS to CSV to R, modelling the ideal model for our stats. There seems to be no significant p-values for most of the variables. Although when applying a model setup in R, there is no significance between student-advisor ratio and the medals given.
Day 2:
Lamya and Ogaga made minipreps of the J04450 backbone. Sam made a PCR of the minpreps and Charlie ran another arabinose test. Ogaga also streaked a plate for singles of the backbone. A variety of models were run in the stats of the human practices.
Day 3:
Sam ran a gel today of the PCR. Chris ran various models, such as the dependency of projected budget on the team, whether the projected budget has an effect present from the citation score and overall rank of the university. Also the division and year variations, to see if the random effects that have been removed from the model.

UPO-Sevilla,2010,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Chemotaxis_-_-_TEXT.html," L-tryptophan and L-valine. Chemotactic response of E. coli to amino acids involves two MCPs (methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins), which are the products of tar and tsr genes. In this case, E. coli and Salmonella are very similar, whereas B. subtillis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are positive chemotatic to the common twenty L-amino acids. Sometimes taxis toward L-amino acids depends on the nitrogen availability.
Chemotactic response is characterized by great sensitivity, huge dynamism and precise adaptation, that allow E. coli to amplify the sensed stimuli up to 50-fold. In bacteria as E. coli and Salmonella, some chemotactic stimuli bind directly to chemotaxis-specific receptors, whereas others bind first to a primary receptor, which then interact with the respective receptor. There are several genes involved in taxis: those that encodes chemotatic receptors for specific components (receptors, transducers and Che genes). E. coli tactic receptors are the product of five partially redundant genes: tsr, tar, trg, tap and aer., that sense a wide variety of chemicals. Vibrio cholerae has 43, H. salinarum has 3 subfamilies of MCPs, M. xanthus only one, and B. subtilis has ten.
The receptor complex is composed by MCP-CheW-CheA. Usually, MCPs are clustered at the bacterial poles (one or two). At least, MCPs have three main functions related to bacterial chemotaxis: they bind the ligands, they transduce the chemotaxis signal across the cytoplasmic membrane and they undergo methylation or demethylation (adaptation process). Received information is transduced by a group of proteins that are coordinated by phosphorilation-dephosphorilation reactions (CheW, CheA and CheY), and act on the flagellar motor changing its direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise). The methylation-demethylation reactions (focusing in Tar MCP) take place in a carboxilic group of glutamate and glutamine residues as part of a chain reaction, which is carry out by the enzyme methyltransferase CheR, and the opposite reaction is carried out by the enzyme methylesterase CheB. As for chemorepellent, in most cases, the ligands bind to specific receptor, although sometimes this chemicals cause cellular perturbations that directly act on MCPs.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,", has the public finance to carry this out.  However, throwing more money at the problem without tackling upstream inefficiencies in manufacturing/distribution will not solve the problem. [27]
An alternative, fiscally-efficient methodology would be to invest public finances in local insulin manufacturing facilities. The lack of intellectual property protection on Regular Human Insulin would allow for the Canadian government to limit the effect of the supply constraint, while boosting local industry and reducing out-of-pocket costs for Diabetics.
Figure 11.The burden of Diabetes disease management rests most heavily on the poorest Canadians, costing an average of 17.7% of individual income for those who earn less than CA$15,000 (with an insulin pump). On Prince Edward Island (PEI), poor citizens can expect to fork over nearly 40% of their individual income to pay for diabetes management with a pump. Comparing this with 10% of income on PEI for management without a pump elucidates a major challenge faced by low-income Diabetics in developed nations.  Extensive advertising expense is paid to educate health professionals and advertise to the decision makers in government to ensure the status-quo is advanced insulin pumps that only function with an expensive insulin analogue.  Better control of blood-glucose and a low-input regime should not be locked behind a paywall that excludes the majority of Diabetics on the planet. There exists here an excellent opportunity for open-source science to provide an insulin pump that provides CGMitC (continuous glucose monitoring in the cloud) and is capable of dispensing a variety of Regular and Analogue Human Insulins. The BioFoundry plans on development of this pump in 2018, using the insulin produced from USYD iGEM’s bacteria!
European Union
The European Union enjoys relative prosperity and easy access to insulin. Socialisation of the health care expense reduces the cost burden to the individual, and also creates a clear image of the “societal cost of Diabetes.” Rather than extensively examine the shelf prices of insulin in various EU countries, it is more important to observe the public expense that Diabetes treatment incurs. Pharmaceutical benefit schemes will often offer only one insulin brand, greatly increasing the taxation burden due to the non-competitive market. Furthermore, a lack of competitive pressure can keep prices artificially high, beyond the reach of poorer nations.[25]

France:“There is no insulin shortage in France despite many patients so I guess it's not hard to obtain it”
Netherlands:“I have no problems getting insulin, getting enough test strips to measure blood sugar levels is way more expensive”

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," to improve the characterisation of existing registry parts by measuring their expression in a novel organism. C. difficile is a Gram-positive anaerobic organism with significant differences to the E. coli chassis for which existing characterisation was performed. The existing registry promoters BBa_J23114, BBa_J23106, and BBa_J23119 were characterised for expression strength using a GusA assay in C. difficile. A new registry part which represents the ribosome binding region from the thiolase gene of Clostridium acetobutylicum was added to these promoter regions allowing them to be characterised in the context of having a different RBS than previously. In addition, four promoters have been added to the iGEM registry from C. acetobutylicum (Pcac_thl) [Bba_K2715010], C. sporogenes (PCsp_fdx) [Bba_K2715011] and two from C. difficile (PCdi_TcdA) [Bba_K2715012] and (PCdi_TcdB) [Bba_K2715013].
The four novel registry parts were characterised alongside the existing registry promoters in a GFP assay in E. coli as well as in a GusA assay in C. difficile. The most remarkable conclusion from the E. coli GFP assay of these promoters is that both of the suspected strong C. difficile promoter PCsp_fdx and Pcac_thl were stronger than any of the three existing registry promoters we assayed; with Pcac_thl producing around three times the concentration of fluorescein (0.3235µM) as the positive control used in the InterLab studies (0.0958µM).
Our main objective in characterising these promoters was to find a suitable pair of strong promoters to use in our subsequent dCas9 or asRNA projects. For this the GusA assay within C. difficile was most relevant since this is the chassis in which these constructs would be acting. The C. difficile GusA assay clearly showed that none of the three existing registry promoters from E. coli had any detectable activity in C. difficile. By far the strongest promoter we were able to measure was PCsp_fdx which was around 7.5 times stronger than the next strongest promoter we found (PCdi_TcdA). We were unable to clone the strongest promoter from the E. coli GFP assay PCdi_thl into a GusA reporter plasmid. This is likely because of the toxicity of the gusA gene in E. coli and since we know that  PCdi_thl"
Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Water Report_-_-_TEXT.html," due to fears of residual wastewater in the recycled water.
Perception is very dependant on the particular source and treatment of the water.
Choice matters: in places where alternative sources of water were available, people were more sceptical of water reuse than in regions with water shortages.
Education about the necessity and safety of recycled water is paramount for improving public perception and must accompany the technological implementation. A recent survey conducted by Guardian, posted alongside an article about Thames Water plans to introduce recycled water for potable use to meet demand by 2040, revealed a promising 63% of Londoners would be happy drinking recycled water (Saner 2014). As 100% of Londoners need to be drinking it by that date however, perception must catch up.
Water innovation and Synthetic Biology : Overcoming barriers
In order to use Synthetic Biology in such a large scale and significant project as water purification and recycling, we need to have a better insight into the potential development and commercialisation of synthetic biology applications. That of course would require the use of genetically modified micro-organisms (GMMO) on a setting outside traditional laboratories and entry into large scale industrial setups.
Currently, the majority of synthetic biology projects involve micro-organisms (in our case the bacteria G. Xylinus and E. Coli) used as host cells (“chassis”).  In essence, the first wave of commercial applications of synthetic biology consists of the production of natural compounds from the chassis in an industrial fermentation setup. In our particular case, we are using our two chassis in order to produce large amounts of bacterial cellulose that will in turn be used as water filters, after processing and functionalization with water contaminant-targeting proteins.
In the case of our project, there is no direct use of GMMO for bioremediation. Therefore, here we are dealing with contained use rather than with deliberate release in the environment, which are key categories in the EU/UK regulatory framework. In order to fit the contained use definition, specific containment measures should be used to limit the contact [of the GMO] with and to with and to provide a high level of safety for, the general population and the environment (Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC). In the UK regulations, such containment measures are further defined as physical, chemical or biological barriers (UK Genetically Modified Organism (Contained Use) Regulation 2000) (Marris and Jefferson, 2012).
It is important to note that, apart from dealing with the issue of water recycling and water perception, we are dealing with the applications of"

Finally, we choose PDC1 and cecropin A to kill Fusarium                                               graminearum. They can inhibit the growth of Fusarium                                               graminearum in a very low concentration(1.5μM、3.6μM),                                               PDC1 is specific for Fusarium graminearum.
Sensing Part
We intend to sense toxins through the yeast system. In the                                           sensing part, estrogen receptor is secreted by constitutive                                           promoter, and then binding to the membrane. ZEN comes                                           into the cell via the receptor-mediated endocytosis process,                                           the endocytosis complex will activate ERE(estrogen response                                           element) which incorporated with a yeast promoter and the                                           promoter begin to express fluorescent protein.

In order to observe the fluorescence intensity in different                                           concentrations of ZEN and the corresponding reaction time.                                           We set a dynamic model by some differential equations:
Simulation
In different ZEN concentrations, the system will express different                                           intensities of fluorescent protein. We use MATLAB GUI to                                           simulate the process.
Figure3: Simulation result
You can adjust the ZEN concentration and observe the change                                           of protein concentration. According to the Chinese National                                           Standards For Food Safety, ZEN’s concentration should not                                           high than 0.015 mg/L. If the concentration of ZEN is higher                                           than the level, the device will sense the fluorescence, turn on                                           the photoactivatable switch and degrade the toxin.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," increment the DNA moves according to the movement rule specified by me, and when certain conditions are met it can either be bind to TALE permanently or can exit the strip. The difficulty was to translate those rules to the transition matrix, whose n-th power gives us the probability of state transition after n-th time increment, which we can obtain the probability of DNA capture. This model essentially hides irrelvent details such as how TALE binds to DNA, and focus on the efficiency of DNA biding directly. The probability of DNA capture obtained from the model can be tested against empirical data such that certain parameters (i.le. the rules) can be modified to better describe reality.
So far a model with hard-coded constants was constructed as a proof of concept. The revision of the code with functions were paritially done but was not tested for all combinations of TALE and DNA. So far the model has only considered 1 TALE and 1 DNA, with the movement rule being Brownian motion type, with no TALE-DNA dissociation, with no ¡°noise¡± or false DNA possible for binding, with no DNA and strip interaction. But those are future directions that I can work on to sophisticate the model.
Week 18: August 26 - August 30
After the quantitative modelling was presented to the entire team on Monday, some senior memebers gave us some great suggestions. One of them requested the implementation of the concept of saturation of TALE such that per one TALE at most one DNA can be bind to it. Although looks simple to implement but in reality it increases the computational effort significantly. If there are n possible states for DNA to be with an unsaturated TALE, then another n states with saturated TALE needs to be included in the state transition matrix. This effectively doubles the number of states needed and quadruples the number of calculations. Given that TALE and DNA will be much smaller than the space we consider, a large number of states will be necessary, which translates that the computational effort will be enormous. Here Dr. Nygren's suggestion of using Partial Differential Equations for the modelling of diffusion and reaction might be appropriate, except the parameters of the detailed DNA TALE binding scheme were not found.
After few days of research and thinking, two approaches seem to be worth a try: either do Monte Carlo simulations of the discretized system, or Bayesian network to exploit the overlapping sub-problems. For Monte Carlo simulations would be straight forward to code, for it simply describes the system in computer language then runs thousands of simulations to empirically determine the probabilities. For the Bayesian network it will"

Science Research Symposium
During the school year when we were brainstorming for potential project ideas, our team members were divided into several groups and gave presentations on those topics at the school’s Science Research Symposium.  Over 80 students from 11 research classes presented their own research from all different areas to the school community.  This allowed us to receive feedback on our project ideas from both students and teachers. This really helped us decide our final project idea.

The silk we extruded with the aid of a syringe pump is stretchy, but quite brittle. Optimization of protocols is the next step. We also need to create better controls to better justify our results. We did observe that our recombinant silk, when co-spun with purified Tamura protein, and observed under florescence microscopy, is thicker in diameter than our control.

Soon after infection, phage DNA replicates in a speed much faster than E. coli’s genome. Progeny M13 phages are then released from the hosts and infect other uninfected bacterium. Owing to this fast speed of the phage life cycle, mutations take place mostly in the phage DNA and the mutation of host cells should therefore have little impact on the selection. With the help of inducible promoter, the mutagenesis module will work only when it is necessary and the mutation rate can be adjusted according to needs with different inductor concentrations, making this module more controllable.

David Caballero's Diary
Week 1 (July, 4-8)
First week in the lab!
During the last few months we have been studying and designing a Tn7-based system to deliver BioBricks into bacterial chromosomes. Now it is time to perform the ideas and experiments we drew on paper.
We ordered the synthesis of a complete basic mini-Tn7 to avoid site-directed mutagenesis, cloning and other intermediate processes. Unfortunately, our order is delayed (22 days by now). So, this week I tried to prepare all the necessary strains and vectors in advance. Anyway, this is my first week in Fernan’s lab at CABD, so I am mostly getting familiar with the location of materials and equipment.
These were my main tasks this week:
Prepare pUC18-SfiI vector for mini-Tn7 insertion. Our mini-Tn7 was designed flanked by SfiI target sites. We plan to use a pUC18 vector, replicative in Enterobacteriaceae to maintain the mini-Tn7. I located the vector in the lab strain collection, set up an inoculum, purified the plasmid DNA, measured the concentration with the Nanodrop and digested with SfiI.
Prepare pUC18R6K-SfiI vector for mini-Tn7 insertion. The goal is to obtain a vector with an R6K replication origin, which is non-replicative in pir- strains to host the mini-Tn7 constructs. We requested a pUC18R6K-mini-Tn7T-Km vector from Herbert Schweizer's lab in Colorado State University. We will use this as a template to amplify vector sequences adding SfiI restriction sites. I had problems to get amplification in the PCR reaction ("

The students then made their way to UES to begin on their various tasks: Max worked on the cinnamaldehyde sequence and the project description. Peter worked on the project description and on the team logo. Chris also worked on the project description and some research on the various bacteria and fungi that will be used in the project for the safety forms. Travis worked on the daily lab logs, some research on the various bacteria and fungi that will be used in the project for the safety forms, and on the safety forms themselves.  The students then returned to base to meet with Chia and discuss the final submission of the DNA sequences and the iGEM mini-prep.  They then decided to start the mini-prep by making SOB and CCMB80.  They then returned to UES to complete the previously stated tasks.
Friday (06/22/18)
Lab 1
The students are still currently waiting for DNA sequences to come in. Mentor Dr. Varaljay thought it would be a perfect opportunity to use NCBI Blast as a method of analyzing DNA sequences with proteins and nucleotides. She gave a quick lesson on how to use it and how to discover more about unknown surface proteins pertaining to the project.
Lab 2
On Friday morning, the whole iGEM team met at UES for the weekly meeting with Vanessa. She taught the team how to use the NCBI web-based program called BLAST. Vanessa helped the team put in the Chitinase C-1 sequence into the program and cross reference it to other amino acid sequences. After that they put unknown nucleotide sequences into the program in order to identify them. After the meeting with Vanessa, RH left for lunch while RX stayed behind to discuss their sequences with Chia. Chia helped Max to edit his sequences for ordering, and after that Peter, Chris, and Max left for lunch. They met with RH and the cadets at El Meson. When they returned to UES, Max left, then Peter and Chris ordered the sequences through IDT.

Technion_Israel,2015,Team:Technion Israel#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," all four ligands have the same energy when free in the solution.
When the ligand is bound to a site in the receptor - \({\varepsilon _b}\).
Each ligand will have different energy from the others when bound to the enzyme.
The sum of the energies of all the ligands will give us the energy of a microstate:
\({\varepsilon _{microstate}} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{{L_A}} {{\varepsilon _{{A_i}}}}  + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{{L_B}} {{\varepsilon _{{B_i}}}}  + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{{L_C}} {{\varepsilon _{{C_i}}}}  + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{{L_D}} {{\varepsilon _{{D_i}}}} \)
In our system, only two ligands that are bound to the enzyme can have the energy \({\varepsilon _b}\). We assume the rest have the energy \({\varepsilon _{sol}}\), no matter in which box they are in. For that reason, we can say that all the microstates of each macrostate are the same.
For example, for the macrostate in which only one ligand of type A is bound to the enzyme:
\(\begin{array}{l}{\varepsilon _{microstate}} = {\varepsilon _{sol}} \cdot \left[ {\left( {{L_A} - 1} \right) + {L_B} + {L_C} + {L_D}} \right] + {\varepsilon _{{b_A}}}\\ \Rightarrow {e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{macrostate}}}}{{KT}}}} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{MP} {{e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{microstat{e_i}}}}}{{KT}}}}}  = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{MP} {{e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{microstate}}}}{{KT}}}}}  = MP \cdot {e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{microstate}}}}{{KT}}}} = MP \cdot {e^{ - \frac{{{\varepsilon _{sol}} \cdot \left[ {\left( {{L_A} - 1} \right) + {L"

It is well known that doing science is expensive and lot of economical resources are needed, specially in Synthetic Biology.Processes like PCR, DNA extraction, miniPrep, among others, need specialized equipment and chemical compounds that have considerably high prices and only a few people can afford them. Costs in materials affect the development in Latin American researches in the Synthetic Biology field and the formation of new iGEM teams in Latin America.
Considering this we to organized the second edition of our Low Budget iGEM competition, that aimed to demonstrate that most of the protocols may have a new and cheaper way go being conducted.
What was the competition about?
The teams that accepted this challenge had to design a new and cheaper way to make a normal protocol in the lab. We received excellent and very interesting results, we invite you to check out the process.
The following teams participated:
Paris Bettencourt → developed a cheap spectrophotometer
GSU in collaboration with students of Emory University→ grow broth (J-Broth) File:GSU.pdf
Nagahama→ miniprep with alkaline solution File:Kit.pdf vs File:Alkaline.pdf
Tec Monterrey→ miniprep, EDTA, loading dye and SB buffer using cilantro extract + electrophoresis chamber
TU Darmstadt→ Real time electrophoresis chamber File:TU Darmstadt.ppt
BBK → Extraction of metabolites directly from agar Despite the fact that they did not have quantitative results, they still created a new protocol that can be tested by people who are interested in the matter. We consider their effort as valuable. File:BBK.pdf
All the participants received this sticker:
AAAND The winner will be announced at the Jamboree! Thank you all for participating!
Artistic Contest
Instead of doing the standard polls about people’s perception of synthetic biology, we launched an artistic contest, where each participant developed his or her idea in a short story, a drawing or both.
We had two participants, that each developed opposite ideas about the questions synthetic biology raises for the future. We chose César Nieto as our winner, for his better structured and more appealing short story called “the human software” (not for his posture!). It is noteworthy that our other participant, Alirio Lugo, with his short story “Pandemonium”"

Consequences of intoxication
The consequences of date rape drug intoxication are not only of clinical nature. In an interview with our team, Dr. Jorch, doctor at our local childrens hospital and expert in prevention, explained the dangers of date rape drugs. “Date rape drug intoxication can be a traumatic experience. Not only the possibility of crimes, but also the loss of control and memory are consequences that victims have to face.” Unfortunately, the detection of date rape drugs intoxication is  a problem in the daily clinical schedule due to the short time frame. “In case of admittance of an unconscious patient, we usually determine the blood alcohol level first, because the victims are often admitted from a party where alcohol consume is likely."" Dr. Jorch explained. ""If the results are not congruent with the level of consciousness, further tests are scheduled. But until then, several hours might already have passed. The availability of a cheap, reliable and easy to handle test strip would probably increase the number of tests for date rape drugs, because at the moment we need to send samples to a laboratory. The availability of a test strip for other recreational drugs would also be a valuable tool to quickly determine the ingested toxin and avoid the possible consequences.” He points out that crimes are often committed by people close to the victim. Therefore, the likelihood of testing ones beverage is often not given, as it might have been bought by a person the victim trusts. A test strip could not only be a tool in prevention, but also in diagnostics and forensics.
Detection
Screening for date rape drugs is possible in a specific time frame, 3-10 h after intoxication. Common practice is the detection of GHB in a urine sample via gas spectroscopy. Rapid tests have the disadvantage of cross-reaction with ethanol, which is often involved as well in cases of intoxication ( Franken et al. 2015 ). These enzymatic assays are therefore not suitable for preventional testing of beverages. A repressor/DNA interaction based test has the advantage of specifity. In addition, our cell extract is robust to certain amounts of ethanol. Our rapid test provides significant advantages compared to current testing methods.

After more than a month of brainstorming, we have preliminary designed three sets of experiment scheme. At this moment,IGEM2013-HZAU (Huazhong Agricultural University)and Igem2013-HUST (Huazhong University of Science and Technology) start their experiments. In order to exchange experiences and stronger friendship, three teams had an exchange in 3rd floor meeting room of department of life science, Wuhan university, on a weekend in March. The team leader and the other 6 members of  iGEM2013-HUST attended this meeting， sharing their designing ideas and their following plans。And after that, the team leader of iGEM2013-HZAU with his huge team composed of 10 members, also presented their experimental programs and the favorable conditions provided by their school, which indeed let us envy. Then Zhaoren HE, as the team leader of iGEM2013-WHU, gave a speech about our thoughts of experiments and our appreciation to them for coming the meeting. Finally everybody talked of own thoughts in a cheerful voice, the meeting ended happily.
Display during Scientific Fair
In order to raise the profile of the IGEM, especially to the public who are interested in science, we publicized the IGEM competition and our 2013-IGEM projects (including our final project and our alternative projects) to the whole students of Wuhan University and the citizens living around, in the Scientific Fair of Wuhan University. In this Scientific Fair, we designed display panels and posters to promote IGEM and introduce our project. And thus, made the public feel the fantastic charm of the synthetic biology. We mainly introduced the following topics to the public: (1). Introduced the synthetic biology, including the research propose, research contents, research methods and application of the synthetic biology to the public. (2). Introduced the IGEM, including the organizers, the ideas and significance of this competition. (3). Introduced our IGEM final project: precise gene expression regulation system based on CRISPR-Cas9 and tandem promoter. (4). Introduced our alternative project of raising the content of zinc ion in rice by Escherichia coli, and the project of controlling the protein yield in a properly high level in E.coli by N-starvation system. In addition, we explained how we determined our final project, including the feasibility analysis and value assessment. After this practice, we felt"

Global computational studies can be used to evaluate immense numbers of possible input and output combinations.  One new method of weighting can be added by assigning price values.  This could be used to determine what the most economically valuable metabolic transformation is.  Another improvement is picking the right host organism, which contains the highest fraction of the enzymes needed to conduct a transformation.  Enzymes from other organisms can also be added to the initial host organism in order to add the desired functionality (considering from which sources the enzyme engineering challenge in the host is likely to be minimized).
Moreover, some other helpful features that can be added are assigning price values to all compounds and genes used, and then provide a feature that enables users to calculate the total expenses for ordering the compounds needed for a pathway, and also to order biobricks to carry out the pathway reactions in lab.
These are some of the additional features that could be added to enhance the project.  Other ideas that will also be considered are; adding a tutorial that shows users how to create a biobrick if it does not already exist, and a way to favor reactions and pathways that have been genetically altered over time to create a specific product.  Another tool that could be added is a flux balance analysis, to balance all the inputs and the outputs of the reaction.  Thus, there are several options that are being looked into, for next summer’s team to work on, in order to enhance the current project.
