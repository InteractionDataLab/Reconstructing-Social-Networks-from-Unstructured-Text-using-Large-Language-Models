Members from our team reached out to another local iGEM team, CSU, to meet and talk about our projects at the beginning of the summer. We were able to discuss our projects and our experimental design over some appetizers and drinks at Oskar Blues Brewery. It was here we decided to work together August.
Representatives of our lab traveled to CSU for a two-day experiment to validate our packaging signal part (BBa_1445000). We explained the theory behind our project and shared our protocol for phage amplification. The CSU team then produced phage using our packaging signal part and compared its delivery to a similar plasmid containing an insert with no known phagemid packaging ability. In order to accommodate the time constraints, we shortened the protocol by removing the lengthy incubation. This, along with other errors along the way likely led to the unexpected results.
During our stay, we related to their current problems with Gibson Assembly and offered solutions that had worked for us. Additionally, we cultivated ideas for a combined outreach program. These plans were not realized this year but set the groundwork for future and more extensive collaboration between the schools next summer.
We also participated in the following surveys for other iGEM teams:
Complexity – Zurich
Policy and Practices – Warwick
On the concept of living and Bioart – Paris-Saclay
Bioethics and Biotechnology in XXI century – Brasil-SP
Modeling and Survey – AMU-Poznan

Explain how you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory work.
Describe and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as you submit your parts to the Registry.
Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?
Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they?  Provide a link to them online if possible.
Yes, we have our own biosafety rules to follow. The link below is the documents about laboratory rules for all the university, including our igem-research-laboratory. National Chiao Tung University - Environmental Protection and Safety Center The rules in this website are strictly followed by our researchers, and administrators who are in charge of laboratory safety will come regularly and check if the rules are fully followed.
Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns or changes that were made based on this review.
Yes, we have equivalent committee and well discussed our project with them.
In our university, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), the Environmental and Safety Center (ESC) is strictly responsible for Safety of all labs in the school. What we can do in our project should follow the rules they permit, and they manage all instruments and chemicals, especially for dangerous and toxic ones, in all labs. The ESC is to be informed on the basis of our project and on what we are doing and plan to do. Therefore, the ESC has permitted our project at first.
In addition, we do our wetlab activities in Common Instrument Rooms where are in charge of Biomedical Engineering Lab of Dr. Chih-Sheng Lin and Applied Microbiology & Biochemistry Lab of Dr. Ching-Ping Tseng. They would check whether the rules are followed or not everyday, and every time someone starts to work in these rooms, he or she should take down his or her student numbers in a log. Besides, when someone uses a common instrument, he or she should record the purpose for the instrument.
Briefly, under these requirements, the progress for our project would not raise any possible safety issues.
Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If so, describe this training.
Yes, all the researchers included in the project are all well trained. They have all already received laboratory safety classes and practical trainings about safety instructions such as which toxic medicine should be aware, the instruments introduction and emergency response, etc.
Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?  If so, provide a link to them online if possible.

1 Building A Mathematic Model
2 Comparing simulation results with experimental data
3 Conclusion
This model describes the locomotion of worms in the Gaussian Plate ( the second layer of the microfluidic chip). It is based on the mathematic model of the Galton Nail Plate (Figure 1.)
Different from classical Galton board(Fig.1), it is worms rather than balls running on the plate. We use worms as the “ball”. However, when a worm is choosing a direction at the crossing, its previous choice may influence current choice due to worm’s relative long body.
Fig. 1 The simulation of Galton board
This model is applied in the experiment to demonstrate whether the insertion undermine the function of AWA and AWB neurons. Worms with normal neurons will be attracted by diacetyl and be repelled by 2-nonanone.
Fig. 2 The Gaussian distribution A) The ideal Gaussian distribution before adding chemicals. B) The changed Gaussian distribution after adding chemicals by using the first diffusion methods, which means diacetyl diffuse in the same plate as the Gaussian Plate .
Building A Mathematic Model
Whether the Gaussian Plate works as our expectation is the main concern in this experiment. Different from classical Galton board, there are worms rather than balls running on the plate. The previous choice of them may affect the current choice due to their relatively long body.
We introduced a parameter ‘ka’ (0<=ka<=1) in our model to describe the extent that the previous choice will influences on the current choice.
The ‘ka’ is defined as the absolute value of difference between the probability of two direction choices (Fig 3. ).
Fig 3. Diagram of parameter ‘ka’. ‘ka’equals to absolute value of difference between the probability of two direction choices.
It means the greater the ‘ka’ is the greater the influence of previous choice is. Especially, when ‘ka’ is zero, the simulation model is more like Gaussian distribution.

Das hört sich jetzt schlimmer an, als es ist. Du wirst selbst in der heißen Laborphase noch zu deinem Feierabendbier kommen und da wir ein relativ großes Team sind, kann die Arbeit so verteilt werden, dass niemand alles erledigen muss (Stichwort Engagement). Letztlich nehmen wir an iGEM teil, weil wir Laborarbeit gerne mögen und wir mit iGEM die Möglichkeit haben, ein ganz eigenes Projekt von Anfang bis Ende zu erdenken und zu begleiten.
iGEM ist kein bierernster Wettbewerb, sogar die Konkurrenz zwischen den Teams ist sehr gering ( stattdessen wird international zusammengearbeitet ). Wir haben gewöhnlich eine entspannte Atmosphäre in unseren Team und machen nur zu unserem eigenen Spaß und aus Neugier bei iGEM mit. Spaß ist praktisch die Hauptsache. Und genau den können wir bieten.
 
Übrigens: Studenten und Studentinnen der Biochemie können sich durch die Laborarbeit im Rahmen von iGEM bis zu 10 ECTS (Soft Skills) verdienen.

Once we received this fragment cloned in pSBAT3 we amplified the part by PCR. Primer 1 will incorporate a HinDIII site and primer 2 will incorporate a BamHI. Checked that these enzymes don’t cut the fragment:
We cut the PCR fragment and clone into pMutin4 cut with the same enzymes (diagram below is pMutin2 but this is essentially the same)
We then integrate into the 168 chromosome using homology between our cotC fusion and the native copy of cotC.
c) Testing and Characterisation
Once transformed the spores of the mutant will need to be tested for fluorescence. Two obvious methods:
1) Fluorescence microscopy: grow the cells in sporulation medium and look under the microscope for fluorescent spores.
2) Purify spores and measure their fluorescence in a fluorescence plate reader.
3) We would also test whether the strain is able to absorb cadmium in the spores when compared to the wild-type.

This, combined with the observation by [16] that transcription factors tend to be toxic when overexpressed, led us to recommend the experimental team to use low-copy plasmids or genome integrations of AimR when using them in E. coli.

SECA_NZ,2017,Team:SECA NZ#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," increased exports from kiwifruit alone.
The kiwifruit industry in 2016 produced $1.668 Billion in exports according to http://www.hea.co.nz/2012-05-11-03-05-28/kiwifruit-trade
A loss of 1% of the total crop due to frost per annum for 5 years would be a loss of                 $1,688,000,000 x 0.05 = $84.4 million.
Even a benefit of 10% increased frost resilience would save $8.44 million over 5 years.
This is just an estimate for kiwifruit.
Potential return on investment to the licensee after 5 years of sales
The licensee, now receiving 1% more crop per annum, would receive the economic benefit of this minus the costs associated with implementation. This value is significantly less clear as the costs of different crops varies so wildly in this regard.
Key assumptions:
The pilot study proves a success.
There is a PI and a PhD student who want to continue this work.
More investment will come as this project grows.
This isn’t being worked on by a large company already.

Mitigation:
Time Constraints
Our project only runs for the span of a year. For it to reach its full potential, the project would have to be developed into a PHD project.
There is potential for the project to be continued as a PHD project. We need to connect with those academics and researchers who could continue this.
IP
The barriers to getting IP rights on our product/technology is unclear. Our research so far has been inconclusive, and we need further professional guidance regarding this.
We have to seek further guidance regarding the IP rights to our project. We have been advised that this portion of the project is not IP protected but it is likely that future portions of the project will be.
Commercial
Companies may be unwilling to invest in these ideas to a commercial level as a result of this technology being novel and the public's reactions not being known
Seeking to collaborate with companies while in the development stage will ensure the final seeds produced have the best chance of success in the marketplace.
Regulations
New Zealand is behind other countries in terms of embracing G.E Currently our technology would have no place in the New Zealand market. The regulations are being re-thought, but this is generally a time consuming process.
In the time the project takes to get adequate results, it is hoped that New Zealand will become more tolerant of G.E technologies.  Currently the regulations regarding G.E is"

Medal Criteria
Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Gold Medal Criterion #3
To complete for the gold medal criterion #3, please describe your work on this page and fill out the description on your judging form . To achieve this medal criterion, you must convince the judges that your team has gained insight into your project from modeling. You may not convince the judges if your model does not have an effect on your project design or implementation.
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
Best Model Special Prize
To compete for the Best Model prize , please describe your work on this page  and also fill out the description on the judging form . Please note you can compete for both the gold medal criterion #3 and the best model prize with this page.
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for the Best Model Prize.

Lysis Module
Our team designed but was unable to test this module due to the limitation of not being able to work directly with Streptococcus       Pneumoniae (Biosafety level 2) in our lab. This module proposes to kill Streptococcus Pneumoniae upon detection when coupled       with the detection and regulation modules by releasing specific bacteriophage lytic enzymes, Cpl-1 and Pal.
Amidase (PAL)- cleaves the peptidoglycan between N-acetylmuramic acid and L-alanine
Lysozyme (CPl-1)- cleaves the glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine
Fig ? . The lysis Module.
The enzymes are tagged with osmY (Washington 2012) via a linker to be exported out of Escherichia coli. Both enzymes have       very different N-terminal catalytic sites and share a similar C-terminal cell wall attachment site, which binds to choline in both cases.       Cleavage with either of these enzymes results in a weakening in the cell wall, which leads to the externalization of the cytoplasmic       membrane and ultimate lysis of S. pneumoniae.

We have successfully talked to microorganisms. Yeast cultures already talk to us when they are hungry ( neat and marked fluorescence is emitted when there is no glucose in the medium). Taking into account the relevance of yeasts in fermentative processes of the alimentary industry, these results open up new possibilities in the application of our talking yeasts in the control and monitorization of that kind of processes. Moreover, we achieved true dialogues with E. coli. All our biobricks worked as expected in E. coli, and allowed it to answer the following questions: “Are you hot?” (thermal shock sensitivity); “Are you hungry?” (glucose); “Do you have enough nitrogen?” ; and “Can you breathe?” . We did so by encoding the questions into light wavelenghths that excite reporter proteins, which were cloned under the control of environment-sensitive promoters. Emitted light pulses were encoded back into the answers “I am cool”, “I am hungry”, etc. We could even make E. coli obey our orders by encoding the “Express your gene” sentence into a promoter-activation wavelength.
We submitted seven biobricks to the registry and fulfilled all other requirements listed at the judging form. Most of our constructions did also work on another bacterial species, Citrobacter freundii: We collaborated with the Edimburg iGEM team sending them our bacterial biobricks (BBa_K763000, BBa_K763001, BBa_K763002, BBa_K763003 & BBa_K763004). They have tested them and the results obtained are collected in this link.

Module 1: Conjugation system
The goal of the Conjugation module was to create a 'helper' plasmid which could conjugate a signal plasmid to other cells containing the helper plasmid. While this type of system has been hinted at in the past, it has never been implemented due to several reasons. Conjugative plasmids contain membrane bound protein known as 'entry exclusion' or 'surface exclusion' protein [ 5 ] which prevent conjugation between two cells containing the same plasmid. Creating a system which can achieve our goal requires several knockouts to be done on the conjugative plasmid.
Selecting the Conjugation system
There are many different conjugation systems, with F and IncP being among the most used by previous iGEM teams. The IncP incompatibility group is further divided into two groups IncP-alpha aka Birmingham aka RP4 plasmid and the IncP-beta R751 plasmid. We chose to use the IncP-beta system R751 plasmid for several reasons:
F has two surface exclusion proteins (TraT, TraS), while IncP has only one (trbK) [ 4 ]
F has a self-imposed fertility inhibition system (new donors fertile for only about 6 generations), while IncP systems have no self-imposed fertility inhibition system. [ 4 ]
Smaller plasmid size:
R751 is 53423 bp [ 1 ]
RP4 is 60099 bp [ 2 ]
F is 99159 bp [ 3 ]
The R751 oriTR has been biobricked and verified to be working.
Our helper plasmid is based on a modified R751 plasmid.
Selecting genes to knockout
Entry exclusion
As mentioned earlier, the goal of this part of the project is to allow a signal plasmid to be transmitted between cells containing conjugation helper plasmids (modified R751). In nature this does occur but at very low levels, due"

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4

Designing the XY-Plane
In order for TERRA to select for specific locations to dispense fluids, we needed a method of either moving the output tube or the vessel, such as a 96-well plate. We ultimately decided to move the vessel, as that would minimize the length of and amount of dead volume in the output tube. Our team designed an active XY-plane, which would allow us to move the platform in the X- and Y-direction to target a specific location. This XY-plane needed to have the following functions and features: the ability for translational motion; a homing system; a control system; a manufacturing method; material; and motors.
The following morphological chart illustrates our potential means of accomplishing each function or feature and the chosen options are written in green.

Translational Motion: We chose to use a system of timing belts and pulleys as it is more accurate and creates less backlash than threaded rods. The timing belts and pulleys are also more cost effective, as they are as accurate as higher-end threaded rods, which would be necessary for smooth translational motion. The pulleys are also easier to mount and integrate into the design of the XY-plane than threaded rods.
Homing: Our team chose to utilize contact switches in order to home our system as they were the easiest to integrate into the existing design of TERRA and were low-cost. We had briefly considered manual, user-controlled homing, but realized that it would result in a great amount of human error, as the user would need to approximate the distance from the nozzle to the well A1. Optical sensors and ultrasonic sensors would result in accurate locations, but would increase the cost of TERRA"

Introduction
Right from the beginning our team wanted to address a real-world issue which was local in Finland and didn’t have any current solutions available. In one of our brainstorming sessions we came up with the problem of blue-green algae. Check out our introduction video “Matti and the cyanobacteria” to see how our solution for this problem would work!
Project overview
Our project can be divided into two parts: firstly, detecting the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin from water and secondly, degrading it when necessary. Both the detection and degradation happen with the help of modified baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Our idea is summed up in Figure 1.
Figure 1. A simplified diagram of the detection mechanism and degradation enzyme production processes in genetically modified yeast.
Detection:
The first step in the detection of microcystin is to get the toxin inside the yeast cell. Normal yeast lab strains are not known to be capable of doing this, but there is one strain, normally used in winemaking, which is capable of importing microcystins. This strain (VL3) has a variant of a transporter normally present in yeast that is capable of importing the toxin (Valério, 2014). In our project, we will replace our strain’s original, non-toxin importing transporter gene from the yeast’s genome with the one from VL3. This way our lab strain will also be able to transport the microcystin inside the cell.
When microcystin is imported into eukaryotic cells, it causes oxidative stress. This increases the activity of certain transcription factors, which activate genes involved in the oxidative stress response (He and Fassler, 2005). We take advantage of this natural response in our detection mechanism. In our engineered yeast, promoter regions of genes involved in oxidative stress response are coupled to genes coding for yellow fluorescent protein. Consequently, when encountering microcystin, our yeast will start to produce yellow fluorescent protein, and the resulting fluorescence can then be measured. We hope that the level of fluorescence will correspond to the extent of oxidative stress, and therefore also the concentration of microcystin.
The detection mechanism will be modelled to support our experiments and to provide suggestions for actual promoter design. We also hope to be able to predict the response of our promoter constructs to different microcystin levels with"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," synthesis. An experiment is conducted utilizing an octanol-assisted liposome assembly (OLA) method. Liposomes are formed when three unique phases (solutions - OA phase, LO phase and IA phase) form a correct interphase at the junction (Fig. 6). The IA phase (inner aqueous) occupies the inner part of the liposome and contains an IVTT transcription/translation system, DNA, membrane protein integration machinery, chaperones and salts needed for protein synthesis and integration into the membrane of the liposome. The LO phase contains lipids (i.e. DOPC, Cholesterol) and organic solvent (i.e. 2-octanol); it can also contain fluorescent lipids, such as Rh PE, for imaging. This phase introduces all of the components that will form the liposomes’ membrane. Octanol acts as an organic solvent for phospholipids. In the OLA method, initially double emulsions are formed; the excess octanol and lipids dewet and separate from the droplet leaving double-layered liposomes.  Octanol removal from liposomes is crucial as the correct bilayer cannot form in excess organic solvent.  Lastly, the OA phase (outer aqueous) contains surfactants that help stabilize the droplets at the initial formation and propagation through the microfluidic channels.
Fig. 6 A  close-up of the phase interface during liposome synthesis; IA phase contains elements required for the synthesis                              and integration of membrane proteins; LO phase consists of octanol and lipids that form a lipid bilayer; OA solution                              carries surfactants that stabilize the initial formation and propagation of the droplets along the microfluidic device.
Optimized flow rates for high throughput synthesis
With this method, we effectively produce monodisperse bilayered liposomes with high throughput. It is important to note that together with the microchannel dimensions, the infusion rates of the different phases also have an impact on the size of the droplets. Additionally, the infusion rates regulate the throughput of liposome production. The already mentioned SynFlow model determines the optimized flow rates for the most stable and highest frequency synthesis. With the right dimensions and flow rates we reach the production rate that is up to 2000 Hz. The results suggest that this method could be successfully adapted for mass production of liposomes. Fig. 7 reveals the slowed down process of droplet formation.

As a result of her ignorance and continued lack of birth control, she became pregnant at a young age and had a child she couldn’t properly care for. Read More >> Another woman mentioned that when she attended a routine check-up with her male friend, the male received free condoms just for being a man while she was not given any condoms or additional information about birth control methods. This statement correlates with statements from the other women, which describe that culture plays a large part in birth control issues; Mexico is largely Catholic which discourages women from discussing their sex lives. Many women feel too embarrassed or ashamed to purchase contraception, and they feel forced to have unprotected sex and take care of the child(ren) that may result. We hope that our new, discrete birth control method may help women feel more at ease, as it won’t require them to routinely purchase it in public.
New Zealand
Ava, New Zealand Citizen
Ava, an alum from the University of Otago, shared that she often struggles to obtain birth control. In New Zealand, 15-minute appointments with a local health care provider are available to all citizens but are too short to be personalized enough to the patient, and while longer appointments are available, they are more expensive. This lack of personalization and Ava’s lack of funds deterred her from pursuing birth control forms that require a prescription, so she instead pursued condom use. Read More >> One-use condoms, however, became expensive after a while, and Ava decided to spend her money on things she saw more important than her sexual health. Although many of her peers used oral contraceptives, her low-income background forced her to prioritize buying food and paying rent over sexual protection. Sexual health education is not emphasized in the rural areas around Ava and locals still use traditional forms of birth control, many of which are painful, unsafe, and/or ineffective. For example, in areas where poroporo leaves are found, people make a broth from these leaves that they believe acts as a contraceptive. The leaves have not been shown to suppress ovulation (The Encyclopedia of New Zealand). These misconceptions and alternatives prove to our team how much our cheap and safe contraceptive is needed.

Firstly, its output signal should be measurable with the use of equipment which is inexpensive, portable, and easy to handle by non-specialists. Secondly, the signal should be easily quantifiable: the relation between analyte concentration and output signal should be not too complicated. Thirdly, the output system should be modular. This means that different sensing elements (for example promoters) should be easy to connect to the output mechanism. Stated in a different way, the biosensor should have plug-and-play functionality.
Application
Our ELECTRACE system consists of bacteria which generate a current as a response to the measurement of an analyte.  This current will be measured with a three-electrode setup and some circuitry called a potentiostat. This will be put together in a small handheld device.
Figure 2: Overview of a possible implementation of the ELECTRACE system
The bacterial part will consist of E. coli cells which contain the BioBricks that make electron transport possible.  The transcription and translation of the Mtr proteins, which form the transmembrane complex that makes extracellular electron transport possible, will be under control  of a promoter sensitive to the compound we want to detect. In this way, the amount of ET complexes is directly coupled to the concentration of the analyte. Each of the ET complexes contributes to the overall extracellular electron transport. Therefore, the amount of transported electrons is directly related to the concentration of  the analyte.  To measure the amount of transported electrons, we have developed a gadget . This gadget consists of a microfluidic chamber in which the bacteria are placed, together with three electrodes. The extracellular electrons will reduce one of these electrodes, resulting in a current. This current will be measured with an integrated potentiostat. The outcome of a measurement (the current strength) is directly related to the amount of ET complexes and therefore the concentration of the analyte.
Inexpensive
The two main elements of the ELECTRACE system, namely the genetically modified bacteria, and the potentiostat circuitry, have great potential to be mass-produced. Mass production will make the system very inexpensive. Also, the novel technique of paper microfluidics provides an opportunity to make our device even cheaper. A very coarse approximation of the cost of an mass-produced ELECTRACE device would be around $10: $1 for the GMOs on a microfluidic paper strip, $4 for the potentiostat circuitry, and $5 for the casing. Although coarse, this price estimate clearly shows a"

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Human Practice#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html,"Benefits. Why GMO plants and crops? What are the real benefits? Can we really do better then natural selection, which is very powerful? Some researcher promised 2nd generation GMO plants that can resist to drought, but at the moment it is very unlikely that we can achieve such a thing: we still do not understand most physiological mechanisms in plants.
Risks. We are at a time where technique advances faster then science. For example, we have been able to model a bike for only 10years, although we have been riding this engine for much longer. We did not wait for a working model of the bike to use it. This is happening for GMO's. We do not have complete models yet. Nowadays, we live in a society that tries to maximize innovation, to go as fast as possible, where no one takes the time to understand how things work anymore. Researchers from the public sector should demand that money be invested in other things then innovation: to try and understand how things for instance. The risk associated to the release of GM bacteria in the wild is at the moment impossible to assess. The best we can do at the moment are disaster scenario: for example, we could imagine that the bacteria that we but in a lake to purify water will end up binding an ion that is vital for the life of other organisms in that lake. However, we are not yet able to model the whole lake. Nor are we able to imagine all that could possibly go wrong, or necessarily notice if something actually went wrong.
Our system. You are trying to minimize the time your bacteria is in the wild, but people that want to maximize economical benefits might, on the contrary, try and maximize the time a GM bacteria will be able to remain in the wild.
Discussion with the public. The discussion with the public on GMO crops and plants started during the peak of the mad cow disease. People asked researcher to stop species transgression because it is not natural. Sociologues conducted studies, and concluded that behind this idea of transgression that can seem a bit irrational, there was a more rational fear. Things seen as ""natural"" are not necessarily less dangerous, but at least they are familiar. People know what to expect. They know what to eat and what not to eat for example (they know which food they are allergic too, what mushroom is poisonous, etc). With transgenic food, they loose their landmarks. We are in an empirical science, we cannot predict what will happen if we change the parameters.
Regulations. There is a big problem due to lobbies. They have a huge power. Lobbying in ministeries"

Most importantly, the design shRNA must satisfy at least two points in 14, 15 and 16.
Solution: We wrote a small program with C++. This program asked the user to input their mRNA sequence and it
would generate a series of shRNA sequences with length between 21nt and 23nt. Then the program would check
these sequences how many requirements they satisfied, and ranked them by this number.  Download the tool.
Result: NJU-China used our tool and generated the sequence of shRNA targeting to K-ras gene. The predicted se-

“FLAVOFF” Ethics
Our project includes genetic change that is not welcome by the entire population. It raises many concerns and questions we can not necessarily answer. To try to understand the perceptions of public opinion on this issue, we performed a number of steps:
A public opinion survey - the survey examined the perceptions that exist about gene therapy. The survey was conducted through social networking by questioning students.
A school debate on the issue.
An interview with professionals who work in the field of our project.
Opinion polls: whether genetic modification is a blessed or cursed act
(perceptions about gene therapy)
300 participants answered the survey we distributed.
Participants age groups from 15 to 65.
Survey Results
100% of participants stated and demonstrated that they understand and know what genetic modification is.
100% of participants recognized the potential in the field of genetic modification.
80% of participants agreed that the field of genetic engineering should be explored.
33%  stated they were willing to experiment on their bodies genetic modification for example using the product ""FLAVOFF"". Most of those who agreed were 25 years old and younger.
Debate on the subject of genetic modification and ethics:
""Is genetic modification a blessed move or cursed?""
From the survey a need arose to conduct further investigation with a more targeted age range. We held the debate at school; Students from ninth through twelfth grade were invited to the debate. We were interested to see the reaction of the young audience regarding the ethical question. 250 students were present at the event. 2 students had prepared ahead arguments about the use of genetic modification. At the end of a heated and learning debate a vote was held in front of the young audience.
Results of the debate showed that the youth is very open to scientific changes, they are aware of the biological dangers however realize that research in this area and experience can save lives and improve the quality of life dramatically.
Recruiting the public - “FLAVOFF” for Everybody
After holding a public opinion poll we thought it necessary to deepen the knowledge about gene therapy in order to deepen their understanding in this area. The interview was conducted in order to understand professionally the degree of necessity in our product, the degree of success it may have for those who use it.
First we turned to professionals to hear their views about gene therapy.

In the afternoon we picked single colonies from dish-cultured 6&leuB which we coated yesterday to LB solution for shaking culture. There were no colonies on 8&6 dishes. We supposed that K-antibiotic was not valid so repeated the transformation and coated the product to new K+ dishes.
After enzyme digestion of RFPpart by E and P, we conducted the large scale of gel-collection to use its P5B1C3 vector to standardize the part. (the size of previous vector was wrong)
We used the four rested parts that needed to be standardized to continue PCR. raiR was successfully polymerized and was collected after enzyme digestion by E and P with the other seven parts that have been successfully polymerized.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the origination and degradation of cell free gene doping DNA in the blood. We used the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene as our model gene, and have thus included the EPO-dependent production of red blood cells in our model through a series of partial differential equations. Figure 3 shows the simplified process in the body for gene doping with the EPO gene. The result was a time-dependant concentration in the bloodstream of the gene doping DNA, which was used in the wetlab experiments. The detailed information on this model can be found on our Modeling page .
Figure 3. A representation of EPO based gene doping. Viral vectors infect kidney cells, increasing their production of EPO. The increased concentration of EPO in the blood leads to an increased production of red blood cells. The red blood cell count acts as a feedback loop that determines the endogenous production of EPO.
1.3 Extraction Verification
Aim: Verify successful extraction of low concentrated cfDNA from blood serum.
Approach: To verify successful extraction of the low amounts of cfDNA, we combined two approaches. First we quantified the cfDNA using the Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) dsDNA kit. Second, we verified the correct DNA extraction by amplification of the bovine albumin gene, a standard for verification of genomic mammalian DNA extraction and recommended by Sanquin, using nested PCR.
Figure 4. Graphical representation of the nested PCR on the bovine albumin gene. First round of PCR amplifies a fragment of 229 bp. Product of the first round will be used as a template for the second round, amplifying the final fragment of 153 bp.
1.4 Gene Doping DNA Extraction
Aim: Show successful extraction of predicted concentrations of gene doping DNA.
Approach: We used an artificial intronless human EPO gene to simulate gene doping. Prior to the extraction we spiked the serum with this EPO gene doping DNA, using concentrations matching the predicted values of gene doping DNA from the gene doping model. Two different forms of artificial EPO doping DNA were spiked, the linear intronless EPO gene and the same fragment cloned in pSB1C3 (EPO biobrick, BBa_K2643004 ). The extraction of the EPO spiked serum was verified by two PCR’s.
2. Prescreening
During our interaction with the Dutch Doping Authorities, Dr. Oliver de Hon emphasised the importance of a high throughput assay to screen thousands of athletes simultaneously. He recommended a rapid, sensitive and cheap initial filter to reduce the total quantity of samples"
ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," AHL at the same time point into different bacterial colonies. The factor that we want to observe is the strength of the activation of the Lux promoter. The read-out is made by the fluorescence. The data was gathered over several time points in order to be able to observe the dynamic behavior. More precisely, the read-out of the promoter activation is made by the relative fluorescence, which corresponds to the ratio of the absolute fluorescence over the Optical Density (OD). We consider that the concentration in GFP per cell is proportional to the relative fluorescence. As we try to avoid fitting the saturation events, we chose to normalize with respect to the highest value before a certain amount of time, which corresponds for each experiment to the apparition of the saturation.
As a first approach, we only try to fit the steady state value. As the signaling molecule is inducing the production of GFP, we chose to use an Hill function to fit the function [GFP] = f([AHL]) at steady state.
If Hill functions fit these two curves good, the parameters used are surprising. For our system, we suppose that AHL binds to the regulator protein LuxR. This complex called Rlux dimerizes before binding to the promoter to induce its expression. Thus, the dimerization event makes cooperativity emerge from AHL molecules. It is translated for a Hill function by n > 1. In this particular case, one could expect to find n=2 (as it is a dimerization event). Nevertheless, the n found are on the order of magnitude of 1 (0.89 for the non-riboregulated promoter plasmid and 1.22 for the ribo-regulated promoter plasmid). The data points were collected in triplicates and this allow us to have a look at the variability (namely standard deviation) around each value. Where the switch happens, the variability is higher (it is expected because the output GFP is more sensitive to variation of the input [AHL] around the switching point). Therefore, the inflexion points could need some improvment, by taking more points around this identified sensitive region. Moreover, this critical concentration of AHL was the one that was expected given the litterature and our system. We observe that it needs a higher [AHL] for the riboregulated system to be activated than for the non-riboregulated system.
We modeled leakiness as an offset in the Hill function : [GFP] = g([AHL]) = f([AHL]) + aLeakiness. We obtain the expected information that the signal over noise ratio is"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html,", an association for some of the most talented high school students in Denmark. During the workshop we invited the students into our laboratories, where they conducted a miniprep and a gel electrophoresis on bacteria containing our BioBricks. Additionally, we held a presentation and discussion about our project, with the dedicated students. We strongly believe in mutual communication and made sure to compile feedback, all of which was positive!
Presentations for the Local Schools
The local high schools, Mulernes Legatskole and Odense Tekniske Gymnasium, invited us to present our project, in addition to starting discussions with the students about GMO.
An 8th grade class from the local public school, Odense Friskole, were invited to see our laboratory workspace. It was a challenge to successfully convey our project and the concept of synthetic biology in a way that would be easily understandable by 8th graders, who have only recently been introduced to science. A challenge that we accepted and solved, by relaying the fundamentals in synthetic biology, e.g. the basics of a cell, DNA, and GMO.
From all of these presentations and interactions with younger individuals, we had a strong intuition that it had made an influence on their awareness of synthetic biology. This intuition was supported by the positive feedback provided by teachers and students. An awareness of how new scientific technologies can be a feasible solution to a possible energy crisis. Technologies such as synthetic biology, with endless capabilities to achieve efficacy, since no one knows what tomorrow brings. For more information about this read To Future iGEM Teams
Final Presentation at SDU-Denmark
The day before we travelled to Boston, we booked one of the big auditoriums at the University of Southern Denmark, for the final rehearsal of our jamboree presentation. We made sure to take note of all the feedback and tips we received, while also implementing these into our final presentation. This event was promoted on all the information screens at our university in order to attract a broad audience and increase the interest for iGEM. Thus, making it possible to reach a substantial amount of future applications for the SDU-iGEM team and ensure that the iGEM spirit will continue to prosper in the future!
Social Media
Social media is an easy way to impact a high number of people, so a strategy was concocted with the intention of reaching as many people as possible with our outreach. Our strategy yielded marvellous results, amongst which was a video on our project, that reached viewers equal to 16% of our hometown’s population, along with becoming the second most"

AMR STRATEGY
MEETING WITH AMR COMMITTEE
The 5 Year Plan
Antibiotic resistance is clearly a problem that needs to be tackled on a global scale. However, global plans do not consider the more detailed aspects of tackling the problem, whereas national strategies have this at their core. The UK government is adopting the five year antimicrobial resistance (AMR) strategy; a collaboration between a host of organisations from the Government Departments for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and the National Health Service (NHS) as well as the Ministry of Defence.
Click here for the AMR report
Together these organisations set out a number of action points for seeing a reduction in antibiotic resistance over the next 5 years, beginning from 2013.
The report listed the following as targets:
Good infection prevention and control measures to help prevent infections occurring become the norm in all sectors of human and animal health,
Infections can be diagnosed quickly and the right treatment used,
Patients and animal keepers fully understand the importance of antibiotic treatment regimens and adhere to them,
Surveillance is in place which quickly identifies new threats or changing patterns in resistance,
There is a sustainable supply of new, effective antimicrobials.
The government is also calling for quick diagnosis of infections in tackling antibiotic resistance - we feel we could answer this call with our device.
The Rapid Diagnostics Steering Committee Interview
To design our device according to the requirements of the UK government, we consulted a member of the AMR Rapid Diagnostics Steering subgroup, David Oglesby. Below is what we learned from our time with him.
David Oglesby,
Clinical Fellow and member of the Rapid Diagnostics Steering Group
According to David Oglesby, a device like ours would significantly aid national and global governments in combating antibiotic resistance. Our device uses the biomarker lipocalin-2, which is produced by a host in response to bacterial infections and is not pathogen-specific. Our device is unable to differentiate between different bacterial infections, and so we asked Mr. Oglesby if this is a limitation.
His response was “Absolutely not. When you look at the reports around that say where antibiotic resistance is coming from... one of the biggest [issues] you still find is that people [are receiving] antibiotics when [they have] viral infections…”
Furthermore, Mr. Oglesby said that the device would have to be accurate enough to give doctors confidence in the results,"

Motivation
Remember ’Mystique’ from the X-men franchise? Albeit prone to a little villainy,  she is that amazing character with the blue skin; and possessed the uncanny ability  to effortlessly transform into anyone at will. Quite an intriguing capability; her  cells had the potency to reconfigure into any individual of choice as per necessity.  Now, that may be a far fetched dream, but we can take a lesson or two from  Mystique’s biological gifts. For instance, reconfigurable electronic circuits may not  be far out of reach [? ];these systems would be the ideal multitaskers, switching  between functionalities as the need arises. Synthetic Biology also seems to be  vying for a place in this domain; from reconfigurable logic gate systems [2, 4] to  systems with switchable dynamical behavior [1, 2, 6].  On an abstract level, the idea of reconfigurablity resonates with Team iGem IIT  Delhi. Works like [1, 6] that propose a novel synthetic circuit, which can act both  as an oscillator and a toggle switch have been a major influence on our work. The projet is divided into two parts; and at the heart of it all lies a ”Sychnronized  Quorum of Genetic Clocks” [3]. First, we develop a reconfigurable circuit that  can switch between an oscillator and a toggle switch. We realize this circuit  using the oscillator of [3]. In order to achieve a toggle switch behavior, we add  the lambda repressor; which is susceptible to thermal denaturation. Thus, at  temperatures of around 30 deg. celsius the system acts as a toggle switch, since  the lambda repressor is constitutively produced and represses AiiA. However, as  the temperature is raised to 37 deg. celsius, the lambda repressor undergoes  thermal denat"

Overview
Coordinated action is required to minimize emergence and spread of antibacterial resistance (ABR). The World Health Organisation have recently (May 2015) endorsed a global action plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance.
The plan sets out 5 objectives:
Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance
Strengthen surveillance and research
Reduce the incidence of infection
Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines
Ensure sustainable investment in countering antimicrobial resistance
Our work is focused on the first two WHO objectives. In our system , we are developing the use of bacteria as living therapeutics to provide an alternative to administering antibiotics, thereby addressing objective number two. However, ABR cannot be overcome with research alone in view of the fact that misinformed antibiotic use contributes a large part to the increasing worldwide acquired ABR.
In line with the first objective of the WHO global action plan, to improve awareness and understanding of ABR, our project relies on a three way conversation between the team, the public and experts. This influences every aspect of our project, from our choice of application to the details of our delivery system. The emphasis of our Policy and Practises is to take an iterative approach to developing our idea, continuously taking input from the public and healthcare professionals, so as to ensure that our project could become a realistic method to overcome ABR.
The practices approach of our project has been inspired by the Royal College of General Practitioners TARGET Antibiotics Toolkit. TARGET stands for: Treat Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education, Tools. 1 Our guidance comes from healthcare professionals and the public; in terms of education we have worked on increasing awareness of ABR and synthetic biology; and our tools are based around using engineered bacteria as therapeutic agents. The targeted nature of our solution is achieved by building the project around our practices, constantly feeding back and forth between the two.

Collaboration is a powerful driver of progress in science. To stand on the shoulders of giants is increasingly unrealistic in a globalised world where scientists work in ever more specialised areas and without geographic or language barriers.
For science to continue to benefit from globalisation, we must advance the axiom and seek to build a human pyramid from the shoulders before and around us. Collaboration and open source data are at the heart of iGEM and so too the heart of Incell.
Below we describe our most significant collaborations within the iGEM community. The symbiosis we strive for in our project has shone brightly through the partnerships established with teams around the world. Our story — and the stories of our friends — have been mutually shaped by the diversity of our shared experiences, knowledge and perspectives.

In the tradition of the previous year’s winners hosting the following year’s conference, we had the pleasure to host teams from the Nordic region in Copenhagen. Teams had the opportunity to present their projects and receive questions and feedback from peers and judges. It was beneficial and a huge confidence boost for teams to be able to play with presentation strategy and get a feel for which parts of project stories gained traction and areas in need of development."

Additionally, we will be delivering this same workshop in conjunction with the Art|Sci Center at UCLA in the upcoming academic quarter.  We hope that by discussing the basic science and displaying the simple techniques used to construct these synthetic silks, that we bridge the gap between understanding the intrinsic artistic properties of silk, and the power of the engineering principles that derive them.   We invite all LA locals to attend both of our workshops this year!
Public Outreach and Science Communication: Ask Us Anything on Reddit's r/AskScience!
Third, while synthetic biology as an emerging field has revolutionized the biotechnology industry and inspired hundreds of scientists to pursue biological engineering interdisciplinary methods in their investigations, there is a severe lack of public knowledge in the field.  With significant miscommunication and issues in public perfection on to use of engineered organisms for manufacturing and production of items, we sought to combat those issues through public engagement and support.  Namely, we conducted an online public ""interview"" through the popular internet forum Reddit, where we conducted an Ask Me Anything , where public commenters and members of the iGEM team could freely disseminate information to the general public.  Our AMA was a success, we generated over 1400 up votes and approximately 100 questions reneging from issues stemming from our project, to how iGEM and synthetic biology can positively impact current academic research and frontiers in biotechnology.  We were very honored to represent iGEM and the silk engineering field to the wide public through our interview!
Education Outreach and Inspiring Future STEM Careers: Gene Circuit Lesson
Lastly, we wanted to bring this level of education not only to artists, but also to the next generation of scientists.  Students attending at-risk and underprivileged high schools are becoming less interested in pursuing STEM-related career fields. To help engage our community, we partnered with a UCLA science outreach group called, CityLab and a nonprofit education summer camp organization called http://starinc.org STAR Education, to develop a module specifically designed to enhance students' interest in synthetic biology.  We had students design basic gene circuits, and offered suggestions about where they think the science of silk can take us in the future.  We hope that this model of education, where we give students hands-on experiences and the opportunity to collaborate and give ideas to scientists in the field, can inspire and enrich students to pursue a STEM career.

Fig. A the plasmid map of our circuit CC, CM, MC, MM. The CC circuit includes the commonly used native promoter CYC1 and terminator CYC1. The MM circuit includes the combination of MINI promoter and MINI terminator.
Results
For each circuit, the strength of promoters was characterized by yECitrine, a kind of yellow fluorescent protein was used to detect the output level of particular promoter, terminator or promoter-terminator pair. And the red fluorescent signal from RFP mStrawberry can represent the relative read-through efficiency of particular terminator in the circuits including the same promoter.
While monitoring the growth rate of four strains containing different expression regulatory devices, we also characterized the expression strength of the promoter-terminator pairs by detecting the fluorescence intensity of yECitrine in each circuit. As we can see in the bar chart, the ratio and relationship of the signals from 4 circuits become relatively stable at the early stationary phase, which hints that the expression level may reach the dynamic steady state at the time point 22 hours. And the results from 22 hours point also match the strength relationship of the two promoters in previous research, although we used another yeast strain here. [2, 5] Therefore, comparing with the mid-log phase data, we tend to believe that this results can reflect the true dynamic characteristics of the genetic regulatory devices, although we will research this phenomenon in our future work.(Fig. D)
So, in order to better reflect the dynamic behaviors of the circuits we tend to use data from mid-log phase during the growth process.

Function Verification of promoters and terminators
Through comparing “CC” with “CM”, we can learn that the Fluorescence/Abs600 of “CM”is nearly three times of “CC”, proving that the strength of MINI terminator is higher than that of CYC1 terminator. (Fig."

Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of some of our parameters. Oxford recommended we used Karzburn’s 2011 paper, ‘Coarse grained dynamics of a cell free system’ for the translation constant. They also pointed out that we had forgotten to change some of the parameters’ units so our model was not dimensionally consistent, and we updated the model to fix those.

One of the biggest potential problems we identified was that if enough translation of closed switches occurred, it would be difficult to see any meaningful results. The kleakage parameter represents the ratio of translation rate on the closed and the open switch. We concluded that would not get any observable difference if translation on the closed switch was above a ten thousandth of the rate on the open switch, something we would never have been able to quantify easily without the model.
Without the model we wouldn’t have realized quite how crucial reducing leakage was. We spent a lot of time designing our switches to minimize leakage.
The lab team also asked us to find the optimal concentration of DNA for both output variation and overall output. By varying ktranslation and the concentration of DNA we found that a higher concentration was better in general, however it would plateau eventually as miRNA consumption became the limiting factor. In the specific case of miRNA degradation being 2 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of degradation of the other RNAs the GFP concentration plateaued around 5×10-9 mol dm-3.

A 1:10 dilution was made of each colony and the absorbance was measured at 600 nm using the faculty plate reader. These readings were used to determine the dilution required for the colonies to have a concentration of 0.02. A diluted cultured was made for each sample and placed on ice. Further culture samples were made and placed into a 37 degree incubator for six hours. Once this was complete the samples were placed into individual wells on a 96 well plate.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"At the same time, as the understanding of the underlying biological processes and methods for assembly of diverse DNA constructs has improved, many novel software tools aim at the computer aided design (CAD) of DNA sequences (e.g. J5,
). Such tools have been particularly valuable to the iGEM community, as they stimulate the design of more complicated, yet less error-prone biological devices. Two examples originating from the iGEM community are: Clotho , a framework enabling the automated and computer-assisted design of synthetic biology constructs introduced by the Berkeley iGEM team of 2008 and Gibthon created as a web app by the Cambridge iGEM Team of 2010 , which suggests primers in order to assemble a set of predefined DNA fragments using Gibson cloning.
Influenced by this development, we introduce here the NRPSDesigner , an integrated CAD software, implemented to facilitate the design of customized synthetic NRPs. In particular, the NRPSDesigner includes the following features: Based on the NRPS-PKS database we built a manually curated database capturing the biological complexity of NRPS while storing information of about 200 NRPS modules their coding sequences and substrate specificity. The database can be easily extended with curated content using automated domain prediction based on Hidden Markov Models. By applying this information, the NRPSDesigner can calculate an optimal sequence of domains based on simple evolutionary assumptions. To accelerate the process of testing this synthetic construct and eventually produce a customized peptide we included additional assisting software to the framework. We offer to incorporate the necessary domains for combining the nascent peptide with an Indigoidine tag . Furthermore, embedding of the Gibthon software automates the suggestion of primers necessary for the assembly of the predicted domains by Gibson cloning.
Results
NRPSDesigner Database Structure
The NRPSDesigner is a knowledge-based software tool using stored information about NRPS pathways to predict the optimal domain sequence that is able to produce a user-defined NRP. The storage organization is of great importance for the functionality of the designer because of its dependence on a comprehensive description of the biological and biochemical properties of NRPSs. For this purpose we built a hierarchical database  that comprises three layers of complexity: i) the DNA level represented by all DNA coding sequences. They are directly linked to ii) their encoded NRPS domain, respectively. Finally iii) our database stores detailed information about the substrate and its potential modification of the corresponding domain. (see Fig. 1 )

Lactic fermentation is the main step that can ensure the transformation of liquid milk into a yoghurt. The two lactic bacteria used, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus work together in symbiosis.
At the beginning of the fermentation S.thermophilus develop first. Converting lactose into lactic acid, these bacteria provoke a decrease of the characteristic pH of yoghurts. They also synthesize compounds like formic acid or carbon dioxide which increase the growth of L. bulgaricus. Lactobacillus hydrolyze the casein from the milk thanks to a protease bound to the cell wall. Products of this hydrolysis, after several reactions, form amino-acids and in particular Valine which is not present in sufficient quantity in the milk at the beginning of the fermentation. S. thermophilus has a lower protease activity and get benefit from the presence of L.bulgaricus. Thanks to this joint action, the two species grow rapidly and metabolize enough lactose into lactate so that the fermentation ends in 3 to 4 hours instead of 12 to 16 hours if they were alone.
2. Transformation of L. bulgaricus by electroporation
3. Quorum Sensing and regulation
When ingesting yoghurt, the two ferments react in a different way. S.thermophilus is destroyed by the digestive system whereas L. bulgaricus resists different pressure imposed by this digestion (variation in pH, enzymes). L. bulgaricus stays some time into the intestine before being evacuated. We wanted to use this fact to create a quorum sensing system allowing to stop useless synthesis of colors or flavour once the yoghurt has been eaten.

E. coli Terminator
To end the transcription of both the constructs to be expressed in E. coli, a bidirectional terminator is to be used.  This terminator is capable of terminating transcription in either a forward or reverse direction when placed at the end of a gene.  Although the designed system should only be expressed in the forward direction, the terminator can be used to stop the transcription of genes if open reading frames in the reverse direction are detected.

FUS1 Promoter
The FUS1 gene is turned on when yeast encounters the opposite mating type as part of its preparation for mating. This means any gene hooked up to this promoter is turned on any time the yeast comes into contact with the opposite mating factor.
His3 Protein
Histidine is an amino acid necessary for nearly all forms of life, and in order to be synthesized by cells, many genes must work together in order to produce it. This gene is one of those genes necessary for histidine production. Without a functional copy of histidine, the cell will die unless it can obtain histidine from its environment.  By hooking up this gene to the FUS1 promoter, we can make it so that the only way yeast will survive is when the opposite mating factor is provided by the E. coli, or when histidine is provided in the media.
Constitutive Yeast Promoter
Some genes in cells need to always be on at relatively constant levels in order to keep the cell alive. These genes have what are called “constitutive” promoters, which means that they are always on and don’t change their expression regardless of what is happening to the cell.
Lactate Dehydrogenase
Lactate Dehydrogenase is a protein that can be used to synthesize a compound known as lactate. This is done by converting a chemical normally used for energy production into lactate. Lactate can be used to induce many lactate-sensitive promoters found in nature. In our system, we’re giving the ability to produce lactate, and making the E. coli dependent upon lactate in order to survive, allowing us to provide a large amount of"
Bilkent-UNAMBG,2018,Team:Bilkent-UNAMBG#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Therefore, this creates a platform for the development of superbugs (bilim akademisi linki) which in turn holds a real threat to our world.
Thus, our primary focus is to efficiently eliminate penicillin by expressing a penicillin binding protein (PBP) on the bacterial surface; and via interaction between PBP and penicillins’ β-lactam rings, it can bind and degrade the penicillin in the environment via β-lactamase activity.
After that we have interviewed the head doctor of a prestigious hospital in Ankara and what she has told us have changed the scope of the project and lead us in a much different and more complex idea for the project. Here is the interview:
 
 
What we have deduced from the interview is that we should not degrade penicillin in the environment which only creates smaller subunits of penicillin resulting in another contamination; but we should capture the penicillin by only binding but not degrading it with the help of a protein expressed on the surface, and removing it from the environment by a method. And lastly, to recycle the collected antibiotics!
Recycling will have many economical and logistical benefits to the government as well as pharmaceutical companies. This innovation will highly benefit the industry in a way that there will be more resources and also antibiotics will be seen less as a contaminant but rather a renewable substance.
We have then searched for a method to eliminate the bound antibiotics from the environment and through investigating other teams projects, ideas and checking the registry over and over again we have came across Berlin 2014 iGEM teams side project where they expressed Bacterioferritin (BFR) M52H heme-deletion part to store iron particles inside the cells and they can eliminate these cells by applying a magnetic field. We have incorporated this idea into our project which resulted in our final project design.
When we have finalized our project design, we wanted to share our idea to other people that can have an impact on the future of the project. So, we have talked with the governor of İzmir* and explained our project to him. He was very interested and proud of us representing our country in an international competition with this innovative idea. Then he has directed us to PINAR corporation’s general manager and we have also presented our project to him and he was also interested and wanted to support us. Later on, we wanted to contact Prof. Dr. İdil Alaton herself whom we were inspired for the project idea. We have interviewed*** her and expanded our knowledge about refinement and disinfection of contaminants from wastewater, the problem"
