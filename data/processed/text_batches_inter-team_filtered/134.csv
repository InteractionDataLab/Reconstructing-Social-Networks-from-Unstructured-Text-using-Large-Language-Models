Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"ized iGEM in Swedens historically biggest student city.
Survey
In the Uppsala IGEM team 2018’s booklet we focused on the topic burning out. We thought that it was a really interesting topic, as it is one of the factors that can affect the proper development of the project as it involve so many people, stress situations, deadlines etc. For this reason, we decided to compose a guideline to prevent and increase the knowledge of this condition. To do so, we started with an internal survey that the IGEM members answered, talking about their experiences during their projects.
This evaluation consists of 5-6 sections with questions, and it takes more or less 10 minutes to answer it. The survey was constructed by the iGEM Uppsala Association & Team and is constructed to highlight and improve the work environment during the iGEM project and to identify risks that the team needs to be aware of.
The survey is so far answered by nearly 80 people. In this group we found: former members, members of this year's project and members from other iGEM teams around the world, which provided a broad idea of how their experiences were and how they feel regarding the stress related to the project. Some preliminary statistics were incorporated in our booklet but for future improvements we encourage more iGEMers to participate in this survey. You can find it here ."

1. Measuring fluorescence of GFP
Yesterday, varieties of bacterial cultures were grown in order to test the expression of GFP's. The fluorescence of GFP are measured by the plate reader, and following are the results that Emily and I were able to get today:
Fluorescent levels of different cultures (Stored in the plate reader for 5 hours after dilution of R0040+GFP)
Fluorescent levels of different cultures (Stored in the shaker at 37˚C for 5 hours after dilution of R0040+GFP)
We were forced to wait for 5 hours after the dilution of R0040+GFP culture as we were asked to leave the lab that had the plate reader by another organization. We were able to measure once quickly right after the dilution; however, with no accurate settings, meaning we cannot make any comparisons.  As for the above results, it seems convincing enough for me to say those cells that have the reporter and mutant (LuxOD47E) circuits in them are doing something special that make their readings higher. Our KT1144 cells have a cosmid that contains Qrr4 promoter driving an expression of GFP; thus, as shown by the data, express GFP in larger quantities when it has the LuxOD47E mutant than when it doesn't. Our TOP10 cells also have a plasmid containing Pqrr4 and GFP, which behaves the same way as our KT1144 cells.  Both data show that the fluorescence reading is about 2 times higher in cells that have both mutants and reporters than the cells that doesn't have mutant circuits. As we can see in well B7, the cells that have R0040, a constitutive promoter, driving GFP have a much higher reading than the rest, which is what was expected. Also as expected, diluting the R0040+GFP cells to 1/10, 1/50, and 1/100 ratios resulted in much lower readings of fluorescence. Two interesting things to note about the above collected data are:
1. Both with and without mutant readings of TOP10 cells with reporter are than the readings of KT1144 cells. I do not know exactly why it is as such, but my guess is that different type of cells absorb different amount of wavelengths.
2. The fluorescent levels of the cells that were"
IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#blog_-_-_TEXT.html," colonies.  We  checked  our  plasmids  by  using  appropriate  restriction   enzymes and running gels. Another serious problem arose in case of ligation. The ligation was   carried out for 16hrs with an insert:vector ratio of 3:1 but we did not get any colonies at all! We   assumed that ligation was not occurring due to improper digestions of the insert. So we carried   out sequential digestion and again tried the ligation in the same procedure. This time we got a   single  colony  and  on  screening  it,  we  found  it  to  be  the  undigested  luxPR  transformant!  We   were terribly disappointed. Next, we tried checking whether there was any problem in the competent cells. For this, we took   a positive control of 50ug/ml of luxPR DNA and tried the ligation procedure again but with no   better result. After that, we started working on another way of cloning where we tried to get 55   bps  of  luxPR  cut  with  restriction  enzymes.  On  performing  sequential  digestion  of  luxPR  and   crtEBI, and running the product on 2% agarose gel, we were not able to get the 55 bps band   (instead, we got a gradient of bands of  same length). Yet, we did not lose hope. We  started   again  with  the  “3A  Assembly”  :  sequential  digestion  of  luxPR  and  crtEBI,  PCR  purification,   double digestion ­ luxPR with ECoRI and crtEBI with XbaI followed by heat kill for 5 mins. This   time we used 3:1:0.5 , 1:1:0.5 of luxPR:crtEBI:kanamycin backbone DNAs for ligation (16hrs)   and finally succeeded in getting colonies. Several other hurdles were also encountered by our wet­lab team. But our motivation boosted   our patience and perseverance to keep on struggling till we achieve the result.

The sequence for BiME has been optimized for production in E. coli, as both material scFvs were meant to be produced in E. coli cultures. The HER2 scFv source paper recommended production in the DH5α strain (Song et al., 2005) while the GCN4 scFv source recommended Stbl3 (Tanenbaum et al., 2014). For production of BiMe, the DH5α has been chosen because it is readily available and suited to production of sensitive proteins. Purification will be via IMAC, which our polyhistidine tagged protein will adhere to with high affinity (Lindner et al., 1992). This allows cheap and relatively simple production of BiME in the absence of protein synthesis services. The nuclear localization signal will also allow speedy analysis through importin-α interaction assays (Fanara et al., 2000).
The SynNotch protein has an intracellular rtTA system which cleaves from the receptor upon stimulation of the receptor with binding and physical pulling force. The rtTA system, also known as the Tet On/TetR system, was first created by Gossen et al (1995). In the presence of tetracycline, the released factor would be induced to promote transcription at the tight-TRE promoter. This will go on to transcribe GFP, our reporter protein, and through a P2A linker, more rtTA (encoded by the tta sequence) in order to generate a positive feedback loop. In clinical applications, the GFP can be substituted with any conceivable gene, including IFN gamma, TNFalpha, etc. In the continued presence of tetracycline, successfully bound cells will soon express detectable levels of the GFP reporter.
Our synnotch was an anti-CD19 synnotch construct with intracellular domain tTA. This was uploaded by the authors who had engineered SynNotch (Morsut et al, 2016) and ordered by the team from Addgene. The construct has its original ligand binding domain replaced with anti-CD19, a myc tag added for additional inducibility, and a rtTa intracellular domain that would cleave from the receptor upon activation and circulate in the nucleus. Upon induction with tetracycline, the rtTa transcription factor will bind to its promoter and induce expression. The benefit of this system is that the rtTA and its corresponding promoter are prokaryotic in nature and"

We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter we put inside warrior I. (More details can be seen at Orthogonality test )
V Killing test
Because we use RFP to indicate the level of LacI inside the cell during Orthogonality test, we are not sure if the results will be the same when we use a complete circuit. Therefore, we designed two warriors and beggars as below to verify results got from Orthogonality test.
(Fig.5 Gene circuit designed for killing test to verify Orthogonality test. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II.)
According to results of Orthogonality test, the warrior I will be killed by itself when it is cultivated without warrior II. Furthermore, warrior II doesn’t kill itself but can kill E.coli from another side successfully. All results we got here are consistent with our Orthogonality test! They greatly enhance the reliability of our previous data. (Fig.6)
(Fig.6 Killing test results)
More details can be found at Killing test
VI Improved orthogonal gene circuit
The problem now becomes how to block warrior I’s response to C4HSL secreted by himself. Our model tells us if we design the warrior I as below (Fig.7), we can make it only be killed by warrior II by just regulating the RBS of TetR to an appropriate intensity.
(Fig.7 Improved gene circuit. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II.)
See more details at Design of characters
Results are shown below:
(Fig.8 Performance of improved gene circuit)
See more information at Improved gene circuit
VII Regulation of killing ability
Sometimes, to mimic the situation we investigate in real world, it may be necessary to regulate killing ability to an appropriate level, like making two warriors have the same killing ability. What can we do to regulate the killing ability of warriors? Our model suggests that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of the two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins! (Fig.9)

Project Overview
Our project is currently the first step in a much larger endeavor.
We are attempting to take the nif cluster from a cyanobacteria and get it to function in E. coli while simultaneously attempting to create a transcriptional regulation system that turns off in the light and turns on in the dark.
In doing such, we hope to create a system for nitrogen fixation that operates exclusively in the absence of light in preparation for transformation into a photosynthetic system. After we come to a greater understanding of how the system works and perfect it, we can move on to working in a more complex organism, such as a cyanobacteria like Synecosystis spp. 6803.
The end goal is to create plants that can fix their own nitrogen by moving from the cyanobacteria into the chloroplast of the plant. Endosymbiotic theory postulates that cyanobacteria are the ancestors to chloroplasts, so this is the natural progression.
This summer, we were successful in transforming E. coli with the nif cluster from Cyanothece 51142, and ran an Acetylene Reduction Assay in order to test for the strains ability to fix nitrogen. For more information, please consult our Nitrogenase page.
This summer, we were also successful in cloning a light regulated repressor system in order to turn OFF transcription of genes in the presence of light. For more information on our methods and background, please visit the Light Regulation page.

In a collaborative national effort with the iGEM teams of Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Groningen, we organised an interactive lab tour and various other activities on the Discovery Festival. We did this simultaneously on the three locations of the festival: Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Rotterdam. Although the preparations were done cooperatively, we split up the teams on the night itself. Our team was responsible for the location of Rotterdam.
The Rotterdam version of the Discovery festival as well as those in the other two cities were a great success! Over 1200 people visited the location in Rotterdam, and over 4000 attended the three festivals combined (based on presale numbers). With happy, interested people from all kinds of backgrounds mixed together, the general atmosphere on the festival as well as in our improvised lab was really great!
Lab Experience
We prepared a provisional laboratory where small groups of people (3-6) could manually go through a simulation of synthetic biology. In the first step they ‘ordered DNA online’, and through various subsequent steps they learned to use devices like an actual centrifuge, vortex and pipettes, and a make-shift electroporator. In the"

$$\rho \cdot \overrightarrow{f_2} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \cdot dS \cdot dt $$
According to the mass conservation we can get the equation:
$$\iiint_D(\rho |_{t=t_2}- \rho |_{t=t_1})dxdydz=- \int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt  \iint_{\partial D} \rho \overrightarrow{f_1} \overrightarrow{n}dS+  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt  \iint_{\partial D} \rho \overrightarrow{f_2} \overrightarrow{n}dS$$
Assuming that \(\rho\) , \(\overrightarrow{f_1}\) , \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\)  are all continuously differentiable, according to Gauss Formula we can get that:
$$\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt [\iiint_D \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_1})- \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_2})]dxdydz=0 $$
Because of the continuity of integrand in   and the randomicity of   and  , we can get that:
$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_1})- \nabla \cdot (\rho \overrightarrow{f_2})=0, \quad  \Omega \times (0, \infty) $$
And the definition conditions:

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Parts#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," toxic metal Hg under the regulation of the MerR family transcriptional factor MerR. MerR acts as an activator of mer genes in response to the presence of Hg (II), while it will be reversed into a weak repressor in the absence of Hg (II), to maintain its own expression at certain level.
Fig.1. MerR dimer structure. We can see from its structure, upper part is the metal binding domain. When two monomers come together in the presence of mercury, to form a dimer, mercury ions will be captured inside.
The MerR protein, in the form of homodimer, binds to the mer operon between the RNA polymerase binding sites of the promoter region. The attachment is independent on the presence of Hg(II). When the apo-MerR dimer bind to the dyad symmetrical operator DNA between the -35 and – 10 elements of mercury inducible promoter, PmerT, which has a unusually long spacer of 19 bp for MerR to bind on, the binding of RNA polymerase is inhibited. When Hg(II) is available in the environment, the ion binds to merR between the two subunits. The Hg-bound MerR can result in an a structural distortion of PmerT, allowing the RNA polymerase contacts to be made, leading to the expression of down-stream genes(Fig.2).
Fig.2. A generalized mechanism of MerR family regulator transcriptional activation. A: The dimeric MerR regulator binds to the operator region of the promoter and recruits RNA polymerase, forming a ternary complex. Transcription is slightly repressed because the apo-MerR regulator dimer has bent the promoter DNA such that RNA polymerase does not contact it properly. B: Upon binding the cognate metal ions (shown as cyan circles) the metallated MerR homodimer causes a realignment of the promoter such that RNA polymerase contacts the -35 and -10 sequences leading to open complex formation and transcription. Modified from Brown et al.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html,"ALEs are polar and bind significantly stronger to the 5’ end of their target sequence compared to the 3’ end (Meckler et al. 2013). Therefore, if the alignment included the 0th to 10th nucleotide of the target sequence, that specific two target site combination could be ruled out. To get a better idea of how we designed the TALEs, please refer to Figure 3 below.
Figure 3.This flow chart shows the process to design TALEs specific to stx2 gene. First we picked two target sequences ([1] and [2]) based on the consideration mentioned in the above text. Then we used this flowchart to ensure the combination of the two target sites would not produce a false positive.
Figure 4. Alignment of both of the chosen EHEC target sequences. Notice how the target sequences start with a T and are pyrimidine rich. The two TALEs ( BBa_K1189032 and BBa_K1189033 ) are designed to bind to the 19 bp target sequences.
Proof of Concept
The TALEs are a very fundamental part of our project. In order to have a functioning system for E. coli detection, we need to have proteins that will successfully recognize and bind the Stx2 gene. However, before we can actually create and use TALEs to bind to enterohemorrhagic E. coli DNA, wanted to build a proof of concept to optimize our assays and to ensure that TALEs work in our hands. On the iGEM parts registry we found TALEs that 2012 Slovenia iGEM team synthesized for a previous project. TALEs are very large proteins and are expensive to synthesize therefore, we decided to use these TALEs as a proof of concept. We also saw this as an opportunity to use and build upon parts made by former iGEM teams. Thus, we ordered their three TALEs: TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ), TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ), and TALE D  ( BBa_K782005 ).
We used TALE A( BBa_K782004 ) and TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) to build the proof of concept and resume testing. To test our TALEs, we synthesized the target sequences that bind to Slovenia's TALEs. We made similar variants of the target site by changing 1-2 bp at a time to characterize the binding affinity of the TALEs ( BBa_K1189004 , BBa_K1189005"

$$\sum_{i=0}^{8}f_i = \rho$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{8}f_i e_i = \rho \bar{u}$$
The equilibrium distribution functions \(f^{(eq)}_i\) depends only on local density and velocity. In our case we chose to calculate it in the following way:
$$f^{(eq)}_i = \rho \cdot w_i [1 - 3(\bar{e_i} \cdot \bar{u}) + \frac{9}{2}(\bar{e_i} \cdot \bar{u})^2 - \frac{3}{2} \bar{u} \cdot \bar{u}]$$
where \(w_i\) is direction weight:
$$w_i = \begin{cases} \frac{4}{9} & i = 0\\ \frac{1}{9} & i = 1,2,3,4\\ \frac{1}{36} & i = 5,6,7,8 \end{cases}$$
After collision step is performed, the streaming step takes place.
$$f_i(\bar{x} + \bar{e_i}, t + 1) = f_i(\bar{x}, t + 1)$$
This means the distribution function value is streamed to a next node in that specific direction.
Boundary conditions
Boundary conditions are a quite complex problem. The problem arises from the fact that there is no physical intuition on the behaviour of the velocities at boundaries. Choosing the right boundary conditions plays an important role in the simulation's stability. In our simulator, we implement the boundary conditions defined by Zou and He [Zou1997] .
Inlet
At inlet boundary condition, we have no information about the behaviour before the inlet. For each inlet node we compute the density and then use this density and inlet velocity \(\bar{u}\) to compute distribution functions.
$$\rho = \frac{1}{1 - \bar{u}_i} (f_{0,2,4} + 2 f_{3,6,7})$$
Outlet
At outlet boundary condition, there is no information about the behaviour after the outlet. We thus compute the outlet velocity and then use this velocity with \(\rho = 1\) to compute distribution functions.
$$u = -1 + \frac{1}{\rho} (f_{0,2,4} + 2 f_{1,5,8})$$"

Growth rates and spectrophotometry
Basic Concept - Measuring Optical Density
When assessing growth of microorganisms, it is necessary to be able to obtain and interpret information about population size, or at least concentration at a given time. Optical Density (OD\(_{600}\)) measurement is a widely used, suitable method known by everyone familiar with biotechnology. This principle is based on spectrophotometry, where a light transmission of 600 nm passes through biological material and the resulting transmittance, \(\Phi\), is measured at the receiver end. Because biological material reflects light, higher biological density reflects more light, giving lower transmittance readings. Thus, at full transmittance, \(\Phi_{\text{ref}}\), OD\(_{600}\) should be equal to 0.
For the Microfermentation Platform, OD\(_{600}\) at time t is calculated from the Beer-Lambert law 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 :      $$       \text{OD}_{600,t} = -\log_{10}\Bigg(\frac{\Phi_t}{\Phi_{\text{ref}}}\Bigg)      $$        Where the light source is an LED, with its intensity controlled by some input voltage, and the transmittance is measured by a sensor and recorded as a voltage.
Figure 4: Brief outline on how spectophotometric measurements for calculation of OD\(_{600}\) are carried out by the Microfermentation Platform.

Figure 4: Brief outline on how spectophotometric measurements for calculation of OD\(_{600}\) are carried out by the Microfermentation Platform.
Maximal Saturation - Calibration of Light Emission
The sensor recording the transmittance has a maximal saturation level. Transmittance of higher intensity than this level will yield the same constant reading. Thus, the input voltage must be calibrated, such that the emission from the LED matches the maximal saturation level of the sensor exactly when tested under conditions considered as reference.
Figure 5: The maximal saturation level phenomenon. The graph shows sensor reading as a function of input voltage"

1. Would any of your parts or project ideas raise safety issues?A. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab? No. Upon assessment, our engineered parts present a very low risk to the safety of the researcher, public, and the environment. Every team member has completed the introductory laboratory safety courses. The main chassis we are working with, a derivative from Escherichia coli K12, is a non-pathogenic strain.  It is not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adult humans and is of minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.  There are no special biosafety protocols researchers have to follow, other than basic treatment of equipment and materials coming into contact with the organism (autoclaving, etc.). We will also briefly work with Rhodococcus erythropolis, which is also non-pathogenic.  Like the E. coli strain we used, R. erythropolis posed no health hazards if normal biological laboratory procedures are followed. B. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident? As explained in part (a), none of the organisms, parts or created compounds are pathogenic, infectious, or toxic at the safety levels we are working at. The team is also following proper disposal procedures.  Given that the E. coli we use are of the K12 strain or a derivative, these bacteria are of relatively small concern.C. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident? The only component of our project that may pose an environmental risk is the chemical reagents and products involved in the desulfurization process.  Petroleum fractions and dibenzothiopene are potential pollutants but storage, bench work and waste disposal are being carried out in accordance with UBC's chemical safety procedures. D. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states? At the moment, it doesn't seem very feasible to maliciously misuse our organisms or desulfurization reagents"

Enzymology
Assay for ethanol detection. Simple one-step assay takes ethanol and NAD+ into acetylaldahyde and NADH with use of alcohol Deh (ADH) enzyme. Final NADH concentration can be determined using its molar extinction coefficient and absorbance at 340.0 nm, and is proportionate to initial ethanol concetration.  Ethanol concentrations ranging from 0.05mM-0.25mM were assayed with 173U/mL ADH.  and absorbances were measured at 340.0 nm.
Results: Final NADH concentrations were calculated to be off by a factor of ten due to unexpectedly low absorbancies. Assay was repeated with increased ethanol concentrations (0.5-10mM), but absorbancies remained lower than expected.
Discussion: It was determined that this assay was now sensitive enough for the range of ethanol concentrations that will need to be detected in our project, therefore we will use other means of ethanol detection using simple primary alcohol detection methods using oxidizing reagents.

So another PREDCEL was started using the same conditions plus adding 5 mmol of 5-Aminolevunilic acid, a precursor of the heme molecule which displays an important cofactor for the CYP1A2 (this was added, as in the mean time CYP1A2 testing showed visible colour change when adding the substance, indicating higher activity of the CYP1A2). The plaque assay of this run confirmed that adding theophylline leads to faster phage propagation and showed that caffeine concentrations between 5-500 �M can also impact phage propagation.
2. CYP1A2 Test To find out whether our CYP1A2 is functional or not, we repeated the dithionide experiment as no sufficient peak could be detected the first time. Small changes took place: a change of buffer was performed before ultrasonifying the cells. Also a dithionide solution was directly prapared befor meassuring the optical density at 550 nm. As this did not lead to a colour reaction, it was repeated once again adding 5-Aminolevunilic acid, which is a precursor of the heme molecule which in return displays an important factor for CYP1A2 activity. We added 5-Aminolevunilic acid, as we assumed, that mybe ther would not be sufficient amounts in e.coli available. This time a colour change could already be detected by eye, as the colour of the growths was red/brown. The optical density meassurement at 550 nm then showed a peak, indicating, that our CYP1A2 is functional.
Modeling
Logistic growth was implemented for glucose modeling to be able to model larger time scales with E. coli leaving exponential phase. Plotting was improved.

To prevent phage contamination all instruments and tools were cleaned, all solutions were prepared freshly and
filter tips were used more consequently. It turned out that there was a phage contamination in the glycerol stock of AP_dark_Ppsp-EL222 containing S1030 cells. As these cell
have a psp-promoter, phages which don't contain EL222 can propagate with and without blue light.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

The ‘trigger’ is just the moments where we simulate the effect of adding IPTG or increasing temperature. The parameters used are the same as in the last Simbiology simulation.
If we run this program, we obtain the following result:
Basic Toggle Switch General Equation Model with Simulink
Here we present another implementation on Simulink, using Matlab again.
In the model we have included the overall process of the transcription and translation as a first-order kinetic model. The only exception to that vision is that the repression is treated as a modifier of the Michaelis constant of the transcription.
The diagram of the process is the following:
These results show no relevant information with respect to the models already presented. But the way to implement the system is closer to the vision of systems theory. Under this environment, we show all processes as first order systems.
Basic Toggle Switch Simplified Equations Model
Now we show an overall vision of the general behavior of the system. It is based on the simplification made by Timothy S. Gardner. It only includes the changes on the repressors concentration:
Repressor1:
Repressor2:
And including the effects of IPTG or temperature:
Repressor1:
Repressor2:
These simple equations offer an external view of the system (a black-box model), and not in the internal processes in the bacteria analyzing the input-output relations.
The parameters α1 or α2 just show the force of each repressor of the proteins’ expression, while β and γ model the cooperativity of the mutual inhibition. If we simulate this scheme:
Although the behavior is not the same than the one showed before, due to the fact that there exists a delay at the moment of the switch, it is a good approximation for a qualitative analysis.
Basic Toggle Switch - Stochastic Model
In other script (ecoli.m), we’ve tried to show a different integration. This time we add some stochastic elements to our general equation model. We supposed every species as random Gaussian variables while its changes are random Poisson variables. At each integration step we also decided to understand the degradation reactions as random processes. Finally:
As we can see, we got a different result.
In the following image, we show the concentration of one repressor against the other.
It shows a bistable system. If one of the states is “on” the other is “off”.

Survey: new plant breeding techniques
Social opinion about research and science can affect                         development and exploitation of innovative                         technologies. By taking in account people opinion, we                         can obtain benefits for society in different issues                         such as health or environment, allowing to introduce                         science in a way that it can be more accepted.
For that reason, HYPE-IT project opts for mutual                         communication between society and scientists. It is                         utmost important for us to know how our project can be                         leveraged by users and potential beneficiaries.
To gain further insight into general knowledge about                         some plant breeding techniques such as genome editing,                         transgenesis or genetic engineering, a survey has been                         carried out. Our goal was to know if people knew the                         difference between these plant breeding techniques, and                         if they have or not solid reasons to be in favor or                         against genome editing.
One hundred fifteen people between the ages of 16-68                         were interviewed. Survey represents most of the levels                         and fields of study (science, engineering, arts,                         primary school, college, etc).
They were asked if they knew current plant breeding                         techniques in order to reveal us the general society’s                         knowledge about it. Afterwards, we wanted to know which                         of these techniques they think that are currently being                         used. In other words, how people think that crops are                         improved to get higher nutritional quality fruits.                         Figure 1 shows that hybridization - also known as                         cross-species – and artificial selection – best plants                         are selected – are the most known techniques. As it can                         be checked, induced mutagenesis and polyploidy are the                         least known techniques.

It is interesting to notice that only the 33.9% of                        "
TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Project#Appendix_-_-_TEXT.html," is the country with the most landmine casualties:766 killed and injured in 2012. Other countries with an alarming number of large casualties numbers include Cambodia, Colombia and Yemen. Figure 2 shows the amount of casualties in the ten most affected countries for 2011 and 2012[8].
Figure 1 World map indicating mine contamination per country. The contamination is measured as the amount of square kilometers which are SHA or CHA (suspected/confirmed hazardous area, see below)[9].
WHAT IS DONE AGAINST LAND MINES?
LEGISLATURE
The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty (also known as the Ottawa Convention, and officially titled The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction)[2] provides the main legal framework for governments to take action against land mines [8]. Governments who join the treaty declare upon signing that they never, under any circumstance, use, produce, stockpile and transfer anti-personnel mines. In addition, they must destroy all stockpiled antipersonnel mines in four years and clear all antipersonnel mines in all mined areas under their jurisdiction or control in ten years.
Next to that, States Parties are obliged to provide assistance for the care and treatment of land mine victims and support for educational programs to help prevent mine incidents [2]. The Mine Ban Treaty is currently signed by 161 countries. Major non-signatories include China, Russia and the United States. Since March 1, 1999, the Mine Ban Treaty is implemented as a binding international law [7].
The Ottawa Convention is mainly the result of the work of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and to the campaign's coordinatorits spokesman person, Jody Williams. In 1997, they received the Nobel Peace Price ""for their work for the banning and clearing of antipersonnel mines"" [12]. The ICBL is a global network in around 100 countries, working to eradicate land mines. The ICBL-CMC (a merger between ICBL and the Cluster Munition Coalition) releases the Landmine Monitor, a yearly publication providing a global overview of developments in mine ban policy, use, production, trade, and stockpiling. It also includes information on contamination, clearance, casualties, victim assistance, and support for mine action [9].

Collaborations 1. Biosafety Biosafety education video in Chinese Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.       However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research. In       some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier       that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English. We’ve participated in an intercollegiate collaborating project to produce a series of biosafety education movies,       all in Chinese. This video collection has been uploaded online and is freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili , a popular Chinese video-sharing website. Teams participated the production:

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html," transmembrane receptors right before the Strep-tag. Cells that express and fold the protein properly should give a signal of 605 nm (red) when exited at around 558 nm (rfp channel). [20] We tested our contructs three diffrent cell types: HEK293T adherent cells that were stably transfected, HEK293E suspension cells that were semi-stably transfected and N2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, that we transiently transfected.
As you can see on the images the signal developed over time. In the beginning, before selection, the protein was visible in little dots and therefor seemed to be localized more in subcellular oragnelles than in the membrane.  During selection on hygromycin B resistency most of the cells died, leaving some resistant cells behind, which over time grew to bigger foci consisting of stably transfected cells only (See Fig. B). For the BAP-receptor there was hardly to no fluorescence detectable neither in semi-stable nor in the stable transfection approach. But in latter case the cells still grew on hygromycin B and formed foci, which leads us to the conclusion that chromosomal intergration was susccesful (as already shown via PCR) hence there must be some problem in later steps of transcription, translation or protein maturation.  After 2 weeks of selection on hygromycin B the foci were harvested and expanded. The cells seemed to recover fast and moreover the red dots nearly disappeared leaving only the membrane of the scA-receptor cells illuminated by mRuby.
High resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy
In order to obtain high resolution confocal fluorescence images from our receptor constructs we transfected the Neuro-2a (N2a) mouse neuroblastoma cells line with the respective plasmids. Shortly before the end of the project Christoph came up with the idea to include a trafficking signal to the C-terminus of the receptor proteins that is described to increase the surface presentation of receptors by sorting them intracellularly towards the cell membrane. The sequence of this trafficking signal is DFFdDFFJDFJDKJFKFDJFD (aagagcaggatcaccagcgagggcgagtacatccccctgg accagatcgacatcaacgtgGGCGGCttctgctacgagaacgaggtgtaa) [21] and we have inserted it into the assembled BioBrick device using PCR cloning.

Hosting High School Students
Having seen the difference between a first-year and a second-year iGEM team, we felt exrtremely important to recruit new members to the group, to keep the project going. One side of this task was accomlished within the walls of our university by holding lectures and presentations about the iGEM-experience for students and inviting them to visit the lab and participate in the competition.
We also decided to recruit students at an even earlier peroid of their studies, so a lecture was put together and held at a local secondary school. During this presentation the basics of synthetic biology, the main features of the iGEM competition and some important results from our and some other groups were discussed. Students with a special interest in biology were at this meeting. Some of them took the opportunity and visited the group at the lab and one of them decided to join us and helped our work this year.
This year we got to know a smart, anthusiastic, helpful High School student called Éva, who became an indispensable member of the Team. She came not for only few weeks but for the whole summer, and gained experience which maybe pushes her toward biology studies.
Eva is preparing gel for agarose gel electrophoresis.

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve their gold medals!

IFAC Proceedings Volumes, 35(1), 351-356.). In the case of our biosensor we theorize this means that the public is likely to be more open to the use of GMO, as the potentially harmful effects of pharmaceutical pollution are not currently being addressed sufficiently. Multiple experts confirmed this sentiment: as long as the genetically modified bacteria in our device are safely contained, a majority of people will not oppose their use due to their important utility in solving the detection problem of pharmaceutical pollution (Martin van den Berg, Institute of Risk Assessment Sciences). In a similar vein, our biosensor makes current detection methods (i.e. those utilizing Daphniae and fish) redundant, leading to a reduction in the use of laboratory animals.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," With the use of the Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin for ImageJ image processing, scatter plots of the green intensities (y-axis) and red intensities (x-axis), Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's correlation coefficient were generated.
Result
Figure 1. MLS directs GFP into mitochondria. When MLS is added to the N-terminus of GFP, the GFP was directed to the mitochondria in the cells, giving patches of GFP signal that overlapped with the signals from MitoTracker®. When MLS is not added to the GFP, the GFP signal can be seen scattered all around inside the cell. Scale bar = 10µm.
Figure 2. Scatter plots of fluorescence intensities of green (y-axis) and red (x-axis) by construct. It showed that the BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial MLS-GFP construct had a linear relationship of green intensities and red intensities while the GFP generator alone had no relationship. Pearson's correlation coefficient (rp) and Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) were determined using the Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin (French et al., 2008) for ImageJ with a threshold of 0 and listed for each image.
Figure 3. Calculated mean Pearson's (rp) and Spearman's (rs) correlation coefficients for each construct. The coefficients were generated using ImageJ software and specific plugins. For every batch of transfected cells, four samples were used for quantification. Experimental BioBrick MLS-GFP and commercial MLS-GFP: coefficients were close to 1, good colocalization; GFP: Coefficients were close to 0, poor colocalization. Error bars show standard deviation.
CMV Promoter ( BBa_K1119006 )
Introduction
For this promoter's characterization we assembled it with GFP reporter ( BBa_K648013 ) and hGH polyA terminator ( BBa_K404108 ). The Pcmv-GFP was then transfected into HEK293FT cells and the in vivo green fluorescence signal was observed under confocal microscope. The positive control was pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) that contains CMV promoter and EGFP reporter. The negative control was the same as the experimental construct, but minus the promoter. The detailed protocols employed for our characterization work can be accessed through the link.

iGEM Europe
The European Teams
This year, Oxford has been researching the European contribution to the iGEM competition.
We have looked at all european countries that have iGEM teams this year as well as the development of the number of iGEM teams in Europe over the past years.
Our team has also founded the iGEM Europe Facebook page this year: to help facilitate communication and collaboration between European iGEM teams. The page has over 100 likes and has been useful as a platform for exchange of ideas, help, and inspiration between teams. We hope it will continue to do so in years to come!
iGEM and Language
We've also been working with the Imperial iGEM team, who have been doing some interesting research into languages and iGEM, an aspect which closely relates to our own interest in European teams. Teaching of English (identified by ICL as the lingua academica of science) is particularly strong in European countries - perhaps language is a contributing factor to the success of European teams at iGEM, as revealed by our statistical analysis (below).
Check out the  work of ICL on . iGEM and language .
Statistics
We have also analysed statistics to spot trends over recent years in European iGEM participation. It's great to see that participation has been increasing steadily between 2006 and 2014, and that every year European teams have performed strongly and brought some great ideas to the competition. You can see some of the results of our research below...

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#KyleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," on what is going wrong.  On the NEB website for the protocol using T4 DNA ligase with cohesive (sticky) ends, it suggest a ligation period of 16 C overnight.  Thus, I set up two samples of BFP + terminator: one with a 3:1 ratio of insert to vector and the other with a 6:1 ratio.  The tubes would sit overnight in the PCR machine and hopefully give us a proper ligation.
WEEK 5: 7/3-7/7/2011
7/3:  Today I came to just transform the overnight ligation reactions from 7/1.  We used only 40 ul of competent cells due to our low stock of cells.  Also, 4ul of ligation mixture was used in the transformation protocol.  The plates will be left on the bench top for 2 days.
7/4:  Holiday!
7/5:  This morning I checked on the transformations from 7/3.  Every plate had a thin layer of bacteria on them, almost a lawn of bacteria.  This is not usual for transformations and I am somewhat skeptical about the success of these plates.  Also we have realized that our stock of LB broth is contaminated with mold, therefore we are going to redo these transformations and include a negative control.
Today, I also did a restriction digest of my RFP+terminator that I had ligated and transformed last week as well as some promoters that Vanessa needed.  The RFP+Term was cut with XbaI and PstI.  The nanograms of DNA for the restriction digest was increased from 500ng to 750ng in hopes of getting greater concentrations for our gel extractions.

The gel did not come out well and is very smudgy.  This can be from improper placement of the comb that molds the wells when the gel is made as well as too little buffer.  Also, the RFP+Term only has one band"

Day 55 (11/09/14):
E.coli were transformed with RFP plasmid on backbones with AMP, TET, CAM and KAN resistance. This were plated on the appropriate agar and grown up overnight at 37°C.
To test the functioning of the enzymes we ran a series of digests of the limonene synthase plasmid on a gel. These were single digest with EcoR1, single digest with Pst1 and double digests with EcoR1 and Pst1. These showed that the EcoR1 enzyme was not functioning.
 
Day 56 (12/09/14):
Our zingiberne synthase gene finally arrived today! As we had ordered this gene in a plasmid we carried out a double digest using EcoR1 and Pst1 and ran these on an agarose gel to check the digest had worked and that we had the correct part. This worked so we are now able to start the assembly of the zingiberne synthase BioBrick.
We also moved out of the teaching labs where we have been working and into a research lab in preparation for the start of term.
 
Week 13
Day 57 (15/09/14):
Today we carried out double digests of Limonene synthase, promoter J23119, R-linalool and TET backbone.
We carried out 3A assembly of promoter and limonene synthase onto a TET backbone. These were transformed into E.coli, plated and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
R-linalool was assembled onto an AMP backbone using Gibson assembly. These were transformed into E.coli, plated and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
 
Day 58 (16/09/14):
We had no growth of the limonene synthase assembly, but we did have colonies of growth of R-linalool on the ampicillin resistant backbone. Colonies of R-linalool were selected, inoculated in LB media and respreads on fresh plates and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
To check if the limonene synthase gene had assembled with the promoter and just not transformed we ran the assembly product on an agarose gel. When we viewed the gel there was no DNA present.
We also made fresh agar plates containing ampicillin and tetracycline.
Zingiberne synthase and tetracycline backbone were both digested ready to carry out a Gibson assembly.

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," year during the construction process of iGEM biobrick parts for     our new project, we felt the need for an application to find interacting     parts based on an input/output model to design the genetic constructs.     Using a specialized software for searching the parts registry to find     possible biobricks to include into our construct would be much easy,     fast and accurate than manual. We have shared our need with a group     of friends who are software engineers, and initiated the METU_Turkey_SOFTWARE     team where we worked together over this summer to build the BIO-Guide     software.
Scope and Future Aspects
The partregistry.org is     a continuously growing collection of standard genetic parts that can     be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems.     The Registry is based on the principle of ""get some, give some"". Registry     users benefit from using the parts and information available in the     Registry for designing their own genetically engineered biological systems.     In exchange, the expectation is that Registry users will contribute     back to the information and the data on existing parts and will submit     new parts they have designed in order to improve this community resource.
As an expanding database partregistry.org needs to be more organized and the standardization template needs to     be improved. Additionally, the potential of multiple ways of using each     part in different construct combination brings out the necessity for     an application to search through the database. BioGuide is the first     designed software that organizes over 1000 parts in partregistry.org as possible     atomics parts to build new biological device and systems for specific     input and outputs based on graph theory. The requirement of similar     applications and software tools are now inevitable in the emerging field     of synthetic biology. The innovative approach that makes the partregistry.org easy to use     for synthetic biology applications is the collection of standardized     parts that can be used in any combination with minimal effort under     one database. But while working on our algorithm to search for possible     combinations of parts depending on the given input and output, we have     realized that present standards are inadequate and parts registry form     must be improved.
In very near future a new format for parts registry form is needed     and few additional features should be implemented to have more control     on the database. We are planning to suggest a new format and features     for the parts registry based on the survey results we have received.     And planning to build the next version of Bioguide based on the revised     parts registry form. Along with using new parts registry standards we     will be improving the algorithm, so that the software can search through"

Interaction between iGEM community
We would first like to thank Uppsala 2011 iGEM team, for introducing amilGFP to the iGEM universe. Although we did not need to contact them directly, the data and sequences they contributed to the parts registry formed the core of the colors we used this summer.
We have supplied strains and plasmids to a number of other iGEM teams. Both the University of British Columbia and University of Calgary iGEM teams relied on E. coli knockout strains we had access to and provided to them. Additionally, the CINVESTAV-IPN-UNAM_MX iGEM team used a number of BioBricks first made by the 2007 and 2008 University of Alberta iGEM teams, which we provided to them along with technical suggestions. (Parenthetically, we note that the border issues faced by some teams pales in comparison to those faced by Canadians.)

The system has the same architecture with protein LasI that synthesize the AHL that binds to LasR, the intracellular receptor. One of the differences between those to systems is the structure of the AHL (Figure 2.)
The use of two quorum sensing system is possible. This is one of the challenges that Frederick K. BALAGADDE et al. (2008) carried out successfully. They constructed a synthetic ecosystem that imitates the prey-predator relationship in two different strains of E. coli.

Lethbridge,2012,Team:Lethbridge#team_-_-_TEXT.html,"
Hello! I am a graduate student at the U of L currently completing my Masters degree in Biochemistry and am looking forward to my second year participating in the iGEM competition. Since I’m convinced I was born in the wrong era, I’m currently looking for assistance in inventing a time machine to send me back to the ‘50s, where I would happily fit in with the bubblegum rockers and poodle skirt-wearing youth of the day. Until that happens, I’m content to read a good book, knit, or do crossword puzzles to pass the time outside the lab. Best wishes!
Fan Mo - Advisor
Fan currently works as a lab technician in the Wieden lab. In her spare time she likes to play badminton, computer games and dancing in the rain. She currently holds the title for best score playing gold miner among the Wieden lab. This is her third year in iGEM as a supervisor and looks forward to another year on the team.
Dipankar Goyal
Fellow iGemers, we all know Synthetic Biology has moving applications, solutions to problems that may go unresolved otherwise. I have been extremely fortunate to have been a part of the U of L iGEM for two years now and I can say the experience has been absolutely magnificent. Synthetic Biology defines one part of me; I also have keen interest in the field of medicine especially programs such as the Doctors without Borders. In my spare time, if any, I am either figuring out ways to park free of cost at the university or paying university parking tickets downtown.
Nathan Dawson
Hello! I’m Nathan a student at the University of Lethbridge, currently entering my second year of Neuroscience. One thing I’ve long known about myself is that I love the sciences, so when I found an opportunity to volunteer in a biochemistry lab this spring I took it without hesitation. Through the volunteer experience I gained a wealth of knowledge (something I’m always hungry for), and a desire to continue exploring the opportunities at the university, for more learning experiences. Being on the University of Lethbridge’s iGEM team has been a gateway to the exciting world of synthetic biology. When I’m not in one of the labs (Ute Kothe’s, or iGEM), I enjoy reading, biking, scuba diving, snowboarding, and volunteering with St. John Ambulance.

PLlacO-1-T18-linker-hTrx_scaffold-(3xFlag): The human thioredoxin scaffold fused to the T18 domain of cyaA through a flexible linker. The human thioredoxin scaffold is a scaffold used for presentation of peptide aptamers. When a random nucleotide library is inserted into the scaffold, one can use the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen against specific targets. An affinity 3xFlag-tag is fused to the C-terminal for detection purposes. The part is under control of the hybrid PLlacO-1 promoter.

Plac-T18-linker-Intein-hTrx_scaffold-(3xFlag): The human thioredoxin scaffold fused to the T18 domain of cyaA through intein and a flexible linker. The human thioredoxin scaffold is a scaffold used for presentation of peptide aptamers. When a random nucleotide library is inserted into the scaffold, one can use the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen against specific targets. The intein is added for affinity purification purposes. This allows us to only purify the pure hTrx-based peptide aptamer. An affinity 3xFlag-tag is fused to the C-terminal for detection purposes.

RNAi: Off-Target and Non-Target Effects
Wheat crops in Canada are protected from infection by Fusarium graminearum through the application of foliar fungicides and seed treatments. Foliar fungicides are sprayed onto the plant itself rather than soaking seeds as is done in a seed treatment. Seed treatments are used to prevent initial FHB infections from the dormant chlamydospores in the soil. These seed treatments are however, not as effective in prevention of the spread of FHB once the crop begins to grow and are most vulnerable [1]. A suppressive spraying method is used, meaning crops are sprayed at the point in growth that they are most vulnerable to infection by FHB. Farmers will spray once after 75% of the heads on the main stem are fully emerged, but before 50% of them have flowered [2].

Table 1 provides information about three commonly used FHB combatant foliar fungicides. The cost of spraying these products adds up when considering the millions of acres that Canadian farmers must spray to keep their flowering wheat Fusarium-free. Seed treatments can also be quite expensive. For example, a fungicidal seed treatment made for wheat called Vibrance Quattro is $346 per bushel at 69.0g/L [4]. These costs all may vary based on the retailer and composition of the fungicides. Our goal is to eventually create a way to produce RNAi that is more affordable than these conventional fungicides.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Switch_-_-_TEXT.html," the divergent promoters do not have equal promoter strength, we decided to include two sets of divergent promoters from Gifsy1 and Gifsy2 respectively, see figure 3.
Figure 3: The divergent promoters from the Gifsy 1 and Gifsy 2 phages have been highlighted. The divergent promoters from Gifsy 1 are pR1 and pRM1, whereas the Gifsy 2 divergent promoters are pR2 and pRM2
The Gifsy1 phage repressor GogR will repress the pR1 promoter when it is expressed and the Gifsy2 phage repressor GtgR will repress the pR2 promoter when it is expressed. The weaker pRM1 and pRM2 are constitutive promoters and there will therefore be a constant expression of GogR and GtgR. Expression of both GogR and GtgR will result in repression of both pR1 and pR2.  We will address this problem in step 2.
Because pR1 and pR2 are strong promoters they will be used in the switch to amplify the expression of the downstream genes from pRM2 and pRM1 respectively. Consequently the pR1 promoter will control  half switch two (in figure 3 illustrated as the lower part) and pR2 will control half switch one (in figure 3 illustrated as the upper part).
Step 2: Introducing anti-repressors
The pR promoters can be de-repressed by adding anti-repressors to the system as these will hinder the effect of the repressors. The two anti-repressors AntO and AntT, will anti-repress GogR and GtgR respectively and thereby de-repress the pR1 and pR2 promoters.
Figure 4: When the anti-repressor is expressed it will bind to the repressor and thus expression from the pR promoter will occur. Here illustrated by the Gifsy2 system.
As illustrated in figure 4 the expressed anti-repressor AntO will anti-repress GogR and thereby cause de-repression of the pR1 promoter. As a consequence expression of the genes in half switch two are amplified. GtgR will then repress pR2. At this point there is still a low expression of GogR from the pRM promoter. We will adress this problem in step 3.
Step 3: Introducing the anti-terminators and the corresponding nut-sites

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar,"

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Abstract and Methods
The purpose of this work is to determine whether we should codon optimize the genes from Nitrosomonas europaea and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that we are expressing in E. coli.  We find that the heterologous expression of these genes is such that we do not need to codon optimize.
E. coli has a different tRNA pool than both N. europaea and P. aeruginosa do.  When genes from these organisms are expressed in E. coli, they may have a very inefficient translation efficiency if the available tRNA pools are very different.  To determine the impact of this difference, we calculated the tRNA adaptation index (tAI).  The tAI for a gene is a measure of the availability of the tRNAs that serve each codon in the gene.  A high tAI for a gene means the gene incorporates more rare tRNAs (tRNAs that do not occur frequently in the genome sequence) than a gene with lower tAI would.  A high tAI also indicates that the gene has been optimized for high expression levels.
Using tRNAscan-SE, we determined the tRNA codon copy numbers for E. coli, N. europaea and P. aeruginosa.  Then, we calculated the tAI for each organism using a script provided by Chris Workman (unpublished).  Finally, we calculated the tAI of heterologous expression of our genes of interest from N. europaea and P. aeruginosa in E. coli using the same script, but with the E. coli codon table in place of the native codon table.  The tAI graphs were plotted using the R package ggplot2.
Results
Graphs are shown for genes from Nitrosomonas europaea (left) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (right).  The top two graphs shows tAI levels over these organisms, with our genes of interest marked in red (AMO, HAO and cy"

That cepI was then used for OE-PCR with cfp. The PCR product was run on a gel. It showed the expected bands at 2000 bp. The DNA was extracted from the gel slices and ligated into pJET. The resulting plasmid was used for transformation into E. coli TOP10.
This week we set up our controls as well. We transformed pSB3C5_BBa_J04450 (mRFP) and pSB1C3_BBa_J04421 (cfp) from the distribution kit 2015 into E.coli Top10 and isolated the plasmids. To get the same vector background with the same origin of replication (p15A) as our pCERI-vector, we cut both constructs with EcoRI/PstI. After digestion pSB3C5 was also dephosphorylated. BBa_J04421 was cloned into pSB3C5 afterwards.
The size verified pPIC9_p15A_bla clone was streaked out again to isolate more plasmid. After plasmid isolation the vector was cut with EcoRV and XbaI to get the p15A_bla fragment for the Gibson assembly of pCERI.
This week we repeated the SDS-PAGE analysis of AADC samples in order to visualize the presence of the His-tagged enzyme via a Western Blot (as this could not be confirmed with SDS-PAGE alone). Following a run at 250 volts for 30 minutes the SDS-PAGE gel was soaked in 1x Towbin buffer while nitrocellulose membranes were soaked in methanol. We then constructed the gel ‘sandwich’ and ran the electroblotting apparatus for 60 mins. Each membrane was then soaked in 30ml PBS + 0.5% BSA for 1hr. This was then repeated, with the addition of antibody, and left for 1hr. The membrane was then washed with PBS + 0.1% TWEEN. Once completed, the membrane was soaked in BCIP/NBT purple substrate in order to visualize bands.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," interested, presented the movie we made for the RIVM and the Resource from the future that was made in collaboration with Synenergene. There were short “break-out sessions” where safety of previous iGEM projects was discussed in small groups, and at the same time two artists made a huge and beautiful drawing of everything that was discussed during the day. We learned a lot from the interesting talks about further handling safety in synthetic biology both from a political and a societal point of view. An interesting point that comes to mind was made by Sabine Roeser (professor of Ethics, TU Delft), about how feelings of the public concerning synthetic biology can be a useful source of questions on the ethical aspects of our work. She also mentioned how art can be used to connect people to synthetic biology. In our project, we tried to achieve this through collaborating with the Design Academy Eindhoven (hyperlink). Besides, it was nice to get to know more about how the other Dutch iGEM teams handled the RIVM assignment. We thank the RIVM and the Rathenau institute for inviting us, it was an inspiring day!
October 3rd – Project Presentation
On October the 3rd, we organized a lunch lecture at the university to present our project to researchers, beekeepers, students and other interested people. Quite some people were attending and a lot of questions were asked. We are happy about getting to practice our presentation in front of an audience, as well al learning what parts of our story where still unclear. Furthermore, we hope we enthused other students who might participate in next year’s iGEM team!"

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," will not have such thoughts for example (as there is probably no deontology in this field, my remark is probably irrelevant).
As biologist, we are working on living systems and I think that it’s important to keep in mind why we are doing this or that experiment. For example, animal models are necessary for science, you can’t do all you experiments in vitro or in silico. If you have to kill thousand of mice to develop a new vaccine, well, do it .But if you can do it just killing hundred of mice, it’s better. That’s not because we could do something that we have to do it.
It may be the right moment to ask ourselfs why we pretend doing synthetic biology. According to what you mentionned above, goals are not defined, but the means are very clear. Is it absurd to simply try to push a frontier as far as we humanly can? What if I told you that in my opion, this field is to me a playground where I can be creative and where creativity is rewarded. Playground is obviously a very ‘bad’ word in science, but still, some people just want to experiment a lot.
I have a very simple comparison. Imagine a game where you have a undefined target stuck on a tree. You don’t know what it is, but you aim it. The only thing you have at you disposal is a ball. Remember that the ONLY rule is to hit that target. Now, the most obvious way to hit that target is to practice at aiming and try as hard as you can and you’ll get better and better over time. But wait, you realize that this game is boring, trying to aim straight for that thing in the tree. What if you could reach it with a bounce on the ground? What if you could put some spinning effect in that ball? Oh wait, there are other trees: what if I try to bounce first on a tree on the left? After afew days of training, you start to get this. Your friend comes over and has a boomerang. OH WOW, this gives the game a whole new dimension! After you tried several others projectiles after the ball and the boomerang, you start to be really good at aiming things, not even caring what you hit. Some guys asks you to hit a thing on a roof?

The fireworks using AHL as a transmitter.
The bacteria communicate with each other in the same way as people do so using some languages.This was called Quorum Sensing, and we paid our attention to this Quorum Sensing.In Quorum Sensing, the bacteria use the chemical substance called ""autoinducer"" in substitution for words used by a human being.The bacteria confirm how much density the same type of bacteria exists by around oneself with autoinducers.When they sense the density is high, the bacteria take action all at once. We plan to produce bioart using Quorum Sensing as materials this time.E. coli uses a chemical substance called ""N-Acyl-Homoserin-Lacton(AHL)"" as autoinducers.We thought whether we could reproduce fireworks by bioart using AHL as a communication factor.We use the GFP to express flower firelight.The GFP,which is green fluorescence protein discovered in Aequorea victoria, has the property of forming a chromophoric group (chemical structure to develop a color) alone.  In short, fireworks will be launched and turned off by the following methods.  ①       GPF is expressed in E.coli using AHL as a communication factor  ② Turn off the expressed GPF like a chain reaction.
Development of multi-level adjustment course by using morphological changes in slime mold
Slime mold has been living in various shapes its life cycle.This time we focused on the cellular slime mold.Dictyostelium is the representative of cellular slime mold.It has a very unique life cycle. It is an organism that has characteristics of both plants and animals.
Its life cycle can be divided into five stages.
1st stage  spore
2nd stage  myxameba
3rd stage  aggregate
4th stage  moving body
5th stage  myxameba
Let’s take a look at these five stages in detail.
First, Dictyostelium survive until conditions for spore growth.(1st stage)Then the spores grow into myxameba, and undergo cell division and multiply while eating bacteria such as E. coli and yeast. In this case, amoeba cells can move about freely, behave like animal cells, so to speak, and has been living as a"

Inoculations of GFP Constructs (29 tubes)
After making our constructs, we transformed them into Keio Wild cells and inoculated from the successful transformation plates.

pλR LacI GFP Θ (no IPTG, 10µM IPTG, and 100µM IPTG) in 1C3
pλR LacI GFP DAS (no IPTG, 10µM IPTG, and 100µM IPTG) in 1C3
pλR LacI GFP LAA (no IPTG, 10µM IPTG, and 100µM IPTG) in 1C3

Colonies were chosen from the overnight plates and were diluted into 300 µL ultrapure water.  These dilutions were used to inoculate triplicates of 4 milliliter cultures and were grown at 170 rpm for 24 hours in 37C.  Each construct was treated to three different levels of IPTG induction(no IPTG, 10µM IPTG, and 100µM IPTG) to turn on the ClpXP degradation system and subsequently turn off GFP production.  Our initial results were promising.

The graph (below) shows significant differences between the levels of induction and the resulting degradation of GFP.  Of interest is the drop from 6000 GFP/OD for the GFP with no tag to the 2700 GFP/OD in the GFP LAA construct under 100uM IPTG induction.  Our next step is to complete this experiment in parallel in both Keio ClpX knock out and ClpP"

Coloring book
Scientific research is not always a dull work, it can also an interesting experience that everyone could share. In order to spread the fun and attractiveness of synthetic biology, we designed a coloring book. In this way, synthetic biology drew more attention by showing its fun part, following the idea of combining science and art. To our delight, the public were in favor of color painting and they praised our activity for being a good chance to broaden their horizons. Finally, we collected more than 200 painting works. Most surprisingly, kids loved our coloring book very much. With their creative imagination, they developed interests in synthetic biology and at the same time, gave us much courage and inspiration.
We were inspired by the recently popular coloring book Secret Garden, and we learnt from its design. In our coloring book, we simplified several important scientific items into simple stick figures, including DNA chains, viruses, bacteriophages, bacteria, so that people would understand some basic concepts of synthetic biology by painting them. Drawing itself is relaxing and thought-inspiring, and in the form of drawing, we presented our work and popularized iGEM. Hopefully, this coloring book will be a carrier of the spirit of scientific research and our wish to bring benefits to the world.
We have brought our coloring book to the Giant Jamboree, hoping that all of you could have fun with it and know more about us. We also want to discuss with the organizers of iGEM abut the perspective of publishing the coloring book, so that the spirit of iGEM could be spread out and keep encouraging more iGEMers to devote their talent and passion.

This biophysical model expresses an input-output relationship between the miR inputs and the classifier output. Given an miRNA expression dataset, we can calculate the expected output for each sample and evaluate the performance of a concrete classifier.
Classifier design process
Circuit optimization algorithm
pANDORRA’s goal is to discriminate 2 groups of cells. If there is an miRNA expression dataset for these cells, we need to find the optimal circuit inputs that maximize output in cancer cells and minimize it in control cells. Thanks to the evaluation function derived above, if we have a way to generate candidate circuits, we can employ a search method to optimize the logical circuit.
The search space is huge and looking at every possible combination of circuit inputs is impractical; the search is guided instead by a genetic algorithm. The search begins at the simplest circuits: those with a single up- or downregulated miRNA. At each search step, the pool of candidate circuits is evaluated and only the top best-performing are kept. These are then used as a seed to propose new circuits by randomly recombining them together or adding to them single miRNAs. This process is repeated until the best-performing circuit isn’t dethroned for enough steps [ 2 ]. The parallels between this process and natural selection and genetic recombination are obvious, justifying the name “genetic algorithm”.
Optimizing the logical circuit therefore requires selecting an architecture first (to have a concrete evaluation function). However, if there are many candidate architectures it can’t generally be known a priori which one will perform best on a particular dataset. Different architectures can be sensitive to different levels of miRNA input - imagine using a particularly strong repressor in the middle layer: low concentrations would be sufficient to completely knock out the output. The only way this classifier would produce output is if the levels of the upregulated miRNAs are exceedingly high on an absolute scale. This architecture wouldn’t work well to recognize cancer cells whose upregulated miRNAs are expressed in lower levels. Therefore, deciding on an architecture is also an optimization problem that should be solved for a specific dataset.
Contrary to the huge search space in circuit optimization, the biologically realizable architectures are few and each can be examined closely. To optimize across the architectural axis then, one need only find the best classifier circuit given the current architecture’s evaluation function. In the following section, we examine the various architectures in more detail.
Classifier Architectures
The first proposed architecture is straightforward: it accommodates upregulated miR on the top layer, downregulated mi"
