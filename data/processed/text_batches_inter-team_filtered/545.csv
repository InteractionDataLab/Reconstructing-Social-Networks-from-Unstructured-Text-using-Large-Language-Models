What would we do without Marcelo? Throughout the summer, Marcelo was not only our advisor - he was our mentor, our lab father-figure and most importantly, our friend.
He has been involved in all of the aspects of our project. He taught us all the tips and tricks for working in the lab; he helped us get funding and sponsorship; he was our voice in our institution; and he was heavily involved in all of the animation and 3D modeling in our project.
Without Marcelo, our team would never have come together. Thank you so much, Marcelo. Words can never express our gratitude for you.
Mattéa Bujold
Without Mattéa, there is no Team NAIT 2015. Alongside Marcelo, Mattéa was directly involved in bringing our team together.
She is our lab guardian - making sure we always had everything we needed to carry out and complete our experiments. From protocols to ordering reagents, we could always count on Mattéa. She was always willing to sacrifice her time and bestow us with her knowledge and extensive lab experience.
We are so thankful for her involvement in this project. We've learned so much from her and we are proud to say that she is our mentor and friend. Thank you so much, Mattéa. We could never repay you for your kindness (and your patience with us).
Eduardo A. R. Serratos
Humble, intelligent, passionate, kind, handsome, guapo - these are just some of the few words that we can use to describe our team leader and captain, Eduardo.
He was instrumental in our entire project. He took responsibility for the majority of the lab work and conducting of experiments. In addition to that, Eduardo kept our entire group organized and focused on our end goal. Eduardo really had a hand in everything - he attended meetings on behalf of our team, he conducted research and assisted in literature review, filled out our lab log books with David (with extreme neatness), and somehow, he was always willing to do more. Eduardo never missed a day coming into lab, and even came in on the weekends.
Eduardo has truly been an indispensable asset to the team and an even better friend. We could always count on him to listen, advise and provide the emotional support in this chapter of our lives. Friends are the siblings that we were not originally given. It is an honor for us to be your ""siblings"" - to be your iGEM family. Thank you, Eduardo, oh Captain, our captain.

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," a matrix. These enzymes are N-aacetyl-galactosaminidase (NAGA) from Elizabethkingia meningosepticum , α-galactosidase (aGAL) from Bacteriodes fragilis and endo-β-galactosidase (EABase) from Clostridium perfringens. NAGA removes N-acetylgalactosamin (GalNAc) from erythrocytes and therefore converts blood group A to O and blood group AB to B. aGAL removes Galactose and thus converts blood group B to O and blood group AB to A. EABase converts blood group A, B and AB to Bombay type. For cloning, we used different E. coli strains: NEB5α, BL21 (DE3) and XL10 Gold. For the immobilization on agarose beads three different tags are used.
Figure: Schematic illustration of the enzymatic action of NAGA, aGAL, and EABase. While NAGA cleaves blood type A antigens, aGAL cleaves blood type B antigens. Both create type O antigens. EABase, however, cleaves both A and B antigens in a way that creates the so called Oh antigens - which corresponds to a blood type known as ""Bombay"".
The first tag is called SNAP-tag and is coupled with the enzyme. They are expressed together as one protein chain and then the SNAP-substrate is fused to agarose beads. The second tag, named SpyTag, consists of two parts: the SpyCatcher, which is coupled with the enzyme, and the SpyTag, which is a synthetic peptide attached to a membrane. Both parts are fused together, forming an immobilized enzyme. The third tag is called Ssp GyrB split intein (intein-tag) and is derived from a self-splicing protein. When both parts approach each other, the intein parts fuse and splice themselves, leaving behind an immobilized enzyme on the membrane.
For the analysis, a simple clotting test with blood antibodies (commonly used to identify a patient's blood group) will be used for the determination of the activity of the soluble enzymes and FACS for the immobilized enzymes' activity, using special fluorescence coupled antibodies.
Methods used during the practical part varied from restriction, ligation and transformation over agarose gelelectrophoresis, SDS page, and PCR to gelextraction, plasmid preparation, and peptide synthesis.

Also, some of us had the privilege to assist to a lecture of Andrew Hessel, an authority in Synthetic Biology from USA. Unexpectedly, he had a slide about us! (He found out about us in Internet). He said he was surprised that Chile had an iGEM team working in a forefront discipline such as Synthetic Biology.
But most importantly, we designed our first secretion constructs, consisting of a GFP Reporter Plasmid, a Protease Producer Plasmid (see section constructs for more information) and a working plasmid. This last plasmid is used as an intermediate plasmid to build the other two plasmids. We ordered the primers that we need (it takes about two weeks until they arrive!)

We met with Ignacio Ibarra, an undergraduate student of the group of Dr. Francisco Melo.  He is willing to advise us in the area of protein modeling. The problem is that spider silk proteins are semi-crystalline and is difficult to predict its structure. He recommended starting with a comparative protein analysis between our spider silk monomer of interest and other similar proteins that have its structure available in PDB.  The idea is that from the structure of those similar proteins we will have a reference of the most stable conformation of our monomer. Later we should be able to improve the self-assembling of the proteins or improve some mechanical properties, such as elasticity and tenacity. Nevertheless, we were warned: protein modeling is a complex and slow task.
Recommended software: -MOE: to add hydrogen atoms. -Autodock: a suite of automated docking tools. This should be useful to evaluate the self-assembly of our monomers. -Force Field: to calculate potentials between particles. Finally, something very important happened: Christopher A. Voigt, author of “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers” is going to help us with a valuable gift: a plasmid to secrete ADF-3 in salmonella.

Rice,2016,Team:Rice#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," parameters, the equations include 11 undetermined parameters related to the reaction rates at specific steps in the violacein synthetic pathway. As described in the pseudocode, we used least square regression to determine the optimal values of these parameters.
Each one of the11 differential equations describes the rate of change of specific molecule in the system. The equations consider the production, consumption, and degradation rates of the molecules. Degradation of molecules is described by first order decay. Therefore, the rate of degradation of a molecule depends on a degradation constant and the degradation coefficient. The degradation coefficient is identical for all molecules since it only depends on E.coli growth rate.
Differential Equations in the Model
Results
Our model is able to compute the average violacein yields for all the strains tested experimentally, but can not capture the difference of violacein yield with different promoters strengths. The comparison between the violacein yields determined by experiments and those predicted by our model is shown in Figure 3.  The optimal parameters determined by the model are listed in Table 2.
Figure 3. VIolacein yield with different promoter combinations. This graph compares the violacein found for various promoter combinations determined by Jones et al., 2013 (shown in blue) with the violacein concentrations that our model predicted for the same promoter combinations. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 52.04.
Table 2. Notations of parameters.
Discussion
The current model is not able to show the expected dependence of violacein yield on promoter strength. After reevaluating our assumptions, we identified some potential flaws of the model that might cause the unexpected results.
One of the assumptions from our model is that the rate of production of L-tryptophan is constant and independent of the promoter strength. Jones el al. suggest that the L-tryptophan production rate may be affected by the metabolic burden of the production of the recombinant enzymes (VioA, VioB, etc.). This phenomenon may be caused by the depletion of essential metabolic resource, such as amino acids, mRNA and ATP. Therefore, the L-tryptophan production rate might need to be dependent on enzymes production rates.
Another effect that we didn’t consider is the saturation of the enzymes. To improve our model, we could include these effects by employing Michaelis-Menten Kinetics equations in our next step. Nevertheless, we have been cautious about including this in our model, since increasing the number of parameters, without increasing the number of data points usually causes the overfitting of the model.

Stuttgart,2017,Team:Stuttgart#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"          Therefor this odor can act as an indicator for keratin degradation. 2-phenylethylacetate is in high demand and widely udes as an additive in food, drinks, perfumes and cosmetics (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al.).          Currently, 2-PEAc is mainly produced by chemical synthesis, but consumers prefer more natural flavour compounds in the field of food and cosmetics.           But extraction of natural 2-PEAc is cost and time-intensive (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al. 2017).           Therefor the production of 2-PEAc using microorgansims such as E.coli can be an attractive alternative (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al. 2017).          In recent studies from Guo et al the 2-PEAc biosynthetic pathway was successfully designed and expressed in E.coli .           For our project we want to use this pathway for the production of a lovely rose scent by E.coli.          This pathway comprise four steps (Fig.1) (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al. 2017):
Aminotransferase (ARO 8) for transamination of L-phenylalanine to phenylpyruvate
2-keto acid decarboxylase KDC for the decarboxylation of the phenylpyruvate to phenylacetaldehyde
Aldehyde reductase YjgB for the reduction of phenylacetaldehyde to 2-Phenylethanol
Alcohol acetyltransferase ATF1 for the esterification of 2-PE to 2-PEAc.

In this case, the Hex protein docking server was used, and the three best results were downloaded (the best result is that one with the lowest level of free energy). The server was run twice, a first time considering only shapes and a second time considering shapes and electrostatics.
Analyse the docking results and locate the final and initial fragment of the fused proteins in order to predict possible interactions. To visualize and locate these peptidic ranges, the RasMol 2.7.5. viewer was used.

Figure 1. Docking models for the TetR-BAMSir3 interaction. The best three shape docking results are displayed in the top row while the best shape+electrostatics docking results are shown in the row below.
Taking everything into consideration, it seems that there is a high possibility of interaction between the TetR protein and the functional Sir3 BAM protein domain. This is due to the lowest three free energy results (for both shape and shape+electrostatics) can also acquire a stable structure in which the linked parts in the recombinant protein are quite close. These possible interactions would reduce the functionality of our fusion protein TetR::Sir3.

Usage & Output
As a positional argument, the script needs to be handed a non-empty list of albacore base directories containing basecalled reads to be filtered. Additional required arguments that need to be specified are the path to the bwa mem executable and the fasta file containing the reference sequence the reads shall be mapped to. A basic, abstract program execution looks as follows:
python2 iCG.py filter PATH/TO/ALBACORE/DIR_1 PATH/TO/ALBACORE/DIR_2 --bwa_mem_exe PATH/TO/BWA-MEM/EXECUTABLE -r PATH/TO/FASTA
All specified directories are subsequently filtered using the same filter settings. These settings can be modified by specifying optional arguments. The results of the program execution are saved in a new directory inside the albacore base directory named ""filtered"" by default. In addition to the filtered reads, sorted into subdirectories named ""sense"" and ""antisense"", the destination folder will contain a file called settings.txt holding all specified filtering settings. Additionally, a directory plots is created on default containing plots of the normalized signal traces at the region of interest for both the sense and the antisense strand orientation.
During program execution, iCG filter prints useful information regarding current steps of the filtering process, revealing how the result maybe optimized. The following is an example for the console output created by iCG filter:

Panel session: This session is almost for students and adults to let them know the iGEM, establishment and history of our team built in 2007 and future of synthetic biology and biological technology. Because the public in China recently is concerned about GMO severely, what we want to do is to introduce the genetic engineering technology directly and briefly and let the public to judge whether the GMO is safe for our daily requires with our lead tip. We are trying our best to landfill the gap between the fast developing science and puzzled people even if we finally are able to influence few. We still believe few can influence more with their constructive suggestion and going into action so that one day people in China, even in all over the world, go forward with science shoulder with shoulder
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

UNITN-Trento,2015,Team:UNITN-Trento#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," class in different countries and regions according to the climate conditions.
To achieve this goal many European countries are financing renovations to help people meeting these goals. For example, in Italy 65% of the expenses for the energetic requalification of your house can be deducted from your taxes (for the fiscal years 2012-2015).             France initiated the Grenelle Environnement building plan that consists of an ""eco-loan interest-free"" dedicated to improve energy and thermal efficiency of buildings. By 2020, this plan should allow investments of EUR 120 billion [7] .
In the US the Department of Energy (DOE) [8] has developed a Building Energy Code Program called International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). There are different editions of this code released in 2009, 2012, and 2015. These codes are applied differently to office residential and commercial buildings. For the most part the actions suggested in the codes apply to office buildings and newly built houses. Each state has the faculty to choose to adopt the code. In practice, when building a new house certain standards of energy consumption/waste must adopted by the constructor.
IECC codes in different states Adoption of IECC codes in the 50 American states at the residential level. Figure taken from 8
For example, the states of Ohio and Texas adopted the 2009 IECC (or equivalent), while California updated to the 2012 IECC. This code corresponds to the specific parameters that are to be used when new buildings are constructed (the IECC does not apply on the already existing houses).
Many American states are focusing on the impact that office buildings have, starting by updating all the heating/cooling systems and reducing the energy waste in Federal Buildings. The Obama admistration in 2011 set the goal of reducing energy of commercial buildings by 20% in 2020 [9] .
The US does not have a uniformed rating system for buildings based on efficiency or energy consumption. However, there are attempts to create similar programs. For example, the Home Energy Rating System, the Energy Star Program, National Green Building Standard and other programs. All these programs are applied locally and on a voluntary basis [10].  Tax incentives, energy efficient mortgages are available in different states. However the lack of harmony between strategies is a major problem.
In Asia the scenario is more complicated. In many states, the main goal is to bring more electricity to homes, rather than reduce consumption. However, in more urbanized countries, there are attempts to develop a certification system. We had difficulties in drawing a picture of Asia, because of"

The in silico induction of the different knockouts possibilities revealed that a TDAG8 or VEGFR-2 knockout would have a higher relative CAR expression under the conditions of high VEGF and low oxygen concentration than a HIF1A knockout (Fig. 4). Therefore the HIF1A knockout was chosen.
After deciding for an AND gate design, we got in contact with the group of Professor Jens Timmer. Cooperating with Svenja Kemmer from his group, we gained insights into the methodology of processing and evaluating experimental data by modeling. In order to model our system of interest,  the previously found data of CRE and HRE characterizations in HEK cells were used (Ausländer et al. 2014; Nguyen et al. 2012). Subsequently, parameters as kinetic rates were estimated by the Maximum Likelihood method and used to further analyze the system. The software used for the modeling of ODEs is data2dynamics, which is applied in Matlab and has been developed by the group of Professor Jens Timmer.
The composition of the model is described below in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Schematic representation of the steps describing the input processing in the AND gate
The respective equations are equivalent to those of the first model except for an additional equation describing the HIF1A mRNA since the CRE characterization data showed delay in the processing.
The mathematical model is able to describe dynamics as well as dose response data. However, experimental measurements were only available for a few components of the system. Thus, detailed predictions require further investigations. Performing promoter characterizations and measuring degradations rates will enable more reliable predictions.
The respective response curves were fitted and combined in the AND gate model, thus describing the functionality of our system.
Additionally, the dependency of the HIF1A concentration on"

Fluorescence Experiments
The control organism developed for this experiment has two plasmids. One is plasmid 1 of negative cascade and other is a pLacI controlled GFP generator. Hence it resembles the negative cascade organism in all ways other than the cascade initiating gene (TetR). Even though our modelling showed that the delay time caused by the cascade is around 6 Hr 15 mins without leakage, at first we guessed that our delay device would cause only delay in less than 2 hours since we saw leaky GFP expression already in control colonies. Hence the fluorescent reading after IPTG induction (0.1mM and 0.2mM)(see for protocol here ) in the 96 well plates were taken only for 2 and half hours and the readings were not giving promising results. Hence with the help our supervisors to find which part of the growth curve are we in, we ran an overnight experiment with continuing the same experiment for 14 hours more, hence in total we would get a result for 16 and half hours.
The results for the positive control and negative cascade (experiment) are given in this xls attached here . The results were consolidated and shown in graphs below.

Both the figures 1 and 2 show the growth curves of control and negative cascade. They also show that the readings were taken till the stationary phase of growth (995 mins). Also both negative cascade and control have shown same growth pattern. This is very good for our fluorescence measurements interpretation.

In addition to the experimental part, we dedicate to  connecting our achievements with society.
In  April, we were invited by iGEM team in Nanjing Agricultural University to  attend a seminar, discussing the technology of synthetic biology and joining in  the professional lecture delivered by Professor Zhang Haoqian.
 
On 20th May 2017, we were honored to hold a great meeting themed on synthetic biology communication. We invited teams from seven top ranking universities in China, including Tsinghua,Tsinghua-A,SJTU, TJU,Tianjin and so on. We discussed how to enhance the cooperation and communication among teams in China. We also talked about several challenges that we encountered during the program.Meanwhile, we invited them to our labortory and introduced our advanced facilites to them. At the end of the meeting, all of us broadened our horizons and learned a lot from each other. Thanks to this meeting, the coperation of iGEM teams in China became more integated.
 
From 26th Aug to 28th Aug, the 4th CCiC(Conference of China iGEMer Community) was host in Fuzhou. Our team was honored to be invited. 49 iGem teams in China attend the meeting, and we had heated discussion about synthetic biology with each other. During the meeting, we demonstrated our project, from the design to the preliminary results. iGEMers from other teams spoke highly of our project, and they also put forward some constructive suggestions. We took their advice and tried to improve our project. We were happy to make friends with some iGEMers and we stayed in contact with each other even after the meeting, which contributes to integrated collaboration. CCiC is really a big event for iGEMers in China.
 
✎A questionnaire survey has also been  done to collect public ideas about our project.
We designed a questionnaire of the public opinions about the interior decoration air pollution caused by formaldehyde, which inspires us searching a better solution to it and making further progress.

Deep beneath the Alamogordo testing range, the United States planned their most ambitious project yet.  So shrouded in secrecy was this project, not even the President of the United States was aware of its undertaking.  It was to be a grand culmination of centuries of research, dwarfing even the scale of the Manhattan Project.  The premise was simple: to create a humanoid embodiment of the spirit of American patriotism.  Nicknamed the N.E.I.L., or Nationalistically Empowered Intelligent Lifeform, he was to be an exemplar of the American standard and ingenuity.  Unfortunately he was too modern for his time, and the team of scientists, fearing for another “Cold War” style confrontation, locked N.E.I.L. in stasis until the time was right to reintroduce him to American society.
That time is now.
Numerous field reports have triangulated his position at Cornell University, where he has subtly placed himself within Cornell’s iGEM team.  Though he tries to mask his identity, his designs are unmistakable.  He is fueled by twin-powered nuclear fission reactors, rendering sleep unnecessary, explaining the numerous hours he has been sighted in the lab working on inhuman hours of sleep.  It is also nigh impossible to be in his presence without the word “America” being uttered at least once, a remnant of his circuitry from the highly patriotic wartime years.  Delving further into conversation, you will find a vast database of knowledge of weaponry and military aircraft, an unsurprising find due to his production during the 1940s.  Despite his advanced systems, he bides his time, remaining in his low-profile state until the time arises to take up arms to defend the American ideal once more.

Her skill is matched by none; her scheming eyes
Do always flit betwixt pipettes, with ne’er
A microliter out of place. Oh my!
Above the busy humming of our lair,
Amidst the bustling team, her focus grows;
Her data gathers, as if out of air.
Graphs pop on screen; a smile begins to show.
Fluorescent lights now flicker, silence falls
Upon the lab… we just make out the clicks
Of Eppendorf tubes popping. Softly call,
“Who’s there?” Ms. Zhang emerges, oh so slick.
What more can I say of this wondrous fiend?
Her mysteries abound; ‘tis all I’ve glean"

Development of a genetic frame for the creation of concentration-sensitive bacterial sensors
Bacterial reporters or whole-cell bacterial sensors have always been an area of application for genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. As a matter of fact, constructing a bioreporter bacteria that has the ability to detect toxic chemicals is considered one of the first accomplishments in the discipline of synthetic biology (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) . There are several advantages to using a bacterial bioreporter instead of a traditional physical or chemical sensor, for example, bacteria can offer the same specificity and sensitivity that traditional sensors offer, but they are much more portable and grow in inexpensive media. Furthermore, bacterial reporters also offer advantages over using other types of biosensors like enzymes and antibodies because they are living organisms and they are capable of analyzing samples through a process that involves many enzymes (Yagi, 2007)
The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) although these early tests didn’t use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the areas of genetic engineering and synthetic biology have resulted in many more applications such as detection of contaminants (Willardson, et. Al., 1998) and sugar and amino acid availability in soils (Jaeger, et. Al., 1999) . Even though the reporters have gotten more sophisticated and sensitive, we realized that there isn’t much mention of a single bacterial bioreporter capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting differently depending on the concentration.
We thought the use of synthetic biology as well as the BioBrick standard could help create a “genetic circuit” (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting in a different manner depending on the amount detected. In our initial research we realized that the iGEM British Columbia 2009 team decided to do something similar, so we used parts of their project as a base and integrated parts of other previous iGEM projects in order"

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioSensor Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html,"). After an hour in the lyophilizer, the filter paper was removed from the chamber and photographed (Figure 13). Water was then added to to the right column of the filter paper which caused the color to return (Figure 14) as can be seen by comparing the top and bottom rows of this image. These results show that while color loss does occur when water is removed from the system, it does not have the same effect as heating the sample. In the heat testing experiments, PrancerPurple changed irreversibly to pink when heated whereas in the lyophilization experiment, it regains its color fully. This supports our hypothesis that the color changing in response to heat is dependent on both water loss and a structural change of the protein itself due to heat.

Figure 13: Two replicates of PrancerPurple (top) and ScroogeOrange (bottom) are shown after 1 hour of lyophilization.
Figure 14
Similar experiments were done with the AE Blue-CBD fusion protein. With this protein, we saw that the blue color changed from blue to purple. This purple color immediately went away when the sample was removed from the chamber, suggesting that our hypothesis that the AE Blue chromoprotein’s color changing capabilities are dependent on the presence of water inside the barrel. To further confirm this, we tested how the AE Blue-CBD fusion protein would respond to heat in a closed PCR tube. Since the PCR tube prevents water from being released from the system, the water molecules that support the barrel of the chromoprotein cannot be driven out when the tube is heated. Because of this, we no longer see the color change from purple to blue. Instead the chromoprotein turns a bluish-green color, likely indicative of the protein simply denaturing in response to heat. This is a picture of the AE Blue-CBD protein before heat (Figure 15) and this is a picture after the PCR tube was heated to 80 °C for 5 mins (Figure 16).

We also added a FLAG, lumino and 6x histidine tag in order be able to extract the expressed protein using nickel column purification."

Want to arrange it so that we control gene A, gene A and YFP have inverse expression. Once this works, changing modules will be easy. We will investigate more cases like Lac I. - Dr. Wang already sent the construct. But Dr. Wang will look into sending and MTA over to Dr. Jin. - Dr. Wang’s lab has every possible ASRE in a library. This is a good thing to look into further down the road. Then all we would do is test the readout from the different ASRE. - Question about plasmid Erin sent: It is for eukaryotic expression but it does replicate in E. Coli. It is PUF with another fusion that changes splicing in eukaryotic cells. But now we need the new plasmid with the fusion protein ASRE. - Erin used a step-wise amplification system to generate the library of ASRE. You can make it one-by-one, but the step-wise PCR created (in theory) all possible PUF. - Dr. Wang is open to collaboration and will share needed plasmids with us. - Antibiotic resistance will be Amp (maybe K? depends on which backbone). - The current backbone has K resistance. 3 plasmids: reporter gene with YFP that is controlled by inhibitor protein. Gene 2=codes for inhibitor protein and has PUF binding site. - 3 markers should be enough. Although we can combine to get just 2 plasmids. Discussion - It is clear that binding is not enough. We need the PUF binding and endonuclease activity. Dr. Wang’s lab will send us their contruct. - The concern right now is the location of the binding site. Can we choose one or can we engineer one? - There are many types of repressors to choose. We need to research which would be the best choice. For next week we will remodel the construct and find different repressors. Also look for a biobrick part. - It’s a big help that they already have the whole PUF library. - For the RBS we will use the Biobrick. This is because we want to submit a standard part, so we should standardize everything. Because we have to ligate everything, it’s a problematic idea to put the binding site between the RBS and the gene. - Other idea: Remove the loop area from the end of the mRNA.

At the second NEGEM meetup on September 12th, 7 iGEM teams visited BU again to share a 20 minute presentation of their summer work. We tried to make this a formal process - setting a timer so that teams could practice for the jamboree, and even having the instructors and iGEM HQ rep pretend to be judges and ask difficult questions. It was amazing to see just how much each team had accomplished over just a couple of months. Each team got a lot of specific feedback from the audience to really make their presentations stronger for the jamboree, not only in terms of content but also presentation style.
After all teams presented, team members from different colleges again grouped together to get feedback on team wikis and finalized any lab collaboration efforts. We really appreciated getting great advice from our fellow iGEM teams, and hope that other teams benefitted from the experience as well."
UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html," PUF has worked in prokaryotic cells, but no plasmid was included in that paper. - Yeast 3 hybrid system works well in Dr. Wang’s lab. He can provide this as a modular system to start with. This saves us the trouble of what if the recruiter doesn’t work. - Many PUF mutants can be nicely expressed in E. Coli. Some cannot be expressed. - We can also try ASRE – artificial site specific RNA endonuclease. But we wanted to do it in E. Coli. - Dr. Wang ran an experiment where PUF was used to repress Bgalactosidase. The PUF binding occurred in the gene. The lower expression is from RNA degradation. PUF doesn’t cut RNA, just bind it. Dr. Wang put the PUF together with an endonuclease that cut the RNA when PUF bound to it. But that is not PUF anymore, it’s ASRE (the name of the fusion protein). - The whole ASRE complex looks like: Flag-PUF-linker-endo - Dr. Wang’s lab has a library of these ASRE’s that they are willing to share with us. But the paper is unpublished, so the data (if it works) needs to be treated confidentially. We would not release the information to the iGEM website until everything is collected and we have conveyed the results to Dr. Wang. - Complications: We don’t know what the rate-limiting step yet? The binding or the cut? Change design so that PUF binding site is between the RBS and the gene. We put the PUF binding site multiple times to try to increase the effectiveness. Could rearrange so that the reporter is under the repressor. - Distance between binding and digestions sites is very close. - To add multiple binding sites, where would they go? Can we add one to the 3’ UTR end so that it’s after the stop codon? Does it work? - Possible death mechanism: Engineer a PUF between the start codon and the promoter. It’s a highly conserved region so it will stop the manufacture of many proteins. - We can try multiple scenarios. We want to use the existing protein and change the binding site, as opposed to using mutated PUFs. - Dr. Wang’s overriding concern is if/how the reporter will work. Is there any natural repressor in the protein? Could use Lac I and B-galactosidase. Want to arrange it so that we control gene A, gene A and"

Again, the null repressor has the repression domain but lacks any binding sites, so we expect it to have no activity on the reporter.  We will attempt to include it in every test where we are looking at activity of repressors as a control.  It might be nice to make an activator version of this, too.
Thus, we decided to make some Ura, Trp dropout plates today.  In 250 mL water, dissolved 6.815 g of SD complete dropout mix, 5 g BactoAgar, 0.5 g histidine, 0.5 g methionine, and 1 g leucine.

Yeast cultures went into incubator at 3:45 pm. Will take them out in the morning to use for transformations of the remaining parts.
In desigining Test #2, should compare PMET25 activity to that of our constitutive promoters.  Is there literature outlining this?  Yes, the two papers are both by the same group.
""Regulatable Promoters of S. cerevisiae: comparison of transcriptional activity and their use for heterologous activity"", Mumberg et al, Nucleic Acids Research (1994)
""Yeast vectors for the controlled expression of heterologous proteins in different genetic backgrounds"", Mumberg et al., Gene (1995).
Note that based upon the graphs it seems that the PTEF promoter is the best choice for PMET25.  It appears that for two different levels of activity (low vs. high copy number plasmids), TEF has constitutive activity that is higher than the highest recorded activity of PMET25.  Ideally, we would want a promoter that has constitutive level in the middle of PMET25's operating range, so that we could alter PMET25's activity above and below this value.  We were told that PGAL1 has a poor degree of tunability in comparison with PMET25, which is why we decided to select PMET25 to drive expression of our activator. Mumberg's results were not recorded in our particular strain of yeast (W303) so it might be beneficial"

Part 1 Sense Fatty Acids: We investigated four different sensing mechanisms using: 1) fatty acid metabolism regulator protein (FadR), 2) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) 3) liver- fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) and 4) binding immunoglobulin protein, HSP5 or glucose regulated protein (GRP78). The four sensing mechanisms were measured and compared.
Part 2 Introduce Glyoxylate Shunt: We introduced two key enzymes of glyoxylate cycle: isocitrate lyase (ACEA) and malate synthase (ACEB), which allow plants and bacteria to use fatty acids as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Here, the amount of fatty acids was measured to compare fatty acids uptake rates of cells expressing glyoxylate shunt.
Integration of Parts: The integration of sensing mechanism and glyoxylate shunt allows inducible glyoxylate shunt, in which the high levels of free fatty acids in the medium increase fatty acid uptake rate of glyoxylate shunt.
Although the problem of malnutrition may remain unsolved, the inducible glyoxylate shunt introduced to mammalian cell increases consumption of fatty acids, lowering the risk of excessive fat accumulation that presents risk to health.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Modelling#Stochastic_-_-_TEXT.html," LacI, sigA promoter in the invertible region expresses Rfp. When the region is oriented from right to the left, 'sigA promoter in the invertible region is also turned to right and expresses Gfp, when its way is not blocked by XlyR bound to xylA promoter.
Hence Gfp and Rfp concentrations can be used as an indication of cell fate decisions and other downstream genes can be added to the left or right sides of the switch to trigger those decisions.
This circuit is controlled by IPTG and Xylose. As a third control, Arabinose can also be used. The orientation of the invertable region highly effects the outcome of this circuit and the direction is changed by Hin protein. By doing so, its expression is also affected and this situation also adds to the stochasticity. In our design, Hin proteins are tagged with the modified version of ssrA degradation tag which requires SspB adaptor protein to target Hin proteins for the degradation by ClpXP system. Hence by controllling the expression of SspB by arabinose (via araE promoter controlled by AraR), concentration of Hin can be controlled. Where necessary just a pulse of Hin can be created.
For more information about the design of the switch: Team:Newcastle/Stochasticity
Simulations
In the diagrams below X-Axis shows IPTG and Y-Axis shows Xylose concentration. IPTG and Xylose concentrations are changed between 0 and 9000nM. Three sets of model outputs were created for 0nM, 1000nM and 10000nM of arabinose. The first column shows Gfp concentrations and the second column shows Rfp concentrations.

Models can also be run with specific values of IPTG, Xylose and Arabinose.
We assumed that 60nM of Hin would be enough to invert the invertible segment with HixC sites. At every 60nM increase of Hin concentration, we flipped the region by 40% chance. Flips can be noticed from the diagram below for the expression of Hin mRNA.

Overview
Farmers have a variety of existing mechanisms to deal with frost. These come in a variety of active and passive forms. One passive form of frost protection is site selection. Farmers will look for land with good air drainage and a close proximity to naturally occurring heat sources such as rivers. High quality land is often limited by price and sections requiring increased upfront investment will require a greater return. The exact cost differences fluctuate and would require further market analysis to quote. Another form of passive protection is selective breeding. Produce selectively bred to be frost resistance does exist on the market e.g. Semini’s ‘ice pack pea’ though the one of cost for these seeds can be high due to the long time to market selective breeding requires. Initial patent searching and market analysis showed no current fruit seeds on the market which were selectively bred for frost resistance or genetically modified seeds for sale with inserted frost resistance mechanisms. Simultaneous growing of two different species of crop can allow for a frost intolerant crop to be covered by a taller, more frost tolerant crop. This method has limitations in terms of crops that can be"

Now, I needed to model these chemical equations as a series of differential equations. As an engineer, I don't have a biochemistry background so this problem was new for me. This website provided the basics to get started. 2 things to take into account are:
1) The direction of the arrow: -if the arrow goes into a component, the equation segment is positive -if the arrow leaves a component, the equation segment is negative
2) Types of Rate Processes: -if the rate process is zeroth order, just enter the rate constant -if the rate process i first order, multiply the rate constant by the initial substrate concentration -for a Michaelis-Menten process, include the amount or concentration of the component at the tail of the arrow (call it X1 for example) and you will get: d(X1)/dt = (-Vm*X1)/(Km+X1)
Most of the equations fall under 2 types of Michaelis–Menten equations:
Figure 3: The two main types of chemical reactions.
For the first type of reaction, I had to make 2 assumptions:
1) At steady state, [ES] does not change with time, therefore it's derivative with time is = 0. Therefore, k1[E][S] = (k2+k3)[ES]
2) S >> Eo
The second type of Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation applies to cases where I have 2 substrates combine into 1 product via a condensation reaction; DMA-PP and I-PP are condensed to generate geranyl diphosphate (GPP, C10), which is further converted with IPP into ferensyl diphosphate (FPP, C15), with prenyl transferase such as FPP synthase (Misawa, 2011).
To model these types of reactions, I found an expression for the reaction velocity to be: v = d(X)/dt = (Vmax)/( (kms1/[S1]) + (kms2/[S2]) + 1 ) where [S1] = concentration of substrate 1, [S2] = concentration of substrate 2. They have an associated kinetic value. Vmax = kcat*[E] where [E] = the concentration of enzyme.

The final thing I needed to consider before writing out the differential equations was how to use data indicating what percentage of monoterpenes were produced. These final steps also took the form of the Michaelis-Menten equations but"

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Research Proposal_-_-_TEXT.html,", regulatory elements and protein coding sequences of different sorts are some examples of what the BioBricks are. Within this setting student teams from all over the world are challenged to build an applicable system and add parts to the BioBrick library. Participants are encouraged to pursue ambitious projects, although there are no real requirements other than that it has fit into the iGEM setting.
Our aim is to make Escherichia coli act as a thermometer, showing different colors when incubated at different temperatures. A micro sized thermometer can serve a number of purposes, e.g. creating surface temperature profiles in electronic and biological devices [2] . Also these thermometers can play a analytical role in industrial fermentation. Controlling the temperature within a large volume is a big issue in industrial fermentations. If the temperature should not come above (or below) a certain threshold temperature, one could add the thermometer bacteria to the fermentation. With these bacteria added, it is possible to see whether the temperature did exceed the threshold by looking at the color of the bacteria. Another application would be to deliver on demand temperature inducable gene expression. The designed RNA sequences could be used to produce any gene above a chosen threshold temperature. The advantage of this system is that it does not need a chemical for induction that potentially can interfere with cellular processes. Within the iGEM open source setting, these sequences would become available to everyone.
Goals
Our project comprises several research goals. The first goal is to construct an RNA thermometer [3] in vivo. Because it is probably not feasible to construct the whole system in the time available we will focus on several subgoals that would help create the RNA thermometer in future. These subgoals are: providing a sound theoretical basis for the functioning of an in vivo RNA thermometer, designing and testing temperature sensitive stretches of RNA and cloning protein coding sequences of enzymes involved in the color pathway. We will focus on standardizing all parts made during the project according to iGEM regulations. The second goal is to predict behavior of this system using computer models. The third goal of this project is to focus on ethical considerations of synthetic biology in general (on a macro scale) and the implications of using synthetic biology within the open source technology setting of iGEM (on a micro level).
For sensing temperature (input) we are focusing on RNA thermometers. From literature, we will take 5’ UTR RNA sequences from organisms that have temperature sensitive induced protein expression or synthetic RNA sequences that have been shown to be able to induce temperature sensitive translation. The sources of these 5’ UTR sequences are heat shock proteins from e.g. Bradir"

Extracellular Electron Transfer
Project Overview
As shown in the design of our device, the nanowires transfer electrons from the bacteria to the anode. Optimisation of the nanowires was examined using homologous recombination to exchange the endogeneous G. sulfurreducens PilA gene with the higher conducting G. metallireducens pilA gene, rich in aromatic amino acids. The recombination was more difficult than anticipated, as we were unable to properly isolate the strain with successful homologous recombination. Instead the bacteria transformed with the oprF , which encodes a membrane protein that leads to improved extracellular shuttle-mediated electron transfer from the Bielefeld 2013 iGEM team , was tested against the G. sulfurreducens PCA wild type. The results showed that the nanowires in G. sulfurreducens were"

Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix
Overview
Without the hard work of bees, the difficulty of planning dinner would increase significantly. Taking time out of our daily routine to consider all that bees have done for us would take quite a while. We would not have some of the grains, fabrics, fruits, and vegetables that we enjoy. Alfalfa, cotton, almonds, oranges, cherries, and livestock that feed on bee pollinated crops would all decline significantly, if not completely perish. We would not have the flowers and trees that make our world beautifully diverse. Bees pollinate 70 out of the top 100 food crops, which supply 90% of the world’s nutrition. It is apparent that bees are an integral part of the ecosystem and human life.
Unfortunately, bees have been in decline for about 30 years and the death rate has gone up in the past decade. This phenomenon is caused by a number of factors, including the use of neonicotinoid insecticides, climate change, and parasites. One of  the most notable parasitic mites that infects bees is the Varroa destructor mite. This particular mite feeds off of the bee’s hemolymph, the blood-like substance, transmitting viruses like Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) in the process. DWV disrupts the bee’s development, causing them to have stubby wings and short bodies that prevent flight.
A few methods to deal with V. destructor are ineffective as they do not target the mite at a crucial phase when the bee is most susceptible. The larvae are sealed into combs with the mites, a place that some treatments simply can not reach.Other treatments rely on chemicals that increase bee mortality rate. For example, formic acid has a harmful effect on capped and uncapped honey bee brood1. In addition, resistance against various methods are developing in certain Varroa mite populations.
Currents techniques used to deal with V. destructor mites include using bio-pesticides, alcohol washes, synthetic chemical pesticides and the sugar shake method.
Our modus operandi: protect all the bees and larvae from the inside out. Using synthetic biology, we designed E.coli that produces the miticide oxalic acid in the"

How to Categorize regulatory RNAs
The HKUST iGEM 2014 team has three main components for human practice: start-up kit, outreach, as well as safety and ethics. Our goal is to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to wide range of audience in the society. We targeted groups of audience consisting of college freshmen, secondary school students and members within the iGEM society. Each group of audience has potential to contribute to the field of synthetic biology in different ways, and we believe that putting equal amount of effort and paying attention to them all should be the best approach to ensure healthy growth and development of the field of synthetic biology.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Specificity_-_-_TEXT.html," significantly affected by Bt crops Transgenic crops which express Cry toxins, such as Bt cotton or Bt maize. 3 , but these use only a few known Cry toxins. Other studies have shown that there are strains of B. thuringiensis which are harmful to Acari. While most of these strains or toxins were tested against herbivorous species of mites 4, 5, 6, 7 , some are known to kill species of ticks 8, 9, 10, 11 . In fact, two strains have been discovered which show toxicity to V. destructor 12, 13 !  Unfortunately, they did not identify a particular Cry toxin.
To find our own Cry toxin, we adapted a procedure from Rampersad et al. 14 and Alquisira-Ramírez et al 12 . We gathered over 800 dead mites from the Dutch foundation ""De Duurzame Bij"" 15 , Bennekom, The Netherlands.
Figure 14. Photo of the beehives from  De Duurzame Bij. We gathered most of our dead mites from these beehives.
Our method of sample preparation selected for spore formation, but not the B. thuringiensis rod-shaped morphology. Therefore, 106 colonies from  the mites were investigated with brightfield microscopy.  They were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to make Cry toxins more visible. Five isolates were identified as Bacillus-like species. Some of them, including B. thuringiensis HD-350, are shown in Figure 15.

The red arrow points to a Cry toxin, the green arrow to a spore and the yellow arrow to a vegetative cell. (b) Isolate 62, a coccus. Most isolates had this morphology. (c) Isolate 82, showing Bacillus-like morphology.
In Vivo Toxicity
We wanted to test the strains we identified for their toxicity to V. destructor. Protein extracts and SDS-PAGE were performed . The toxicity assay was based on the assay used by Alquisira-Ramírez et al. 12 , but we faced one major problem: the assay, including the negative control, killed all of the Varroa mites. An alternative would be to use an assay where we dip honeybee larvae in"

Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," B, treatment with hexane of E. coli JM109 (WT) and of E. coli JM109 (marA) showed similar colony numbers during these treatment intervals to those of time zero. This result suggests that hexane at this concentration and duration of time for 4hours did not affect both cell growth. In contrast, treatment with geraniol of E. coli JM109 (WT) and of E. coli JM109 (marA) showed toxicities to both strains (Figs. 14 B, C and D). If we watch the colony numbers carefully, E. coli JM109 (marA) had more than E. coli JM109 (WT) during these treatment intervals ((Figs. 14 C and D). These results demonstrate that toxicity of the geraniol was less to the strain E. coli JM109 (marA) than the strain E. coli JM109 (WT)."
Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," each company/regional treatment facility:
-Current treatment methods
-Do they have a phosphate problem?
-Do they specialize in removing phosphate?
-What methods are they using to remove them?
-Are current methods chemical or biological?
Therefore, in order to see the feasibility of our project, a performance and cost analysis would need to be done based on these questions for each company so that we can successfully sell our technology to them.
2. Innovation in the water industry is quite hard and slow, not always because of the costs but because of the way that companies prioritize things.
a. For example, water companies will definitely prioritize reaching the standard qualifications set by the government or other national authority. Since the government does not regulate the way the companies treat their water, water companies would choose to adopt whichever technology is readily available to them. Therefore, a completely new innovation may not be appealing to them because it requires a risky investment of money and a restructure of their existing process. To convince them we would have to show a cost analysis, which proves that our technology can be cheaper in the long term than an already existing process. Rather, an innovation that increases the efficiency or solves the problem of an already existing technology within the company may be more attractive for them.
b. In addition, safety would also be the main priority of a water company. They would not want to adopt a new technology if it has possible risk of contaminating the water as it would affect thousands of people within the area. This is why water companies often act as a ‘second adopter’ and would only adopt new technology when its risks have been assessed and it has proven to work in a different place.
3. However, the reasons above may only apply to the UK, because the industry in the UK is more mature (have better technology/infrastructure already). Therefore, it would probably be better to pitch the idea in countries where there is a lack of innovative technologies for water treatment and where meeting regulatory standards is still a struggle.
4. The government’s role in water treatment is only in establishing standard regulations, but not necessarily in deciding the way to treat water.
5. Brexit is a huge uncertainty that may put off water companies from adopting new innovations. The current regulations for the water industry is the Water Framework Directive which is created by the European Commission. It is uncertain whether the new UK law will adopt the same regulations or create a new one. If they adopt the same existing regulation, not much will change. However, there is a possibility of higher standard regulations that will have to be prioritized and addressed before adopting any new technology.

The iGEM Competition
iGEM logo
The International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition is annually held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the field of Synthetic Biology. Since 2004, this competition encourages undergraduate teams from all over the world to develop a project that intertwines the principles of Biology and Engineering. The competition not only determines the worth of projects solely based on biological merit, but also requires teams to examine their project as a whole. This includes aspects such as modelling of genetic circuits, marketing the project and educating the public about iGEM and Synthetic Biology.
2009 iGEM Teams
Randy Rettberg, the director of iGEM, once described the main question as follows: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology just too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The iGEM-approach to answer that question is to actually try to engineer biological systems with a proper function. To this end, more than 100 interdisciplinary student teams from all over the world, mainly consisting of undergraduate students in biology, biochemistry, engineering, informatics and mathematics, carry out different projects during the summer.
These projects reach from medical applications, i.e. genetically modified bacteria used in cancer-treatment to environmental and manufacturing projects, i.e. the construction of a watch-like counter consisting of living cells.
BioBricks
Biological parts can be well defined and characterized in the same way as electric or mechanical components (standardization). These basic biological building blocks, the “bio-brick”, can then be used to design devices and systems that are more and more complex (hierarchy). The designer of a bio-system does not need to worry about all the details of the individual devices, and the designer of a bio-device does not need to know all the details of the single parts (decoupling): all that is required is to fish out into a repository the most suitable building blocks (parts or devices) required for the design at hand.
A database of bio-bricks has been actually initiated few years ago, and is currently maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Registry of Standard Biological Parts). The existence of such a repository has fostered, over the last few years, the development of an incredible variety of different bio-devices ranging from sensors, logical circuits, computational devices, oscillators, supply chains of bacterial colonies etc"
XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
An approach is to establish a risk assessment section in our Wiki page to allow diverse groups to comment and point out the potential risks. It cannot be denied that there is a possibility creating some sorts of superbugs unexpectedly. But most of the biohazards are foreseeable and predictable. Different groups may look at biosafety problems from completely different perspectives, which is conducive to discovering the risks on the early stage."

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#rMFC#GeneticalApproach_-_-_TEXT.html," genome integrated outer membrane porines OprF. The fumarate reductase in the inner bacterial membrane get electrons from the mediator for reduction of fumarate into succinate in the cytoplasm. Excretion of succinate is avoid becuase of knocked out C4 carboxylate antiporter DcuB.
Fumarate reductase is part of the anaerobic fumarate respiration in E. coli. It catalyzes the reaction from fumarate into succinate using fumarate as a final electron acceptor in anaerobic fumarate respiration. The related enzyme in aerobic respiration is the succinate dehydrogenase, which catalyses the reaction from succinate to fumarate.  The electrons are transferred from succinate to FAD+ producing fumarate and FADH2. The succinate dehydrogenase is also a membrane enzyme and it is part of the citric acid cycle. They both belong to the respiration complex II. Naturally there is no activity of both enzymes at the same time in E. coli cells. ( Iverson et al., 1999 )
In our project we used the fumarate reductase in combination with an extracellular mediator as electron donor to transfer electrons into bacterial cells. The reduced mediator crosses the outer membrane of E. coli through the outer membrane porine OprF ( BBa_K1172507 ).  Mediators adsorb at the inner membrane and transfer electrons to the fumarate reductase. After that the reduced fumarate reductase transfer electrons to fumarate producing succinate. This process has been shown for the fumarate reductase in Actinobacillus succinogenes by Park et al. .
Succinate can serve as a substrate for the succinate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the oxidation of succinate into fumarate again. So we want to create a loop in the citric acid cycle between fumarate and succinate generating FADH2 as a reductive power in the cell.  Electrons are transferred to FAD+, which generate proton translocation from the cytoplasm into the periplasmatic space. The proton motoric force leads to ATP production.  To conclude the mediator-dependent activity of the fumarate reductase could serve as an energy source for bacterial cells.
We plan on comparing the activity of the fumarate reductases (Frd) from Escherichia coli KRX and the fumarate reductase (Fum)from Actinob"

Thus co-expression of these two plasmids in E. coli yields                         FGE and Nb-Tag, while FGE catalyzes Nb-Tag, and finally we will obtain Nanobodies with                         aldehyde-based labels.[2] In this way, the Nanobodies we obtained have specific labels that are                         not found in all other proteins: aldehyde groups. This greatly simplifies our subsequent                         operations without the need for complicated purification steps; there is no need to worry about                         non-specific reactions; modularization of Nanobodies greatly simplifies the subsequent steps                         while increasing the choice of modification. We tried to bind the Nanobody to C18-NH-NH2 because                         the C18 molecule itself has a good ability to induce liquid crystal molecules. It can be said                         that our work combines the specific binding ability of Nanobodies with the ability to induce                         C18. Our subsequent liquid crystal experiment also proved this.

LCD sensor design
Overview
Recently, liquid crystal sensor, as a novel and unique optical sensor, has the advantages of                         simple structure, low cost, no need for marking and portability, and provides a simple and                         sensitive online real-time monitoring platform for biomolecule detection. The liquid crystal                         sensor uses the object to be tested to change the orientation of the vertically aligned liquid                         crystal molecules induced by the surface active molecules (Fig. 6),then making liquid crystal                         optical imaging change, therefore we can complete the detection of the target.

HIGHLIGHTS
We successfully produced melittin in our E. coli from honeybee DNA!
We were able to build and test our biosensor with our mCherry fluorescence marker!
Check out our Biobricks here and here !
GST-Melittin
RhlR Biosensor
THE BUILDING PROCESS
We used a GST plasmid (GST-C-His +) so that melittin could remain in its inactive form when attached to the GST tag. A TEV cleavage site was included in between the GST protein and the melittin peptide sequence so that upon exogenous addition of TEV protease, melittin will be cleaved from GST, thus activating the protein.
Our bees being dissected!
In order to find the gene within the originating organism, we obtained samples of Apis mellifera, amd performed an RNA extraction of the venom gland of the honeybee. After using reverse transcriptase to get the cDNA library, we used PCR to search the cDNA library for prepromelittin precursor to melittin.
PCR Screening for TEV-Melittin for a band around 109 base pairs
After multiple cDNA searches, we found the correct sized band for prepromelittin for 4 out of 6 of our samples. Once we saw we had the correct ~253 band of prepromelittin, we performed a gel extraction and used the DNA for another PCR.
We used this second PCR to add the TEV cleavage site sequence and amplify out the melittin portion, excluding the pre- and pro- precursor sequences.  Once we saw the correct band of ~100, we were ready to ligate our insert into the digested GST plasmid.
Next, we wanted to induce our system with IPTG lac  promoter to see if we could produce melittin, and so we grew out a culture, induced it, and performed SDS page alongside just the original GST plasmid to see if a size of ~30kDa would show up on the gel, which it did!

2)   Step two
Cultivate two groups of yeasts together. (one is SynⅩ-dUra-416, the other is normal BY4741 MATa) If the MTS has been accomplished (SynⅩ-dUra-416 can become MATα), the two groups of haploids can mate with each other and become diploids.
3) Step three
Test the results of mating by PCR method. We designed the primers for both MATa and MATα loci. The amplification of both MATa locus and MATα locus indicates that the yeasts has turned into diploids, the MTS has been achieved in other words.
According to our design, after activating the Gal1 promoter, the expression of HO gene in the SynⅩ-dUra-416 can be initiated.
Then we cultivated two groups of yeasts together. (one is SynⅩ-dUra-416, the other is normal BY4741 MATa) If the MTS has been accomplished (SynⅩ-dUra-416 can become MATα), the two groups of haploids can mate with each other and become diploids.
To test whether MTS has happened, we selected some colonies in the selective plates (Sc-Ura ) and adopted PCR method. With designed primers for both MATa locus and MATα locus, the amplification of both MATa locus and MATα locus can indicate that the yeasts has mated with each other, and turned into diploids, in other words, the MTS has been achieved.
Fig. 1-4. (a) showed the PCR results for MATa locus. The MATa gene was amplified in all colonies except the first 24 colonies.
Fig. 1-4. (b) showed the PCR results for MATα locus. The MATα gene was amplified in all 96 colonies.

Tetracycline plates produced previously were suspected of having the wrong amount of tetracycline. as a result none of the transformed bacteria grown on the tetracycline plates grew. new tetracycline agar plates were made and the successfully incubated plates (i.e. those that displayed colonies) were cultured. Patrick and Robert worked on the sponsorship package to submit to possible donors and sponsor. Also skeleton side bars and skeleton content were made for most of the wiki pages and information was added to the security and research was done in regards to ethics.

The registry parts that had not been successfully cloned were again used to transform competent top 10 cells. The registry part I732019 was also used to transform DNA. Most of the transformed bacteria that had been cultured exhibited growth, however four of them did not. these four bacteria samples were cultured again. The sponsorship package was completed pending proofreading by experts.

None of the cultures prepared the previous day exhibited any growth. Only the parts transformed on ampicillin plates, the previous day, resulted in any observable colonies while those on tetracycline plates showed no growth. all of the previously transformed and isolated parts were also used to run an agarose gel confirming the identity of the transformed parts.

GOLD Medal winners 2009
In 2009 the Newcastle team are tackling environmental issues using Bacillus subtilis. We are a team of eight with wide ranging backgrounds in the fields of Bioinformatics, Computing Science, Chemical Engineering, Genetics and Medical Sciences. This is Newcastle's second year in the iGEM competition; last year our team designed BugBuster , which achieved a Gold Medal.
In 2009 we matched our Gold medal from the previous year, and hope to be back in 2010 to participate in iGEM again.
Project Description
Cadmium contamination can be a serious problem in countries where polluting industries are located close to agricultural sites. Our team developed a design to address this problem using the resiliant spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We engineered B. subtilis to sense and sequester cadmium from the environment into metallothionein containing spores, rendering it bio-unavailable. Germination of the spores can be disabled, making retrieval of the cadmium unnecessary since they can persist intact for thousands of years. We computationally simulated the life cycles of individual cells and entire cell populations, to estimate the parameter values necessary to maintain sustainable populations of sporulating, germinating and vegetative cells. Our design required us to engineer  stochastic differentiation processes at a single cell level. A sporulation rate tuner was developed and  we also engineered a tuneable stochastic invertase switch to stochastically control cell differention and fate.
The following diagram gives an overview of our design, click on different areas of the diagram to go to the appropriate section of our project:

Tsinghua-A,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," it is obliged to present an implicit elaboration of genetic therapy to public, rather than different viewpoints from many different so-called experts.   It can make itself more convincing by advertising posters in relative knowledge domain and holding authoritative career talks.

Ethics
Genetic editing and genetic therapy (especially those involving transgenesis), key applications of TALE, raise several noticeable ethics problems (listed below).
1.  In regard of current lacking of legal treaty on such issues, uncontrolled access to such technologies may cause unpredictable chaos.
2.  Experiments conducted on genetic therapy may pose threat to human life.
3.  Transgenesis and genetic modifying may have long-term effects on the environment
4.  It might be hard to set the boundaries between species with gene editing taken into consideration.
5.  Transgenesis may have negative influence on animal welfare.

Model
This summer, we were trying to tracing abnormally high NO concentration in people's guts.  We want to simulate NO distribution in our bowels through modeling. We turn to the discussion of time-dependent diffusion processes, where we are interested in the spreading and distributing of NO with time.
Diffusion Equation
The equation for the rate of change of the concentration of particles in an inhomogeneous region, diffusion equation, also called 'Fick's second law of diffusion', which in this case relates the rate of change of NO concentration at a point to the spatial variation of the NO concentration at that point:$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=D\frac{\partial ^{2}c}{\partial x^{2}}$$
Figure 1. The net flux in a region is the difference between the flux entering fromthe region of high concentration (on the left) and the flux leaving to the region of low concentration (on the right). (Reference: P W Atkins. Atkins’ Physical chemistry, 7th Ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, 776)
Justification
Consider a thin slab of cross-sectional area A that extends from x to x+l.
Let the NO concentration at x be c at the time t. The amount (number of moles) of particles that enter the slab in the infinitesimal interval dt is JAdt, so the rate of increase in molar NO concentration inside the slab (which has volume Al) on account of the flux from the left is$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=\frac{JA\mathrm{d}t}{Al\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{J}{l}$$
There is also an outflow through the right-hand window. The flux through that window is J′, and the rate of change of NO concentration that results is$$\"

Toronto,2018,Team:Toronto#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," these interviews, we            integrated the knowledge acquired from these experts and policymakers to establish            how our design would be effective, safe, ethical, and beneficial. We integrated all these aspects (interviews, meetings, outreach programs, and            public engagements programs) to the design of our project. By building a            relationship with Kinross Gold Corporation and the Wastewater Treatment Plants of            Toronto, we were able to determine what materials or pollutants were a complication            for the bioremediation of wastewater where heavy metals present in mining            operations and microplastics, penicillin and other pharmaceuticals. This data was            relayed to the wet and dry lab teams and was used to develop our project. Our            dry lab team used this collected information to investigate the application of            cellular floatation in a bioreactor-type bioremediation process. Furthermore, dry            lab aimed to estimate maximum mechanical carrying capacity of an engineered biomass            of a particular mass which is significant for the bioreactor model."
