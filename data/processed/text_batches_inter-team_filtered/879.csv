UCL_London,2011,Team:UCL London#HumanPractices#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," a preference for international agreement on synthetic biology policy, to improve competitiveness and maximise economic benefit from the technology. European initiatives such as Emergence and SynBioSafe commend the open discussion of relevant social issues, and attempts to standardise aspects of research. iGEM is therefore seen as a positive force for driving standardisation and ethical consideration. It is likely that the UK’s government will continue to support the ethos of the competition as the field develops.
Interdisciplinarity - Arts Catalyst
File:Artscatalyst.gif
Traditional ideas about the ‘two cultures’ of science and art are being challenged by modern interdisciplinary collaborations that use synthetic biology as inspiration. We attended the Arts Catalyst event We Need To Talk About Synthia to investigate the potential of art as a tool for increasing accessibility to cutting-edge research. These events commission art to enable audiences to critically engage with science, and several pieces were showcased that illustrated innovative approaches. We were inspired to devise an event that displays existing artworks in a more reflective way. Our event exposes the effective merging of the two cultures, allowing us to discuss the implications of MIT’s ‘hacking’ ethos for the garage biology movement. There’s more on our Art Collaboration here .
Motivation - Norwich Interviews
To further explore the purpose of iGEM, we interviewed several participants from different UK teams. The majority of interviewees explained that the competition was primarily an opportunity to improve their career prospects, and it was compared several times to a summer internship. This suggests that for many students, the competition is less about the pursuit of actual science and more about developing skills in project marketing. We discussed this topic in our debate event here .

Fluorescent protein Dronpa
This part contains the protein coding sequence for a mutant (K145N) of the fluorescent protein Dronpa and is codon optimised for yeast. Dronpa is a photoswitchable protein. Fluorescence can be turned off by illumination with 488 nm light and switched back on by illumination with 405 nm. The K145N mutation leads to photoswitchable monomerisation/multimerisation behaviour (as described by Zhou et al. 2012). The part is supplied in RFC25. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the expression of this part works and photoswitching can be observed as expected ( see Results ).

(E) Phase diagram of repressilator model with $\beta_1=(30,30,30)$ and different initial protein numbers. The behaviours are robust. (F) Phase diagram of repressilator model with $\beta_1=(30,15,20)$ and different initial protein numbers. The behaviours are sensitive to initial numbers.
It is obvious that such a difference can influence the attractor of this system when we plotted the time response diagram and phase trajectory diagram for the three proteins ($x_1, x_2, x_3$) (Fig. 4). We presented two potential attractors: a fixed point and a limit cycle. If the attractor is a fixed point, the gene expression is easy to converge to a steady state which means the oscillations die out. If the attractor is a limit cycle, the oscillations are stable. We simulated the oscillation by scanning different initial protein numbers to further illuminate the difference between these two attractors. The oscillation behaviour is sensitive to the initial state when the attractor is a fixed point. So we cannot make sure that we will observe the oscillations in this situation. But the oscillation behaviour is robust when the attractor is a limit cycle.
Another question arose: Whether the attractor results from the relative promoter strength or the absolute promoter strength. To find out the answer, we scanned a range of promoter strength and constructed a index named relative amplitude $A_r$, \begin{equation} A_r=\frac{2\cdot(max(x_1)-min(x_1))}{max(x_1)+min(x_1)}. \end{equation}
This index was calculated when the simulation time approached the infinity ($t=120000\ min$). So if the relative amplitude approached 0, we concluded that the system was attracted to a fixed point.
Figure 5. Results of parameter scanning. The left diagram and the right diagram are the same results from different point of views. The colorbar indicates the relative amplitudes of different simulation results. The blank regions reveal that there is a fixed point attractor in the parameter space. The colored regions imply that there is a limit cycle attractor in the parameter space.
The simulation results reveal that there is a critical surface between these two limit states (Fig. 5). An attracting limit cycle emerges as the absolute promoter strengths increase, which is consistent with the previous result (Strelkowa and Barahona, 2011). They also assumed that the promoter strengths for all genes are identical and"

Véritable cuirasse, l’enveloppe de M.avium est composée de nombreux éléments. Certains, comme les protéines solubles, les carbohydrates, et les lipides sont communs à toutes les bactéries.
D’autres en revanche, spécifiques à M.avium, sont des plus intéressants, notamment ces trois macromolécules insolubles : - l’arabinogalactan,
- le peptidoglycane,
- l’acide mycolique.
Ensemble, ces 3 constituants forment le cœur mycoylarabinogalactanpeptidoglycane (MAGP) de la paroi cellulaire. Le MAGP représente un des deux lipopolysaccharides (LPS) commun à toutes les mycobactéries, mais M.avium possède un second LPS : le lipoarabinomannan.
On observe également, chez M.avium, une couche de glycopeptidolipides (GPL) tout aussi spécifique.
Toute cette structure (MAGP, GPL et lipoarabinomannan) est fortement immunogène tout comme l’est le LPS des autres bactéries. Mais contrairement aux autres bactéries, cette structure complexe confère, à M.avium, une résistance spéciale. Le réseau formé par la membrane, basé sur des hydrocarbonés parallèles, rend la mycobactérie imperméable à de nombreux agents comme l’éthanol, les détergents ou les antibiotiques classiques.
La paroi du vecteur tissulaire et sa faculté à synthétiser des perturbateurs de transduction cellulaire lui permettent d’être l’un des seuls vecteurs résistants au système immunitaire . Ceci étant surement l’un des atouts majeur du DVS .

Duke,2013,Team:Duke#Modeling#1_-_-_TEXT.html," cooperative property leads to the sigmoidal shaped curve shown below.
Figure 1. Cooperativity of Hemoglobin
It has been shown by both mathematical derivation and experimental data that proteins which form multimers have cooperativity (Phillips et al, 2012). A transcriptional repressor of the lac operon, lacI proteins form tetramers and show cooperative repression of transcription. Similarly, tetracycline repressor (tetR) found in E.coli form dimers, and as a result show cooperativity. Professors Hermann Bujard and Manfred Gossen at University of Heidelberg developed a synthetic transcription factor called Tet-On and Tet-Off using this naturally found tetR respressor (Gossen, 1992). By fusing VP16 activator found in Herpes Simplex Virus with tetR, they made synthetic repressors (tetracycline transactivator, tTA) that could target specific locations named TetO operator sequences.
In addition to multimerization, combinatorial promoter binding has been shown to generate cooperativity (Murphy et al, 2007). Having multiple operator sites for both inducers and repressors produced cooperative response and it is this design that we chose to use in our project (with multiple binding sites for iTALs and CRISPR-Cas9). Cooperativity of repressors with multiple binding sites will be further explored in our mathematical models.
Hill Equation
Named after English physiologist Archibald Vivian Hill who studied the sigmoidal binding curve of hemoglobin, the Hill Equation provides a way to quantify cooperativity. The equation describes the fraction of proteins or enzymes that are saturated by ligands as a function of the concentration of ligands.
Figure 2. Hill Equation (Induction)
In the Hill Equation shown above, theta represents the fraction of binding sites occupied by ligands, [L] is the ligand concentration, n is the Hill coefficient, and Kd is the dissociation constant of the ligand. The value of the Hill coefficient describes the cooperativity of ligand binding: n>1 for positive cooperativity, n<1 for negative cooperativity and n=0 for no cooperativity. The above equation can also be applied to cooperative induction or activation of transcription, where theta represents the level of mRNA produced and [L] represents the level of inducer present. More cooperative the activation is, the steeper the slope will be, and the expression of the gene becomes more switch-like with distinct on-and-off states without intermediate states.

Besides, this collection also contain the genes that are necessary to produce the bioplastic polyhydroxybutyrate, simply do not add Lactate polymerizing enzyme to the organism of choice.
All of these BioBricks are optimized for usage in B. subtilis, and they can be used if a promoter is added in front of it. We can recommend using an inducible promoter such as Pgrac100 promoter that is induced by IPTG. Also, the operon will need a terminator - here we will recommend the α-amylase terminator from B. licheniformis.

In our Human Practices, we devote to raise people’s awareness of deafness and let them involve in to serve our society. Thus, we tried several ways to spread our idea on campus and in society.(e.g. Questionaires, brochures, lectures, interviews, etc) Meanwhile, we also collected information from different sources, including education field, government officials and charity organization,etc.
Education
We propagandized biology and synthetic biology concepts, iGEM history and ideas, as well as our project. We hope our education can cover people from different walks of life as many as possible. As a result, we pay attention to every opportunity that we can obtain to contact with people out of the lab.
Pupil & middle school students in rural areas in China
In summer 2016, some of our team members went to remote areas in Gansu and Sichuan Province in China for volunteer works. They taught primary and middle school students who cannot receive scientific and cultural education of good quality due to economic reasons. Considering interesting synthetic biology knowledge can bring happiness and inspiration to them, we briefly introduced what can be achieved by synthetic biology in an imaginative and creative way, including the knowledge of bacteria, plasmids and genes, and what we can manipulate on genes to generate a different thing. We also asked them to draw pictures of the ideal biology in their mind.

Lab 2
As the week came to an end, the RX lab students began their morning by eagerly viewing the transformation plates and the Yarrowia testing plates from the previous day.  The Yarrowia and chitinase testing plate showed a very visible zone of clearing where the 10 mg/mL and the 1 mg/mL concentrations were tested.  Unfortunately, the transformation plates did not grow a single colony after the incubation period.  The lab work for the day included a second Yarrowia testing as a attempt to recreate the results from the first testing and a second DNA assembly and transformation for chitinase C-1 and the pwPCH055 plasmid.  Also, in a disappointing turn of events, Max and Jonah’s cinnamaldehyde testing plates were viewed to be contaminated and had to be thrown away, so new cultures and testing was started.
Week 8
Monday (07/23/18)
Lab 1
After discussing all of their options, they discussed ways their PCR might have messed up. Thus, they began by double checking their primers, before agreeing that it was indeed correct. Next, they concluded that there may have been a problem with the digest that was performed, as there were multiple cut sites for the DpN1 digest that may have messed up the bands from cutting in the right places. Armed with this knowledge, Mike suggested them re-doing the PCR, this time leaving the digest out and see if there are the right bands.
Lab 2
To begin this Monday in lab, the RX Lab students first looked at the Yarrowia Testing plates from the Friday before.  Not a single plate seemed affected by the chitinase, so the team made a plan to start another round of testing the following day once the another Yarrowia culture was grown. The team then split into the two working groups: Max and Jonah resuspended their IDT orders for the cinnamaldehyde and began a DNA assembly. Travis, Peter, and Chris performed a DNA assembly transformation on Chitinase C-1 which was set up in an incubator to grow overnight.  After the lab work for day was completed, the RX students met with the RH students in order to work on completing the presentation for Dr. Niak.

Integrated Practices - Insert Header Img Here
Although synthetic biology is a field that seems like it would be confined to science, it permeates throughout various sectors of society. Early on in our project, we knew we had to get the input of experts to tailor our project. We did our best to integrate these professionals’ knowledge into our project to make it more meaningful and useful. Listed below are the summaries of the interviews we conducted and the take away in relation to our project.
Dr Cathleen London
Dr.London is a WGN radio correspondent and currently resides in rural Maine. Dr. London practices general medicine and is active in healthcare policy. Dr.London recently made news as she devised a reusable epinephrine autoinjector to combat Epipen’s controversial price increase.
Dr. London emphasized the importance of physician-patient relationships and public health policy to lowering the rate of antibiotic overuse. Hospitals are essentially hotbeds of bacteria, more so than individual physician practices. People without insurance (due to de funding) also have the tendency to wait until things are bad before rushing to the emergency room, where carers unfamiliar with the patient prescribe antibiotics “just in case” the problem is a bacterial infection, which it's often not.
Dr. London also believes our project is a clever idea, as antibiotic resistance must be attacked on all fronts with as many new ideas possible. The onus, however, lies with us to educate the public about gene editing, which often sounds like a dangerous idea to the average citizen.
Takeaway: We tried to take Dr.Londons emphasis on educating the average citizen that genetically modified does not inherently correspond to something negative. For example, while presenting to CTD students, we made an “ethical consideration slide” that balanced the pros and cons of potential genetic engineering applications. Projects such as experimental mosquito (i.e to fight Zika) or GMO foods often get a bad rep in the media, but have many positives such as disease eradication and feeding hungry populations.
Dr.Mendelson
Dr. Mendelson is the head of the division of infectious disease and HIV medicine at University of Cape Town. He mainly studies models of antibiotic stewardship, responses, prescription, and how international policy/health systems implement antibiotic resistance. He is an advocate for using standardized language when talking about antibiotic overuse across"

Boston University
Survey
We completed a survey on microfluidics to help Boston University gather data for their project.
Düsseldorf Cologne
Postcards
We joined many iGEM teams around the globe, led by the Cologne-Duesseldorf team, to create postcards that highlight synthetic biology and then distribute the postcards in our respective communities. Here is the front and back of our postcard:
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki
Experiment / Modelling / Survey
We conducted experiments to data feed their quorum sensing model. OD measurements over 9 and 12 hrs, 10 min intervals,               of colonies carrying our quorum sensing plasmid. We also received answers for our surveys concerning bacteria               mediated cancer therapies, from both patients and field specialists.
Stony Brook University
Survey
While new treatments can be very powerful, the ability of treatments to impact patients heavily relies on the willingness of patients to embrace them. To assess how well patients will receive the treatments developed by Columbia iGEM and Stony Brook iGEM, the two teams have joined forces to create a survey that targets patient reception of bacteria-mediated treatment and antimicrobial peptides. Columbia iGEM created the backbone of the survey and Stony Brook iGEM revised it and added their own section. Stony Brook iGEM collected most of the survey participant data. We aimed for a stratified random sample of participants, specifically targeting the younger generation as well as middle-aged and older people. The statistical analysis of the results of this survey will provide insight upon patient reception of the treatments developed by the two teams.

SCREENING
April – May
We found some literatures for our Screening Project and combine some projects from previous team. We decided to use Golden Gate Assembly from Freiburg team 2012 to synthesis our TALE. Our screening kit is related to Calgary team 2013 model but we use AmylCP reporter from UPPSALA team 2011 .
June-July
The TALE and AmylCP will be linked by E coil and K coil that created by Calgary team 2013 , so we ordered them from IGEM. The bio bricks stocks is limited so we have to clone them, we transformed them to E. coli competent cell. In the beginning we use local strain E. coli but the cells has low efficiency.

This shows that our biosensor works in waste water!

        ↥
Design:
When we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan. We discovered that many products had already phased out triclosan; some labels even read “Triclosan Free.”  Although triclosan had been removed from products, many of them had simply replaced it with a different antimicrobial.
This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences. What results is a cycle whereby one toxic chemical is replaced by another toxic chemical.
We didn’t want to raise fear over triclosan use and contribute to this cycle. Instead we wanted to raise awareness around appropriate chemical use and reduce the use of chemicals in cases where there is no proven benefit.
This lead us to supplementing our triclosan biosensor with an, “antimicrobial footprint app,” to get consumers thinking about whether antimicrobial agents are even warranted in consumer products.
Deliverable:
We designed our app as a heuristic to raise awareness about the unnecessary ubiquity of antimicrobials in consumer products.  In the app, the user can click on an “About” tab to learn more about antimicrobials and how to be a responsible consumer.  They can then go on to calculate their “Antimicrobial Footprint.” The user is able to click on antimicrobial containing products that they use, and see how it affects their total footprint. After using the app’s antimicrobial calculator to calculate their footprint, the user can submit their footprint along with their location. On the final page of the app the user is able to see how their footprint compares to the average footprint of other users. The submitted data is used to calculate this average, as well as to create a heat map of antimicrobial usage in the United States. This is another deliverable that users can look at to become more educated consumers.

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," polyketide chain from PKS. In TE domain catalyzed reactions, polyketide chains anchored on the ACP domains react with the oxhydryl on the pecific binding sites of TE domains.  Then the polyketide chains are transferred from ACP domains to TE domains. However, polyketide chains are instable when binding to TE domains and they release from TE domains, that is, release from the whole PKS. Finally, they become ripe polyketides.
The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
After the analysis of equation above, we conclude that this enzyme catalyzed reaction is similar to the single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions. We confirm that we can apply the mechanism of single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions to TE domain catalyzed reactions by using King-Altman Method.
The graph of mechanism is written as:
Kinetic Equations and Simplified Model Analysis
In the establishment of kinetic models, we employed the kinetic equations educed from single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions and multi substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions to each part (details in Reactions and Mechanism). Kinetic equations of enzyme catalyzed reactions (including single substrate’s and multi substrate’s) are educed from Law of Mass Action initially. We wrote out the related kinetic equations according to the mechanism in each part.
1．Loading Part
The reaction mechanism of Loading Part is Ping-pong bi-bi. The kinetic equation is :
KmAis the Michaelis Constant of substrate A when [B] is saturated.
KmBis the Michaelis Constant of substrate B when [A] is saturated.
Acoording to prerequisite of Michaelis-Menten equation, the concentration of substrates are much more than the concentration of enzyme, that Is, [A]>>[B]. Therefore, this kinetic model can be simplified. The simplified equation is:
After perfection, the final equation is:
[A0]is the concentration of DEBS 1.
[B] is the concentration of product in AT domain catalyzed reactions.
2. KS Part
(1)  AT Reaction
The reaction mechanism of AT Reaction is same as AT Part’s-------Ping-pong bi-bi. Therefore, the kinetic equation is the same.
(2)  KS Reaction
The reaction mechanism of KS Reaction is Ping-pong bi-bi. The kinetic equation is :
KmAis the Michaelis Constant of substrate A when [B] is saturated.
KmBis the Michaelis Constant of substrate B when [A] is saturated.

Penn,2011,Team:Penn State#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," repressor the promoter site is relatively transcriptionally active, while at higher concentrations the RNAP is unable to transcribe protein.
This particular graph was equal to the sum of configurations 24, 37, and 40. The graph below represents the sum of configurations 9, 16, 23, and 26 and corresponds to the PR operator region. The negative effects of CRO on the OR3 operating region can be seen as the concentration of CRO increases the transcriptional probability goes down as CRO binds to OR3 blocking RNAP. The positive effects of CI can also be seen as the increase in CI concentration prevents CRO from being formed allowing RNAP to bind to OR3 and proceed with transcription.
Using this distribution and sum of probabilities the following two differential equations could be produced relating the rate of change of protein concentration to the probabilities of transcription and kinetic constants.
The above equation corresponds to the rate of repressor production R that occurs at PRM, while the following equation corresponds to the rate of CRO production at PR.
By solving this simultaneous system of nonlinear differential equations, the production rate of protein at PRM and PR can be determined which in the case of the lambda phage consists of CRO and C1 repressor.
The above graph shows the concentration of CRO protein and C1 repressor as a function of time. As can be expected initially both repressor and CRO are produced but as the repressor protein degrades or is cleaved by recA protease, the rate of production of C1 repressor approaches zero due to the inhibitory effects of the CRO protein on OR3.
Modeling Done Since the Regional Jamboree
A paper found on the effect of ionizing radiation on D. Radiodurans called A Model of Interactions Between Radiation-induced Oxidative Stress, Protein and DNA Damage in Deinococcus Radiodurans by Igor Shuryak and David J. Brenner was used to model the relationship between double strand breaks and intensity of ionizing radiation.  A value of 200 Gy was chosen for the radiation intensity as that seems to be a slightly less than lethal dose for E. Coli.  Modifications were made to the parameters in the model due to the increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation of Escherichia Coli.
At a constant dose rate the equilibrium number of double strand breaks can be calculated.  This can then be applied to the number of single strand breaks that occur and then to the rate of activation of RecA, which is yet to be done.

Biobrick design
Our goal is to produce a new bio-repellent of insects, PANTIDE, which is successfully an alternative for chemical pesticide. We strive to express PANTIDE that can be used to reduce appetite of the major pests in the farmland. So far, we have already designed two types of BioBricks that three spider toxic peptides are included with and without lectin respectively. We can then do several experiments to test the function of BioBricks and prove that PANTIDE truly works.
We submitted a collection of spider toxins, lectin, and GS linker as basic parts, and the composite parts with T7 promoter and RBS. All in all we have provided twelve new BioBricks to the Registry in total this year. All BioBricks were sequence-confirmed. Our parts are presented in table view at our Registry summary page.(table 1)

First, we wanted to know how methanol in the medium affects the growth of E. coli in general. Therefore, we cultivated a BL21 Gold (DE3) strain with an empty pSB1KRDP backbone without and with different methanol concentrations on M9 medium . As expected, high concentrations of methanol in the medium clearly decelerate the growth of the organisms.

Error bars indicate standart error of linear regression trough averages of log(backscatter); n=4; 750 µl cultivation in BioLector for 23 h at 37°C with 900 rpm
Next, we wanted to test the overall growth performance of our polycistronic plasmid in BL21 Gold (DE3). In this experiment, a strain with the polycistronic construct, the Mdh expression plasmid and a control were grown on M9 medium. The best growth could be detected for the strain with the four genes in a polycistronic frame. This findings surprised us because the burden of expressing the four genes should inhibit growth in comparison to strains with less additional overexpressed genes. In later attempts, this results could not be reproduced and the strain with the polycistronic version of the methanol conversion genes grew worst compared to the others.
Comparison of polycistronic plasmid in pSB1KRDP, mdh in pSB1A30 and control on M9 medium without methanol
All strains are BL21 Gold (DE3). The control carries an empty pSB1KRDP backbone; cultivation of 750 µl cell suspension in BioLector for 23 h at 37°C with 900 rpm; n=4
Subsequently, we were able to show that the lag phase of a strain with our polycistronic construct can be much shorter compared to a strain with the Mdh expression plasmid and a control with an empty pSB1KRDP backbone when it is grown on M9 medium with 1.6 M methanol. This amount of methanol equals 6.48 percent per volume of the fermentation broth. The polycistronic strain is the only one that grows at all on on this methanol concentration that actually is the highest concentration where we ever observed any growth.

Caltech,2008,Team:Caltech#Project#Phage Pathogen Defense_-_-_TEXT.html,"csA induction in both the off-state as well as the induced state. Phage concentration was reduced by more than 1.5x106 pfu/mL in both control and induced states (Figure 5, Columns 4 and 5). In Figure 5, for the construct expressing cI, there is an 8 fold increase in phage concentration between induced and uninduced states, more than double the dynamic range of the construct without cI expression.
Conclusion
We have successfully developed a model system in which a bacteriophage can be integrated as a lysogen within an E. coli host that is not able to be infected by that phage. We successfully demonstrated this model with bacteriophage λ and the JW3996-1 strain of E. coli which is immune to λ infection. A system for inducing the release of phage was constructed around the E. coli regulatory protein RcsA.  Work was done to optimize a switch using an AHL inducible promoter for rcsA induction. RcsA overexpression led to significant phage induction, producing approximately 1x108 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL. This value is 4 orders of magnitude greater than the phage induction reported by Rozanov et al. However, direct comparisons cannot be readily made between the data, because the method of overexpression of rcsA differs between the two papers, and the level at which rcsA was overexpressed in Rozanov’s study is unknown. The background phage concentration in uninduced lysogens was also much higher than reported in literature [7]. At present, there is no clear cause for this increase in basal induction levels within the λ lysogens. Phage induction via rcsA can be reduced through lambda repressor overexpression. The mechanism by which RcsA activates the lytic cycle of the dormant prophage is largely unknown; however, there is evidence that RscA acts through inactivation of the phage repressor, cI [7]. Therefore, increased production of the repressor cI led to a decrease in rcsA mediated phage induction. The addition of constitutively active cI repressor led to the construction of an rcsA phage induction system with a high dynamic range and relatively low background.
Future work should be focused on broadening the host range of the system. Thus, a key aspect needs to be adapting other temperate phages to the model system. A significant extension of the results presented here would be the incorporation and production of a non-E. coli bacteriophage by E. coli"
Kyoto,2016,Team:Kyoto#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," 12A2 in its HBGA binding site has been demonstrated previously [18]. The scFv used in our research derives from antibody 12A2, so it also sterically blocks the binding of NoV to HBGA in theory, it might neutralize NoV using the same mechanism employed by human immune system. If we can show that our Noro-catcher does indeed neutralize NoV infectivity, we will shed a new light on the underdeveloped field of NoV therapeutics.
Also, as our Noro-catcher is essentially NoV-capturing E. coli, we can cheaply mass produce them. This means that Noro-catcher can contribute to NoV therapeutics on the economical side as well. For example, the monoclonal antibodies for NoV GII.4 strains generally costs USD600~USD1000 per milliliter. Our E. coli surface expressing scFv can theoretically be multiplied and be used without limitation and with negligible costs. This may be the more economical alternative to studying antigen-antibody interactions.
4-4 Possibility of further application of our surface expression system
Our INPNC-His surface expressing system can be applied to other virus researches by interchanging the variable fragment part of scFv domains to other virus antibodies. Other applications include, but are not limited to: switching scFv domain to heavy metal binding proteins to create a bioremediation device that removes harmful metals from the environment; switching scFv domain to neutral lipid binding proteins to remove excess fat from human bodies; and so on. With our INPNC-His module, it isn't possible to just surface display passenger proteins, but also to easily identify its expression through His tag Western blotting. As such, we have also contributed to further research on bacterial surface expression systems.
Note
[*1] This summer, a team of scientists reported a way to incubate NoV using human stem cells, and studies on NoV from these fields are also expected to progress rapidly. [*2] The oligosaccharides on the surface of enteric commensal bacteria are HBGA-like substances [17]. [*3] In general, purification and characterization of proteins require it to be soluble. Insoluble samples need to be denatured and solubilized to be handled, but proteins would completely lose its characteristics and functions, disabling purification. However, His tag's unique ability to retain its property to bind to nickel after denaturing means it can exceptionally be purified even when in insoluble sample. [*4] It is iGEM"

Protocol de-bugging
For the threshold device project, we need to amplify pSB3K3 as a low-copy number plasmid vector in order to transfer the activator constructs into low copy number plasmid.  We tried 4 different PCR reaction mixtures, and used a Zymogen PCR wash kit before running them on an 0.8% Agarose E-gel.  After looking at the gel, the ladder was quite smeared and no PCR product was visible.  It was found that the samples run on the gel had a very low DNA concentration.  However, some PCR solution was left before the wash kit was used, and using the Nano-Drop it was determined that it had a high concentration of DNA, so the PCR worked, we just need to refine the protocols after PCR.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is that our survey is based on social networks and this certain population of people is more likely to have chances to use the social network and answer the questions. Besides, it can also be considered as people with these characteristics are more interested in allergy and allergen testing.
Popularity of Allergen Testing
In the questionnaire, we designed a question used to investigate the allergy frequency of people. The answer '1' means respondents are never allergy while '5' means they face allergy issues all the time. From the charts, it is clear that people never allergy only make of 30% while who frequently allergy occupied over 12.2%. People who have ever get allergy take up a majority parts of sample, which indicates that the snowball sampling is worked and help us to target to the expect population.
However, the result of another question that 'Would you seek medical advice for allergy' is a bit negative. Only half of the respondents will seek medical help even if they are allergic, which means that they probably have not attached adequate importance to allergy.
Meanwhile, the patients who choose to take an allergen testing occupy only a quarter. It is a hint that the allergy testing is not as popular as we think in China.
Views On Allergen Testing
In this part of the investigation, we mainly focus on what kinds of the allergen testing methods are popular and how respondents think about it.
The first result is about the popularity of various allergen testing methods. From the bar chart, it is obvious that the skin test is absolutely the mainstream, which is known by almost 90 percent of respondents. The detection of food intolerance is also popular as food intolerance often happens in China.
Skin test is known by most people.
Besides, as the recall of respondents who have ever done an allergy testing, the allergy test they take are mostly skin test. In addition, it is noticeable that approximate 15% of respondents do not know the allergy testing method they experienced, which implies us that the popularity of allergen testing may not be done well even in hospital.
Skin test is the most popular method.
Another fact that we are interested in is the price of allergy testing, so we designed a question that ask for expect price as respondent's wish. And about 83% of respondents choose the answer that the price of it should be under 300 RMB, which is equal to approximate 45 US dollar. As we know, the expectation price in hospital is far higher than this.
Most people expect lower price.
And we also collect views of the public on the popularity of allergen testing and the privacy of personal allergen information."

Thus, we used control variables               of 3 hours and [AHL] = 1.00E-05 M as an optimum level of induction.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"? We thus researched this issue and consulted several experts on the topic.
In principle, we do not think that the risk of infiltration is high, as ‘our’ E. coli bacteria secrete toxins. This                             does not make the material an attractive environment for foreign bacteria, or at least the targeted ones. Once we                             will have incorporated a broad spectrum of toxins to be secreted on demand, the risk of infiltration by malignant                             bacteria will be minimal.
What remains, is the risk of non-targeted bacteria infiltrating the gel. Think of benign bacteria present on our                             skin, which will be attracted by the nutrient-rich environment of the gel. Although this will not pose a                             safety-hazard, it would be problematic when they outcompete E. coli and consume the nutrients. It is, however,                             more likely that E. coli remain the dominant species, as they are present in large amounts.  As foreign bacteria                             lack the binding affinity for Dextran that our E. coli have, this will only happen when the gel forms a                             sufficiently attractive environment and when they can live together symbiotically with E. coli. This is not                             necessarily a bad thing, such as in the case of mutualism or commensalism. Whether this happens, will need                             to be tested experimentally. In case it happens, we researched some preventive measures.
Changing the plaster
A simple measure may be frequent replacement of the plaster. This would ensure fresh nutrients and fresh E. coli bacteria. A disadvantage of this is inconvenience for the patient, which was highlighted by doctors from the Maasstad Hospital. Clinical studies will need to show the optimal treatment duration and replacement frequency.
Quorum Sensing
Bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate activities on a larger scale. This is mostly intraspecies but the molecule AI-2 (Autoinducer 2) has been suggested to be a universal quorum sensing molecule, allowing inter-species communication. Production of this molecule has been found in a wide range of both gram-positive and gram-negative species, by means of the protein LuxS (11) . By implementing a luxS knockout in our own bacteria, combined with an AI-sensing gene we can induce production of bactericides upon invasion of unwanted bacteria into our living material. A similar mechanism has also been attempted by NTU-Singapore 2008 iGEM team .

Tumbling Length Distribution. The distribution is approximately exponential with a mean value of 0.14s and a standard deviation of 0.12s.
Distribution of the absolute angle change during one directed movement phase. The distribution is approximately χ-distributed with mean 20.5° and standard deviation 20.1°.
Distribution of the absolute angle change between two directed movement phases. The distribution has similar properties as the one experimentally observed in [1] . Its mean value is 62.3° and its standard deviation 47.0°.
Variations in input bias
Furthermore, we simulated the spatial behavior of a single E. coli cell under the influence of different input bias values. For a more realistic simulation of the bacterial movement process, the input bias was obtained directly from the combined molecular model linking the chemotaxis pathway and the light switch . As the combined model offered us many design alternatives for performing simulations, we decided on a fixed molecular template, to ease the comparison of results.
The chosen molecular template for simulating the movement model was the following:
molecular model chosen: Spiro et al. [3]
controlled Che species: CheY
Light coupling: CheY-PIF3 & PhyB-Anchor
Each row of the subplots table presented below represents a different input bias value for the movement model, obtained as a result of different input protein concentrations for the combined molecular model. Each column represent a different simulation length (100 seconds, 500 seconds and 3000 seconds).
The input protein concentrations used, together with the corresponding obtained steady-state bias were the following:
All the simulations were run without the existence of any controller algorithm, therefore reproducing the random chemotaxis walk.
Please note the different spatial ranges when comparing the plots, increasing both with increasing simulation time length (the bacterium travels a longer distance in a longer time period) and with increasing bias value (the probability of choosing the directed movement state increases, therefore, on average, the cell travels a longer distance).
Bacterial random walk for different input bias values and different simulation times The plots were generated under different initial conditions of the molecular model, resulting in different values for the input bias. As seen by analyzing the plots row-wise, an increasing bias value leads to increasing directed movement periods. The culminating point is a bias value of 0.99, equivalent to almost continuous directed movements. Also to be noted is the gradual smoothing of direction changes between directed movement states, with increasing bias value. The effect of the simulation time can be seen by analyzing the"

Gifu,2017,Team:Gifu#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". H-an stands for HXT3 promoter and antisense-GFP. Since yeast is eukaryotes, the amount of GC is really low. Thus we cloned terminators by PCR from genomic DNA.
Performing biobricks, we constructed two composite parts. First one is the part which consists of HXT3 promoter and antisense-GFP and RPL15At. Second one is the part which includes ADH1 promoter , kosak sequence, SF-GFP gene and RPL15At. We confirmed the success of transformation by colony PCR and sequencing.
Conclusion
This year our team completed the composite parts of ADH1p-kozak sequence-SF-GFP-RPL15At and HXT3p-antisense-SF-GFP-RPL15At.
Discussion
Gap-repair cloning
22 bp(prefix and suffix) of homologous recombination region may not be enough to perform plasmid construction effectively. According to this research , Gap-repair cloning is basically stable and efficient. An alternative idea of the cloning method for iGEM should be developed soon.
Strain for this experiment
The reason why our team selected S. cerevisiaeW303 this year is that S. cerevisiae S288C is not able to grow on Gly-GluN media and the assay of this strain would be difficult. We thought degradation of glycerol is one of the causes of this phenomenon. In this case, W303 is more appropriate compared with S288C.
Terminators
As mentioned above, terminators of yeast contain less than 50% of GC. The ratio of GC affects on stability of DNA alignment. Thus terminators must be cloned from genomic DNA of yeast, not depending on DNA synthesis service. This matter may make it complicated to conduct researches of yeast in this competition. Also, each terminator has its own function. In iGEM catalog, just a few terminators are registered currently. Analysis and submission of terminators of yeast should be conducted more next year.
Future work
One of our purposes of the project is detection of the causative bacteria of Hiochi. To detect lactic acid, we can use HPLC which is a more precise way. But if we apply our parts or system into wild type and association selected yeast for making sake, we expect to get some features of sake making microorganisms such as interaction between yeast and lactobacillus in sake. This means we can confirm ancient Japanese sake breweries select microorganisms which has some special characteristics. Sadly, we could not assay our parts this year, but we would like to"

Overview
Background
Synthetic biology has come a long way already and the following step into the complex system engineering will be a big one. Yet, the next generation biosystems are still locked away by our insufficient knowledge regarding biological parts. First of all, the immense amount of parts we currently have are poorly characterized, especially the interactions between them. Moreover, artificial intelligence aided development of synthetic parts with novel functions is hindered by the lack of sequence to function relationship data.
By all means - characterization is not an easy task, as even a small protein has more possible sequence variants than there are atoms in the known universe. For this reason, the characterization speed is as important as measurement precision. The current state of the art characterization techniques - mainly based on microplates and microfluidics - do not have capabilities to effectively assess the sequence and activity relationships for a large number of biomolecules. And that is understandable, as those systems were built for direct evolution, providing a way to assess the activity and sequence of a few best variants.
Therefore, we believe there is a strong need for a step in a different direction - an approach that would enable the ultra-high throughput sequence and activity space exploration.
What is CAT-Seq?
CAT-Seq stands for Catalytic Activity Sequencing - a system designed and built for high-speed, simultaneous characterization of Catalytic and Regulatory biological parts. The best way to explain what CAT-Seq can do, is to show how it works.
A library of uncharacterized catalytic biomolecules is swiftly encapsulated into small water droplets together with Recording Module .
Inside of the droplet, the biomolecules are produced. Each droplet contains a unique biomolecule library member. Then, the Recording Module assesses the biomolecule’s catalytic activity and records that information into the DNA molecule which encoded that specific biomolecule.
The activity information recorded in each unique DNA molecule, together with its sequence, can be read using Nanopore Sequencing.
In this way"

Cultured cells stained with mitotracker after nanotubule induction and stabilization were then placed under microscope for observation. As it can been seen in this figure, mitochondria could travel from one cell to another via nanotube, demonstrating the property of material transportation of these induced nanotubes. Moreover, Ca2+ dye loading and two-photon Ca2+ imaging further confirmed the communication via Ca2+ flow between two connected cells.
4. Recovery after harsh-environment-simulation induction(HES induction) with further culturing and observation.
Figure4: Cellular structural changes after prolonged harsh-environment-simulation induction and recovery. (A)Cellular structural changes after five days of HES induction. Multiple nanotubes were formed during induction, resulting in a more intimate connection between distant cells. (B)Hela cells recovered in normal culture medium after HES induction. A Hela cell with unique outlook were recorded. These cells were not rare among the recovery dish. Each cluster of Hela cells had an average of one to two of these cells, stretching out their long and wide nanotubes, connecting neighboring cells. Scale bars: A:50μm; B: 10μm.
When the harsh-environmental simulation induction prolonged, cells with nanotubes underwent more radical changes in their cellular structures. After 5 days’ induction, most living cells tended to distribute most of their plasma into wide and elongated nanotubes, resulting in an octopus-like shape of each single cell and a web-like system among the whole cell colony. After incubating these cells with normal culture media for one to two days, several originally distant cells connected merely by nanotubes moved towards each other and finally clustered together, forming one big syncytium that had interchangeable plasma and organelles via nanotubes. As cells of this syncytium divided, its state remained as the newborns, with nanotube-linked neighboring cells as well. Further Ca2+ dye loading and two-photon Ca2+ imaging demonstrated a synchronization of Ca2+ flow among each individual within this syncytium( see the video below).

Histidine-tagged Wild-Type Staphylococcus Aureus CRISPR Associated Protein 9 (saCas9)
saCas9 is a RNA guided endonuclease that has proven to be an incredibly viable genome editing tool. Compared to the more generally used streptococcus pyogenes cas9 (spCas9), saCas9 is roughly 40 kDa smaller and only sacrifices slight levels of efficiencies. The construct includes the wild type sequence of saCas9 codon optimized for Escherichia coli. Furthermore, saCas9 has a his6 tag fused to the N-terminus of the protein, which can be utilized for protein purification.

This construct includes a mRFP gene with a constitutive promoter (BBa_J04450) upstream of the BBa_J23119-template-sgRNA scaffolding device. The template sequence is 20 bp region flanked by BsaI at the 5’ and 3’ ends. These BsaI restriction sites allow for one to insert 20 bp guide sequences in place of the template via Golden Gate Assembly. These guide sequences will then be constitutively expressed and will guide saCas9 to target specified sequences.
BBa_K2019002 :
gRNA Guide Sequence with Constitutively Expressed mRFP
In the presence of saCas9, the constitutively expressed gRNA guide sequence will direct saCas9 to cut the mRFP protein, causing the cell line to lose its red fluorescence. Two overlapping primers were designed in order to insert a 20 bp guide sequence into the gRNA template construct (BBa_K2019001) via Golden Gate assembly. The guide sequence targets the 130-150bp region of the mRFP gene and has an on-target score of 74.9 and off-target score of 99.1 according to Benchling.

We achieved incredible things during this intense time - iGEM gave us an aim to work towards to, but we are only at the beginning of our journey.
As we are the first iGEM Team from the Berlin Charité University hospital, we started with no infrastructure at all - a great challenge and opportunity at the same time.
Special thanks & attributions go to:
Prof. Schülke, our primary PI, and his lab at the NeuroCure Clinical Research Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin.  Thank you for your patience and giving us the opportunity to to carry out this project in your lab. We greatly appreciate your help in the analysis of the tapeworm transcriptome data and writing applications for grants and for the Institutional Review Board. Without your continuous support in administrative challenges and constructive scientific feedback, our progress would not have been possible. We hope to continue the project with you and would be happy to steer the development process towards a spin out company.
Prof. Kramer, our secondary PI and his working group located on the same floor as the Schuelke Lab. Thank for the fruitful discussions on immobilization of cell free expression systems on membranes. Furthermore we want to thank his group for their patience when sharing a kitchen with our team and for helping us out with cells and reagents we borrowed from time to time.
Prof. Volk for his help in preparing discussions with other institute leaders and for critical review of our progress. We hope to continuously rely on your support in the future challenges in realizing our diagnostic platform.
Furthermore we want to thank Florian Uhlitz for allowing us to use his RNA analysis pipeline for target discovery and Marjan Faizi for helping us with the evaluation of potential sensor sequences.
We want to thank Jakub Bartoszewicz and Melania Nowicka for introducing Jonathan to NUPACK and writing his first script with him.

LIGHT TO COLOR
Figure 1. The RGB system composed of four subsystems(sensor array, circuits, resource allocator and actuators) is shown.
Video 1. We explained the RGB system using dominoes.
We introduced the RGB system[1] to stain our rose using light. The RGB system mainly consists of four modules: a ‘sensor array’, ‘circuits’, a ‘resource allocator’ and ‘actuators’.
The ‘sensor array’ combines 3 light sensors, Cph8*(BBa_K2598006), YF1 (BBa_K2598009) and CcasR (BBa_K2598005), which can respond to lights of different wavelengths. CcaSR can sense and be switched on by green (535nm) light. Cph8* is switched off by red (650nm) light, while YF1 is switched off by blue (470nm) light. Cph8* and CcaSR are based on phytochromes in the phycocyanobilin chromophores, which are produced by pcyA and ho1(BBa_K2598018)[3], while YF1 is based on Flavin mononucleotide(FMN) chronmophore.
.
To activate gene expression, the signals from the red- and blue- light sensors need to be inverted, which is done by connecting them to NOT gates in ‘circuits’. The repressor CI turns off the promoter(P) of K1F, and red light can release the inhibition effect and induce the P promoter. Respectively, the repressor PhlF turns off the"

The absorbance maximums for the pink and green mutants were also shifted as expected, to 576nm and 609nm respectively (Figure 5). When standardised for protein concentration, the peaks for the pink and green mutants were not as high as for blue or purple (Figure 5), indicating that the chromoprotein colour is not as strong.
Figure 5. Spectrum scan of the extracted protein from the different coloured amilCP mutants. Protein concentration is equal between all samples.
The spectrums were then adjusted mathematically to have the same peak absorbance of 1 (Figure 6). This revealed that the purple and pink mutants have spectrums similar to the wild type, however, the green mutant had a second peak at about 314nm (Figure 6). This is out of the visible spectrum, and likely just due to contamination of the sample by cell membranes. The main peak at 609nm accounts for the green colour, since 609nm is within the red part of the spectrum and so would lead to the sample being seen as green.

We explained them what was Synthetic Biology, and tried to show them the « iGEM spirit »! A lot of students were interested, and we got tons of interesting questions, regarding Synthetic Biology, our respective projects or even the competition in general!
Our teams had very diffferent projects, yet we all shared the same passion and the same desire to succeed. We had a lot of fun with them and are hoping to see faces from Jussieu again, as 2017 iGEMers!
iGEM EPFL and iGEMnews
During late August, we were contacted by the iGEM EPFL team: they were working on an independant iGEM news site, called iGEMnews . As part of this project, they asked us to Skype them, and so we did! We were interviewed by two of their team members, and had an amazing time with them. An article about our team and project is published on their webpage, and it was for us an occasion to meet even more people! Here is a link to the article .
Measurements with iGEM Bettencourt
During our work with CelloCad , we had to perform fluorescence measurements through a flux cytometer, a machine our lab is not equipped with. However, the iGEM Bettencourt team gave us access to their lab, so we were able to come, see them, and perform our measurements using their equipment!
Surveys
We happened to fill out a wide number of surveys for various teams throughout the year. We tried to help all the teams as much as we could! Though we did not get this from every team, we thank the iGEM Paris-Saclay and the iGEM Pasteur teams for sending us a Collaboration Badge in return!

We are especially grateful to our numerous sponsors on gofundme,  who supported our project and made it possible.
Every public donor, who helped us to achieve our goals got a special place on our bacterial wall of fame and a handdrawn microbe to show our appreciation. A link to that wall can be found here:
Bacterial Wall of Fame
Experiments
All experiments were performed using the Method Collection ""Methods in Molecular Biology of Bacteria"" provided by the Department of General Microbiology , University of Göttingen. The method collection is based on methods that have been collected and optimized during the past years by the students and supervisors of the Department of General Microbiology. The methods are suitable to engineer bacteria like Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The book also contains protocols for the purification and characterization of proteins.   If you are interested in purchasing the whole method collection you can contact us! Hopefully, it will be soon available at Amazon .
High-throughput cultivation of bacteria
For growth experiments with the Synergy MX II multi-well plate reader (Biotek) prepare pre- cultures and grow them over night at 28°C. Next day dilute these cultures (for instance 1:100, 1:500 and 1:1,000) in 1 - 5 ml of the same medium that will be later on used for recording growth curves and incubate them at 37°C (or other temperatures) and 220 rpm. At an OD600 of about 0.2 – 0.5 use the cultures to inoculate a 96 well microtitre plate that has been supplemented with 100 µl medium per well. The outermost wells of the microtitre plate should contain 150 µl of distilled water to avoid that medium"

iGEM Toolkits: Gibson Assembly
and Magnetosomes
We designed and constructed a modular alkane production BioBrick, the PetroBrick, to generate alkanes, the main constituent of diesel.  By expressing this BioBrick in E. coli, we were able to produce alkanes of yields over 100 mg/mL.
Gluten intolerance stems from an inappropriate immune response to PQLP, the most common motif in the immunogenic peptide.  We reengineered a protease, active at low pH, for strongly enhanced activity against PQLP.
We built two iGEM toolkits. The first is a set of five BioBrick vectors optimized for Gibson assembly. The second is a set of genes essential for magnetosome formation characterized in E. coli.

Figure 5., below, displays a simple set-up of lab-on-a-disc device.
Figure 5. Illustration of lab-on-a-chip concept for screening the MAGE products.
The use of the disc for observing cell lysis is very easy (Figure 5.). According to methods used in BluSense Diagnostics, it consists of a few steps. First, loading the bacterial supernatant and blood volume to specific inlets (Figure 6). When the disc starts to rotate, the bacterial supernatant is moved to the mixing/detection chamber where a certain volume of the blood sample is measured out and then moved (with the next rotation) to a mixing chamber, where it is mixed with bacterial supernatant (Figure 7.A). Subsequently, the disc stops rotating, before again beginning to accelerate and decelerate for a certain time period to mix the fluid (Figure 7.B). The disc stops and after a certain time period, the blood cells can be analysed by UV-Vis as described earlier to determine, if the sample contains cytotoxic antibiotics.

Pictures provided by BluSense Diagnostics.
Further investigation is still required to determine: sensitivity the test, the interaction between bacterial supernatant-red blood cells, the most efficient method of extraction of NRPs for screening, and optimization parameters for mixing and microflow within the disc. However, it is very likely that this design would be an applicable screening method for MAGE.

Week 7
TUESDAY, JULY 5
Returning from holiday, the team worked into the week with a couple of collaborative Skype calls. The first, Northwestern University, was in regard to co-hosting the iGEM North American Conference next summer. They are excited about the project and are looking into Chicago-area venues as the Purdue team investigates Indianapolis as a potential host city. Denny Luan, a founder of Experiment, the crowdfunding website utilized to raise money for lab supplies, spoke with the team on the day’s second call. An indication of Denny’s personality is given by the title of his groundbreaking study, “Qualitative survey of burritos in San Francisco.” He offered to assist with the iGEM wiki database, which is hugely exciting. Thank you for your enthusiasm, Denny!
WEDNESDAY, JULY 6
Mid-week lab work consisted of transformations (ppgk was successful), PCR amplification, and gels. A reporter from local WLFI 18 TV news visited the lab, as well, and the story, related to Florida’s algal blooms, aired on the nightly news. Checked out the previous post for the link.
THURSDAY, JULY 7
The team attended a presentation by Dr. Kevin King entitled “Production Agriculture and Environmental Targets: Can They Coexist?” He highlighted edge-of-field research aimed at quantifying the impacts of agricultural production practices and discussed potential management practices that might be used to reduce offsite nutrient transport, meeting established water quality targets. Additionally, the team is excited to announce that their submission for a SYNENERGENE Grant-Funded Collaboration proposal was selected! Collaboration with the Rathenau Institute will begin shortly.

Pitt,2014,Team:Pitt#Protocol Design#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"Trials
For each trial, the desired P. acnes strain was grown up in approximately 30 mL of A media until attaining an optical density (OD) of at least 0.5. Once at this OD, a specified concentration of glycine was added for a day, then competent cells were made.
The procedure for making competent cells first involved cleaning the bacteria by centrifuging with 10% glycerol buffer. The bacteria was then soaked in 15% glycerol buffer with varying concentration of lysozyme for 2 hours, then was washed again and frozen with dry ice in 50 uL aliquots of 10% glycerol buffer.
Before electroporation, the competent cells were thawed and a specified amount of our desired plasmid (pBRESP36a) was added. At this time, TypeOne restriction enzyme inhibitor was also added for half of the trials. Electroporation then ensued with a set value of electric field strength, after which the bacteria was recovered.
Recovering the bacteria involved letting it grow overnight in 500 uL of A media, then streaking it on A media plates with erythromycin in it. Because of the pBRESP36a, our bacteria would be erythromycin resistant. After a week of growth on the plates, the colonies of bacteria were counted and validated.

Validating the colonies consisted of ensuring that the bacteria on the plate was erythromycin resistant and that it contained the plasmid, and validating that the bacteria was P. acnes.
To check that the bacterial genome contained our target plasmid, several transformed colonies were restreaked on plates containing erythromycin, then a colony PCR was performed.
To ensure that the bacteria was P. acnes and not some form of contamination, a P. acnes phage was used on a plate with top agar that contained the bacteria.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," “Triclosan Free.”  Although triclosan had been removed from products, many of them had simply replaced it with a different antimicrobial.
This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences. What results is a cycle whereby one toxic chemical is replaced by another toxic chemical.
We didn’t want to raise fear over triclosan use and contribute to this cycle. Instead we wanted to raise awareness around appropriate chemical use and reduce the use of chemicals in cases where there is no proven benefit.
This lead us to supplementing our triclosan biosensor with an, “antimicrobial footprint app,” to get consumers thinking about whether antimicrobial agents are even warranted in consumer products.
Deliverable:
We designed our app as a heuristic to raise awareness about the unnecessary ubiquity of antimicrobials in consumer products. In the app, the user can click on an “About” tab to learn more about antimicrobials and how to be a responsible consumer.  They can then go on to calculate their “Antimicrobial Footprint.” The user is able to click on antimicrobial containing products that they use, and see how it affects their total footprint. After using the app’s antimicrobial calculator to calculate their footprint, the user can submit their footprint along with their location. On the final page of the app the user is able to see how their footprint compares to the average footprint of other users. The submitted data is used to calculate this average, as well as to create a heat map of antimicrobial usage in the United States. This is another deliverable that users can look at to become more educated consumers.
space space space space
How it Works:
To create the antimicrobial calculator we found data on the levels of triclosan in selected consumer products, given in g triclosan/g products.   We also found data on the daily use rates of consumer products, given in g triclosan/day. By combining this information we were able to calculate the users’ “antimicrobial footprint,” in grams triclosan/day. The app will also give you this metric in grams triclosan/year.

Naturally, we can barely find microorganisms that live in isolated niches, instead, there are full of various material, energy and information communications. In our project, we have been aware that Shewanella can efficiently use lactate as carbon substrate for power production. Therefore, high-yield of lactate seems critical for current generation and also for a reliable interaction between different species. Moreover, flavins mediated EET pathway is able to directly affect the electrons transfer and output, which inspired us to adopt flavins as a factor to achieve information interaction. Based on the research above, we further developed and optimized a co-culture system with three strains of bacterium in the MFC to achieve a more robust and efficient system. Apart from that, we designed a pH sensing and proteolysis system as a practical tool for troubleshooting and an attempt to benefit the future researchers.
Figure 1. The overall relationship of bacteria in our co-culture system.
1 Lactate producing system
Generally material flow, information flow, together with energy flow are key factors to regulate relations among bacterial consortium. Material flow, in particular, known as the most reliable and convenient method, is adopted in our construction. Typically the substances of the flow are often necessary nutrition for bacterial survival such as essential amino acid and carbon sources.
Figure 2. The raletively narrow range of carbon source of Shewanella.
Shewanella oneidensis can generate electricity with a relatively narrow range of carbon substrates, including lactate, acetate, formate, pyruvate and some amino acid.[1] It has been shown that Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 prefers the utilization of lactate as an energy-favorable carbon substrate as lactate-based biomass yield was higher than that for either acetate or pyruvate. Similarly, the lactate-based growth rate was much higher as well.[2] Thus, lactate is the most suitable carbon source and also the key mediator for"

Surveys
Usually, bacterial contamination cannot be recognized with naked eyes and many people may eat unsafe yogurt by mistake. We checked the current detecting methods and found that traditional methods contain many cumbersome steps and cannot be used in daily life. So shall we find an easy and handy approach to detect pathogenic bacteria in yogurt? From April 15th to 20th, 2015, we did an online survey among 640 individuals to identify whether our idea was worthy to proceed.
Our survey contained questions about the common sense regarding yogurt and yogurt spoilage. We intentionally distributed our e-questionnaire among people of different ages and backgrounds. The results for questions that have greatly impacted our project are shown below.
According to the result, yogurt is a common food and good for human health. Most people eat yogurt frequently. So it means a lot to reduce the adverse affect caused by spoiled yogurt.
More than half of the people would determine the yogurt quality by the expiration date which appears to be unreliable when yogurt is stored improperly. The appearance of spoiled yogurt may be indistinguishable from the eatable ones. So there are still hidden risks with food safety.
Yogurt is generally safe for eating within the expiration date if it is stored in cold; otherwise it may spoil prior to that date. We have searched the Internet and have found varieties of news about yogurt spoilage within shelf-life. This appeared to be a frequently happening phenomenon, but many people are not aware of it. 
More than three quarters of people would eat yogurt with very close expiration dates. Moreover, according to our statistical data, 80% would still eat the yogurt just before its expiration, although they realized that yogurt may spoil before the expiration date. 
The results of our investigation convinced us that developing a handy and reliable yogurt detecting approach, or “yogurt guarder” named by us, is indeed necessary. This survey do have a great impact on the initiation of our project, since the feedback informed us an urgent need of this detecting method and gave us faith to continue our project. We  hope that our ideas can also inspire other teams with similar purposes in the future.

Hey alle! Mein Name ist Flash Coli und ich bin als schnellstes Darmbakterium der Welt bekannt. Es gibt viele Gerüchte, wie ich geboren wurde, aber ich kann versichern, dass einige von diesen sind maßlos übertrieben und nicht erfreulich! Diesen Sommer unterstützte ich das Team Göttingen während deren Arbeit für iGEM. Als ein großer Liebhaber des Klonens, Anziehen von Kulturen und BioBrick design bin ich der perfekter Helfer. Also, mein Schnelligkeit ist eine große Hilfe, weil das Labor auf dem ""Faßberg"" aka dem kleinen Bruder des Mount Everests liegt, und die Studenten nur Fahrräder besitzen. Daher kann ich leicht alle möglichen Geräte von den Universitätsgebäuden zu unserem Labor am MPI bringen.
Ich freue mich alle anderen europäischen Teams in Amsterdam zu treffen. Bleibt Coli!

 NEFU_China
We have established a partnership with NEFU_China and reached an agreement of helping examine the effectiveness of carrier. First, they cloned EGFP cDNA from pEGFPN2 vectors using NheI and BamHI. Second, they used EcoRI and NheI to cut pesc-trp plasmid, and then they inserted the EGFP sequence and pFUS1 into pesc-trp plasmid to complete the construction of pFUS1-EGFP carrier.We used EcoRI and BamHI to cut the pFUS1-EGFP carrier, we helped them to verify the correctness of pFUS1-EGFP carrier.
And what we constructed is a plasmid containing GroES gene and GroEL gene. GroES / GroEL belongs to the chaperonin family of molecular chaperones and they can enhance the correct folding efficiency of proteins. NEFU_China was digested with BamH I-Vsp I and Bcu I-Vsp I to verify the validity of the plasmid. Click here to see them: https://2018.igem.org/Team:NEFU_China/Collaborations

We collaborate with BNU-China to optimize the project each other. During our experiment we found that the adhE gene which leads to the production of ethanol is competitive to butanol production in their synthetic pathway. So BNU-China give us their assistance in knocking out the adhE gene with their project. This year they are making effort in applying synthetic biology methods, constructing a novel pathway to screen mutants by giving target strains growth advantages. Therefore, they provides us their technical guidance for crisper cas9 and plasmids we need, as well as helping us design primers.

The ends of the operon are BglII and XhoI digested ends, respectively, which are complementary to the vector plasmid. Thereafter, they performed an enzymatic ligation of the operon with the vector plasmid fragment under the conditions of a "

NTU-Singapore
During this our midsemester break we finally obtained the Cas9 plasmid from NTU-Singapore for our collaboration named Wt (wild type), 459 (mutant Cas9) and 462 (mutant Cas9). We then transformed these plasmids into DH5a E. coli cells. Following a standard transformation, we then cultured colonies.
After culturing the OD was checked, the 100ul of each type Wt, 459 and 662 was put in 2000ml of LB media and left at 20C to incubate for 24 hours.
Following this the cells were pelleted and the lysate loaded onto a IMAC column.

** A PCR takes 20-30 seconds to extend a sequence by 1kb, and since our longest sequence is ~2kb the extension time was determined to be 60s per cycle.
Gel Electrophoresis of PCR-Amplified gBlocks
An agarose gel was prepared according to the agarose prepartion protocol.

PCR Results
The 7 bands corresponding to expected DNA sizes were excised using a razor blade for cleaning and extraction. The other sequences, along with J which only showed a very weak band, will be re-PCRed under modified conditions at a later date.
The excised gel chunks were transferred to centrifugation tubes.
Extraction of DNA (PCR product) from Agarose Gel
The extraction was performed using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit made by Omega Biotek, according to the Spin Protocol.
The excised agarose chunks needed to be dissolved in a minimum of 1mL of XP2 Binding Buffer per gram of gel. The heaviest chunk of gel weighed 0.16g and as such 160µl of buffer was added to each tube.

$$ H_n \sim N(EH_n,\sigma_n^2) $$
$$ H_p \sim N(EH_p,\sigma_p^2) $$
Besides, the error of affinity of receptor and receptor amount in per yeast, as system errors, are also considered. From papers, we know that affinity $K$ is probably between $5nM$ to $15nM$, and the receptors in per yeast $R_p$ is probably $10^4$,thus
$$ K \sim N(10,2.5) $$
$$ R_p \sim N(10^4,\sigma_R^2) $$
And we also consider an uniformity error of the system output ($Flo_t$), which is caused by the error of fluorescence detection hardware.
$$ Flo_t \sim N(E(Flo_t),\sigma_f^2) $$
After defining deviations of the system, we simply take follow parameters to testing.
$$ \sigma_n^2=5\%EH_n \; \sigma_p^2=5\%EH_p \; \sigma_R^2=500 \; \sigma_f^2=1\%E(Flo_t) $$
Then, we can use Monte Carlo methods to simulate the negative and positive result. We choose 100000 iterations Gibs Sampling to simulate this system. And the outcome is demonstrated below.
And we can use the ROC to decide the proper threshold that makes the testing most accurate and efficient. The ROC plot is showed below
From the ROC, it is clear that the threshold of the testing should be 8.822 and the AUC that measure the quality of testing is 0.929, which is adequately high.
Risk Analysis
At the final part of the modeling, we are interested in how the errors of input and system influence the testing accuracy. First, we continue to use the definition of error in the previous part,and more specific class the errors into two parts.
Relative system errors
The relative error of the testing system, mainly because of the uncertainty of sensitive parameters and fluorescence detection error of the hardware.
Relative input errors
The relative error of input concentration of histamine, basically because of the operation errors and the natural variance of samples.
And we also use the Monte Carlo method to simulate it and get a heat plot, which gives us hints about how errors in system and input influence the testing quality. In this analysis, we use"

Strategy for the characterization of our BioBricks
As described in the sections enzymes , immobilization tags and synthetic peptides our system consists of several components. The general functionality of most components has already been shown, e.g. ability of the glycosidase NAGA to convert the erythrocytes of the A type to O [1] or the usability of the SNAP-Tag for the immobilizing of proteins [2]. However they have never been used in this context. and we need three events to take place to get a functional system:
Covalent binding of the peptides and the SNAP-substrate to the solid support
Covalent binding of the fusion proteins to the solid support
Efficient conversion of erythrocytes
Consequently we need to verify every single step to ensure that our approach might be successful and identify components which need optimization. Furthermore we can prove the function of the single domains of our fusion proteins independently: The glycosidases on the one hand and the immobilization tags on the other. These will be available as separate BioBricks and can be used in a independently by future teams. In the following we will provide a concept that enables us to answer these questions.
Do our fusion proteins show glycosidase activity (enzyme and substrate in solution)?
First we need to prove that the fusion proteins consisting of glycosidase domain and immobilization-tag are properly folded and show enzyme activity. Therefore we would use soluble polysaccharides mimicking the blood antigens present on the erythrocyte surface. These are commercially available (e.g. by our sponsor Elicityl ). There are several techniques on hand to monitor the cleavage of these substr"

Note that 10-15 are for Test #2.  11 and 13 test competitive binding while the remaining transformations test to ensure that there is no nonspecific binding between the repressors that do not share the same binding domain as the activator and the target site for this binding domain.  This is important seeing as we will have multiple repressors in our system and we would like to characterize the effects of their presence on the functionality of the system.  Thus, we expect the transformations 10, 12, 14, and 15 to emit the same YFP response as a control which contains pRS304* + activator + activable reporter.  This control will be constructed later.
Half of each plate for these transformations had 20 uL while the other half had 100 uL.
