PCR amplified 80uL each of GFP, UV, and HSP.
Purified these with the ones from 6/2/14 as well.
Rinsed and recharged silica wash columns.
On 6/4 and 6/5 while Devora and Shoshana are out, Prof. Medvedik is starting to make the compotent cells, to be completed on 6/6.
6/6/14
Poured plates-2 bottles of kan (20ug/mL) and 1 bottle of amp (100ug/mL).
We used 250 ul of 100 mg/ml stock concentration of Ampicilin and we used 143 ul of 35 mg/mL stock concentration of Kanamycin.
Chlor plate (150ug/mL) that we had tried to transform P3-3H from 2013 BioBrick registry didn't work.
No colonies were seen. A lower chlor concentration (50ug/mL) will be used to see if colonies grow.
Put plates in incubator to be used to transform our ligations.
1 chlor (50ug/mL), 1 chlor (150ug/mL), and 2 amp (100ug/mL).
Put 1 chlor (50ug/mL) plate in incubator to be used to transform the plasmid from the 2013 BioBrick plates P3-3H.
Poured two 0.8% agarose gels.
Inoculated 2.5 mL  (1/2 of the 5 mL we had) of DH5α cells in 125 mL of LB.
We separated it by adding 25 mL of the cell/LB mixture into 5-50 mL conical tubes so that it would fit in the shaker.
We started it in the shaker at 37°C at 10:30 AM when it had an optical density=.078 and let it shake until 12"
Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"orescein, the fluorophore that we were using in the wetlab. This proved harder to accomplish than originally planned.
A first 3D structure was built using Avogadro, an advanced molecular editor and visualiser9, from a 2D model of  AzF-DBCO-fluorescein molecule generated by ChemDraw. Next, the parameters of the molecule were generated using the GAFF force field10 and different modules (antechamber, LeAP, parmchk) of the AMBER biomolecular software suite. The main difficulty here was to incorporate the functionalised AzF residue as a part of the main protein, which involves creating covalent bonds to the neighbouring amino acids.
Here, we needed to align the structure of our AzF residue with that of the phenylalanine near the end of the C-ter linker, remove the phenylalanine then add the AzF with all the correct bonds (and none of the wrong ones).
Biotin is a well known case study of ligand - receptor, so building and parameterizing it was easier to perform. Additionally, this did not require any new bonds in our protein, as the interaction is not covalent. Again, we used the antechamber force field of Amber16 to create the necessary files. Placing it into the correct position in the streptavidin binding site was carried out by aligning our streptavidin domain with the X-ray structure of the streptavidin-biotin complex (PDB: 4JNJ3).
Explicit Solvent Model
To consider the protein as it behaves in its environment, we decided to simulate our platform explicitly in its solvent. This means adding a great number of water molecules around it, using the TIP3P model, and calculating values for all of these new interactions, instead of simply simulating the general physical and chemical conditions of the solvent. Due to the great flexibility of our linkers, we needed to generate the box large enough to accommodate the full length of our Cerberus protein when these linkers are fully stretched out. We therefore left a minimum distance of 20 Å around our protein when generating the water box to contain it, in the shape of a truncated octahedron.
In total, this amounted to over 40,000 water molecules in our model, and in total 127,995 atoms with the protein. Incorporating this number of new atoms into our model meant adding millions, maybe even billions of new interactions.
The equilibration phase decreases the temperature of the protein and its solvent to allow it to"

By dosing that second substance it could be determined when the yeast starts killing itself and hence the final alcohol level.
Seismo detecting bacteria(sound detecting bacteria) Mechanical pressure sensitive bacteria. Two ideas: colony sensing bacteria, if most of them die in a certain area the pressure must be great. This can be done by having all bacteria release a simple chemical, if concentration drops beyond a certain threshold trigger a signal. Other idea, completely different scale: use the fact that bacteria can change shape (to some extend). Position a specific receptor on the outer membrane, position a donor at a known distance from the receptor. This creates an auto-receptive system with known concentrations (taking into account diffusion) in the loop. If the distance between the receptor and the donor changes (due to changes in the bacteria shape) the concentration changes which can be used in a cascade towards other signals. Effectively creating a mechanical pressure sensor.
Miscellaneous, Fun
Synthetic communities Synthetically design an microbial consortium of different types of bacteria that have facilitating or symbiotic interactions with one another, creating a communities that sustains itself.
Bacterial lamp There are these bacteria found on fish that have luminescence. During a practical course some people had to acquire a pure culture of this bacterium from fish bought at the market. There was something about that if you put a culture of these bacteria in a large tube and flip it upside down (thus making oxygen bubbles) making the bacteria illuminate. Maybe we could make this into some kind of biological lamplight.
Bacteria changing the taste of yogurt Bacteria that can change the taste of yoghurt (over a period of time) so that you don't know which taste that yoghurt has at the moment. Or that the bacteria change it per period of the the day, so that you have ""breakfast"" yoghurt in the morning and ""dessert"" yoghurt in the evening
Smelling (coffee) bacteria responsive to circadian rythm Cells which react to a long period of darkness (night) followed by light (the sensors for light exist so this should be possible) produce either smell of coffee or caffeine (your blanket as a biofilm so you absorbe it) to assure a gentle awakening

Chrome Q
Laboratories often require plate readers to detect biological samples in a standardized environment which can be prohibitive to field work. Lambert iGEM offers a low-cost, portable substitute for standard plate readers which are expensive, immobile, and require an electrical power source. The QSystem, comprised of the Color Q app and the Chrome Q device, pinpoints relative color values by using the red, green, blue (RGB) system. A photo of the samples is taken by Color Q and circle detection is used to obtain RGB values. The 2018 Lambert iGEM team improved upon the 2017 design by removing individually-wired LEDs which previously altered the RGB values, skewing relative color value results. The modified base allows for more sample testing and an option for a positive/negative control. With the QSystem, we hope to provide a low-cost tool for the expansion and development of modern synthetic biology in developing regions of the world.
The Chrome Q is a 3-D printed dome/base used to quantify the relative color values of various samples by using the red, green, blue (RGB) system of pixels. The Chrome Q device acts as a very frugal but efficient alternative to industrial plate readers and florometers. The 2018 Lambert iGEM team improved upon the 2017 design by removing individually-wired LEDs which previously altered the RGB values, skewing relative color value results. This Chrome Q was found to have more accurate results when used without the presence of artificial light sources; light still enters the dome, because the dome is translucent, but this light has much less variation that a direct light source. In the 2018 Lambert iGEM project, the Chrome Q was used to quantify the relative expression of blue color in varying bacterial samples with T7 Toehold lacZ. Samples are arranged in a 6x6 array in the Chrome Q, with a +/- control, and is paired with the Color Q app to analyze the sample. A picture of the Chrome Q itself and its base are below.

I'm serious as a heart attack
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero.

At the end of the meet, not only did we have an exposure to the projects of the other Indian teams, we also have a fair share of insights into the functioning of our project as well. The interdisciplinary discussions facilitated by the meet turned the experience wholesome. We are happy to have been a part of the initiative."

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Edinburgh_OG,2017,Team:Edinburgh OG#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,". 89% of the audience hadn’t heard of phage therapy and the use of bacteriophages for medical treatment before our presentation. Greater education about bacteriophages and their potential as an antibiotic alternative would allow members of the public to make informed decisions about phages and their uses.
Both before and after the presentation, no one was completely against hospitals using surface cleaning products containing engineered bacteriophages, for the purpose of removing antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Prior to our presentation, 56% of the audience supported this and 44% were unsure. After the presentation, this changed to 84% supporting this and 14% unsure.
Before the presentation, 7% of the audience was against the use of soaps and hand sanitisers containing engineered bacteriophages, for the purpose of removing antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This increased to 9% after our presentation. However, the percentage of the audience who supported this increased from 46% to 75%, while those unsure decreased from 47% to 16%. These results suggested to us that people may be uncomfortable with putting phages on their skin, so phage-based surface cleaning products could be more viable than soaps, and we would need to investigate other means of delivering PhagED.
Overall, 42% of the audience said the presentation had not changed their attitude towards the use of bacteriophage-containing surface cleaning products in hospitals, 2% felt less positive, and 56% felt more positive. We were encouraged by the mostly positive attitudes the group had towards PhagED.

iGEM Northern Meet-up
In June we hosted a meet-up for teams from the northern UK, attended by teams from Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle and Nottingham - as well as us and our undergraduate team of course! In the morning we showed the teams some classic Edinburgh sights like Calton Hill and Edinburgh Castle, before retreating to the university campus for pizza and snacks. After our nutritious lunch, each team gave a presentation about their project, and we really enjoyed hearing everyone’s ideas. The other teams asked us some great questions and we had some really useful discussions about the routes that PhagED could take.

Figure 2. The significance of improving portable pathogen detection.
(Data from A Summary Profile of Pathogen Detection Technologies)
Access to health care system, especially detection of pathogenic microorganism, is required to be improved for the current problematic pathogen surveillance system. Some existing methods for detecting pathogens in food and water control or clinical diagnosis include microorganism culturing for testing specific characteristics of the morphology of the colony and the biochemical functions, mass spectrometry testing for specific proteins, polymerase chain reaction testing for specific DNA sequences. The most traditional method to detect pathogens is culturing, which is sensitive and cost-effective but the test takes days. The testing methods with molecular or biochemical technologies are efficient and fast but the facilities and service are not easily accessible, and the cost is high.
Some specific issues in improving pathogen detection that should be monitored include designing and constructing novel but safe and effective pathogen detection methods, increasing timeliness and convenience of using the new systems for detection, improving the sensitivity and specificity of pathogen detection services, and decreasing the cost of pathogen detection.

2012 Colombia
Ideas of the project
The extensive use of fungicides and pesticides to control field epidemics in Colombia has raised an issue of the poisoning effect to public health. To solve the problem, this team modified a bacteria that can detect pathogen associated molecules, amplifying the signal, and eventually stimulate the hypersensitive response (secretion of salicyclic acid in this project) of the plant to defense infection.
Safety concerns of their project
(1)Biosafety Provisions
General regulations of the University and safety guidelines for laboratory practices were followed. methods and safety precautions are well within the regulations of the Committee. All team members were required to attend safety training.
(2)Safety Considerations: Hazardous reagents and Biohazards
For health risk and personal safety, safety courses were required before the team members enter the lab. Bacteria were sealed completely during culture, and plants were inoculated at isolated greenhouse. Bacterial strains used in their project, Escherichia coli K12 does no harm to human and cannot survive in the environment other than laboratories in the long run. Aliivibrio fischerii is not considered dangerous to humans, either. Ralstonia solanacearum, though pathogenic to plants, were well handled by qualified and experienced personal in flow chamber. They had also included a way for the bacteria to control their own population density using a Toxin-Antitoxin module (TA). As with known toxic chemical reagents and hazardous physical agents were managed according to the guideline, and the members were well-informed about the toxicity of these agents.
For public health, the adverse effect of salicyclic acid and its metabolites were listed, but it may do no harm to human because it would have bactericidal effects before reaching concentration that causes toxicity. Moreover, it is well-controlled by negative feedback.
For environmental qualities, These sequences have been previously characterized. To avoid cloning unknown pathogenicity, they amplified the majority of genes from the start codon to the stop codon, and a Blast was carried out to confirm the results.
Last but not least, they made sure that the circuit is tightly regulated by positive and negative feedbacks, and the production of salicyclic acid is only induced by pathogen associated molecules but no constitutively expressed"

Ellie digested all of the RFP bricks that Chris had re-made, as well as digesting the new dCas9 strategy vector with AscI and SalI overnight at 37oC. RFP brick digests were purified using a PCR cleanup kit, whereas the vector digest was run on a gel and the band at 7656bp was separated from the 261bp insert by gel extraction.
The digested RFP bricks were ligated into 50ng of vector in a 1:3 (vector:insert) ratio using 20ng of insert. Ligations were done using T4 DNA ligase (Promega) at room temperature for 3 hours before dialysis using Millipore filters, and transformation into electrocompetent TOP10. The electroporated cells were recovered at 30oC for 2 hours in SOC before plating on LB + Cm + Em plates and grown at 30oC over a weekend.

The transformations of each RFP brick inside the new dCas9 vector resulted in 100s of colonies per plate, with only 10 on the negative control (backbone only ligation). We picked and screened 5 colonies from each transformations, as well as using the empty plasmid from before digestion as a control in the first lane. Primers used were: cas9_scr_R1 and pCB102_R1 which should give a product of around 1kb if empty, and 1.6kb if the RFP brick had been successfully inserted.
The positive colonies corresponding to the lanes labelled with a red arrow were used to set up overnight cultures in 10ml of LB (+ chloramphenicol and erythromycin). Plasmids were extracted from these cultures and sequenced using cas9_scr_R1 and pCB102_R1. These plasmids will be called the reporter plasmids henceforth when referring to the CRISPRi tests.

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," immobilised in the coating. Such method has a low capital cost, and is very resource efficient.
The paper/acetate: sensing core
By applying this latex nanoporous coating to a cheap, biodegradable, readily available material like paper, or an equivalent cellulose blend, there is scope for various applications. This will be the core technology of all biosensor designs, as the paper can be cut or distributed in many forms. A schematic for this method can be seen below. After GMO cells are grown up, they are mixed with the latex solution and rolled on sheets of paper using a Meyer roller pull-down system. They are then cut into sticker shapes before being coated with adhesive and stuck on produce.
Product design: Consumer Needs
The latex and cell coated paper sensing strips are the core of the final product design. The fundamental strength in this design is the versatility of applications for these strips.
In developing the final biosensor construct, many different things had to be considered. The most influential factor in designing these devices, and the reason for designing multiple devices, was because of feedback from the potential consumers of our product. Experts from Zespri, Avocados Australia, and Fresh Produce Group, all had unique views on how the biotechnology should be manifested into a final design, based on differing needs.
Avocados Australia was optimistic about a sticker design to help consumers select fruit at the ideal stage of ripeness without damaging the fruit through manual handling.
Zespri prefer to control the ripeness of their produce before it hits the shelves of a supermarket, so consumers can purchase fruit of a consistent stage of ripeness and quality. For this reason, Zespri requested a way to monitor ethylene levels in specific shipping crates in an easy and user-friendly way, technology that would eliminate the need to unbag and re-bag thousands of kilos of kiwifruit for the pure purpose of manual inspection.
Fresh Produce Australia implored the importance of manual handling in their section of the processing chain, because it serves the purpose of eliminating bruised or infected pieces of fruit, as well as acting as a ripeness checkpoint. Once fruit has been unpacked from a shipment, it undergoes rigorous quality assurance checks, is ripened to optimal conditions in ethylene ripening rooms, or is stored under refrigeration. The fruit is required to be inspected for size, colour and other physical features as well, all of which cannot be done by technology. For this reason, whilst our technology might be useful for ripeness monitoring, it would not replace the manual handling stage of this process. Instead, FPA suggested that perhaps"

After carefully evaluating potential risks, it was not a priority for us to add kill switches.  However, if we were to scale this project up, we would do so.
Two of our BioBricks lead to the production of the potentially harmful gases nitric oxide and nitrous oxide. In huge quantities those gases pose risk to both human health and the environment. We therefore keep the transformants contained in bioreactors, which will minimize the threat as discussed above. In addition to that the amounts of gas produced during our project is small scale and if we were to take this project to a bigger scale, more severe methods for containment would be devised.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
We reviewed our project with the appropriate biosafety groups and wrote a Workplace Risk Assessment for our project.  No concerns were raised during the review process. All lab work was performed in accordance with local and national guidelines. For details please see the General section above.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
We think that before starting the lab work, every team should plan their lab work according to safety requirements and perform a risk analysis. For instance, a workshop in order to introduce the biosafety guidelines would be helpful for future iGEM teams. Following lab protocols and careful project design are essential.  In order to mitigate any GMO release into the environment, kill switches could be used. A kill switch is a self-destruction mechanism which can work in genetic engineered genes, while they are released in the environment, then they can produce a toxic protein that damages bacterial cell membranes and kills the cells.  Our project did not explore this idea in detail, but if we were to scale up our system for industrial production, then we would want to incorporate a kill switch.

The LabPats began another PCR this time with the exact same backbone and primers as yesterday, except skipping the Digestion step with DpN1 directly after PCR completion. Unfortunately, after a full day of diligently performing the PCR and running the gel, the correct band was still missing from the final gel. The students were visibly upset, but very ready to continue to persist until the desired result was achieved.
Lab 2
To start off the Tuesday, the team viewed their DNA transformation of Chitinase C-1 and to their surprise, no colonies grew.  A plan was made to redo the transformation and redo the DNA assembly. The team then split into the two working groups: Max and Jonah transformed the assembled cinnamaldehyde DNA and performed another round of cinnamaldehyde testing. Travis, Peter, and Chris, as stated earlier, performed the 2nd DNA transformation and assembled for a second time in the hopes of obtaining a higher DNA concentration.  They also started another round of Yarrowia Testing.
Wednesday (07/25/18)
Lab 1
Today the LabPats tried a new PCR method, using gradient temperatures to test and see if the PCR would work and the primers would be able to bind using different temperatures. Unfortunately, it did not work again, and the LabPats decided that there may have been a problem with the primers. They reviewed their suspicions with their mentors and Mike confirmed that they may need new primers.
Lab 2
The RX lab students entered lab with high hopes.  They first viewed the two transformations, one Chitinase C-1 and one Cinnamaldehyde, but both transformations had failed.  Once the students talked with their mentor, Drew, they decided on carry out two plans. The team then split into the two working groups. Max and Jonah decided to clone the bacteria containing the iGEM Backbone Plasmid in order to increase concentrations of the vector so hopefully it will accept the insert. Travis, Peter, and Chris took the 2nd assembled DNA which had a higher concentration and transformed it into 3 cells: NEB 5-Alpha, One Shot Top 10, and One Shot Mach 1, in the hopes that one of the three would produce viable colonies.  They also set up Yarrowia Testing #4 after discovering that Yarrowia Testing #3 once again showed no results.

The LabPats re-completed the Interlab after realizing that they were missing a set of wells from the last time."

Experiment Na+ 0M
Motivation
The working principle of the antiporter Na+/H+ channel described in [Rachel Karpel et al., Etana Padan et al., N. Dover et al.] makes the nhaA promoter a Na+ sensor and only under certain conditions (presence of Na+) a pH sensor.
Methods
We prepared LBK (potassium - 87mM - instead of sodium) and adjusted pH using KOH and HCl to values 5.5, 6.6, 7.5 and 8.5.
We inoculated 8ul of Invitrogen TOP10 containing  into 4ml of LB + Amp and incubated overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm. We did the same for TOP10 with  and  inside.
Next morning we put 50ul from each of the three falcon tubes into 5ml of LBK pH 6.6 and incubated again for about four hours and a half at 37°C, 220 rpm.
We measured the final O.D. with TECAN F200 and diluted each genetic circuit into four falcons with LBK at different pH (5.5 - 6.6 - 7.5 - 8.5) in order to obtain a same O.D. equal to 0,02 (12 falcons overall).
Then we performed a 6 hours' experiment with measures of absorbance and fluorescence every 5 minutes with TECAN F200.
Each value shown is the mean of three measurements and cultures were shaked for 15 seconds every five minutes.
Results

pH 6,6: Fluorescence
pH 7,5: Fluorescence
pH 8,5: Fluorescence
Comments
As you can see from graphs  didn't produce any GFP. After a short transient in which we have some noise you can see that the GFP production rate goes to zero as well as the negative control (). Positive control () has significantly higher production rate. So we can consider it a Na+ sensor and only secondarily a pH sensor.
Experiment Na+ 250mM
Motivation
We’ll try again to make E. coli producing GFP at the variation of pH in presence of Na+.

We prepared falcons of LB NaCl 250mM and adjusted pH using KOH and HCl to values 5.5, 6.6,"

HUST-Cheering! Conference
This year, we successfully held the first “iGEM HUST-Cheering!” conference. After over four months’ preparation, the conference was held on July 8th and 9th. We invited NCTU_FORMOSA, Nanjing-China, HAZU-China, NUDT-China, Jilin_China, ShanghaiTech_ChinaB and WHU-China to the conference. During the two days of conference, we not only kept the traditional forms of presentation and poster session, but also designed fun activities to expand attendees’ understanding and critical thinking of the development of synthetic biology and iGEM. Those activities included free debate about the better research method of synthetic biology, “Quiz King” (synthetic biology Q&A competition), and iGEM life salon.
It is worth mentioning that, before the conference, many attendees were under great pressure of doing experiment and other preparation for the Jamboree. During the conference, this pressure might even be deepened by listening to other teams’ presentations. But those fun activities significantly expelled the worried looks on attendees’ faces. Especially in the final part of iGEM life salon, Professor Chen Wenliang from team NCTU_Formosa shared his idea of “enjoying science”. He reminded us that whether to win a medal or not was not important comparing with whether you had fun in this experience. It was more convincing with a positive attitude and a smile on your face to show the judge that you had benefited a lot from this experience. And with this attitude, it wouldn’t be hard at all to fulfill the project and claim a medal. All the attendees were deeply moved by this idea and the true meaning of iGEM became clear to us. This conference was really a “cheer-up” for us as host and also for all the attendees. It gave us inspirations on changing perspective to our work both inside and outside the lab.
And we mainly explored three questions about iGEM during the conference:

Our heritable, tunable, stochastic switch is novel since the device can be tuned to be biased by altering the amount of invertase protein.
Finally we believe that our aim of controlling stochasticity in the differentiation process to alter the behaviour of soil bacterium is a worthy aim and the idea of packaging cadmium in spores is unique.

Sheffield,2010,Team:Sheffield#20 July 2010_-_-_TEXT.html," but it definitely helped us work up a healthy appetite. Dinner was very tasty and it was good to chat to the teams over lots of food.
Fortunately we didn't have such a long journey up, so we were probably a bit more awake than some of the other teams - enough stamina to last us for a few bars. Again a great opportunity for witty bannter and to have a laugh with other UK iGEMmers. We sadly lost the other teams towards the end of the night and ended up in a very strange place right at the end called Eazy Street. We'll not say what the first thing we saw was as we entered, as we're trying to keep our Wiki quite censored, but feel free to ask at the Jamboree. Definitely a unique experience. We returned at ~4am chatting breeze and looking for vegetarian pot noodles. A silly state, but we had a barrel of laughs. Very impressed with the day - sorry if we woke anyone upon our return!

Overview
Escherichia coli is generally not regarded as an animal because they don't hunt or eat. Thus, the creation of carnivorous E.coli which catches and digests bugs like other animals challenges this notion. Fries are baited, caught and digested, becoming a supplementary ammoniacal source when the media doesn't contain enough gultamine. The project consists of 4 minor projects.

Our Team
We are DTU BioBuilders, the iGEM team of the Technical University of Denmark. We study biotechnolgy, bioinformatics, mathematical modelling, environmental engineering and biomedical engineering. Our team consists of 13 graduates and 3 undergraduates. In addition, we have 3 highschool students assisting us in the lab. Our team members come from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Greece, China and Poland. This year we tackle substrate utilization in cell factories and this is our wiki:
The brainstorm
We tried to identify a project that meets the following criteria:
Identify a local challenge that has a global impact.
To tackle iGEM with a ""Cell Factory Engineering""- perspective
Make a novel contribution to the biobrick registry
The problem: Waste
In Denmark today, less than half the waste produced is recycled, which means that more than 3.5 million tons get burned off each year.
We have abundant waste streams from the industry such as glycerol from biodiesel production, byproducts from rapeseed production, used cooking oil and ordinary household waste.
Cell factories are becoming an increasing factor in the industry today, where different microorganisms are utilized to produce various compounds from therapeutics to food additives. Currently however, the sustainability of these industrial processes is limited by the narrow substrate range of the organisms used. The most common feeds in use are simple carbohydrates such as glucose produced by enzymatic hydrolysis from edible plants such as maize, rice and wheat.
Aim of our project
This project aims to develop the chassis for a versatile and efficient cell factory that can transform abundant waste streams into valuable products using Yarrowia lipolytica and state of the art genetic editing techniques.
Our contribution: a molecular toolbox
The reason why Y. lipolytica has not been implemented in industry yet is the current lack of tools for genetic engineering.
In our project, we develop and test"

Tec-Monterrey
We attended a few lectures organized by our local fellows of Tec-Monterrey. Additionally, we had a friendly biobrick exchange with them. They gently provided us with a couple of BioBricks as our kit arrival was delayed due to customs issues; then we helped them out characterizing  and cloning some of their biobricks that seemed not to be working. We also shared our miniprep protocol that proved to work smoothly.
Freiburg
We shared plasmid pJT122 with team Freiburg, which we obtained directly from Dr. Jeff Tabor. The plasmid contains the genes coding for the red and green light receptors.
WHU-China
We provided team Wuhan with the following plasmids (which we got from Dr. Tabor): pJT122, pJT106, pJT106b, pT116, pJT118, pCph8 and pPLPCB(S). Additionally, the JT2 E. coli strain both, alone and co-transformed with different plasmids was sent. We definitely learned how to ship biological parts internationally.
Wageningen_UR
We shared our cloning strategy with team of Wageningen, as they wanted to feed a software tool they were developing to optimize such work.
Uppsala-Sweden
Team Uppsala joined our iGEM lighters community, as they worked with light induction as we did. We had helpful contact with them and tested the VR primers on the B0015 terminator, as they suspected that could be the source of a PCR trouble they were dealing with.

where $\delta O_i$ is the error in the OD for each well, $f_i$, $g_i$ are the fluorescence measurements from iLOV and Top 10 wells respectively and N, M are the number of wells used.
Due to the striation of the fine-scale results  a previous measurement was used to confirm the peak of fluorescence. This result can be seen in figure 5.
This result was not used originally as measurements where carried out in Lysogeny Broth (LB) which has a higher autofluorescence than the minimal media used previously. The higher autofluorescence of the LB resulted in a masking of the fluorescence topography from the Top 10 wells. This resulted in the Top 10 cells without iLOV sequences reading as having a higher fluorescence than those with the iLOV sequence for certain ares of the experimental space. The fluorescence topography of the iLOV protein is still visible despite this and matches the topography observed in minimal media.
The peak excitation wavelength is 449$\pm$1 nm and the peak emission corresponding to this excitation wavelength is 494$\pm$2nm. The peak has a lower apparent fluorescence than previous measurements, this is due to a lower manual gain on these measurements. The manual gain is the factor that the measured intensity is multiplied by. It was lowered for these measurements in an effort to take emission measurements closer to the excitation wavelength. However this was unsuccessful, only resulting in some reflection measurements being read as within the acceptable fluorescence range.
Figure 5: The florescence response of the protein iLOV to a range of excitation wavelengths. The peak response occurred at an excitation wavelength of 449nm and emission measurement at 494nm. The fluorescence of the iLOV protein is calculated to be less than 0 for some areas of this plot. This artifact is likely due to interference caused by the Lysogeny broth that the experiment was carried out in.
No photo-bleaching was observed in this measurement despite the protein being exposed for 5ms per scan. This is likely due to the greater opacity of LB in comparison to minimal media.
Photo-Bleaching of iLOV and GFP
Figure 5 shows the fluorescence response of iLOV to exciting photons from three consecutive 4.5 ms scans each taken as a fraction of the first. The measuring conditions of the scans was repeated from the detailed scans used in the previous section."

Conclusion
            This presents a procedure for developing a bacterial thermometer with three distinct states using two RNA temperature switches.  All parts are from the iGem Parts Registry and are suitable to assemble and use together.  The 3A assembly method is appropriate for these parts and can be implemented with a combination of relatively standard processes and techniques.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#MiniTn7_-_-_TEXT.html," the other hand, the selective plates from the pUC18R6KT-miniTn7-Gm ligation did not show any colonies. I checked the DNA samples used in gel and they showed the expected pattern so the problem must be in the competent cells. We planned to prepare new electro-competent and chemically competent DH5α-λpir cells.
Streaking out frozen strains. Before I went on vacation, I froze away most of the strains I had used, so I had to streak them out to work from now on.
Week 7 (September, 5-9)
The wiki freeze deadline is coming closer! So I have been working all the time I could, nine-ten hours a day in average, and thankfully it was a productive week.
Finishing the preparation of the resistance cassettes. The previously purified Cm and Km resistance cassettes were digested with NcoI. Those digested fragments are perfect to create miniTn7 variants of the basic transposon construct.
Finishing the preparation of BioBrick inserts. The BioBrick mini-preps were digested with EcoRI and PstI. As in previous digestions, all the BioBricks showed the expected size, except for BBa_I732094. We skipped this part because it was not essential for us. The DNA bands were isolated from gel and purified. These digested parts are intended for the construction of mini-Tn7 variants with specialized functions.
Checking the identity of the portable attTn7 by digestion. I performed EcoRI-PstI digestions with mini-preps from previous colony PCR positive clones. Unfortunately, the amount of DNA was too low to reach definitive conclusions; so I repeated that digestion with more DNA and an additional analytical digestion with PvuII. The restriction patterns obtained were as expected, thus confirming the presence of attTn7 in pSB1C3.
Constructing the pUC18R6KT-miniTn7-Gm. This is the central construct of the miniTn7 BioBrick tool kit, so I performed all the experiments I could in order to obtain it. I did new mini-preps of miniTn7-Gm, performed new digestions and ligations (pUC18R6KT + miniTn7-Gm) and did three different electroporations: one with previously prepared DH5α-λpir electro-competent cells, again without positive results; a second one with freshly prepared prepared DH5α-λpir electro-competent cells, obtaining only one colony; and a"

The result and figures are:
Therefore, the correlation coefficient between the single mismatch cleavage activity and CRISPR-X mismatch score is 0.8840. And the fitting equation of the straight line is: Y=0.1872*X+0.0987. (X stands for mismatch score).
(B) Multiple mismatches
We next explored the effect between multiple base mismatches on SpCas9 target activity and our mismatch score. We use data of sets of guide RNAs that contained varying combinations of mismatches to investigate the effect of mismatch number, position and spacing on SpCas9 target cleavage activity for four targets within the EMX1 gene.

Our team consists of 8 undergraduate students from the University of Sheffield. Sharan Nanuan - “Miniprep Queen”, a second year student of Biochemistry and Microbiology. Not great at laser quest. Alex Simpson - a second year Aerospace Engineer, in his own words “quite successful with middle aged women” (this may be taken out of context). Ben Madden - a third year Chemical Engineer with a thing for bioreactors. Mustafa Hussain – a second year Mechatronics and Robotics student with a thing for remote control helicopters. Jianxing Qin - a second year student in Automatic Control and Systems Engineering originally from China. Lara Grew – a second year geneticist, bit of a lad, skilled at aiming fluids into other guy’s eyes. Ben Lomax – stunningly attractive, massively intelligent, fantastically funny, and fairly modest first year molecular biologist. Erika “Ethika” Otaviano – a third year Bioengineer. When it comes to ethics and consent forms for policy and practices research, she just can’t get enough.
On Friday 18th of July we held a meet-up for some of the other UK iGEM teams. Widely considered a success, the main aims of the meet-up was to find out about other teams projects, and potentially collaborate with our new iGEM friends. After a hectic morning of putting up sign posts and ensuring refreshments would arrive on time, other iGEM teams arrived from Oxford, Kent, York and UEA. We had talks from guest speakers Professor Phillip Wright about his perspective on synthetic biology as a chemical engineer, and Rob Meckin, who explored the sociology of the human practices aspect of synthetic biology. Each team then gave a two minute presentation on their project, and we all enjoyed a game of networking bingo – a great way to get to know each other. We ended the meet-up with a poster session and refreshments, and began to talk about collaborating with each other.
After the meet-up we went out for post-meet-up drinks and a celebratory night on the town. Conversation began regarding what we should"

Hey, I am Hao Wu and I am a student majoring in the biology science in Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. I worked in the RNA thermometer group and focused on the design of riboswitch. Also I helped to modify the wiki. I have learned a lot and gained valuable experience. Also I had a deeper understand of synthetic biology. Among the six months, although we have come across plenty of difficulties, we still enjoy this unforgettable experience.

OUC-China,2018,Team:OUC-China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to know more about synthetic biology, we decided to display some concepts of synthetic biology in the form of stories and pictures and enlighten the thinking of scientific exploration of them. OUC-China drew a comic book and till now it has been translated into 13 languages. More than 27 iGEM teams participated in our science education with different languages versions. Our comic book left a footprint in 10 countries and popularized in 16 schools.
1.2 A five day life science summer camp
We held a 5 day life science summer camp from August, 8th, 2018 to August, 13th, 2018, recruiting students from 3 different schools. During 5 days, we gave 7 lectures to these students, involving synthetic biology and iGEM, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, PCR technology and cytometry introduction, literature search ability training and so on. Apart from that, we taught them 4 experimental operations in our lab, such as DNA extraction, PCR experiments, marine microbial separation and observation, butterfly specimen making. Finally, every summer camper did a report according their interests and literatures, which was a show time similar to Jamboree.
1.3 A game ""Csy4 Go!"" based on our project
As is known to us, the mechanism of biological and chemical reaction in microorganisms is difficult to understand for most amateurish people. But our game can successfully solve this problem. The leading role of this game is an enzyme Csy4 that is used in our project. The game presents a microscopic view of the world with a more vivid picture. In this way, we can tell the story of Csy4 as well as the CRIPSR system to more people, thus achieving the goals of propagandizing our project and synthetic biology.
1.4 Establish a bridge with biotechnology company
Given that the ultimate goal of fundamental researches is application and benefiting for human, we suppose that making a dialogue with biotechnology companies is significant and meaningful. We went to 3 biotech companies and 2 research institute to integrate our project with social reality. In this way, we can know about the current social needs and improve our project accordingly. At the same time, we established a long-term relationship with them. On the one hand, they can provide us an effective way of converting fundamental  research to actual application, on the other hand, we will inform them of the latest results in the lab, by which we can promote each other and make progress together.

Adaptation to Copy Number -- Decision Based on Probability Distribution
In order to obtain an ideal and robust network which is adaptive to DNA template abundance (copy number), we firstly did parameter scan analysis and made comparisons among all the selected 476 structures intuitively. We changed the range of reaction rate to represent the change of copy number (proportional relationship), and expected to get a cluster of input-output curves (when copy number changes). Besides, we analyzed the correlativity between copy number and output, and expected the curve to be saturated.            
Since the target network structure is supposed to robustly distinguish different cells with either low or high endogenous input signal, there needs to be a saturated tendency to copy number. In other words, the output shouldn’t infinitely increase when the value of copy number increases, especially when the input is low. Otherwise, the network would wrongly regard the low-input kind of cell as the high-input kind when copy number is at high level. According to our simulation, we selected 111 network structures that tend to be saturated out of 476 structures.
Considering that the actual number of DNA templates that may be transferred into cells is not certain but rather follows a certain distribution in probability, we assumed that the copy number follows Poisson distribution. Then we studied each kind of distribution output follows when inputs are low and high respectively. For a better quantized comparison among the 111 structures, we raised Overlap (the covering part of two output distribution) as index, and hoped to get the optimal network with lowest Overlap.
Finally we figured out 2 optimal network structures, and the corresponding network structures contain following core topologies.
Compared with unsaturated networks, the 2 optimal network performance well when copy number follows Poisson distribution.
Because the target network is expect to be functional in distinguishing different cells, we designed a simulated screening test (sorter case) to verify our results above. In this optimal test, we offered 1000 cell A with low amount of endogenous microRNA (low input) and 1000 cell B with high amount of endogenous microRNA (high input). And both of them followed Gaussian distribution. Then we packed the network as a black box sorter which only receives these different cells and tries to distinguish them correctly. We then counted the number of the sorting results, compared with correct decisions and calculated the Accuracy Rate. The low overlap of optimal networks indicate adaption to DNA copy number.

The Greenfield-Central School Corporation is proud to be one of the newest additions to the iGem community as well as a pioneer into the high school division. Our team has been formed from the Biomedical Innovations class at GCHS, which is the fourth year course of the Project Lead the Way Biomedical Sciences Academy.  In this capstone course, we apply our knowledge and skills gathered throughout our high school careers to answer questions or solve problems related to the biomedical sciences. We have designed innovative solutions for the health challenges of the 21st century as we worked through progressively challenging open-ended problems, addressing topics such as clinical medicine, physiology, biomedical engineering, and public health. We had the opportunity to work on an independent project with mentors or advisors from universities, hospitals, physician’s offices, or other industries. At the end of the course, we were expected to present our work to an adult audience that may include representatives from the local business and healthcare community. This is our first year being involved in iGEM and we hope to expand our team as well as the high school division as a whole.

(The version of GFP used in the devices, GFP mut3b, has an excitation maximum at 501 nm and an emission maximum at 511 nm; fluorescein has an excitation maximum at 494 nm and an                       emission maximum at 525nm).
We will prepare a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measure the fluorescence in a 96 well plate in our plate reader. By measuring these in our plate reader, we will generate a standard curve of fluorescence                       for                       fluorescein concentration. We will be able to use this to convert our cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration.
Protocol:
Prepare the fluorescein stock solution from dried fluorescein:
Spin down fluorescein kit tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube.
Prepare fluorescein stock solution (100 μM - 10x) by resuspending fluorescein in 1 mL of PBS (1x). Note: it is important that the fluorescein is properly dissolved. To check this, after the                           resuspension                           you                           should pipette up and down and examine the solution in the pipette tip - if any particulates are visible in the pipette tip continue to mix the solution until they disappear.
Dilute the fluorescein stock solution (10x) with PBS (1x) to make a fluorescein solution (1x) with concentration 10 μM: 100 μL of fluorescein stock (10x) into 900 μL PBS (1x).
Prepare the serial dilutions of fluorescein:
Accurate pipetting is essential. Serial dilutions will be performed across columns 1-11. COLUMN 12 must contain PBS buffer only.
Initially we will setup the plate with the fluorescein stock in column 1 and an equal volume of PBS (1x) in columns 2 to 12. We will perform a serial dilution by consecutively transferring 100 μl from column to column with good                       mixing.
Add 100 μl of PBS into wells A2, B2, C2, D2....A12, B12, C12, D12
Add 200 μl of fluorescein 1x stock solution into A1, B1, C1, D1
Transfer 100 μl of fluorescein stock solution from A1 into A2
Mix A2 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A3"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Measurement#Main_-_-_TEXT.html," easier, we developed a software tool that generates specific DNA adapter sequences needed for ONT sequencing. Each sequence generated can be directly linked to the sample identification. To analyse and use this tool, please visit our improvement page .
Proof of principle
Targeted integration of DNA adapters during library preparation and sequencing with ONT MinION
We constructed, expressed and purified the fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5 . We demonstrated that this protein can integrate DNA adapters on a specific target (using a sgRNA for dxCas9) on human Erythropoyetin coding sequence (EPO cds) as substrate. To see these detailed results, please visit our Demonstration page ). After this result was obtained, we performed the integration reaction with DNA adapters that were compatible with ONT sequencing. These adapters were integrated on the specific EPO cds DNA target. The sample used for the reaction with our fusion protein contained two molecules: EPO cds (the target of fusion) and a different molecule (not targeted by the sgRNA) to assess any off-target adapter integration.
After this integration reaction, the sample was used for library preparation for ONT MinION sequencing. This protocol was started at the second step, as the targeted library preparation with our fusion protein replaced  the first reaction. After sequencing, data was aligned to both DNA molecules as reference. This experiment proved that target EPO cds was enriched for sequencing in comparison with negative control DNA that was not targeted (89 unique aligned reads against 0 unique aligned reads respectively). This result shows sample enrichment towards EPO cds plasmid.
For further proof of targeted integration, figure 2 shows the specific alignment of one of the unique reads from this experiment to reference EPO cds DNA used.
Figure 2. (A) Alignment of DNA sequence read with reference EPO cds in plasmid DNA. (B) Zoom into the sequence alignment to determine sgRNA target. Fusion protein depicted with arrows representing binding of dxCas9 position (red) and the addition of sequencing adapters (blue).
For more information and discussion on these experiments, please visit our sequencing results .
Further improvements and prospective applications
We obtained a proof of principle that indicates how library preparation is enriched towards a specific DNA sequence. However, the method will still need to be optimized before it can be used for detection applications. One of the major improvements to be made is the optimization of the protocol for integration of our fusion protein. Buffer composition must be altered to favour reaction kinetics of both dxCas9 binding to target and Tn5 integration. Another improvement of the method should include the design of optimal adapters compatible with"

For cell A we made a simulation with cell A in the ON and OFF mode as visuable in figure 3. When cell A is in the OFF state, the whole designed circuit is in OFF mode. This means that the cI repressor is succesful in repressing the design. If the degradation rate of cI is raised to simulate the temperature rising, we see that all the components of the system show a big increase. For LuxR this increase is only temporary, but this is also explainable. Since LuxI keeps on producing AHL which binds LuxR to form a complex. Indeed all the LuxR reacts to form the complex. Some values seem really high (for example the AHL,out en leucine,extracellular values, but they are also in the biggest volume so the concentration is not that high). We also assumed that there is a substrate pool without limiting, which is of course not the real situation. The most important conclusion is that with values backed up by literature, our system qualitatively still shows the desired behavior. We can  also ignore noise effects because our model works with a big amount of transcription factors, so small changes will only have a limited effect.
Figure 3: Simulation of all processes in Cell A in ON and OFF state
Afterwards, we made the simulations for cell B. In the OFF state simulations, there is not a big difference between the red and green lines. We do see a very small rise in LuxR but it is not significant. We see a fast equilibration between the external AHL and internal AHL and no drop since there is no LuxR to react with the AHL. The only proteins that are available in high amounts are PenI and RFP. The high amount of PenI was not predicted in our design, but it does not affect the amount of RFP.
In the ON simulations we see a big difference between the red and green lines. When there is AHL available, the production of CheZ and PenI is much higher and the production of RFP much lower. This is expected the behavior. Therefore we conclude that our system is still qualitatively showing the desired behavior.
Figure 4: Simulation of all processes in Cell B in OFF state with and without AHL induction
Figure 5: Simulation of all processes in Cell B in ON state with and without AHL induction
It is also important to study the effect of change of AHL on cell B. Thus, we gave cell B a shot of AHL which is degraded in time and watched how it responded on it. Our simulation results were plotted in figure 6."

Amazing synthetic biology projects all have something in common. They need to deliver. Whether you are trying to cure a disease with a novel protein or small molecule, the last and most important step is delivering your innovations into cells. This is why we have focused on developing an innovative toolkit that utilizes Protein Nanocompartments (PNCs) in order to custom design a delivery strategy for iGEM teams and scientists that fits the needs of their projects.
Current Delivery Systems
Cellular delivery systems all share the same goal, to deliver cargo to a target. This cargo can be virtually anything! These may include nucleic acids such as plasmid DNA, small molecules such as chemotherapeutics, or proteins like the CRISPR-Cas9 system.
There are a wide range of cellular delivery systems available on today’s scientific markets. However, the perfect delivery system has not been developed and many of the most common technologies for cellular delivery used by the scientific community fall short.

Why Protein Nanocompartments?
After consulting the literature and experts in the fields of biochemistry, industry, pharmacy, and clinical research, we determined that the ideal cellular delivery system would be one that has high delivery efficiency, modular compatibility with different cargo types, specific to appropriate targets, and safe for the public and the organism of choice. We strongly believe that PNCs meet those principles and have modeled our toolkit accordingly.
Protein nanocompartments (PNCs) are a nanoscale delivery system. They are composed of proteins that self-assemble to encapsulate various forms of cargo, like nucleic acids and small molecules, and deliver their cargo to different cellular and intercellular locations. Certain"
EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Notebook#October2011_-_-_TEXT.html," right below the 3000 bp mark. Now we have to put the T7 + Lysis together with the backbone, and for that there will have to be some blunt-ends with phosphorylation before we can ligate the two pieces together. Stay tuned.
Sunday, October 16 2011
Vincent came in to work on the blunt-end cloning for the inserts (T7 promoters + Lysis) and the psB3K1 vector. The idea is to use the T4 DNA polymerase, which has a 3' to 5' exonuclease, to fill-in and chew away the ends till we have blunt ends. I added the protocol to the appropriate protocol section. After running through this protocol, the T7 inserts had an average concentration of 40 ng/uL while the backbone vector K1 had a concentration of 90 ng/uL (to within Nanodrop measurement error). Those concentrations are high enough to allow us to move on to the next step which is phosphorylating the T7 inserts (not the backbone!) for ligation.
The phosphorylation step is needed because the ligation (via ligase enzyme) requires that one of the 5' termini have a phosphate residue that will induce phosphodiester bond. If both the insert and the backbone have the phosphate residue, then the backbone may bind to itself, leaving the insert out -- which would defeat the purpose of ligation.
The specifics of the blunt-end protocol were as follows:
For the T7 + Lysis inserts,
H20 - 11.25 uL
NEBuffer2 (10X, found in enzyme ice box) - 3 uL (needs to be at a final concentration of 1X)
dNTP (10 mM) - 0.3 (needs to be at a final concentration of 100 uM)
template - 15 uL (for 1.5 ug of DNA, assuming the T7 + Lysis was at a concentration of 100 ng/uL)
T4 Polymerase - 0.45 uL (it comes at a ""concentration"" of 3000 units/mL and we want 1.5 units)
I made a master mix of everything except the template DNA, which then went into separate PCR tubes. The total is a 30 uL reaction. The tubes were placed in the Bio-Rad machine were we setup a protocol (called BLUNTEND) that keeps the tubes at a constant 12 C for 15 minutes. If you want, you can add EDTA to a final concentration of 10"

No Cumate Expression Mode:
CymR is continuously produced. It binds the cumate responsive promoter (T5 Cumate Operator) and inhibits the expression of T4 Holin and Cathelicidin LL-37.
Bacteria live!
Cumate-Induction Kill Mode:
Cumate enters by diffusion into bacteria, binds and inactivates the     repressor. The cumate responsive promoter (T5 Cumate Operator) is     derepressed and the expression of T4 Holin and Cathelicidin LL-37     is turned on. T4 Holin interacts with the cytoplasmatic membrane,     permeabilizes it allowing the secretion of Cathelicidin LL-37 into the     periplasmic space. Cathelicidin LL-37 binds the outermembrane and forms     pores, which leads to cell lysis.
Bacteria die!
Plasmid Transfer:
The plasmid transfers from the E. coli Nissle into other bacteria         via horizontal transfer. The receiving bacteria do not produce         the CymR repressor, so the cumate responsive promoter (T5 Cumate         Operator) is derepressed and the T4 Holin and Cathelicidin         LL-37 expression is activated.
Receiving bacteria die!
E. coli Nissle looses the plasmid. It continues to produce the         CymR repressor, which does not appear to be toxic for prokaryotic         cells.
Bacteria live and are harmless!

Introductory Lab Session: 23rd July 2009
Please note that all of the tasks written in purple play a part in the real project lab work - they are not introductory lab session work. They just happen to run parallel to some of the introductory lab sessions this week
Introduction
Last week's experiment error is apparent when attempting to load the DNA samples into the wells of the agarose gel
In the last session of last week’s set of practicals, we had attempted to conduct a midi-prep of the plasmids containing the RFP and the GFP genes (derived from E.coli DH5alpha cultures 2 and 3 respectively). However we were unsuccessful in loading the two prepared plasmids into the gel in our electrophoresis attempt. When inserted into the wells the DNA immediately floated and dispersed within the running buffer of the gel electrophoresis apparatus.
The reason for this anomalous result was that the samples still contained a high concentration of ethanol, which should have been completely washed away prior to loading into the wells. Washing solution 2 contained ethanol as an ingredient. After analysis of the situation, a few conclusions were drawn:
For the washing process 15ml falcon tubes should have been used instead of 50ml falcon tubes.
The centrifugation step should have been allowed to run for longer to ensure all of the wash solution had passed through the buffer column.
However all was not lost; the plasmid DNA was still there and in usable form. The challenge was how we could extract it successfully.
The answer to our problem is ethanol precipitation. By precipitating the ethanol from our DNA sample, we could then process the plasmid DNA and run on the gel as usual.

      The figure 4and 5 show that kil can secrete the Exogenous protein，but the mechanism of Kil protein increasing the permeability of bacterial outer membrane is not very clear. There is evidence that phospholipase A involves several links of kil secretion.The periplasmic protein secreting out of cell has many benefits. First of all, extracellular volume is much larger than the periplasmic space, can accumulate more objective protein. Secondly, the process of purifying  extracellular periplasmic proteins is much simpler than the purification of cell wall breaking.

When we advanced to the finals in Boston, we wanted to verify that our previous experiments where replicable as well as investigate the quantity and yield of rubber. To assess this we did a third round of H1-NMR on MG1655 (WT), and MG1655 carrying pSB1C3-Pcon-araC-term-Para-HRT2 (HRT2), or pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI(N)-term-dxs (B. subtilis) and pSB1K3-Pcon-araC-term-Para-HRT2 (Dxs + HRT2). 1 L LB media was inoculated with the strains, starting from OD600=0.05. The cultures were grown at 37ºC with shaking for 5 hours; the temperature was then lowered to 20ºC and cultures were induced with 1mM IPTG, 0,2% arabinose, and 1mM MgCl2 ON. Rubber purification was commenced the following day, and the final yield was solubilized in 2 mL d-chloroform and analyzed by H1-NMR.
From the spectrum reflecting the WT strain, none of the peaks originating from polyisoprene were observed (fig. 8). From the spectrum reflecting the Dxs + HRT2 strain, all three peaks originating from polyisoprene were observed (fig. 9). Lastly, from the spectrum reflecting the HRT2 strain (fig. 10), the peaks potentially originating from polyisoprene could not be conclusively identified indicating the decreased rubber production performance of this strain compared to the Dxs + HRT2 strain. This emphasizes the importance of excess IPP and DMAPP (rubber precursors) available as a consequence of Dxs overexpression, and serves as an indirect proof of the effect of MEP pathway optimization.
Figure 8.
Figure 9.
Figure 10.  
In order to determine rubber yield, we compared the yield from 1L of our Dxs + HRT2 strain with 5 rubber purifications on WT + a selected amount of standard polyisoprene. Yields from all 5 purifications were solubilized in equal volumes of d-chloroform (2 mL), and the resulting TMS peaks could consequently be used for normalization of the polyisoprene peaks at 5.12 ppm. This peak was selected for quantification due to its localization in a region without background noise. From these 5 purifications"

γ-HCH Biodegradation and F2A Cleaving Achieved
Growth of E.coli strain MC1061 transformed LinA+F2A+LinB and LinA gene in LB medium with inducer and 5Mm γ-HCH  respectively, as the substrate was monitored in batch culture. The result was screened by GC analysis(Fig.4). Growth resulted in disappearance of the substrate and simultaneous formation of biomass and γ-PCCH et al. But available columns were limited, hence the intermediate product couldn’t be detected. Through SDS-PAGE analysis, F2A peptide could cleave LinA and LinB(Fig.5). LinB would degrade the intermediate product of γ-HCH and according to theory, the γ-HCH could be degraded to desired low toxic compounds.
Fig.4. E.coli strain MC1061 carried LinA and LinA+F2A+LinB gene incubated in LB medium with γ-HCH(5mM) at 30℃. The concentration of γ-HCH was measured by GC. The bacteria carried gene LinA+F2A+LinB degraded γ-HCH(5mM) but the intermediate product couldn't be detected. Blank control(empty vector) have been added, the concentration of γ-HCH merely remained unchanged.

Formal Lab Session - 11th August 2009
Overview
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team - carried out a second attempt at pouring LB + Em + Kan plates and this time, it was a success
Metal Sensor Team - transformed Bacillus subtilis cells with pGFP-rrnB plasmid and plated potential transformants onto LB + Chloramphenicol plates
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis team
Summary
We used the water bath to cool the LB to the correct temperature for pouring plates.
Previously , we failed to pour the LB + Em + Kan plates successfully due to the smaller amount of volume. Today, from our lessons learnt, we attempted again, and it was a success.
This time however, we set up the water bath to a temperature of 55oC and placed the autoclaved LB + agar solution in it. The water bath ensured that the LB + agar solution would cool to only a minimum of 55oC and the same mistake of the mixture solidifying upon addition of the cold water would not happen.
Stochastic Switch Team
Goksel making sure the liquid agarose gel contains no solids within it
Summary
Today we run the gel for our pGFP-rrnB integration vector. We had restriction digest using EcoRI and HindIII. This gave us a 500bp of DNA on the gel.
Preparation of the gel
3.2 gr of agarose were solved in 400ml of 1xTAE buffer to make 0.8% agarose gel
The solution was microwaved for 5 minutes and left to cool down for an hour.

Athens,2018,Team:Athens#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," a very similar project to ours, so they were in a unique positions to give us more information about the toehold switch mechanism. The team, and especially their team leader, who continued working on their project, gave us tips about the design and the assembly of the switches and generally about many wet lab issues that we came up against.
iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2018 Team
The Bielefeld-CeBiTec team shared with us a slide-show they prepared about Dual Use and Research of Concern. They informed us on these topics in the context of science and explained how they form a part of Biosecurity issues. We supported their commendable effort to raise awareness on such important topics by viewing the slides at the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute where we conduct our experiments. The Bielefeld-CeBiTec team granted us the Dual Use Awareness button.
iGEM Erlangen 2018 Team
Both team Erlangen and our team created a video for their Human Practices. In order to make it accessible to more teams and people around the world, our teams translated each other’s video script in their own language, so that the translated script can be used as subtitles. Thus, our video has German subtitles, and iGEM Erlangen Team’s video has Greek subtitles!
iGEM EPFL 2018 Team
Having just started our iGEM journey, we sought out for teams with previous experience on the diagnostic mechanism we had chosen: the toehold switch. We initially contacted the iGEM EPFL team in order to work as a liaison with Aptasense, the previous year’s team. Yet, that was only to find out that we share much more in common than what we initially thought; cell - free systems utilization and materialization of a diagnostic kit stands in the core of both of our projects. That stood as the beginning of a meaningful collaboration. The EPFL team shared with us their expertise on cell-free system optimization and provided insightful tips on our experimental design. From our part, we assisted the EPFL team set the basic lines and specifications for their kit design. Throughout several skype calls during this summer, we tried to identify the key characteristics our suggested mechanisms should enclose, as well as the needs we should address. Yannis had the chance to meet in person with the team, spend time in the lab with them and discuss future collaboration plans. Since both teams are planning to keep on working on their projects after the course of the competition, we decided to set a common timetable on realizing our kits. To this"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Innovative BioBrick construction
     This year we developed an innovative way to construct and pre-confirm BioBricks efficiently.
     This method mainly applies to those parts that are initially constructed on backbones other than pSB1A3/1C3/1K3 etc. and suffer adding suffix/prefix when changing into standard backbone.
Significance
     Due to various and specific needs for experiments, or customs in host labs, it is often unfeasible to use the standard backbone from the beginning to the end of the project. Therefore, when we construct BioBricks, we will have to reconstruct the part into the standard backbone.
     For example, this year, we used pEntry for most of our experiments, which contains attL recombining sites required by our design. We also used eukaryotic vectors for cell experiments and our G1 promoters (intended to submit as the new basic parts) were are ligated in an eukaryotic vector.
     Moreover, sometimes it is impossible to construct the parts with prefix/suffix for experiments: there is a big chance that the backbones used for experiments contain PstI, EcoRI, NotI enzyme sites (one or more), and that it will be used for experimental needs. In this occasion, you don’t dare add the same enzyme site beside you parts!
     Thus while we suffered from reconstruct"

Microbial B12 Plate Assay
The B12 Plate Assay allows the detection of corrinoids in cell extracts or supernatants. It is based on the fact, that E. coli DSM 4261 relies on its B12 dependent methionine synthase which is encoded by metH. This is caused by a point mutation in metE which encodes the B12 independent methionine synthase. In a medium without methionine, E. coli DSM 4261 therefore relies on the presence of B12.
Cultivation of E. coli DSM 4261
50 mL of Guttman medium are inoculated with a 5 mL preparatory overnight culture.
The cells are harvested at an OD600 of 0.2, washed three times with 20 mL 0.9% NaCl and afterwards resuspended in the same volume NaCl.

Crowdfunding
During the discussion about human practices, science and the public we have looked for phenomena that can bring academics closer to the public. As one example of such opportunity we have researched the potential of crowdfunding in science. We believe it offers a platform for communication and funding previously unavailable to researchers. We are want to investigate whether crowdfunded projects are less constrained compared to other funding mechanisms
As part of our research we have investigated multiple science-related crowdfunding projects from different websites. Several case studies are presented below.
