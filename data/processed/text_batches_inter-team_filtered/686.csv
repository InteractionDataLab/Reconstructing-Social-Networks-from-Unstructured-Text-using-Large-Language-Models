- Transformed Pertobrick into K12 cells
- Constructed the first draft of the scaffold, but it needs review.
- Second, unique scaffold needs to be designed
6/14/2012
- Plated Petrobrick transformations; inoculated cell growth using CM resistance
- Finalized an updated version of the scaffold based on new data of PUF binding. Final modifications need to be made before sent for synthesis.
- Performed PCR: (2) 50 uL tubes of control (no PUF binding site) and (2) 50 uL tubes with the PUF binding site. Used WT PUF as a template and phusion as the polymerase. Ran gel and saw a result of all primer dimers.
6/15/2012
- Made plan to digest cells in order to see whether or not petrobrick was transformed into K12.
- Final modifications made on the scaffold design. The construct is ready for synthesis.
- Second try of PCR: Did a temperature gradient of 55-63-71 degrees Celsius. Used the WT PUF as template DNA. Gel results show only primer dimers, the faintest of faint lines at around 700 base pairs, but it's not a positive result.
- Miniprepped pTET is in the ""temporary"" box of the -20 degree Celsius freezer.
Week 4 Notes
6/18/2012
- Made our own NEB Buffer 2
- RNA scaffold ready for synthesis
- PCR attempt 3: Using hotstart mix at 63 degrees, using protet as the template DNA and including a blank tube that contained no template DNA as a control. Gel reveals another failed PCR with all primer dimers.
6/19/2012
- Made digestions of Petrobrick and K12 cells using EcoRI as restriction enzyme; Ran a gel; brightest band was at 5 kb mark.
- Made more 1x TAE buffer
- Designed primers for BBa_K157006 restriction enzyme site (KpnI/XhoI) incorporation in order to put into pETDuet-1 along with BBa_K157005.
- Created a plan to subclone WT PUF into pBAD (inducible by IPTG) and eYFP into protet.
- Designed primers for the WT PUF with Angela, who submitted them for ordering.
- Inoculated E0030 from glycerol stock for the PCR tomorrow as well as MC4100.

 Overview
In our project we worked with multiple plasmids. We tried different reporter plasmids: RFP and GFP in high and low copy plasmids with different antibiotics resistance genes. We worked also with two different conjugative plasmids: pSW23T           ans pK18mob.
The plasmids used as reporter :
We worked with an Red Fluorescent Protein constitutive generator in the form of the biobrick Bba_J04450 and with the Green Fluorescent Protein generator in the form of a construction of two biobricks R0010, a LacI dependent promoter,               and E0840, a weak RBS promoterless GFP generator.
Both of those construction have been placed in high replicative plasmids backbones: pSB1R3 (with the specific resistance of the backbone R=C, chloramphenicol; A, Ampicillin; K, Kanamycin).
They have also been placed in low replicative plasmids backbones: pSB4R5 (with the specific resistance of the backbone R = C, chloramphenicol; A, Ampicillin; K, Kanamycin).
The submitted parts:
We sent two different biobricks.
The first one, K2654001, is our GFP generator with a weak RBS and a LacI dependent promoter. We used this part to discern our donor with the green color. We wanted a weak RBS to avoid a deflection of the ribosomes from the                   vital translations.
The second one is , K2654002, is a customable sgRNA with a switchable crRNA sequence. This biobrick was used to create two sgRNA’s for txo differnts targets: The RFP Bba_E1010 and the Ampicillin Resistance gene."

Today I designed sites 5-8 using benchling.
Procedure:
1. The wt cage sequence was copied into a benchling file.
2. The thrombin cleavage site was inserted at the area of interest of each site.
3. The resultant sequence was then codon optimized. Integrated DNA Technologies Codon Optimizer, set to Escherichia coli K12, was used. https://www.idtdna.com/CodonOpt
4. The optimized sequence was then cross checked with benchling’s digest function for EcoRI, PstI, SpeI, and XbaI restriction sites.
5. Any residues containing the restriction site were exchanged with different codons to preserve the reading frame and remove undesired digestion.
Tyler Lee -- Wtleeiv 18:27, 23 June 2015 (CDT)
1.Created Mutant Sequences (9-13) using WT cage sequence from Yeates paper(not fully optimized)
- WT cage sequence was copied onto Benchling and the mutation was inserted onto this sequence    - Then this sequence was codon optimized using the IDT Codon Optimizer tool     - Then the sequence was checked for containing any iGEM restriction enzymes(Pst,EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI,NotI) and were removed                            replacing nucleotides to avoid unwanted digestion.
2.Helped shoot video for Spark Video.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  For today, the goal is to become familiarized with Benchling usage, and the general idea behind creating the constructs.  First, the Yeate’s construct will be designed based off of Dr. Yeate’s papers in the methods.  From there, the mutants will be created on Benchling.
1.  Identifying important notes about the protein cage: The sequence from Yen Ting, Dr. Yeate’s former graduate student, was obtained from email with Yeates (June 4, 2015).  See supplemental material for this paper for plasmid preparation, protein over"
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#NeuTest2_-_-_TEXT.html,"Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary scientific area that has recently developed. It links various fields of science like biology, chemistry, physics, molecular genetics, informatics and engineering.
Due to this combination the relation of biological design and function can be investigated from an entirely new perspective. The previous approach was limited to the examination of a structure and its function and the attempt to explain how they correlate. Recently, the reverse strategy is applied. Biological parts are specifically designed and constructed according to a desired function. These parts are characterized by a standardized modular design that facilitates their handling. The subsequent introduction of the synthetic constructs to living cells can either cause the replacement of original cellular components or result in additional elements that act cooperatively or more or less autonomously (see fig. 1).
Nagarajan Nandagopal and Michael B. Elowitz. (2011). Synthetic Biology: Integrated Gene Circuits. SCIENCE, Vol. 333: 1244-1248.
Another very important and necessary feature of biological parts is orthogonality, which means in this context that independent devices can be combined unrestrictedly.   This principle derives from the area of engineering and aims to alter subsystems,   without impeding others.
This way cells can be modified as requested, resulting in a predictable behaviour. Among others, this technique can be beneficial for the effective production of certain substances, like biofuels or antibiotics.

Uppsala-Sweden,2010,Team:Uppsala-SwedenWeek1_-_-_TEXT.html," anaerobic and hard to cultivate. We could introduce magnetosome into E.coli and grow those special cells in a tank. With the help of rapid changing magnetic field outside of tank, the magnetosome will bring the E.coli cells to vibrate and the motion could be amplified by electronic speaker. Well, it won’t be a beautiful song but it would be so cool to hear E.coli.
3.Heavy metal detector
Another practical project! This project is also going to use E.coli transformed with magnetosome but for different purpose. Based on the result from a research group in University of Southampton iii , with the magnetic property, the bacteria could attract and remove metal ions like Fe, Mg, Mn, Al and Gd in the environment. It would be an economical, clean and energy-saving method to protect the nature from pollution. Our project will be creating a heavy metal detector by introducing the magnetosome and coloured proteins genes in E.coli. With contact to heavy metal, the bacteria will show various colour indicating the concentration in the waste water.
4.Post-modern painting
Do you want a post-modern painting which changing the pattern all the time on your wall? This project aims to generate a kind of E.coli cells which could display different colour according to different conditions such as temp, pH, oxygen concentration, and electric potentials etc. We will randomly alter the conditions on each small area of the picture time by time. The colour protein genes will be borrowed from last year’s iGEM team from Cambridge iv. If the works goes quite smooth, we could try to control the colours on each spot and create a bacteria plasma screen which could show words or simple pictures.
5.Snow and ice melter
In the country such as Sweden, the first impression of winter is everything covering by snow and every year the government put great efforts to remove snow on the streets and roofs. Moreover, icy ground is also a big trouble for walking and riding in cold winter.  It would save a lot of money if the snow and ice could melt quickly and won’t refreeze even under low temperature. The existing melter products are mainly consists of chloride salts which are a pollutant if widely used. So our team want to invent an organic snow and ice melter by synthetic biology.  A special kind of bacteria is the main component in the melter which could gain energy from the sunlight efficiently and melt the ice in a short time. After finish its work in one spot, the bacteria will move to on with the melted water.

Yesterday tried to amplify the 2 parts but was only using forward and reverse primers (1 primer for each). This amplified PUF and kinda worked on CCFP. But it didn’t work for the actual tether. So tried again today just with the tether with HF buffer instead of GC buffer. Got primer dimers again. Ran it again on a gradient of 50-55-60-65, used less primers, lengthened annealing time. Will check the results of that later tonight. If this fails the next plan is to do PCR so that the PUF and the CCFP will have the restriction site and linker sequence on them even before tethering. Will be gone July 30-Aug. 6 and needs someone to help out with the RNA scaffold characterization. Will send out a google doc to everyone by next week. Waiting on Angela to get the mutant PUF sequence to get sent out for synthesis in case this doesn’t work.   - social! Thursday night there is a rodeo at 7 at the county fair! It’s $5 to get in the door and Cara will post more info on the fb page. consider eating before because the food is expensive.
Monday, 7/30/12  - Adi - needs to figure out how to pitch to companies with whatever data we have so far. Cara and Angela should send Adi a three sentence summary of preliminary work and data to convince companies to sponsor us. Do this by Thursday.  - Bob - been working on the petDUET and CCFP stuff for Uros. The ligation was finished over the weekend, so transformed into DH5a today. Also the petDUET miniprep DNA has been yielding really low, so inoculated 16 mL to get a good supply.  - Cara - will be focusing on her final on Wednesday. Will resume work on Thursday. Might be considering sequencing.  - Asha - got colonies from last pBAD-wtPUF ligation, think it’s the nuclease free water. Gave to Angela for colony PCR. Made inoculation for glycerol stock of new, better pBAD. Had interview with Dr. Below, got 30 min of footage.  - Anthony - started new digestions for pBAD-wtPUF.  - Angela - no meeting on Friday. Used the new nuclease free water (which appears to be working well!) Have to order new primers for the PUF"

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,", forming the SNAREpin with the t-SNARE (Gerst et al, 1997)
To decorate the compartments with the SNARE we use a peroxisomal transmembrane protein . In our case we use the proteins Pex15 or Pex26, which were further investigated in another sub project, and fuse Snc1 to the N-terminus. We expressed these constructs of membrane anchor and Snc1 constitutively under control of the RPL18B promotor. In case of Pex15 we used a truncated version, lacking a large part of the N-terminus, only consisting of the transmembrane domain (315-383) (Figure 3.1). For Pex26 we use the truncated version published in Halbach et al. (Halbach et al, 2006) .
Figure 3.2 Concept of secreting peroxisomal contents to the supernatant. For the secretion, the membrane anchor Pex15 or Pex26 is used. This anchor is used to decorate peroxisomes or our modified compartments with the v-SNARE Snc1. For the secretion Snc1 interacts with the t-SNAREs in the cell membrane. Induced from this interaction the vesicle and cell membrane fuse and the content of the compartment is secreted to the supernatant.
We verified our secretion using beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter protein. In 2012 Stock and colleagues described the GUS reporter assay for unconventional secretion (Stock et al, 2012) . With it, it is possible to determine whether a protein is secreted conventional and is N-glycosylated or secreted unconventional and not N-glycosylated. GUS is a bacterial protein with an N-glycosylation-site, which is active only if the protein is not N-glycosylated. The GUS-activity can be measured with different reagents in plate or liquid assays. Liquid assays can be applied qualitatively as well as quantitatively to measure differences in activity. If GUS is secreted by the conventional pathway the N-glycosylation leads to inactivation of the enzyme (Stock et al, 2012) (Fig 3.2).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Objective: 60% Glycerol stock
Purpose: Student training
Summary: We have finally done stuff! Student team members continued their initial safety training, as well as learning how to do basic techniques (e.g. 60% Glycerol stock). Meanwhile, our senior team members came up with a more detailed plan than just ""biosensor"". Miranda came up with multiple plans for the system. By modifying Lsr Operons, we hope to use Quorum sensing to detect the presence of E.coli bacteria other than those that we use. -80 Competent cells

UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Spinning Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," to be bio-integrated [2] .
Silk film created by drying dialyzed silk overnight.
Material - Hydrogels
A silk hydrogel is a general term for a variety of ‘gel’ structures that can be created from silk. We chose to create a pH induced gel: the nature of this gel creates a chemically alterable microenvironment that can be tailored to optimize conditions for pharmaceuticals, tissues, or other biological agents. Biomedical applications of this technology could range from pain relievers integrated into a suture to tissue wound sealing.
Optional Processing: Lyophilization
Water can be completely removed from the dialyzed silk by the process of lyophilization, or freeze-drying. In this process, the solution is frozen by liquid nitrogen and is sublimated under vacuum for 2-3 days. This results in a pure silk powder that can be stored indefinitely. This silk powder can also be resuspended in solvents such as hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) in preparation for spinning into a fiber.
Material - Fibers
Silk fibers are the most traditional form. Fibers can be formed from silk that has gone through the lyophilization process and has been resuspended in HFIP. From resuspension, the solution is ‘spun’ into fibers, as detailed below. Silk fibers as a biomedical device are intended to be used as the structural material for scaffolds to assist with re-engineered tissues. Silk scaffolds have the ability to be integrated into bones, cartilage, vascular tissue, and even skin [3] .
Spinning Silk
In order to form fibers from silk, soluble silk protein solutions must be much like how they are in natural spider spinnerets. The majority of spinning methods entail pushing, or extruding, silk solution through very thin channels. During this extrusion, shear forces on the silk solution cause the amino acids of the proteins to align in a way that allows the strong beta sheets of the silk structure to form. Multiple proteins are similarly aligned, causing separate proteins to interact and form larger structures.
Syringe Extrusion
The standard method that we are using to produce silk fibers is syringe extrusion, in which a syringe pump forces silk dope through a small-diameter tube into a liquid isopropanol coagulation bath [1] . This method most directly emulates the process that spiders use. In a natural spider spinneret, silk solution produced in the spider's glands are forced through small-diameter spinnerets, and expelled as solid threads.
A simple syringe extruder setup. It consists of a"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Measure_-_-_TEXT.html," the dilutions is visible on the graph, as the distances betwen the points and the lines of best fit are similar both with the green filter and with no filter. The no filter readings are higher as fluorescence is provided in arbitrary units, as they are the light intensity readings without being calibrated against a blank. Without the filter less light is blocked and thus there is increased levels.
We were surprised results without the filter. We expected greater errors caused by variations in ambient light and the input blue light. The input source light must therefore be very consistent and also quite directional so as not to significantly affect the readings. For reference, we used a Nichia Superflux LEDs, product code NSPBR70BSS. However, we don't think there's anything particularly special about this LED - it may be an idea for future projects to test LEDs to see if there is a benefit to using a specific type or brand.
Conclusions
The results follow the trends we expected them to, demonstrating that our combined fluorometer and densitometer has high linearity and thus is an effective measurement tool. It could therefore be developed commercially to be used in diagnostics, especially in developing countries. This is further explored on our silver human practices page .
We characterized the linearity of our light sensor (TSL235R) with optical density readings of LUDOX, and found it performed very well.
Aachen 2014 characterized the linearity of the same light sensor (TSL235R) to detect fluoroescence of purified iLOV, [1] and our results with fluorescein are concordant. Using the same light sensor also means our work further characterizes their fluorometer.
Unfortunately we don’t have a plate reader at our school so we were unable to test the same samples with commercial equipment to compare the performance. However, the linearity graphs and Aachen’s previous work characterizing the light sensor (TSL235R) demonstrate that our hardware has real potential to reduce the costs and increase the accessibility of a screening programme.

And we found that gfp expresses much if it introduced with rhlR-LVA even though using stronger Prhl than wild type Prhl( BBa_R0071) . Thls is because that RhlR, which represses Prhl without C4, tagged LVA is prone to be degraded and the concentration of RhlR in a cell decreases then the repression becomes weak.
3-3. Results
The level of GFP expression of (a)~(d) are shown below.
3-4. Discussion
The expression level of the gene under Prhl depends on not only Prhl activity but also the type of the rhlR. In other words, this characterize shows that the combinations of Prhl and rhlR can control the expression level of the gene under Prhl. It gives you more choices which Prhl and rhlR you use."

iGEM IDF Meetup
The iGEM IDF (Île-de-France) was a collaboration between iGEM IONIS, iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Evry. It was originally intended to be hosted in La Paillasse, the lab where the iGEM IONIS team is working, and ended up being in the Pasteur campus.
The iGEM IONIS team was in charge of designing the event’s logo, and its members were helping out teams as staff. We also tried to find some speakers for the conferences but didn’t manage to do so. Fortunately, the two other teams found a lot of interesting speakers, and the conferences turned out to be great! This event was a lot of fun, both to organize and to attend to. It allowed us to see again the people we met at the European Experience, and we could spend more time with them!

Working with iGEM UPMC
During the iGEM Competition, we were working in La Paillasse, an open lab in Paris (see « Working at La Paillasse » ). But a big suprise was waiting or us at the beginning of the summer, as the iGEM UPMC team ended up working in the same lab than us! This was the occasion for a lot of fun together, along with tons of advice, regarding biology, protocols, strategy, and even fundraising… We helped each other in the best way possible and it was a very positive thing for us.
The pinnacle of this collaboration was the presentation of both our project in the Jussieu campus: the aim of this was to convince more biology students to attend to the iGEM,as part of one of our teams or even by creating their own teams. We explained them what was"

Aphid population preference
Aim: To   determine   the   effect   on   aphid   population   on   Methyl Salicylate (MeS) induced plants.
Experimental setup: We induced five plants per concentration
Plants: Small potted paprika plants in two ways: via the root or byspraying;   60   in   total.   Paprika   plants   don’t   make   MeS naturally but do produce salicylic acid.
Concentration: 1ng/ml, 0,8ng/ml, 0,4ng/ml, 0.1ng/ml ,0.01ng/ml  of   MeS   (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus®, ≥99% (GC)) in 97% pure ethanol or water.
Procedure
Induction requires 48h
Induction via the roots
Uproot the plant, clean off the dirt with water because compost can interfere with the uptake of MeS
Wipe off the water before placing the roots in a cup with the desired concentration for 10 minutes. MeSA was first suspended in ethanol before being further diluted to the desired concentration in 50ml water
Re-pot the plant and divide the remainder of the MeSA solution amongst the 5 plants
Induction via the leaf
The desired concentrations were diluted in 15ml ethanol, resulting in 3ml per plant. Ethanol has been shown to have no plant induction properties
Each leaf of the plant is sprayed above and underneath
Place aphids on MeS induced plants 48h post-induction
Place 15 green peach aphids on the head of each induced plant
Take the smallest aphids present on the aphid-infested leaf. To be sure that it is a first generation aphid
Place each plant in a separate net
Plants of the same concentration, induced by spraying or via the roots, are placed in the same row; 10 plants per row. The rows are roughly 1 metre apart
Counting aphids on day 7
Following a form, count how many aphids are on Cotyledon, separate true leafs and the head of the induced plants.

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2010,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#Project ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Creating a system by inserting gene inside bacteria, we can build a ""micro-factory"" for different antigens/antibodies and chemical production so as to archive the above applications.  However, if anything goes wrong, the chemical produced will be highly toxic and become a killing agent rather than a curing agent. Will the developers shed their responsibility and attribute all the faults to bacteria? To prevent such immoral action from happening, we need to set up some rules to clarify who has the duty to bear the responsibility rather than merely blaming bacteria for any undesirable outcomes.
Economic dilemma ?
Imperial iGEM team 2009 mentioned in “Economic factor"" that if the production become available everyone, more people will own it. However, when we look at the today’s society, there are many LICENSED/COPYRIGHTED genes that give a spate of functions. Also, they are applied to series of applications like genetically modified food, gene therapy, DNA vaccine, etc.  All the gene sequence is from the nature and was discovered by scientists luckily. Thus, they exploit the nature / artificial gene to make money.
Most important, they claimed if there is no such an action, there will be a lack of financial support and scientific research cannot be encouraged. This is the dilemma. Will the synthetic biology give beneficial effects to the whole society and lead to sustainable development? Or, is it just a trick to allow poor scientists, funded only by universities, to start a market-dominating business with inexpensive set-up and synthetic biology technology? Unfortunately, we can only get the answer after the application is put into the market for a few years. When synthetic biology becomes a tool for profit-making, this ethics area is urged for discussion among the government and the general public, especially the business sector, before any immoral actions (exploitation of synthetic biology to harm people or damage the environment for profit-making) happen.
Start of life? End of life?
With the new idea – synthetic biology, we can now “reborn” many common and less significant organisms into a well-designed and functioning machine. Is it really an amazing issue?
During the Second World War, physicist Werner Heisenberg was working on a nuclear energy project in Germany. The project turned out to develop a nuclear weapon.  There was a rumor saying that it was his intention to have less success resulted in the project during that period and he warned people that he had the ability to make nuclear bomb. His action gave the Allies army enough time to defeat Hitler’s army. However, it was just an example that a person with a moral mind can override the curiosity"

Aiming to help develop a reliable and detailed protocol to enable direct florescence data comparison between labs, we decided to collaborate with The Measurement Committee as a Interlab study participant.
The Interlab study required us to follow a standard protocol including transformation, incubation, plate reader calibration, florescence standard curve obtainment, cell culture florescence measurement, etc ( Detailed protocol information can be found at https://2017.igem.org/Competition/InterLab_Study ). During the whole Interlab study process, everyone, instructed by the team PI, studied the protocol carefully and worked on providing accurate and reliable experiment data to The Measurement Committee.
1.Transformation of the test devices and +/- control
Unfortunately, we had an unexplained problem while attempting to transform cells with the extracted DNA from the Distribution Kit Plates. Luckily, we heard from iGEM team Worldshaper-XSHS that they have successfully obtained the transformed colony but was unable to continue with the protocol due to lack of a plate reader in their lab. We invited representatives from Worldshaper-XSHS to join our Interlab project, providing transformed colony and they accepted our request. (To learn more about our cooperation, check out our Collaboration page .)
2.OD600 reference point measurement
We strictly followed the standard protocols provided by the Measurement Committee and turned off pathlength correction accordingly.
3.Fluorescein standard curve obtainment
We measured the fluorescence of 4 replicates of dilution series of fluorescein in PBS buffer. The results are as shown below.
4.Cell measurement
We had correctly diluted our overnight transformed cell culture to a target OD600 of 0.02. Then we incubated the diluted culture and took samples at 0,2,4,6 hours after dilution and held them on ice. Then we measured the florescence of these samples and the results are as shown below.

The half clot time of different treatments on the blood was tested and calculated. Specifically, the clotting time of our blood was tested with 70mg of heparin as well as 71mg of heparin in different trials, in addition to either 1mL or 2mL of PNRA or 1mL or 2mL of our construct in order to determine the effects of our construct on the blood clotting pathway. A positive control was also set by having blood with heparin with no cells, to ensure the blood did not spontaneously clot on its own. In general, we were able to show that our construct caused the blood to clot. Although these are preliminary tests, we plan to optimize our construct further in the future in order to determine the resulting flow rates after our construct is applied to ensure that it does not impact the rate of blood flow throughout the rest of the patient’s body."

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and"

As a webpage it’s much more accessible - anyone (even on a phone) could use it without having to install any custom programs which would take both time to install and might require a license.
As far as we’re aware, we’re the first iGEM team to ever put up something like this. The closest was Pretoria UP 2016, but our graphs also contained our entire mass action kinetics model, instead of just a visualization.
It was built in JavaScript and therefore not limited by proprietary license agreements, and doesn’t require Java applets to be enabled (which modern browsers no longer support due to stability and security issues). [2]
JavaScript follows ECMA’s open standard so it can run on purely open-source tools. This helps acheive “iGEM’s goal of making everything in the competition open source”. [3] There are also a lot more open source libraries available for JavaScript which means other teams can build upon our work easier. These include Chart.js, the library we are using to draw the graphs.
Finally, our JavaScript code ran faster than our MATLAB code, which we attribute to both our greater experience in JavaScript and the aggressive optimisation that’s been done by vendors trying to compete for the fastest browsers. [4]
Initial mass action kinetics model
We created our first model following a meeting with Thomas Ouldridge at Imperial, who recently coauthored a paper about mathematically modeling toehold-mediated strand displacement. In the meeting we agreed that we’d need to model the different states of the toehold switch. We also discussed modeling the miRNA binding and unbinding to and from the toehold base-by-base. We later decided against this, as whilst it may have been useful for learning about the kinetics of toehold switches it would not have given us useful information to put into our design process and would have overcomplicated our model.
We first modelled a simple system of 4 substances with reversible reactions as follows:
Where CTS, PBTS and OTS represent the toehold switch in closed, partially bound and open states respectively. At this point we didn’t know the value of the rate constants so we used placeholders.
This was useful as it gave us experience programming in MATLAB, which we hadn’t done before, as well as forced us to learn the foundations for the maths we’d need later; mainly ODEs. Khan Academy was very helpful with this.
With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," glycerol stocks of competent cells that we had made earlier. Unfortunately, neither the fresh nor glycerol stock cells led to successful transformation.
We also made a new batch of spores with the more recent supercompetent B. subtilis colonies we obtained from Dr. Wong and stored them at 4°C and -20°C.
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
We were surprised to see white B. subtilis colonies growing on spec plates. The transformed colonies should have been red since the thrC integration vector contains both the RFP and spec cassettes. Untransformed cells (comK strain) do not carry the spec cassette therefore they should not grow on spec plates; this was confirmed by plating untransformed cells on plain agar and spec plates.
In order to ensure B. subtilis was actually being transformed with our PCR product, we did a colony PCR (Fig. 19.1) using thrC specific primers. We expected to see a 2300 bp product which is the size of DNA within the homologous regions in the thrC vector, this region includes the spec and RFP cassette. We either saw bands around 3000 bp or around 700 bp for B. subtilis transformed with PCR product. A B. subtilis colony that was transformed earlier in the year and expressed RFP also produced a 3000 bp band. Untransformed cells gave us a band around 600 bp). These results suggest that RFP expression was turned off in B. subtilis colonies in which a 3000 bp band was amplified. A mystery band around 700 bp was visible for a few of the samples. A different set of primers which amplified 150 bp more were used for a cPCR (Fig. 19.2). cPCR on untransformed colonies (comK) produced a product around 650 bp while the mystery bands appear around 850. This gel suggests that B. subtilis was being transformed. We speculated the transformed colonies containing the smaller bands kept the spec cassette (675 bp) and removed the RFP from its genome. Dr. Wong had warned us about B. subtilis constantly remodeling its genome under stress.
Figure 4: A cPCR using thrC specific primers was done on B. subtilis colonies transformed with PCR product. P2, P3 and P4 colonies were obtained using Primers containing varying amounts of homologous sequence (293 bp, 190 bp and 125 bp of homologous sequence respectively). A band around 300"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Similar to mutD, three different RBS sequences (B0030, B0032, RBS derived from the upstream of wild type tnaA) were introduced upstream of tetA (cloned from pCM110) by PCR amplification. Plasmid pTrc99A_trp sensor_lacZ was also linearized by PCR to remove lacZ and at the same time introduced with tetA overlap homology. All the primers information was listed in the appendix, primer information. The partial functional part of this plasmid was sequenced. The three constructed plasmids were named after pTrc99A_trp sensor_B0030_tetA, pTrc99A_trp sensor_B0032_tetA and pTrc99A_trp sensor_B0030_tetA, respectively. In this iGEM project, they were named after bitter pressure part 30, 32 and ori, respectively.
Week7(8.6-8.13)
Figure. 9 sweet pressure part construction with pBAD as promoter
Simultaneously, because of the failure of our sweet part to have desired growth dependence on tryptophan measured in the last week, we redesigned our circuit and replaced tac promoter in pTrc99A with more strict araBAD promoter (pBAD). At the same time, we designed random RBS library to control the expression level of malQ. In this way, a proper maltase expression level could be selected and expected to avoid the overexpression problem. The pBAD sequence was derived from (pRedET (amp),produced by Red^R/ ET^RRecombination). Hence, pBAD and tryptophan sensor were PCR amplified, gel-purified and assembled by overlap PCR.
A 5’ end RBS random primer (malQ_RBS_library-F) for malQ was designed to produce the RBS library. pTrc99A plasmid was PCR amplified to remove tac promoter sequence and simultaneously linearized. These three gel-purified fragments were assembled by Takara infusion cloning kit. The plasmid with a random RBS library for malQ was named after pTrc99A_pBAD_trp sensor_random RBS_malQ. For the poor efficiency of the E.coli JW3379 component cell, we firstly transformed the infusion product into E.coli DH5a component cells and 120 single colonies were cultured and confirmed by PCR.

UCLA,2013,Team:UCLA#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," be an Inker. Black and white go well together you see.
Naturally, the public was outraged. Accusations were made that we were harboring racial or political agendas. They called us unnatural and accused us of mocking the racial challenges our ancestors had go through. Thinking ourselves clever, we didn’t defend ourselves, we played along. Initially we had Bleaker rights protests and Inker Bleaker marriages. We had no common agenda, we simply wanted to rebel.
My girlfriend once said as a joke, “we are products of more enlightened times.” She hated the societal hypocrisy. She was young, beautiful, but hated that hypocrisy and cowardice built into the society that made discussion of race impossible over half a century. For her, inking was about protest. For me, it was about the inclusivity.   Aggression between two sides was part of the joke, but there was no denying a strange sort of rivalry developing. Egged on by ever critical responses from the media and social networking sites, both sides set out to provoke the nation. If one side had a protest, other side started a riot. When Bleakers had a swimsuit parade, Inkers had nude flash mobs. Each time both sides tried to outdo one another, the greatest in-joke in the world. Wasn’t it? Maybe I’m deluding myself. I have some responsibility for what happened.
I don’t know when we started taking it seriously. Maybe, I saw some preferential treatment from other Bleakers: better job offers here, little discounts there. Inkers weren’t happy about the preferential treatment. They felt that we were taking it too far. Of course, most Inkers are known for their recklessness in general. Often arrested for outrageous stunts and violence. They were in no position to criticize us.
My legs hurt. I can’t move, or they’ll find me.
It was just another mock-protest. I don’t remember too well what it was about, but there was a couple of picketers with the sign, “God, Save These Wretches”. Couple of Plainskins actually came up to us and started pushing us around. Idiots who couldn't deal with their own problem so they inflict themselves to others. Though this time they had real cause to be angry: a security footage of a Bleaker murdering a Plainskinned woman.
She said we should find other people. She didn’t want to be part of a joke gone stale.
While the offending parties were eventually taken away by the police. Strange mood settled over the crowd. No real accusations, but shift in a"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"ynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi"

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Take a look at our Judging Criteria below!
Motivation
Like all iGEM teams, QGEM 2015 sought out to solve a real-world problem with synthetic biology. Our project this year focused on the topics of organ donation and transplantation surgeries as well as the challenges surrounding these procedures. Each year, thousands are affected by the constant struggle to find organs for people in need, and we wanted to see if science could come to the rescue!
The demand for organs for transplantation has been steadily increasing as waiting lists become longer and longer.  Over 1600 Canadians are added to the organ wait list every year.1 Figure 1 illustrates how over the years the gap between the number of people on organ wait lists and the number of donors has been steadily increasing.
Figure 1.Number of people waiting for an organ in relation to number of donors  and transplants performed over time.Data taken from the US Department of Health and Human Services and numbers are for the USA only.2 **Data includes deceased and living donors.
However, organ shortage appears to only to be one of the challenges to transplant medicine. To effectively tackle this problem, we had to understand the full picture. Along with the increasing demand for organs, we also face inadequate organ preservation methods, limiting the amount of time an organ can be stored for transplantation. This creates a very small window of time for officials to find a compatible recipient for the organ.3 Because of this limiting timespan, organ rejection and incompatibility generates another large problem in the organ transplant field. This leads to the loss of a significant number of organs that become non-viable after harvest.
The image above from the Wisconsin State Journal shows a surgical coordinator storing an organ on ice with a perfusion pump containing UW solution.4
The development of new organ storage and tissue preservation methods for transplantation has been a point of interest in research for over 50 years, and techniques including cryopreservation have greatly improved. Current storage methods involve bringing the organ down to cool temperatures, slowing cell metabolism and storing the organ for a certain amount of time. Storage involves the use of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, a cold storage solution containing solutes at optimal osmotic concentrations. UW also uses metabolically inert substances to maintain this concentration which is ideal for organ storage. The kidney and liver for example,"

We had already a plan to make four systems for our bacteria to degrade plastic. We divided our team into four groups. Each groups focused to each systems. We tried to transform BBa_K592025, BBa_B0015, BBa_B0034, BBa_I0040. The transformation did not have any validate colonies.
Week 4
We targeted to transform parts from iGEM distribution kit. Finally, we could see our red colony from RFP parts. So, we made liquid culture and wait until 16 hours. Then the medium turned into red. We tried to isolate the plasmid using Alkaline Lysis Method. The confirmation of the plasmids isolated were by electrophoresis, restriction and PCR method. The result was positive.
July
Week 1
Finnaly our constructs are already fixed. We ordered our synthetic gene for our main construct and ordered some parts from iGEM Headquarters. Our competent cell was also ready for transforming the other parts that we will use for our construct. We rehydrated BBa_K592025, BBa_J04450, BBa_C0040, BBa_B0017 and BBa_B0015, the colonies was growing well and ready for plasmid isolation. All of the plasmid was confirmed using restriction method and the result was positive. In this first week of July we learnt more about 3A assembly since we are ready to make our construct as well.
Week 2
We are ready to construct our building blocks. But first, we made some optimization method for double digest restriction reaction including for time incubation and reaction compotition. We also received our parts that we had ordered from iGEM headquarter BBa_K103006, BBa_K228004, BBa_K936024, BBa_K339010. We also tried to build our construct using two methods: standard assembly and 3A assembly. Still not work well. In this week we also elaborated and had brainstorming for our next method after our construct had been done.
Week 3
We were ready to try 3A assembly again, we made four different ligation composition to make sure which one will work well. After transformation, finally we got few colony in our petri disc, ready for plasmid isolation. After confirmation for all of the plasmid, we got no right colony yet. We then tried again using PSB1C3 with Rfp for the plasmid backbone instead"

About the University of Exeter
The University of Exeter is situated in Devon, England, in the beautiful city of Exeter. We are regarded as being in the top one percent of Universities in the world, with over 18,000 students from 130 different countries across the world studying on one of three campuses across the South West. We were recently named “Sunday Times University of the Year 2013”, and joined the Russell Group in 2012 to join such Universities as the University of Cambridge, University of Edinburgh and the University of Oxford. Our team is made up of students from the College of Life and Environmental Sciences and the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, both based on the picturesque Streatham Campus.  The University undertakes a variety of world-class research in an array of different subjects, ranging from extrasolar planets to international relations. The University has announced its plans to build a £50 million multi-disciplinary research centre at the heart of the Streatham Campus to look at 'Living Systems'"

To correct this problem, we may need to introduce another strain of bacteria that is vulnerable to phage infection and that competes with the strain that has developed resistance. It is also possible that the phage population will coevolve with bacteria, or that the resistant bacteria may mutate again and lose the resistant gene.
In the future, we will continue to improve our model to incorporate more aspects of our system. For example, we may model the influence of decreasing phage numbers as a result of ELP precipitation. Modelling the interaction between bacteria and phages populations has helped us enormously in understanding the viability, efficiency and sustainability of our design.
COPPER BINDING EXPERIMENT
Another important component of our system is the metal-binding peptide, whose purpose is to sequester the floating metal ions before they are precipitated. To gain an understanding of how efficient our metal binding protein, CUT A, can bind to copper, we conducted an experiment where we added the same amount CUP I to solutions with different concentrations of copper. The figure below shows the result of the experiment.
Figure 10. Copper-binding Experiment Results
For details on the interpretation of this result, refer to our result page.(click here )  Unexpectedly, the result did not show a consistent decrease in absorbance (indicative of a decrease in copper concentration) over time as the enzymes bind to copper. In fact, the concentration of copper appeared to have increased closer to the end of data collection. To understand this peculiar result, we proceeded to construct a model.
COPPER BINDING MODEL
Purpose:To determine how efficiently CUT A, our copper-binding protein, can bind to copper ions.
Definitions of Parameters and Variables:
1. Concentration of Free Copper in Solution
2. Concentration of Free Enzyme in Solution
3. Concentration of Enzyme-Ion Complex
4. Rate of Forward Reaction (Kforward): The rate at which free copper ions bind to CUT A. This is dependent on the concentration of free copper and CUT A.
5. Rate of Reverse Reaction (Kreverse): The rate at which bound copper ions are released. This is dependent on the concentration of free copper and bound copper.

We had presentations from previously iGEM contestants who informed us about the iGEM concept and synthetic biology.
07.05.12:
Team Meeting
We finally agreed on a subject for our project; A bacteria that can convert sugar to a fiber the human body cannot absorb. Making it easier to lose or not gain weight. During the meeting we also did a distribution of different tasks, such as choosing who would be responsible for various groups such as funding, lab work, the podcast with Cornell etc. We also divided the team into these subdivisions: A funding group, a wiki group, a podcast group and a group that would stay in touch with the iGEM team from Bielefeld, Germany.
14.05.12:
Team Meeting
We discussed why obesity is such a huge problem and how we could design our project to solve this problem. We agreed to make a bacteria that can survive in our stomach and transform sugar to inulin. the human body can't absorb inulin and furthermore inulin have a positive effect on the already existing `good` bacteria we have in our stomach. Besides this, we also had an update from the groups of their whereabouts and achievements.
24.05.12:
Meeting with our supervisors
We talked about BioBrick techniques and what kind of materials we would need in the lab. We discussed how to proceed with the funding and when & how to get started in the lab.
Later that day, the team had an iGEM BBQ!

Team Meeting
Not all of the team members were able to be at the meeting, so it was decided to do a detailed plan for the next meeting instead. We made some changes in our project description and end goal, because our original one was pretty similar to a team from an earlier year.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," our project we aimed to degrade biofilm formed by S. aureus which has previously been shown to be susceptible to DNase treatment [12] . The DNase we used in the scope of this project was a nuclease (Nuc).
Figure 3: Mechanism of Nuc
In addition to eDNA, nuclease may also cleave neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) which  are secreted by white blood cells in wounds as a response to bacterial infection [10] . Thus nucleases may interact negatively with the body’s own immune system and it would be of great advantage to create a nuclease that targets bacterial, but not human DNA. Eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA typically exhibit different methylation pattern and some studies have taken advantage of this difference to specifically target bacterial DNA using methylation-dependent nucleases [13] .
To target biofilm, we ordered a nuclease BioBrick BBa_K729004 . Together with a T7 promoter BBa_I719005 , we aimed to express Nuc, characterise its ability to disperse and inhibit biofilms formed by different bacteria and find out whether it displayed any kind of specificity for procaryotic or eucaryotic DNA. Whereas no clear inhibition of biofilm formation was shown, indications for successful dispersal were found.
Exopolysaccharides and Lysostaphin
Key Achievements
Assembly and expression
Testing of bactericidal activity on E. coli
Fulfilling a silver requirement: Demonstrating that lysostpahin works as expected by demonstrating its bacteriolytic activity and its ability to inhibit and disperse S. aureus biofilms
After initial formation, when the biofilm enters the maturation phase of development, intercellular aggregation initiates the formation of the 3D biofilm structure, characterized by cell ‘towers’ equipped with fluid-filled channels. In staphylococci, these structures are predominantly supported by an intricate network of beta-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) and other polymers including teichoic acids. These exopolymers are partially de-acetylated which generates a positive charge on the network. Since cell surfaces are naturally negative in charge, the electrostatic interaction between the cells and the exopolymers reinforces the build-up of the biofilm structure [14] .
A strategy to disrupt the formation of biofilm would be to eradicate the production of S. aureus mediated PNAG exopolymers. Hence, to perform this particular action we chose lys"

Conclusion
Date rape drug sensor
Motivation and Experimental setup
We identified the repressor protein BlcR and its corresponding operator sequence from the blc-operon in Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a potential biosensor basis for the detection of the date rape drug ingredients γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL). First of all, we wanted to verify the binding capabilities of the BlcR repressor by the use of EMSA-shifts. Then we tried our designed sensor system in vivo. To do so we previously needed to test the E. coli strains resistance against the both date rape drug ingredients GHB und GHL (further referred to as analytes). Then we transformed the cells with our sensor, supplemented the media with the analytes and measured the increase of the fluorescence. As the final goal of our project was to create a cell-free biosensor, in vitro tests  followed.
For in vivo characterization, our genetic approach was as follows: We built a device, which contains the blc-operator sequence upstream of the translation enhancing 5’-UTR (BBa_K1758100) and sfGFP. The whole complex is under the control of the T7 Promoter. The plasmid further exhibits the BlcR repressor under the control of a constitutive promoter."

TU Darmstadt
We contacted team TU_Darmstadt to search for help and advice in June. Because this is the first year for our team             to participate in iGEM competition, we are unfamiliar with operating such a project requiring cross-disciplinary             collaboration.
TU Darmstadt is an outstanding team participating in iGEM competition for years. We hoped to learn how they organize             a successful team in both short term and long term. Since one of our team member Yu-Hsuan was studying in Darmstadt,             they kindly invited her to visit them.
During the meeting with TU Darmstadt, they shared their experience and a lot of great ideas about team building,             project designing, fundraising, and more. We also shared ideas about our projects with each other. After talking             to them, we were much clearer about what to do next.
We greatly appreciate the advice and motivation given by team TU Darmstadt, and wish them all the best at the Giant             Jamboree!
HUST-China
NCHU_Taichung was the first time to join iGEM. Early in our tram's formation, we usually encountered some                   problems with no direction at all. Modeling was one of them. We didn't even know how to start, and what                   we should do. At that time, HUST-China contacted us. They needed the shuttle plasmid of Rhodopseudomonas                   palustris-E. coli from our PI. We help them get the plasmid and gave some suggestions on cultivation and                   transformation. Simultaneously, when HUST-China knew that we were frustrated with modeling, they gave advice                   on the direction of modeling, and help us to build it.

The amounts of reagents required for two gels with dimensions 0.07 × 14 × 14 cm and containing 10% and 16% acrylamide are given in the table that follows. Do not degas the gel mixtures, because the gel buffer contains SDS. Overlay the poured gels with several drops of water. Leave the gels for about 30 min to polymerize. (Alternatively, precast gels can be purchased from vendors, and the protocol can be started from Step 3.)The freshly prepared ammonium persulfate (APS) solution and TEMED should be added last, immediately before pouring the gels, because these polymerize the gels.
2. Overlay the polymerized separating gel (10% or 16%, or 16%/6 M urea) directly with a 4% sample (stacking) gel prepared as indicated in the table in Step 1, except if resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired. If resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired, then use AB-6 instead of AB-3 for the separating gel and overlay the separating gel with a 1-cm 10% gel, made up as described in the table. The 16% separating gel and the overlaid 10% ‘spacer gel’ can be polymerized together if no glycerol is added to the 10% acrylamide gel mixture (the common role of glycerol in SDS gels is to increase the density of solutions and to facilitate gel casting; it has no"

Our overall project can be broken down into four sub-projects. These are characterized as the following: Mycelium Material & Habitat Development, Mycelium Glue Project, Mycelium Filter Project, and finally the Mission Architecture that ties everything together. Below are the descriptions corresponding to each subproject.
To view the Experiments and Methods that correspond to the Project Descriptions below, please see our Experiments page linked here.
Mycelium Material & Habitat Development
Mycelium is the vegetative structure of a fungus, and is analogous to the root system of most plants. It is able to branch out and fill in the gaps of various materials and substrates in the goal of gaining as much nutrients as possible. Because of its unique properties and its ability to grow into virtually any mold if there are sufficient nutrients, the use of mycelium has been on the rise. With the goal of creating Martian and Lunar habitats at a reduced cost, the following research has been framed with several off-planet considerations in mind. The optimal conditions for mycelia growth on various substrates were investigated; both for on and off planet applications.
Fungal species used
The primary species of fungus that has been used in the Stanford-Brown-RISD lab is Ganoderma lucidum, unless otherwise noted. G. lucidum was chosen as advised by PhD Candidate Rolando Perez, of the Drew Endy Lab at Stanford University. Perez noted that of the numerous species of fungus he has worked with, G. lucidum has by far produced the strongest mycelium materials, and grows at the quickest rate. Perez and his lab provided the Stanford-Brown-RISD Team with the initial G. lucidum plate of mycelia as well as a live fungal culture to initiate the team’s own mycelium production.
We also obtained wild type Aspergillus oryzae (Fungal Genetics Stock Collection, catalog number FGSC #A815) because of its ease of genetic engineering. This was also a result of our collaboration with the 2018 DTU i"

This stator system Works with Na When this two protein system was established in E. Coli, it showed increased flagellar rotation speed and strength as compared to the original MotA/MotB stator system.

White letters in black boxes and arrows show identical residues and junction sites of chimeric proteins, respectively. Gray and hatched bars indicate putative transmembrane (TM) regions and peptidoglycan binding motif (PGB), respectively. Hypermotile mutations and strain numbers are indicated under the alignment.
Figure 5. Diagram of the properties of each chimeric B subunit. White, gray and hatched bars show the contributions of PomB or MotB from V. alginolyticus, R. sphaeroides and E. coli, respectively. TM, transmembrane region; PGB, peptidoglycan-binding motif. The stator proteins were expressed in V. alginolyticus or E. coli. R. sphaeroides MotA/MotB do not function in E. coli or V. alginolyticus, and PomA/PomB function only in V. alginolyticus. MotBE and PotB7E function in E. coli and V. alginolyticus. The properties of motors containing either protein are essentially the same in both species. Stators containing MomB7E or MomB7R function only in V. alginolyticus.
It is possible that the PomA/PotB59 system could be effective without the PotX and PotY proteins.
In light of the above information, we decided to use the PomA/PotB59 system in addition to the mutant HNS protein to increase the bacteria’s flagellar speed and torque strength.

The brief pathway of acetic acid synthesis is shown in the figure below.
○ Succinic acid[Expand]
Succinate has been recognized as an important platform chemical that can be produced from biomass. [15] There are two main methods in fermentation to synthesize succinate(Fig.1,2). One is under aerobic condition and the other is under anaerobic situation. Gene silence technology [16] can be employed in aerobic pathway. Genes of PoxB, Pta, sdhA and some other enzymes could be knocked out to ensure a high succinic acid yield [15].
Fig.1 Anaerobic pathway
Fig.2 Shikimic acid pathway
○ 3-hydroxypropionic acid[Expand]
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important platform chemical from which several commodity and specialty chemicals can be generated[17]. DhaB, a coenzyme B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase, converts glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA). GdrAB is a glycerol dehydratase-reactivating factor [18]. GabD4, a novel aldehyde dehydrogenase, is responsible for the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids [19]. The brief 3-hydroxypropionic acid synthesis pathway is shown below [20]
○ 3-hydroxybutyric acid[Expand]
Poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) (P(3-HB)) is a polyester of 3-hydroxybutyrate that is synthesized by a variety of microorganisms as intracellular carbon and energy storages under unbalanced nutrients conditions [21-22]. An operon of three genes (organized as phaCAB) encodes the essential proteins for the production of P(3-HB) in the native producer, Ralstonia eutropha [23]. The three genes of the phaCAB operon are phaC, which encodes the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase, phaA, which encodes a 3-ketothiolase, and phaB, which encodes an acetoacetyl coenzyme A (acetoacetyl-CoA) reductase"

- by using confocal microscope, GFP could be seen from the BBa_K577881 overnight culture with arabinose
- from the plate streaked on 28 Aug, green fluorescence could be spotted under UV box

Hi my name is Tyler Griffin and I go to Westinghouse High school. I am in 10th Grade and my favorite school subjects are science and gym. Outside of school, I like to play the game Fortnite on my Playstation 4 with my friends and I also like to ride my bike when it's nice outside.
I'm a cook at the Pittsburgh Zoo and I have been working there for a year now. I also like to read books--lots and lots of books. When it's cold outside, I spend most of my time at the library.
Vianie Henri
My name is Vianie Henri! I am a Senior in the Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences at Duquesne University. I am a Biology major with two minors in Biochemistry and Mathematics. When I am not studying for the next exam I enjoy conducting undergraduate research in neurobiology in the lab headed by Dr. Benedict Kolber. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends and touring the city of Pittsburgh. I am interested in iGEM because it provided me the opportunity to work with and mentor high school students in the exciting field of Biology particularly microbiology.
