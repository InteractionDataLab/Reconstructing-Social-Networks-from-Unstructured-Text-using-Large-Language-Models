William Sawchuk, of ARC Resources
William Sawchuk, a reservoir engineer at Arc resources, agreed to talk with us about the main parts of our project.  This interview confirmed that biological methods, and specifically our project, are definite possibilities of remediation in the oil sands if they can prove to be faster and less harmful than current methods.  One concern that Mr. Sawchuk brought up was that there needs to be extra safety features put in place to avoid posing danger to the environment.  This again, serves to further validate the approach that we took to safety, designing both structural and genetic killswitch devices .  In the later part of our project, we have also been trying to work on establishing a glycine auxotrophic killswitch to add yet another layer of safety which we feel is necessary.
Similar to Mr. Roberge, another thing Mr. Sawchuk brought up was scale-up.  Specifically, he talked about feasibility and how much a scale-up of the project would cost and if this is less expensive than the current remediation methods.  To this end, we have been experimenting with getting our bioreactor to work and have performed an initial validation assay to demonstrate that we can use it in conjunction with our belt skimmer to produce and harvest hydrocarbons, which can be found on our Synergy page. The next step is to scale-up further!  Calculating exact costs is a tricky.  Since the conversion of toxins in the tailings ponds into useful hydrocarbons is a relatively novel idea, it is somewhat difficult to analyze what the cost of a scale-up would be at this point.  This is an extremely important future direction for us however.
Gordon Lambert, VP Sustainable Development at Suncor Inc.
Gordon Lambert is the VP Sustainable Development at Suncor Energy Inc. We asked him whether or not the oil sands industry would find technology such as this useful. There was a very positive response. The Oil Sands Leadership Initiative is very keen on searching for any solutions to tackle the tailings ponds, which are considered to be one of the biggest issues in the oil sands currently. OSLI is collaborating with organizations that run competitions globally for oil sands solutions and other bodies such the Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA). Similar to Kelly Roberge's comment, mature fine tailings can be dried and solidified, but"

This meant bacteria splashed out everywhere, and needed to be replenished at 11 pm (after 4 hours of IPTG induction). However, I also forgot to put the lid apparatuses on the yeast plates. Epic fail. Therefore there was no data from this experiment because we had a signal, but no receiver. However, the cells were kind of old so it’s ok. We will repeat Tuesday.

Results
Through modelling, we got the application amount of dsRNA in different areas of China.
Figure 2. dsRNA application dosage in China
Discussion
It could be seen the minimum application dosage of dsRNA in major grain producing areas of China (Northern China Plain, Northeastern China Plain and Yangtze Plain, Middle and Lower) are about 10.16-15.77mg/mu. This model gave us a direction to optimize our dsRNA production experiment. For almost farmers in China, figure 2 can lead them find the special dsRNA dosage of their own field very easily. Then from figure 1 they can easily find relative water consumption of what king of crop they want to plant to confirm dsRNA dosage finally.

UCL,2016,Team:UCLA#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," the subunit level cleavage was disrupting the formation of the full cage.
These results thus demonstrate that specifically through the addition of a targeted enzyme, we were able to disassemble our protein cages, exposing the inside of the cage to the environment. The enzyme did not affect the wild type cages, thus it was only through our designed introduction of the cleavage site that this was made possible.
We thus show the concept that any similar proteolytic cleavage site could be added in place of the thrombin cleavage site we used, allowing for targeting of other enzymes. Additionally, the cage may be loaded with drug molecules which would be exposed only when in presence of the targeted enzyme to disassemble the cage."

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic"

Food Warden
The Food Warden
The Food Warden is a system which detects meat spoilage. It uses Bacillus subtilis cells. Their natural genetic response to the gases of rotten meat has been identified and linked to a pigment production system. In this way, a consumer can easily see when the meat is spoiled: it's rotten and you know it!
read more
How does it work?
Volatiles from rotten meat activate the PsboA promoter, triggering the production of pigments (blue or yellow).
More details can be found on our Data Page .
Stop the food waste!
Every year, 1.3 billion tons of food are thrown away worldwide (one third of total food production), partly due to the fact that best before dates are imprecise. A reliable way of monitoring whether food is spoiled or not could save money and reduce food waste.

Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Achievement_-_-_TEXT.html," Glucose Meter from the data in the questionnaire concerning the sobriety test. We transformed the idea to design and execute our project and collaborated with a biotech company to create our IGEM Blood Alcohol Meter (iMeter).
We improved of a previously existing BioBrick Part [ BBa_K1694002 ] created by NCTU-FORMOSA in 2015 and entered the information in the part's page on the Registry.
“An alternative version with BamHI site: If you'd like to directly use this part as a vector/backbone for cloning a fusion protein, you should be noticed that an extra NcoI site is present on Cm resistance gene. BBa_K1991004 replaced NcoI site behind LO with BamHI site and provides an alternative choice for cloning a LO fusion protein.”
We demonstrated a functional proof of concept of our project consisting of the BioBrick device [ BBa_K1991009 ].
To show our project working under real-world conditions. We demonstrated our whole system working under simulated conditions in the lab.
This year, we made the impossible possible. With all of our human practices activities and the achievements from the lab work, we believe MINGDAO is eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees.
Integrated Human Practice
“To better understand the problems concerning field (alcohol) sobriety tests, in addition to the lab works, our Human Practices are even more abundant and attractive. On the purpose of understanding law regulations, the breathalyzer devices and the practices, we met judges in the local court, got help from the police officers at the police station and visited nurses and technicians in the hospital. An online survey on the sobriety tests was designed and investigated from the public. And in our campus, we hosted a drink “party” to the teachers and the principal to let them understand and experience the sobriety test. Based on these integrated knowledge, we designed our prototype and collaborated with BIONIME Biotech Corp. to develop a novel blood alcohol meter. We also presented our work on an iGEM team meetup with NCTU_Formosa, NTHU_Taiwan, CGU_Taiwan. With these efforts, we hope we can win the prize.”
Education and Public Engagement
“To let our iGEM project go to the public and educate ourselves and junior students in Mingdao High School, we hosted a variety of activities. First, concerning the issue of alcohol sobriety test, we designed a questionnaire to survey the public's opinion and experiences including general public, school teachers, policemen, judges, health care workers and our"

The results are shown in Figure 21. Using pure methanol and acetonitrile naphthalene is not decayed. In BR-buffer with and without ABTS the decay is nearly completed after one hour treatment. So BR-buffer seems a bad choice to test the degradation of naphtalene under laccase treatment.
Figure 20: Decay of the PAHs naphthalene, acenaphthene and phenantrene in BR-buffer at 30 °C after one hour. The initial concentration was 1 µg mL -1 for all PAHs. After one hour nearly all PAHs decayed completely. (n=2)
Figure 21: Naphthalene decay in four different approaches at 30 °C after one hour. Dissolved in methanol, dissolved in acetonitrile, with BR-buffer and with BR-buffer together with ABTS. (n=2)
HPLC analysis of analgesics
Another class of substrates we wanted to test were analgesics. The three analgesic substrates have different optimal extinction and emission values. Every analgesic had to be tested alone. With diclofenac the extinction and emission values were not found. Therefore the substrate was analyzed with the spectrofluorophotometer but this also showed no clear peak for diclofenac and made it therefore not measurable. Additional, difficulties occurred with ibuprofen. Instead of one single peak we found two and they didn't correlate with the used concentrations.
Outlook
The HPLC results showed that ECOL, BPUL, TTHL and BHAL are able to degrade estradiol in the presence and absence of ABTS. Ethinyl estradiol is not degraded by the bacterial laccases. Just TTHL showed little degradation activities on ethinyl estradiol in presence of ABTS. Due to time reasons and the decay of PAHs in Britton Robinson buffer, the analyses of the PAHs and the analgesics with the HPLC and the LC-MS methods could not been carried out. It would be interesting to analyze the produced laccases with the PAHs and analgesics.  Degradation products were found after treatment of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol with TVEL0 with LC-MS. The next step would be to analyze the possible degradation of PA"

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"ic drift: Engineering proteins to require bipA for functionality means that several residues will have to mutate to render a functional protein that does not need bipA. Multiply the slim chances that a single protein mutates for the three engineered proteins, and the chances of an escapee mutant are really low.
Protection from environmental supplementation: bipA is an artificial compound that will not be found in any natural ecosystem.
Resistance to horizontal gene transfer: The escape frequency will decrease as different auxotrophies are included. Moreover, the difference in the genetic code will help to avoid the horizontal gene transfer. For example, if an essential gene transferred contains the stop codon UAG, this will be translated into bipA and the gene will render an inactive protein.
The advantages and efficacy of this method make it the perfect for our chosen containment mechanism.
Figure 1: This figure explains basics of the chosen biocontainment system, synthetic auxotrophy. Its easy explanation makes it adequate for the general public. This figure was used next to the comic to inform the public about the safety of our project.
Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is the quantitative or qualitative estimation of the risk that a specific threat generates. Performing this analysis in synthetic biology can prove difficult, as there is no certain understanding of how synthetic organisms might affect the environment.
With the development of genetic engineering, a risk assessment protocol for GMOs was developed in 2008 [7] in which a case-by-case analysis of the trait inserted, the strain used, and a release in a specific environment should be performed. However, synthetic biology handles far more complex systems that just one insertion, which will interact among themselves in a way that might affect the cell and therefore, reduce the knowledge about the risk it possesses [1].
In an attempt to develop a more suitable protocol for the release of synthetic organisms in the environment, a group of synthetic biologists and ecologists met at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington DC to discuss on how to assess the risks of synthetic biology [8]. They identified four points of risk research to evaluate the ecological impact of synthetic organisms:
Interaction between synthetic and natural organisms
In the case of a release in the environment, the differences in the physiology of natural and synthetic organisms will have an important impact on the environment. Furthermore, when modified bacteria are released into the environment, their main competitor will be unmodified bacteria of the same species or similar ones. Therefore, it is important to compare the synthetic organisms with their unmodified parent strain: growth rate, toxic effects and growth requirements.
Effect of the synthetic organism on the environment
In case the modified bacteria finds a niche"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," part: Groningen, Leiden, Eindhoven, and us. The meeting was divided in two parts. The first part consisted of every team presenting their project ideas with a brief discussion afterwards. After lunch the brainstorm session started. We divided the group in 4 random subgroups. The groups got to know eachother a bit, and then brainstormed on whatever iGEM related topic they liked. Some groups decided to talk about what team could collaborate with what other team, some teams decided to think about ways to connect in a better way, and some teams thought about how to make iGEM more popular in the Netherlands. After some small presentations of the brainstorm sessions’ results, we discussed several ideas. The outcome of the discussions was:
• a list with contact details and team roles of every Dutch team member has been obtained
• the notion of several collaboration possibilities
• ideas about shared sponsoring and funding
When the discussions were over, the official part came to an end, but some teams ended up ordering pizza and playing board games together. All in all, we feel the day was a success not only for the progress of our projects, but also for getting to know and connecting with our fellow Dutch iGEM teams.
June 24th & 25th – Synenergene Forum
In search for the right conditions for responsible research and innovation, this conference was organized by the Rathenau institute (hyperlink) for all relevant stakeholders when it comes to the future of synthetic biology. Scientists, business people, policymakers and civil society organizations attended, but it was also open for the general public. The promises and pitfalls of synthetic biology were considered from a societal perspective during pitches, presentations, workshops and debates. We attended a workshop about connecting synthetic biology with culture and religion, a link we had not thought about before. During small information rounds, we had the opportunity to talk to experts in the field. We also joined a plenary discussion about freedom and security in an age of synthetic biology. We enjoyed hearing so many different opinions and having the opportunity to talk to experts from all over the world.

Tianjin,2016,Team:Tianjin#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," and enforcement of the environmental protection law, our citizens' consciousness of environmental protection has gradually enhanced and deepened, contributing to the improvement in our environment. As the Environmental Protection Law is called as ‘the strictest law in the history’ by the public，it also has the strongest enforcement. Now many citizens know that all units and individuals shall have the obligation to protect the environment and shall have the right to report on or file charges against units or individuals that cause pollution or damage to the environment. Meanwhile, the people's government gives awards to units and individuals that have made outstanding achievements in protecting and improving the environment.
3. Have there been any disputes over environmental issues in China at present?
Yes. Recently, environmental crime is getting increasing attention from the public. With the deteriorated pollution situation in China, the number of environmental disputes is increasing year by year at a high speed. The environmental dispute is complicated, full of uncertainty, and it involves much public interest. Especially in heavy industrial districts, environmental problems have caused much inconvenience, even some serious health threats to local residents.
4.    In China, what＇s the severest punishment for environment pollution?
No specific items are defined in environmental laws at the moment, but if the circumstances are serious enough to constitute a crime, the offender's criminal responsibility shall be investigated and dealt with according to law. The newly revised criminal law has added the stipulation on the ‘crime of undermining environmental and resources protection’, providing an effective legal base for intensifying law enforcement and punishing crimes related to environment. The penalty works better than other methods in environment crime domain, however, it produces some negative effects at the same time, so it is important to be cautious before determining guilty and investigating criminal responsibility.
5. As our research topic right now is to increase the efficiency of biodegradation plastics, what should we do to apply for a patent if we succeed in development?
If inventors tend to have a fast and safe procedure of patent application, they may choose to entrust professional patent agents. The application mainly has the following steps: inquire about whether your creation is in conformity with the requirement of patent application; if it is, then figure out the patent type; sign the agency agreement and clear the obligation; determine the application; prepare application documents; verify and approve.
6. Is the patent admitted in China still applicable in USA?
No. The first thing to clarify is that the exercise of patent is limited to only national sovereignty so that when applied in mainland (except Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan), the right can`t be extended to USA due to its regionalism. On condition that patent owners"

Nobody can do science on their own, so collaborating is a necessity. We had a lot of contact with the other Dutch iGEM teams, via e-mail and at the different meet-ups we attended. Our biggest collaboration is with the team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, with whom we had a lot of contact in the past months. Furthermore we attended three international meet-ups, in Delft, Wageningen and Leuven, where we had a lot of good conversations about science, iGEM and life.
Collaborate
University of Nebraska-Lincoln
After the UNL iGEM sent around there iGEM survey, The Amsterdam team and the UNL iGEM team got into contact about combining their knowledge and explore the possibilities of a combined future application of their projects.  In this collaboration, the UNL iGEM team and the Amsterdam iGEM team joined forces to come up with a way to reduce methane emissions. Methane emissions have a huge impact on climate change. iGEM team UNL and iGEM team Amsterdam explored the possibilities of feeding fumarate to cattle, in order to reduce methane emissions. We can conclude that fumarate seems a promising molecule for this application. However, since the literature about the possible effect of fumarate is not consistent, the physiology of cattle opposes some challenges and the maximum fumarate yields in certain organisms under our specific conditions are not yet defined.  Actual empirical research must show if this promising route can lead to lower methane emissions and a more sustainable world!

Introduction
In this collaboration, we combine the knowledge on genetic engineering to produce fumarate (team iGEM Amsterdam) and the knowledge on the possible impact of fumarate on cattle physiology (team iGEM UNL). Together, we explore the possibilities of using microorganisms to produce fumarate in cattle intestine, to reduce methane emissions by cattle. We explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies. As iGEM UN"

The DNA smear seen in the gel is a characteristic part of the rolling circle amplification. The final concentration of substrate-bound dCTP molecules was chosen to be 25 µM in the amplification reaction.
Figure 3. Phi29 amplified DNA dependence on the concentration of nucleotide concentrations.
DNA, amplified using multiple displacement amplification was synthesised using 750 - 100µM dNTP concentration with or without 25µM substrate nucleotide concentration. Decreasing the concentration of dNTP’s decreases the amount of DNA amplified only when concentrations lower than 200 µM are used. Red dashed line highlight the chosen condition for MDA reaction.
Next, we seeked to determine the lowest reference nucleotide concentration for the MDA reaction usable with the corresponding 25 µM concentration of substrate nucleotides. While substrate dCTP concentration was constant, the concentration of dNTPs was gradually lowered. In addition to this, reaction without modified nucleotides was carried too, to determine whether the nucleotide concentration or ratio to substrate-dCTP is the product limiting factor. The results indicate that 200 µM and 100 µM final concentrations are too low to be used with 25 µM sub-dCTP (ratios 1:8 and 1:4), because the upper DNA product fades considerably. Taking this into consideration, 300 µM was chosen to be the final working dNTP concentration.
Conclusions
To conclude, the phi29 mathematical description solutions allowed us to acknowledge the potential DNA fragment size shift as a result of inhibitory effects of substrate nucleotides. Based on the output of the model we set out to investigate the inhibitory effects caused by substrate nucleotides in the laboratory. The results generated by the model fit with the experimental data well - higher substrate nucleotide concentrations indeed inhibit the production of long DNA molecules and lead to the synthesis of short ones. This model has immensely helped us to improve our CAT-Seq prototype by showing the possible crucial negative effects of substrate nucleotides. This has helped us to successfully optimize the substrate nucleotide concentration in laboratory in order to receive best possible and sequencing quality and the dynamic range for activity measurements.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#EngineeringJournal_-_-_TEXT.html," the quantitative modeling while he worked on the qualitative modeling. The task I was asked to do was to figure out how to simulate TALE binding to DNA, according to laws of physics. We were hoping for using the electrostatics plug-in and derive the reactions from Brownian motion, but I had no luck with any of these. In fact I doubt whatever Cesar understood the capability of Maya himself, for he too is learning about doing dynamics in Maya just as we are. Probably the ¡°quantitative modelling¡± he envisioned was due to wishful thinking, not based on the capabilities of Maya.
Justin did have made good progress with animating TALE binding to DNA without any physics. He did the most of the work of creating two animations while I rendered them into .avi files. Together we now understand the entire process from importing .pdb files to output animations to .avi files; we are ready for production.
For next week, after meeting with Cesar, we had agreed to focus on animation for now. The physics and details can be added later as we gain experience and insight with the molecules we working on.
Week 15: August 5 - August 9
Justin kept working on animating TALE binding to DNA, except this time he will also add ferritin, coils and linkers. The result is ferritin sphere + 12 TALE's + 24 coils and linkers + 1 DNA. Unfortunately the computer he is working on is not powerful enough to smoothly handle this, as a result of the slow response from the computer his progress has been slow. For me the work is to animate immobilized TALE binding to DNA. The difficulty lies in finding out how TALE should deform such that it can bind to DNA while one end of it is immobilized. For this Justin and I actually spend some time playing with wires that represent TALE and DNA to figure out the proper motion. Moreover Maya just behaves oddly on our computers; sometimes we can't generate DNA using the ePMV plug-in, sometimes the button on Maya's shelf will disappear. As a result we accumulated lots of technical questions that we were hoping to be addressed.
To this end we wished that Cesar would be of help, but our meeting was not of substance. Cesar avoided all of our technical questions; instead he spends lots of time reminding us of the big pictures and the approach he would like to see. He actually advised us to abandon the way we had been doing animation, which is by key framing, and switch to Nucleus engine. Given that the animation we tries to build are already complicated for"

This intervention collected valuable information on public opinion, in addition to cultivating internal discussion within the participants as they were forced to question their own beliefs—and to what extent those beliefs were held. Read more about it in our What is Natural? storyline!
Additionally, we collaborated with the UCLA iGEM Team for an interview in our At What Cost? storyline. Interested in learning more about how the Do-It-Yourself biology movement was affecting the ambitions of young synthetic biologists and bioengineers, we reached out to the UCLA team to learn more about their thoughts on this movement. We were happy to see our friends at the UCLA iGEM team once again, and we are grateful for them for giving their time for our interview and questions. Lastly, we collaborated with the Virginia iGEM Team by contributing our answers and views to their Biocontainment survey.

Production of RiAFP E.coli
E.coli Protocol
Tricine SDS-PAGE (%16) under reducing conditions.
Lane 1: E.coli (JM 109, BL21 STAR, Rosetta Gami) soluble fraction lysate post-IMAC 16.6 KDa Der f 2 (SES)
Lane 2 and Lane 3: Molecular weight marker.
Lane 4: E.coli (TOP 10, BL21 STAR) soluble fraction lysate post-IMAC 13.7 KDa RiAFP
IMAC purification of two different proteins (RiAFP & Der f 2) revelead that several metal affinity proteins prevent a clear visualization of our proteins of interest in SDS-PAGE. Moreover, RiAFP (13.7 KDa) was absen in the gel. We believe that in both proteins, their Histidine tags remained enclosed within the inner structure of the protein, restraining the purification of the proteins by affinity cromatography.
Viability assay of TOP10 F and BL21 STAR strains induced with two different promoters
In this experiment, BL21 STAR and TOP F' strains were transformed with RiAFP and treated with Arabinose +NaCl and Arabinose as inductors, measuring viability after each freeza-thaw cycle. Our most significant treatment was RiAFP +BL21 STAR strain induced with Arabinose +NaCl. We found out that the effect of RiAFP becomes more evident over the number of cycles.
ANOVA test to prove the significant effects of individual treatments on cell viability for each strain. Circle, cross and dash indicate possitive, negative and neutral effect respectively.
Increase of cell viability ratio between BL21 STAR transformed with RiAFP and BL21 STAR not transformed cells, over freezing-thawing cycles.
Conclusions RiAFP
RiAFP presence was not conclusively determined by SDS-PAGE; nevertheless, RiAFP viability tests demonstrated significant difference between positive and negative transformants, suggesting expression of the protein in the cells. Further experimentation with variable inductor concentrations would be needed to optimize cryopreservation conditions of RiAFP, as well as longer storage periods. Given the advantages of the RiAFP transformants, we speculate, increase in the competency of RiAFP (+) cells will be measured by comparing the transformation efficiency between positive and negative RiAFP-transformants.

Induction of colitis by TNBS
There are several ways to model IBD[1]. Team SYSU-MEDICINE used a drug TNBS (2,4,6-trinitro benzene sulfonic acid) to induce colitis, thereby modeling IBD. In analogous to human IBDs, the IBD mice shows many similar symptoms including intestine inflammation and weight loss. The experimental flow is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Figure 2. Diagram of the TNBS induced colitis. hEGF (5 μg in 25 ml enema) or saline enema was performed in Day 8.
TNBS colitis procedure
On day 1, carefully shave a 1.5 × 1.5 cm field of the skin of the mouse using an electric razor. To avoid the mouse from touching TNBS (may potentially induce oral tolerance), preferentially select an area on the back between the shoulders.
While holding the mouse with one hand, apply with the other hand, using a 200 ml pipette, 150 ml of the TNBS presensitization solution to the shaved abdominal skin. The solution is absorbed by the skin quickly. Control mice are treated with presensitization solution without TNBS. Leave the mice until day 8.
On day 8, weigh and mark the mouse.
Anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 150 ml of 5％ chloral hydrate solution per 20 g body weight.
Fit a 3.5 F catheter to a 1 ml syringe and fill with TNBS solution.
Insert the catheter into the colon 4 cm proximal to the anus. Proceed carefully to avoid damage or perforation of the colon wall.
Slowly administer 150 ml of TNBS solution per 20g body weight into the colon lumen.
Remove the catheter gently from the colon and keep the mouse with the head down in a vertical position for 60 s. To get reproducible results, it is important to ensure that the TNBS solution remains completely in the colon lumen.
Return the mouse to the cage.
hEGF alleviates IBD symptoms
The IBD mice showed many symptoms, including weight loss and colon length reduction (Fig. 3 and 4). As illustrated in Fig. 2, we sacrificed mice after 5-day treatment with hEGF or saline, and measured the weight changes over time, as well as the colon length"

BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Two wells were made using the thick end of a 1000 µl pipette tip. Aspartate solution was pippeted into the left hole and water into the right (as a control) . Half of the plates had thr solutions added in the morning, in order to set up a chemotactic gradient to set up. The other half of the plates had their solutions added immediately before the inoculation in the afternoon (arond 5 hours later). The E. coli MG1655 strain was inoculated three times on a line in the centre between the two holes and incubated overnight at the different temperatures: 25°C, 30°C and 37°C.
The plates were photographed and measured. There was some significant increase in movement towards the aspartate (chemoattractant), but the difference should be more visible. Thus, various conditions should be tested during the next experiments.

BioBrick Transformation
SOC medium was made in preparation for Biobrick transformation.
Chambers for bacteria-moving-bead assay
The first trial in making wells as in the diagram (See below) was made, but it was found that a different glue is needed. Nevertheless, in the first chambers a blue dye in 0.3% agar (to represent aspartate) and an orange dye in 0.1% agar to represent the bacteria was put (beads were added in later experiments). Pictures were taken at 30 minutes intervals. This was to see how long a chemotatic gradient would take to set up. However, after three hours no gradient was obvious, so the chambers were left overnight.
The dye plates were observed: They had dried out somewhat overnight, however the dyes had mixed well. The experiment was carried out again with whatman paper soaked in water in 15 cm petri dishes to make a humid environment. This time swimming medium (see table below) was also used instead of the 0.1% agar used before as this may be more like what we use in the final experiment.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," terms of secondary structure, repeats, forbidden motifs and homology to the genome of V. natriegens.
The selected sequences were flanked by synthetic transcriptional terminators that were developed in the lab of Christopher A. Voigt (Chenet al. 2013.) . Most terminators were described to be unidirectional (Chenet al. 2013.) and therefore the orientation of the flanking terminators had to be considered. Our priority was to prevent transcription into the respective transcription unit from the upstream sequence. Therefore each spacer sequence was equipped with a strong terminator at the 3’ and 5’ end of the 5’ connector in forward and reverse orientation, respectively.
We expect to achieve the best reduction of crosstalk between neighbouring transcription units by combining our insulators in combination with connectors that facilitate inversion of an individual transcription unit, thus providing a large step towards the reliable and predictable design of synthetic circuits.
Selection of parts
In addition to the connectors that form the scaffold of our toolbox, we evaluated which parts should be integrated into the Marburg Collection. As a starting point, we focused on parts that are already commonly used in E. coli to demonstrate their compatibility with our new chassis V. natriegens. Therefore we integrated all 20 promoters of the Anderson Library, four
RBS
from the Community Collection and the most frequently used reporters and terminators. We also included two well established inducible promoters, three widely used oris and the four resistance parts covering the antibiotics used by iGEM.
In addition to this standard set of parts, our toolbox provides N- and C-terminal fluorescence and epitope tags to facilitate fluorescence microscopy and protein purification and degradation tags that can be used to finetune protein levels. Lastly, we submitted all project related parts that can be used to perform genome engineering via CRISPR/Cas9 or natural competence and all enzymes that were used in our metabolic engineering project.
Summary of the features of the Marburg Collection
The Marburg Collection is designed to be the most flexible golden-gate-based toolbox for prokaryotes. The high degree of flexibility of our toolbox is achieved by the de novo construction of plasmids instead of using entry vectors like most other toolboxes. A novel core feature are the connectors that provide the fusion sites for subsequent cloning steps and can be used to set the order and orientation of each individual transcription unit. A set of newly designed insulators, consisting of “neutral DNA”, and two transcriptional terminators, are designed to minimize crosstalk between neighbouring transcription units.

How are we proposing to solve the problem?
There is currently no commercial antibiotic that specifically targets bacterial biofilms, but researchers have identified a range of bacterially-derived biomolecules that degrade and destroy biofilms. As such, our project involves the engineering of bacterial strains to make them produce and secrete enzymes that can destroy the pathogenic bacteria and the biofilms they make. The beauty of the antibiofilm agents we plan to use is that they have been shown not to induce resistance in the target bacteria, meaning that having them continually produced at a low level will not be nearly as bad as with traditional antibiotics. Our system is applicable to a whole host of biofilm environments and with a simple design that can be used in multiple sectors, we hope to get a step further in providing a novel approach to treating microbial infections.
In terms of product formulation and design, we hope to ultimately arrive at a functional proof-of-concept e.g. an enzyme-secreting infection-clearing catheter or a modular system that continuously and cheaply cleans out pipelines, and to achieve that we have a 16-strong interdisciplinary team comprising 1 engineer, 2 physicists, 2 chemists, 2 biologists, and 9 biochemists working on different aspects of the project in parallel.

Edinburgh_UG,2016,Team:Edinburgh UG#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," storing large amounts of data.
Though very positive of our idea, they confessed that DNA data storage would not work best for them. The simulations and research they facilitate require data to be generated and stored instantly and in high volumes, whereas DNA has a read and write time that is too slow to accommodate supercomputing. They suggested that we meet with librarians or archivists that store important, historical data for long periods of time. It is important to securely store this kind of data since it is often unique and cannot be regenerated or simulated.
They agreed that using Basic English as a proof of concept was very illustrative of our method, however, they pointed out that we should view the information coded in BabbleBricks to be flexible and that we should stress its arbitrary nature to others. Along with saying that this was one of our strengths, they encouraged us to come up with some sort of cost analysis comparing our assembly method to other storage techniques. They said that defining the ‘workflow’ of our project would help us decide whether we envision a BabbleBlock factory that stores all data in DNA, or whether we could scale down the system to a single machine.
EDINA AND MAIN LIBRARY
We were lucky enough to sit down with 5 librarians and data librarians from the University of Edinburgh Main Library. This big group meeting was great since some of the librarians actually had a background in genetics or biochemistry which meant we were able to get valuable and varying feedback.
The main points they raised were that data hardware and software are getting outdated. Often times data access is restricted by the software used to read the hardware. Though we are confident that our hardware (DNA) will last a long time, this really made us think about the future of DNA sequencing. With the current advancements in sequencing technology (ie. MinION) we also feel confident that the software needed to sequence our DNA will only improve.
One concern they raised was the limitations of how many BabbleBricks we could produce. At the time our 5bp information coding region allowed for 1,024 unique BabbleBricks. They expressed concern that this was not enough combinations to store different types of data. This feedback fed into the creation of BabbleBrick 1.7, which is a new version of the BabbleBrick system, storing jpg images in DNA.
Finally, they again questioned how we planned to physically store the DNA.  After explaining to them the different techniques of keeping DNA (dried, in a solution etc.) they offered us the opportunity to test the fidelity of our DNA in their existing storage conditions. This was"

This test is to show the specificity of mutant PUF-PIN. Theoretically, we will see fluorescence.

This test was to test the effects of the PUF-PIN endonuclease activity on a reporter other than YFP to pinpoint possible problems stemming from a YFP reporter
mCherry + Specific Binding Site in Protet plasmid+ mutant PUF-PIN in pBAD30 plasmid
This test is to show mutant PUF-PIN's functionality. Theoretically, no fluorescence will be observed.
Theoretical Results
The above chart shows our predicted results. The control binding sites are predicted to bind both wild and mutant PUF-PIN fusion proteins. The only non-expression combinations are when we match a PUF-PIN or mPUF-PIN to it's respective binding site which should result in endonuclease activity and subsequent silencing of the YFP reporter gene.

She revealed the ground-breaking but occasionally controversial nature of synthetic biology and iGEM's role within it. Members of the audience showed surprise at the progress, discussions and possibilities that synthetic biology represents.
Josi recounts that the other talks and the audience were mainly in the field of the social sciences and that her talk had impressed and rattled the audience with its originality and raised questions they would otherwise have left unasked.
Here's the TEDx profile for the event at the main TED website.

Team St Andrews spoke to crowds at University of St Andrews 600th Anniversary Event Food for Thought on Sunday. The DNA extraction from bananas and a ""create your own superhero"" game were popular with the kids again. We took full advantage of having a stand next to the tent entrance: At least two of us were constantly engaged in conversation with visitors, giving mini-lectures explaining the basic principles of synthetic biology, DNA and iGEM and discussing the surrounding ethical and safety concerns.

NAU-CHINA,2018,Team:NAU-CHINA#testwsq_-_-_TEXT.html," and the results also confirm preliminarily that our upstream circuit can work normally. However, we have to admit that due to we chosed GFP as our reporter gene, it is difficult to distinguish it from cell surface-expressed GFP. Our verification experiment is not intuitive. If we need to prove the function of TEV suppressing the inhibition of tetR strongly, further optimized experiments are still needed.
Downstream circuit
The downstream pathway is the core circuit for us to realize the threshold function. According to literature [3], they have verified the inversion function of the three recombinases in prokaryotic cells and proved the threshold function of the recombinases, i.e. the recombinases do not have the inversion function at low concentration. Only when the concentration of recombinase reaches a certain threshold, can the recombinases work normally.
According to the same document, we designed our pathway in eukaryotic cells, expecting to realize threshold switching in eukaryotic cells. For this reason, we try to test the inversion function of recombinases and the threshold characteristics of the combination of three different recombinases ( Bxb1, TP901, PhiC31 ) and three promoters with different intensities ( miniCMV, EF1 - α, Ubc ) in eukaryotic cells.
We also verify the function of RDF [4] to demonstrate our 0/1 switch resettable in HEK 293T cells.
Pronuclear verification of Bxb1 recombinase plasmid given by Peking University
Before the eukaryotic verification of the recombinases, we performed prokaryotic verification of Bxb1 recombinase.
Two plasmids with different resistances and origins of replication were used for function verification of the Bxb1 recombinase. One of them is a reporter gene plasmid, which uses the constitutive promoter J23119. The recombination site is located on both sides of the promoter: one side is sfGFP, and the other is mRFP. The other plasmid is a recombinase expression plasmid using PBAD, an inducible promoter, which is induced by arabinose. When the two plasmids were co-transfected into E. coli, the reporter plasmid expressed sfGFP, a kind of green fluorescent protein; when the inducer arabinose was added, the recombinant enzyme was expressed, the promoter was inverted, and the mRFP , a kind of red fluorescent protein, was expressed.

Hence, the complete complex encompasses an overall mass of 330 kDa and enables M. capsulatus to turn methane into a natural intermediate of the cellular metabolism. Thus, our aim was to isolate the DNA segments encoding the six MMO subunits (MMOX, MMOY, MMOB, MMOZ, MMOD, MMOC) from M. capsulatus and equip the well-characterised intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli with them. Thus, the transformed E. cowli would become capable of metabolizing methane.
After isolating the genes encoding each MMO subunit the biggest challenge would be to stably produce the functional enzyme complex in E. coli. To facilitate protein folding our plan, therefore, was to introduce a special combination of chaperone proteins. Having determined the right combination for proper producibility of all subunits in E. coli the enzyme complex would be assembled in one final construct, thus creating our methane degrading E. cowli. Establishing a stable expression of the MMO complex in E. coli and enabling the degradation of methane would be the first step towards a genetically modified bacterium administered to cows.
Nevertheless the question of its feasibility as well as the efficacy in a non-laboratory environment has to be addressed. Although E. coli is a natural inhabitant, the designed E. cowli is possibly not able prevail inside the rumen due to the presence of inhibiting substances. Furthermore, the safety of introduction of a genetically modified organism has to be considered. To protect the cow from E. cowli and vice versa we also evaluted the beneficial effects of entrapment inside an alginate matrix. Therefore, we contacted Dr. Ulf Prüße, an expert for immobilization of enzymes and bacteria. Read the whole interview here .
Past Approaches
Past strategies for reducing the methane emissions from ruminants like cattle can be subdivided into two main approaches: Firstly, approaches aimed directly at the methanogens, and secondly, approaches aimed at other microorganisms of the rumen which provide the methanogens with substrates for methanogenesis [1] . The methanogens engaged in such symbioses are also called protozoa-associated methanogens (PAMs) and account for about 37 % of the methane produced in the rumen [2] .
The substrates for methanogenesis vary greatly among different methanogenic organisms because they use different modes of methanogenesis"

Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (Characterization Assays)
Introduction
Phosphate buffered saline (abbreviated as PBS) is a buffer solution commonly used in biological research. It is a salty solution buffer that helps to maintain a constant pH. The osmolarity and ion concentrations of the solution usually match those of the human body (isotonic).
Safety Precautions
SDS (safety data sheet): Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.
PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment. This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.
Materials
Reagents

Backbone pSB1C3 was used for PcelA and PcomFA construct. PcelA / PcomFA gene was fused with BBa_E0240 , which contains a medium RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), GFP ( BBa_E0040 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ). The purpose of this GFP generator is to indicate the functionality of PcelA and PcomFA in the presence and absence of σx. BBa_E0240 was obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit. The bacterial strain of E. coli used is DH10B.
PCelA / PcomFA gene
Identifying the Possible Promoter Regions
To date (12 Oct 2014), the core/minimal promoter region of PcelA has not yet been experimentally defined. In locating the promoter region required to initiate transcription, iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST team attempted in making educated guesses based on relevant information available from the literature. The Com-Box promoter consensus sequence “TACGAATA” was BLASTed for targets in the Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes of strains R6, D39, ATCC7699 and NCTC7465 in the NCBI database. Genome of strain NCTC7465 was particularly given attention because its gDNA was available for manipulation. A list of loci with annotated genes returned. σx was known to turn on late competence gene and therefore loci containing any of those genes documented were favored and filtered for. Those loci were then manually checked for consensus among the 4 genomes mentioned above. A sequence of 67 base pairs stood out as a promising target because it was 1) upstream of a late competence genes celA (encodes competence protein CelA), and 2) was identical across the 4 genomes. This 67 bp region has varying upstream sequences and the potential promoter region can reach as far as 200bp. Different truncations (67, 100, 150, 180, 249, 300 bp) were planned for deciding the minimal"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Today I prepared the culture for miniprep of the LacI generator ligated negative cascade plasmid, riboregulator plasmid and locks and keys. Also I prepared some extra samples for sequencing. Also I prepared cultures for miniprep tomorrow for samples which has to be given for sequencing again (medium control RBS, Normal control RBS, LacI generator) and for reverse primer sequencing.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," of concept for this construct we fused sfGFP to its N-terminus:
Lv1 -plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-LOV2-PTS1 fusion protein
This was done in order to visualize our experiment’s results during microscopy: upon successful import of the fusion protein, one would observe GFP fluorescence localized to our compartment. Otherwise, the whole cell would be illuminated.
Pex7 import
The idea behind this project is to initially block the protein of interest’s PTS2 with a fluorescent protein which can be removed by an optogenetically activated TEV-protease. For this project we use the protein Phytochrome-B from Arabidopsis thaliana and its interaction partner PIF6. These two proteins, also derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, bind together upon irradiation by red light (660 nm) and separate upon irradiation with far-red light (780 nm). We used this property to activate a split version of a TEV-protease whose split halves were each fused to one of the two optogenetic proteins.
The TEV-protease was obtained from the Biobrick BBa_K1319004. This variant contains the anti self-cleavage mutation S219V. Using overhang-PCR we created a split version of the Biobrick protease based on work done by Wehr et al. [2] and the iGEM team Munich 2013. The split was made between amino acid 118 and 119.
Our construct for attaching proteins N-and C-terminally is highly variable: it consists only of a TEV-cleavage site, the PTS2 sequence and a short linker and was designed as a 3b-part for the yeast-toolbox(LINK). This means that we can attach any protein to its N- or C-terminus we desire.  We planned on attaching different fluorescent proteins to each sides of the 3b-part in a Lv1-ligation(LINK). For our experiment we planned on using the pairs mTurquoise-mVenus and GFP-mRuby.
Lv1 -plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-PTS2-Ruby fusion protein
The two other constructs were planned as follows: Phytochrome B was fused to the C-terminal TEV-half, PIF6 was fused to the N-terminal TEV-half. The PhyB-TEV2 part and the TEV1-PIF6 part were supposed to be inserted into a shared plasmid via a LV2 Golden Gate ligation. Finally, the Lv2-plasmid and the"

Week 1
plot normal distributions of the separate systems.  see Method section for example.
Week 2
look for differences in production of GFP by tweaking the parameters.  Chose the best sets from the lognormal distributions between the confidence interval it gave me to work with for the combined system. Found four sets that can give the responses we want.
Week 3
Calculate growth rate for the e. coli used by Thomas.
Week 4
Tried the Event function in Matlab to generate oscillations in the system. This failed due to the fact that it could be only used for single cells and not for multi cell populations. We did not know that this was a limitation of the function.  Try to look at the effect of the total volume for a single cell and multicell, but the multicell was not possible.
October
Week 1
I got a code for generating oscillations from my supervisor, but it needed to be debugged. So I spended the week on doing this myself and together with my supervisor.   Make a heatmap for the subpopulation system about the ratio of lambda-cl and 434 compared to the RFP production.
Week 2
look at ratios lambda-cl and 434 to compare with the data Thomas got from the lab. He used a library for the promoter from the subpopulation system. Tried to simulate the combined model with total RFP.

Sequencing Data arrived, showing that the vectors did not pick up an insert at all, and re-circularized without one. Seems as if inverse PCR was successful. Tail sequence of forward primer shown perfectly, tail sequence of reverse primer shown partially by sequencing. Plan is to re-do the digestion of gblocks and pFTV and then ligate, transform again. Inverse PCR completed again, this time shows extremely faint bands. We know that this was successful at least once because of the sequencing data, but we haven't been able to replicate it.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html,". The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.
To complete the final systemn network from initial conditions, we break up the task to several parts:
Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file;
Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species;
For each template species found matching, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both at the same time;
For each template reaction found possible to occur, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction;
For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied for given constraints, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
Go to step 2 until the end of the species list;
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
Figure 1: Algorithm Flow Chart
Special reactions and volume strategy
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions. The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. It means number of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute"

Thursday (07/27/17)
Another meeting was held to discuss the presentation and viability of the Michigan State Trip. Students from both labs went over their combined presentation and rehearsed thoroughly.
Sense/Respond: Hayley and Tina prepared cultures of GFPa1 and sfGFP from the plates. Dallas transformed the iGem cultures but sadly failed. Dr. Goodson recommended that they regrow the plates and proceed again tomorrow. Later in the day, the young researchers finalized their plan for ""flat Stanley"" and the outreach survey they hope to do in the future.
Packaging: To start the morning, the RXers spent a portion of time discussing the Friday presentation with Vanessa. Later the team performed a transformation of the ligation from the previous day and continued preparing for their presentation.
Friday (07/28/17)
The morning began bright and early with a tour of a C-17 cargo plane on base. It was a great bonding experience for teams from both labs as they took pictures and learned about the C-17 aircraft. The RX group mentally prepared to present their project later in the afternoon to some high-ups and members of their lab. The RH Lab planned to attend and give them support. The presentation went very well and the RX lab members received a stellar ovation.
Sense/Respond: Later in the afternoon, the RH lab would be preparing a mini-prep for the Well 3, 18K competent cells provided by iGem. The students had just found out yesterday that the cultures finally worked and that they could start proceeding to the next step, which was extremely exciting. As experts in the lab now, the group was able to follow the protocol with ease and completed the protocol accurately and quickly.
Packaging: Both the RH and the RX teams participated in a tour of a C-17. Afterwards, the RXers presented their project at a Journal Talk. Vanessa suggested troubleshooting by sending samples of pBAD-CsgA off for sequencing. Additionally, the University of of Michigan mutant strains of E. coli arrived. Once the preparation for sequencing was completed, the team met at UES for a bit before leaving for the weekend (Michigan State!)
Week 10: July 31-August 4
Monday (07/31/17)

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," a laboratory facility where the VOCs is extracted and added to the yeast media.
For the design of the prototype, a relatively small device was considered desirable in order to make it easy to use. It would also be good, for both practical and environmental reasons, if as much as possible of the device was reusable to enable easy cleaning. A two-part option was therefore considered. One main part where the fiber-filter could be placed and one mouthpiece to blow through. In this design, only the filter would be disposable.
Another important part of the design is to minimize the impact of the surroundings. Since the system will be very sensitive, it is important to avoid that air, other than the exhaled air from the patient, comes in contact with the fiber. For this purpose, valves in the mouthpiece and in the end of the device could be used.  To control the background levels of the VOCs, the test should take place in a controlled hospital or laboration facility with oxygen masks or VOCs free air to inhale if necessary. Since the secretion of VOCs also can depend on the food intake, the patient is restricted not to eat a couple of hours before the test, in order for the result to be reliable .
The printing
With these thoughts in mind the prototype was designed in CAD, as may be seen in Figure 4. In addition to this, the team also contacted a former iGEM team member David Hansson, now working with his master’s thesis on the department of Systems and Synthetic biology at Chalmers University of Technology. He offered to aid with 3D-printing of the prototype and he printed the first prototype after the provided design.
Figure 4. The design with the mouthpiece placed beside the main part.
After some consideration the prototype was deemed slightly too big. The mouthpiece could be too big and therefore hard to blow through and the whole device seemed unnecessary long. David made it shorter and scaled it down and printed it again. This time the prototype was perceived too small for holding in the hand even though the mouthpiece was more suitable. The design was therefore settled on a mixture of these two alternatives. The mouthpiece from the smaller version was extended but the size was otherwise kept. The main part had the same size as in the bigger version but was shortened. The final version of the prototype is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5. The final prototype design with the filter removed.
The idea of how to use the device is to place the fiber-filter in the opening, exhale through the device, pause for a minute, exhale through again and repeat this a"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," regulators can alter cell behaviour through protein interactions, transcriptional regulation, or RNA binding (Gao et al., 2007). In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of biosensors produced using synthetic biology methods. Synthetic biology involves the application of engineering principles to the manipulation of biological systems. Biosensors constructed using these methods adapt the native cellular biosensing processes discussed previously, such as protein or RNA binding, and use these interactions to induce transcription of a reporter gene, such as a fluorescent protein. These sensors may be expressed as living whole-cell sensors, but are also increasingly being expressed in cell-free protein synthesis systems. However, thus far, the costs of these systems has been prohibitive to wide-spread use in synthetic biology (Smith et al., 2017).
Why are Biosensors Useful?
One main advantage of synthetic biology based biosensors is their cost-effectiveness. After the research stages, production of the biosensor relies only on the maintenance of a population of cells expressing an engineered system, which is a relatively cheap process in comparison to other traditional methods such as immunoassays or mass spectrometry. Synthetic biology biosensors can be designed to have no dependence on additional equipment, which not only adds to their cost-effectiveness, but also enables onsite diagnostics (Bhatia & Chugh, 2013). Synthetic biology approaches also enable the introduction of more complex behaviour into biosensor designs, such as logic gates which allow for signal generation in response to a variety of simultaneous triggers (Chappel & Freemont, 2011). One specific example of a biosensor is an arsenic biosensor, developed by Aleksic et al. (2007). This sensor was able to generate pH changes in response to the presence of arsenic in drinking water. In this system, ArsR, an arsenic responsive transcription factor, represses the pArs promoter in the absence of arsenic. When arsenic is present and bound to ArsR, the protein no longer binds and represses the promoter, enabling the transcription of downstream genes. In this example, the downstream gene is urease, which generates a detectable pH change. Therefore, the presence of arsenic can be detected by the monitoring of pH.
What problems do Biosensor Developers Face?
Our project focuses on the challenges of biosensor development: If synthetic biology biosensors are so much better than the alternatives, which are often expensive and not capable of onsite diagnosis, why isn’t their use more widespread? In an attempt to answer this question, we consulted various stakeholders in biosensor development: both in and outside the field of synthetic"
Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest TargetingTest_-_-_TEXT.html,", since it is lacking flagella [3] .
The final stage, were the Targeting system is combined with the Sensing system. In the absence of Yersinia enterocolitica, the activator YenR will interact with the yenbox and induce the expression of cheZ..
Stage 2
Since we did not know how different expression levels of cheZ would affect motility, we decided to combine cheZ with constitutive promoters of different strength to see if we could find the optimal expression level of cheZ. The promoters were all from the Anderson family of constitutive promoters available in the iGEM registry of parts. The promoters were the following, with their relative strength within parentheses:
J23100 (2547)
J23113 (21)
J23114 (256)
The same RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) was used for all constructs.
Stage 3
This final stage was simply our regulatory system, the Sensing system, combined with the RBS and cheZ. The idea was that transcription of cheZ would be increased when far away from the pathogen and reduced when close to the pathogen.
Result
All motility tests were carried out on tryptone swarm plates (10g/L bactotryptone, 5g/L NaCl, 2,5g/L agar) based on a protocol from 2011’s WITS CSIR team [2] . Overnight cultures were grown to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0,5) in LB medium and then inoculated on swarm plates.
In figure 1, a selection of the results of our swarm plate assays is presented.
Figure 1. Swarm plate assays. 1A, 1B and 1C were performed on the same batch of swarm agar plates as 1D, 1E and 1F, respectively.
The following strains are present in the figure:

The Bacterial Etch-a-Sketch
Abstract
The Etch-a-Sketch project aims to create a lawn of bacteria that can be drawn on with a laser pointer. This seemingly inconsequential task actually presents many interesting engineering challenges. In particular, the bacteria need to be sensitive enough to respond to a short light pulse from a laser, but still “selective” to not respond to ambient lighting. We have designed a novel genetic switch to tackle these problems. If our work proves successful, it will serve as a useful model for future projects that require large signal amplification. For example, researchers creating biosensors may find our work very helpful.

Formation of new patterns
by
programming  cell motility
Abstract
The ability of living organisms to form patterns is an untapped resource for synthetic biology. The HKU iGEM2008 team aims to generate unique patterns by rewiring the genetic circuitry controlling cell motility. Specifically, E. coli cells are programmed to autonomously regulate their movement by sensing local cell density. Interesting patterns are formed by two types of newly engineered cells. The low-density mover cells spread outwards and spontaneously form a distinctive ring of low cell density surrounded by rings of high cell density whilst the high-density mover cells form a Mt.Fuji-like structure. Moreover, we build a theoretical model that satisfactorily fits our current experimental data, and also predicts some parameters which may significantly affect the ring formation. The study of this self-organized spatial distribution of cells helps us to understand principles underlying the formation of natural biological patterns, and synthetic non-natural patterns have various potential applied uses.

Overview
The iGEM2008 iHKU team aims to  deliver a brilliant project this year. We major in multiple disciplines  including Biochemistry, Bioinformatics, Physics, and Chemistry. Using our  different backgrounds and modalities of thought, we complement each other in  developing new ideas, and in carrying out wet/dry lab work ( Team ).
Pattern formation is one of the  most common yet fascinating biological phenomena happening in our daily lives,  though for centuries, biologists, physicists and mathematicians have struggled  to understand its nature. How do highly ordered patterns arise from a few  living cells? How can our hands, our eyes, our bones form their shape with such  low error rates? These questions are fascinating and crucial. The fundamental  elements in biological pattern formation are cell growth, cell movement,  cell-cell communication, and differential gene expression. In this project, we  aim to form new patterns by controlling cell movement, using a single strain of engineered bacteria. Bacterium E. coli was chosen as our  model system. E. coli cells use their flagella to move around. To  generate a recognizable and stable pattern, bacterial motility must be  controlled and coordinated. This can be accomplished by designing genetic"

ER alpha LBD:
LBD means “Ligand Binding Domain”. This ER-alpha LBD from the human can bind estrogen and EDCs. The whole ER-alpha is a huge protein, which means it may be difficult to express by E. coli. From the previous research (Akiko Koide et al, 2001), the LBD can bind to estrogen normally without other parts, so we chose its LBD to conduct our experiment.
BBa_B0015:
A double terminator from iGEM. It can terminate DNA transcription.

2. Express Monobody with GBP
Monobody:
From the previous research (Akiko Koide et al, 2001), the type III domain from human fibronectin (FNfn10) can be used as monobody to probe whether ER-alpha LBD bind to the ligand(EDCs).

Mentoring Team Ruia-Mumbai
Team Ruia-Mumbai have been working to create a synthetic biological device to degrade catechu, by extracellular expression of genes responsible for breaking the flavan 3,4-diol bonds in polyphenols which is one of the compounds responsible for the red stains caused by the same.
They approached us regarding mentorship at the beginning of July 2018. In our first meeting we got acquainted with their project and suggested different methodologies they could follow to make their project more robust for example, we discussed in detail about secretion tag to facilitate extracellular secretion of their protein of interest and suggested corresponding literature. After that, we organized regular video conference meetings between July and October to discuss the progress of their project and other aspects of iGEM competition such as Interlab and Human Practices. We discussed technical doubts they faced in Interlab and also shared data to validate the results.
Our team also helped Team Ruia-Mumbai with experimentation protocols like we shared our protocol for preparing competent cells. We suggested changes to their protocols to optimize experimentation for cloning of their construct. We also thoroughly discussed modeling kinetics of their enzyme but weren’t able to continue it due to time constraints.
Discussions with IISER-Bhopal
We have been in constant touch with Team IISER-Bhopal starting from the month of May. We discussed each other’s project and helped sort out technical problems related to it.
IISER Bhopal suggested an initiative to increase the outreach of each other’s projects. In this initiative both the teams exchanged slides mentioning brief overview about their project and introduced each other’s idea in public engagement events like Lecture Series conducted by IIT Kanpur and iGEM Day (25th August 2018) organized by IISER Bhopal.
Both teams shared each others’ Interlab data and interpretations to get a deeper understanding of the acquired data from experiments.
We also helped Team IISER-Bhopal with their US VISA procedures which eased their application process.      Along the way, we also cleared their other technical doubts and"

The overriding principle is that all infectious materials should be decontaminated, autoclaved or incinerated within the laboratory.</p> <p>The principal questions to be asked before discharge of any objects or materials from laboratories that deal with potentially infectious microorganisms or animal tissues are:
1. Have the objects or materials been effectively decontaminated or disinfected by an approved procedure?
2. If not, have they been packaged in an approved manner for immediate on-site incineration or transfer to another facility with incineration capacity?
3. Does the disposal of the decontaminated objects or materials involve any additional potential hazards, biological or otherwise, to those who carry out the immediate disposal procedures or who might come into contact with discarded items outside the facility?

The risk analysis for Foundational Technologies, depend on its applications, that can impact positively or negatively. We saw that these technologies show potential to solve these conceivable risks. In a nearer moment, the most important and certain about these Foundational Technologies is the acceleration of continuous and constructive experimental research. A scientist using technologies that optimize the phase of experimental processing will have an increase in productivity, reducing experimental time and improving the efficiency of research.
The answer to the future when it comes to biosafety does not reside in limiting scientific development and knowledge dissemination through free-to-use access, that way we would be stopping abruptly science’s progress and hindering the discovery of novel treatments and cures in the biomedical field and the improvement of techniques in bioengineering. The answer consists in our agility in detecting, understanding and responding to biological risks, natural or artificial.
It is necessary to put society and scientific community closer since they are intimately related and influence each other. Just as society drives the direction science goes, science also influences society’s lifestyle, in the way we eat, what we think and so on. Jennifer Doduna said in an interview about CRISPR for The Guardian: “History and evidence points to the fact that when we inspire and support our scientific community we advance our way of life and thrive.” Therefore, it is important to keep encouraging society as a whole to support a global community for Synbio and be aware of its importance, so together we can move further to advance bioengineering.
CRISPR made possible the insertion of the Amazon in a scenario of scientific-technological advances. Scientific development in the Amazon is difficult for a number of reasons, including logistics, because it is a region with few possibilities for access and investment, which for science is somewhat limited. There are many research challenges with state-of-the-art technologies in the Brazilian Amazon, because the majority of them has a high cost. In the midst of so many challenges and difficulties, we have been able to carry out state-of-the-art and highly effective research. CRISPR has made this possible, especially for its practicality and low investment cost. This achievement represents scientific-technological advances for the Amazon region, where it is possible to form a network of national collaborators and even international laboratories, drawing attention to this region, which may imply greater investments, more young people in science and development of more complex projects to contribute to a global scientific and social community.
Building Synbio legacy in our community
One of the greatest achievements of Synbio is to be broadly present in diverse backgrounds: from high tech institutes to local communities all around the world."

Mr. Teng (52-year-old)      Pancreatic cancer sufferer
It was in May or Apr., 2016, Mr. Teng went for examination due to abdominal pain. At first, he thought it might be a gastrointestinal disease, but later results showed that it was actually pancreatic cancer. He had side effects like skin rash and hair loss, but his mental state is pretty good.
Mr. Teng has been applying chemotherapy since August this year. His treating cycle was 15 days of infusion followed by 8 days of withdraw, and his treatment costs 15k RMB (around 2200$) each time.
Mr. Teng did not take new treatments such as molecular targeted drugs into account because he thought it may not be practicable, and he emphasized the use of chemotherapy to get his situation under control. However, the patient did have a good understanding of new therapy, and he showed us some of the new cancer treatment that he knew before. For example, he mentioned a ‘cancer cell hunger therapy’ discovered in Zhejiang University, and also interference therapy from Japan. Mr. Teng has fundamental information related new therapy, but his understanding of cancer and therapies still left deviation.
Mr. Zheng (72-year-old)  colon cancer sufferer -> liver metastasis sufferer
In Nov. 2014, Mr. Zheng suffered from blood in his stool, and stool was too soft to form normal shapes. Then he went to hospital for colonoscopy. The results showed that there were distinctly 9 polyps in his gut, two of which have red tips. The doctor suggest two treatment options, one of which is to remove these polyps from anus, and the other option is to apply minimally invasive surgery for the removal of polyps. At the same time, metastatic cancer cells were also detected in his liver, forming two lesions of different size.
Now he mainly takes treatment combining chemotherapy and interventional therapy. Chemotherapy has been practiced for more than a year and most commonly, twice in each month. To be more exacted, he goes for 3 days of chemotherapy every 12 days. Previously he used Irinotecan, but recently it started to develop resistance, so he replaced it by Oxaliplatin. In addition, Mr. Teng has been applying interventional treatment for about once a month, but it’s not fixed, depending on his specific circumstances. The drugs enter mainly from the artery to surround the tumor, and block the blood vessel supplying nutrients for cancer cells, commonly known as ""starve cancer cells"

1 Safety
1.1 Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
1.2 Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
1.3 Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.
Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of E. coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being fact"

Bistability in B.subtilis
The Sin (Sporulation Inhibition) operon
The Sin (Sporulation Inhibition) operon can be used as a stochastic switch. It is a natural bistable switch.
File:SinOperon.jpg
During normal conditions, SinR is expressed constitutively by P3 and keeps its concentration at a constant level repressing promoter 1. When transcription of promoter1 is activated by phosphorylated Spo0A, both sinI and sinR are expressed from promoter 1. SinI inactivates SinR by forming a complex with sinR upregulating both proteins from promoter1. This cross repression, inhibition of SinR by SinI and  the transcriptional represion of sinI by SinR, forms the basis of the bistability. While the positive feedback in the production of SinI enhances the bistability, it also causes increase in sinR levels because of the expression from promoter 1 hence causing oscillations.[1]
The Sin operon controls the early stages of sporulation and has a key role to control the sporulation without disturbing its regulation. The threshold of this switch to progress into sporulation can be controlled by varying some parameters, hence providing population heterogeneity.  Tight binding of SinR to the first promoter region  with fewer sinR molecules increases this heterogeneity. By mutating the first promoter, the binding affinity of sinR the promoter can be increased.   With variations on SinI:SinR interaction strength,  transcription rate of sinR from the third promoter and the expression rate of SinR, dynamics of the system can be altered.[1]"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.
